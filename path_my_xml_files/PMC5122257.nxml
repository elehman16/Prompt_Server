Group A received PVP without using preoperative CT measurements and puncture simulation. In Group A, the needle insertion point generally chosen to be 2&#x02013;3 cm lateral to the middle line of the spinous process, and the final insertion site and puncture angle were decided based on a lateral fluoroscopy. Procedures were performed under C-arm fluoroscopy in both group. With the patients in a prone position, the vertebral body was visualized fluoroscopically as having a superior and inferior endplate, and the spinous process was midline in a true anteroposterior projection. The lateral margins are also visualized as somewhat concave margins. Medial to the lateral margins of the vertebral body are the ovoid pediculus. The vertebral arch pedicle was displayed clearly. On the anterioposterior fluoroscopic view of the C-arm, the skin insertion site was marked according to the measurement above. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia using lignocaine (2%). According to the angle of the puncture, the needle traversed within the line of the ovoid pediculus of the vertebral body. It was crucial that the needle reach exactly to the tip with the junction of the anterior and middle third of the vertebra for unilateral PVP. The bone-cement was injected with continuous fluoroscopic monitoring. The cement injection should be stopped if the cement reached nearly the posterior margin of the vertebral body.</p><p>The symbol of the success of the procedure is that the puncture reaches the anterior and middle third of the vertebra and bone cement can diffuse across the mid line for unilateral PVP.</p><p>The success rate of puncture and the mean time of the operation were calculated.

The choice of the unilateral or bilateral approach is usually decided at the time of puncture on the basis of the judgment of the practitioners. It rarely reported that how to determine the feasibility of the unilateral or bilateral approach and how to decide the puncture angle, the skin insertion site before the procedure. In this study, a method of preoperative CT image measurement was used to determine the unilateral or bilateral approach before PVP procedure. Only those vertebral body that meet the above two conditions (the needle traversing throughly the pedicle and reaching the target site) can be implemented by unilateral pedicular approach. Preoperative CT puncture simulation is necessary for screening indications of unilateral pedicular approach PVP. In Group A, the needle insertion point generally chosen to be 2&#x02013;3 cm lateral to the middle line of the spinous process, and the final insertion site was decided based on a lateral fluoroscopy. The success rate of unilateral pedicular PVP was lower than Group B. In Group B, the unilateral PVP was performed in 58 fractured vertebral bodies during simulation puncture. In actual operation, unilateral PVP was successfully performed and with a successful operative rate of 100% on above 58 fractured vertebral bodies. We found that this method could increase the success rate of unilateral pedicular PVP. In this study, no serious complications related to the procedure were found, indicating that the method can be applied to severe osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures patients.</p><p>With unilateral PVP, the target site for puncture is the anterior and middle third of the vertebra as in the previous study. For the procedure, the suitable puncture angle and skin insertion site is very important. However, the puncture angle skin and the insertion site are not uniform on PVP using the unilateral pedicular approach.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Zindrick <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> indicated that there was difference in the vertebral body shape for different vertebral body or different people. The surrounding anatomical structure is so complicated that the puncture can fail easily, and the failure may cause a serious consequence, such as retroperitoneal organ, lumbar artery, nerve, and spinal cord injuries. The success rate of unilateral PVP will be improved if a larger puncture angle involved. However, the vertebral pedicle as well as lumbar artery, nerve, and spinal cord are easily exposed to high risks of injuries. Therefore, the completion of unilateral PVP requires the accurate placement of the needle. In this study, a method of preoperative CT image measurement was used to direct access for PVP. We consider that targeting the tip of a needle in the vertebra is in the anterior and mid third of the vertebral body for unilateral PVP. In general, bone-cement can diffuse cross the mid line if the puncture reaches the target. Therefore, based on this theory, we developed a simple puncture simulation method. We measured the puncture angle and skin entry point by radiation PACS/RIS apparatus of CT. In our series, we found that the puncture angle and skin entry point were different for the different vertebral segment, and the success rate of unilateral PVP is closely associated with the vertebral segment.</p><p>However, for PVP, the unilateral pedicular approach is not suitable for all vertebral bodies. In this study, five patients were excluded from unilateral pedicular approach before procedure due to the smaller width of the vertebral pedicle. With the preoperative CT puncture simulation, we found that it was dangerous to carry out unilateral PVP for narrow pedicle. Otherwise, this approach may increase the risk of crossing into the spinal canal, paraspinous hematoma, and hemorrhage from needle injury.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Then based on the preoperative CT puncture simulation, the procedure was completed successfully by the bilateral pedicular approach in the five patients. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully analyze the CT image before determining the optimal approach for each vertebral segment.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Literature indicated that the majority of the fractures in followup occurred at the adjacent vertebrae and within the first 3 months after procedure.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> During the followup, no people suffered from a new adjacent vertebral fracture. This is further indicated that unilateral approach PVP is safe. It is important to obtain a fairly uniform distribution of bone-cement inside the fracture vertebral body. In the unilateral PVP, the location of cement is important mechanically although unilateral filling can control clinical pain. Once patients in whom the polymethylmethacrylate is unilateral filling or not entering into the fracture zone, a similar PVP procedure were done on the other side of the fractured vertebra.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>The puncture angle and skin entry point were different between different patients and vertebral body. These differences should be considered during PVP procedure. Preoperative CT puncture simulation is a method for screening unilateral PVP. It also could increase the accuracy and decrease the complication rate of the unilateral PVP. However, not all vertebral bodies are suitable for the unilateral pedicular approach.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Galibert</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Deramond</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosat</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Le Gars</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preliminary note on the treatment of vertebral angioma by percutaneous acrylic vertebroplasty</article-title><source>Neurochirurgie</source><year>1987</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>166</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3600949</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Dion</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Schweickert</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaufmann</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kallmes</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unilateral transpedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty: Initial experience</article-title><source>Radiology</source><year>2002</year><volume>222</volume><fpage>737</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11867793</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomersall</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lloyd Jones</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rawdin</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hern&#x000e1;ndez</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dias</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: A systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis</article-title><source>Health Technol Assess</source><year>2014</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>290</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>XZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is there really no benefit of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
