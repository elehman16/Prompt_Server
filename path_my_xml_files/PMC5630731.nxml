HZ and PHN risk increase with age. Efficacy against HZ induced by a live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL; Merck) declines following vaccination (21% in years 5&#x02013;12 post-vaccination). To ensure protection, revaccination can be considered. Therefore, we assessed immunogenicity and safety of HZ/su, a non-live candidate vaccine containing VZV glycoprotein E (gE) subunit and AS01<sub>B</sub> adjuvant system (GSK), in adults previously vaccinated with ZVL &#x02265;5 years before, (HZ-PreVac) compared with adults not vaccinated with ZVL (HZ-NonVac).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase III, group-matched, open, multicenter study (NCT02581410), 2 parallel groups of adults &#x02265;65 years of age (YOA) received 2 HZ/su doses 2 months apart. A co-primary objective was to compare humoral immune responses 1 month post-dose 2 (M3) in the 2 groups (non-inferiority criterion: upper limit [UL] of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for HZ-NonVac/HZ-PreVac adjusted anti-gE antibody geometric mean concentration [GMC] ratio &#x0003c;1.5). Humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated at various time points. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded for 7 and 30 days post each dose, respectively. Serious AEs (SAEs), HZ cases and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) will be recorded until study end. Here, we present data up to M3, as the study is still ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>430 participants were vaccinated. M3 humoral immune responses in HZ-PreVac were non-inferior to those in HZ-NonVac and the co-primary objective was met as the UL of the 95% CI of the adjusted GMC ratio was 1.17 (Table 1). In addition, there were no apparent differences in CD4[2+] T-cell frequencies between groups (Figure 1). No clinically meaningful differences between frequencies of solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs or SAEs in the 2 groups were observed (Table 2). No SAEs considered vaccine-related by investigators, no suspected HZ cases and no pIMDs were reported up to M3.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>HZ/su vaccination in adults &#x02265;65 YOA who previously received ZVL stimulates strong immune responses and does not raise safety concerns.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Funding</title><p>GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0450"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0451"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0452"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
