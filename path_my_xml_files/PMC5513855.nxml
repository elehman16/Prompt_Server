This drug is used to treat osteoporosis, Paget&#x02019;s disease, and other bone-related diseases.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The bioavailability of alendronate after oral administration is &#x0003c;1%, which decreases in the presence of food or divalent ions, such as calcium, but increases with increasing gastric pH. Alendronate is rapidly distributed from plasma because &#x0003e;95% of the drug is cleared within 6 h after intravenous infusion. Alendronate is not metabolized, but it appears to be excreted renally through filtration and via an active channel that differs from the classical acid and base channels. Despite the rapid plasma clearance of alendronate, clinical studies estimated an elimination half-life of 10 years, suggesting that the drug exhibits prolonged sequestration in bone.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Wante Pharmaceutical (Hainan) Co., Ltd. (Haiko, China) has developed a new generic product of alendronate sodium. An unpublished pilot bioequivalence study indicated that alendronate exhibits extremely high within-subject variability in terms of the area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), with a within-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of up to 50%. Therefore, alendronate can be considered a highly variable drug. Highly variable drugs are defined as drugs in which the within-subject CV in one or more measures of bioequivalence (eg, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> or AUC) is &#x02265;30%.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In a survey of generic products reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2005 for marketing approval, approximately 20% of generic drugs are highly variable.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A survey of the Canadian Contract Research Organization database showed that 18% of 580 studies fell into the highly variable category, where the failure rate was 54%.<xref rid="b11-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, determining the bioequivalence of highly variable generic drugs remains challenging for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities. In recent decades, several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. These methods include multiple-dose studies, replicate study designs, individual bioequivalence studies, direct expansion of bioequivalence limits to other prefixed values, and scaled bioequivalence studies.<xref rid="b11-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Scientists and regulatory authorities introduced reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) method, which involves widening of bioequivalence limits based on reference variability.<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In 2010, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued substantially revised guidelines on bioequivalence;<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> the guidelines include RSABE method for determining the bioequivalence of highly variable drugs. Similarly, the FDA published a draft guidance, which includes RSABE method, in 2011.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The methods recommended by the EMA and FDA are all based on scaled average bioequivalence or a closely related variant. A partial replicated (three-way crossover: TRR, RTR, or RRT [T is the test product, and R is the reference product]) or fully replicated (four-way crossover: TRTR or RTRT) study should be performed to estimate the within-subject CV for the reference product (<italic>CV</italic><sub>WR</sub>) and confirm that the drug is highly variable for a given parameter. According to these guidelines, we performed a randomized-sequence, single-dose, open-label, reference-replicated, three-period, crossover study in healthy male Chinese volunteers under fasting conditions. The RSABE methods recommended by the FDA and EMA were used to assess the bioequivalence of the generic product to the reference product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study drugs</title><p>We used generic alendronate sodium tablets (equivalent to 70 mg alendronic acid; batch number: 20130504; expiry date: May 2015) manufactured by Wante Pharmaceutical (Hainan) Co., Ltd. as the test product and Fosamax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (equivalent to 70 mg alendronic acid; batch number: 130200; expiry date: February 2015) manufactured by Hangzhou MSD Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The health of the participants was assessed in terms of medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiography, and routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C antibodies, and hepatitis B surface antigen). Volunteers were not enrolled if they had taken any investigational drugs within 4 weeks or any prescription or nonprescription drugs within 2 weeks before the first dose of the study drug. Other exclusion criteria included known or suspected allergies to the study drugs or related compounds, a positive result in any drug screening, current smoking, significant blood loss (200 mL) within 2 months before the first dose of the study drugs, or consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 7 days before the first dose of the study drugs. All volunteers provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.</p><p>Based on the results of a previous pilot study and considering the within-subject CV of approximately 50% for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and the predicted geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 0.95&#x02013;1.05, the enrollment of 31 patients would provide power of &#x02265;90% to show bioequivalence.

A follow-up visit was scheduled up to 7 days after the third dose of the study drugs. The study was conducted at the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region and the protocol was approved by the hospital&#x02019;s independent ethics committee.</p><p>In each dosing period, after an overnight fast of &#x02265;10 h, each volunteer received the test product or the reference product according to the randomization scheme. Both products were administered as a single oral dose of one tablet containing 70 mg of alendronate sodium with 200 mL of water in the morning. The volunteers continued to fast for &#x02265;4 h post dose, and water was forbidden for &#x0003e;2 h post dose. Standard meals, of similar compositions in each study period, were provided to the volunteers at 4 and 10 h after drug administration. Beverages, alcohol, extreme physical activity, and smoking were not allowed between enrollment and the final follow-up visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>All volunteers who participated in the study were included in the safety analysis. Safety was evaluated in terms of physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature), 12-lead electrocardiography, laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), and adverse events (AEs). Vital signs were assessed before administration and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h post dose. Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis were conducted in the screening period and at a follow-up visit scheduled up to 7 days after the third dose. AEs were recorded throughout the study period and at the follow-up visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>In each study period, blood samples (4 mL) were collected from a forearm vein and were placed in heparinized tubes. Samples were obtained before administration and at 10, 20, 30, and 45 min and 1.0, 1.33, 1.67, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 8 h after administration. The samples were centrifuged at 1,500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min.

The procedure was based on derivatization with trimethylsilyldiazomethane during solid-phase extraction on a weak anion-exchange solid-phase cartridge, which integrated sample purification and derivatization into one step. The alendronic acid derivative was eluted with methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Capcell PAK-C<sub>18</sub> column for a total run time of 7.0 min. A Qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for mass analysis and detection. Quantification was performed by multiple reaction monitoring of the transitions <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 348.2&#x02192;289.0 for the alendronic acid derivative and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 354.2&#x02192;295.0 for the d6-alendronic acid (internal standard) derivative.</p><p>The calibration curve for alendronic acid was linear within the range of 0.200&#x02013;30.0 ng/mL with a low limit quantification of 0.200 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision values were &#x0003c;7.3% and 8.9%, respectively, and the accuracy ranged from 97.8% to 106.7% of the nominal value.</p><p>In method validation, dilution test was performed to assess the reliability of the method at concentration levels outside the calibration range. Based on the results, a fivefold dilution of human plasma samples containing alendronic acid above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was considered acceptable. In an analysis of unknown samples with concentrations higher than ULOQ, they were reassayed after appropriate dilution.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic analyses</title><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods.

In a classical, typical bioequivalence study, 122 subjects were enrolled because of the high within-subject CV for urine parameters, 37.42% for A<sub>e 0&#x02013;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic>, and 40.05% for R<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Rhim et al<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> were the first to assess the bioequivalence of alendronate by determining its plasma concentrations in a two-period crossover study involving 23 Korean subjects; the results demonstrated bioequivalence even though the study power was &#x0003c;60%. Wright et al<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> performed a classic bioequivalence study of the combination of alendronate and vitamin D3 tablet in 68 healthy Taiwanese volunteers. The combination tablet was bioequivalent to the coadministration of separate tablets based on the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> for alendronate but not on <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. The <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> exceeded the bioequivalent limit of 80%&#x02013;125%, because the high variability of alendronate was not considered in sample size calculation; therefore, the sample size was not sufficiently large to confirm bioequivalence. We conducted a pilot study that provided valuable information, including differences in pharmacokinetics between the test and reference products, and within-subject CV for AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>; these data were used to estimate the sample size in our follow-up study. Assuming a difference of 5%, we estimated that &#x02265;98 subjects would be necessary for 80% power to ensure that the 90% CI of the ratios are within the bioequivalence limit of 80%&#x02013;125% by using the classical two-way crossover design. However, by using a partial replicated design (ie, a three-way crossover study) and RSABE method of the FDA, a sample size of 31 subjects would achieve 90% power. The current study demonstrates that the new method not only reduces the sample size required but also increases the study power. Considering the increasing cost of bioequivalence studies, the new method, which uses fewer subjects, is an economic choice for the sponsor.</p><p>The methods proposed by both the FDA and EMA involved mixed scaling, that is, the reference-scaled procedure should be used for bioequivalence measures with <italic>s</italic><sub>WR</sub> &#x02265;0.294 (or <italic>CV</italic><sub>WR</sub> &#x0003e;30%), and the TOST procedure must be used for pharmacokinetic parameters with <italic>s</italic><sub>WR</sub> &#x0003c;0.294 (or <italic>CV</italic><sub>WR</sub> &#x02264;30%). In the current study, we preferred the FDA method to assess the bioequivalence between the two formulations. We also used the EMA method to compare the two methods. The differences between the FDA and EMA methods were reported in previous papers.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> For highly variable drugs, the FDA method is more lenient than the EMA method and requires fewer subjects. The FDA method permits the scaling of both <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC and does not restrict the scaling limits, but the test/reference GMRs must be within the range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25. By contrast, the EMA method only permits reference scaling for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and imposes an extreme limit of <italic>CV</italic><sub>WR</sub>, in which the scaled limits should be applied. For <italic>CV</italic><sub>WR</sub> values &#x0003e;50%, the extreme values of 143.19% and 69.84% are imposed on the upper and lower limits, respectively. Another major discrepancy is the different scaling factors. The scaling factor <italic>k</italic> approximately equals 0.893 in the FDA method but equals 0.760 in the EMA method.<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Moreover, we found that the <italic>s</italic><sub>WR</sub> values differed between the FDA and EMA methods. For example, the <italic>s</italic><sub>WR</sub> value for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was 0.571 with the FDA method compared with 0.607 with the EMA method. This variation is due to the differences in the calculations used in both methods. The EMA questions and answers&#x02019; document contains a section &#x0201c;Clarification on the recommended statistical method for the analysis of a bioequivalence study,&#x0201d; which describes the statistical models for analyzing data from replicated bioequivalence trials and the differences between the EMA and the FDA methods.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-2109" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Thus, although the FDA and EMA methods are based on similar principles, they yield slightly different results in bioequivalence studies. Considering these differences, researchers should carefully select appropriate scaling methods when designing the protocol prior to conducting the study. In addition, the guidelines of the relevant application region or the recommendations of the appropriate regulatory authority should be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study demonstrated the bioequivalence of generic alendronate sodium tablets to the reference product Fosamax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> by using RSABE method proposed by the FDA and EMA in a partial replicated crossover study.
