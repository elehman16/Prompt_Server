However, spinal anesthesia has been associated with an incidence of maternal hypotension of 60-94%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hypotension impairs uteroplacental circulation and frequently results in nausea, vomiting and organ-system disorders particularly in the presence of coexisting diseases.</p><p>Arzola and Wieczorek, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, demonstrated that low-dose bupivacaine (&#x02264;8 mg) in combination with fentanyl (&#x02264;25 &#x003bc;g) significantly reduces incidence of hypotension and bradycardia during spinal anesthesia for CS, but compromises surgical analgesia and increases the need for intra-operative supplemental analgesia.-[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Intrathecal midazolam enhances the anesthetic effect of bupivacaine without affecting the hemodynamics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although ketamine stabilizes hemodynamics it has a limited analgesic effect and is associated with a higher incidence of dissociative manifestations.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Midazolam combined with low-dose ketamine as a neuraxial adjuvant to bupivacaine has been shown to reduce hemodynamic fluctuations and prolong postoperative analgesia in orthopedic surgery without significant adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was performed to evaluate the effect of low-dose ketamine combined with midazolam compared with fentanyl as adjuvants to intrathecal low-dose bupivacaine for CS on hemodynamics and postoperative analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, this prospective double-blinded study was conducted from May 2012 to February 2013. Fifty parturients aged between 20 and 40 years undergoing elective lower segment transverse incision CS of singleton pregnancy at &#x0003e;36 gestational weeks by a single surgeon were consecutively enrolled. Patients were excluded from the study if they had height &#x0003c;150 cm or &#x0003e;180 cm, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension), antepartum hemorrhage, evidence of acute fetal distress, thyrotoxicosis, valvular heart disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other organ-system disease, neuromuscular or psychological disorders, allergy to the study medications, or contraindication to spinal anesthesia. Randomization was done using a computer generated random number table into two equal groups (ketamine-midazolam-bupivacaine [KMB] and FB). Allocation to groups was concealed using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</p><p>Oral ranitidine 50 mg was administered with a sip of water 2 h before surgery. An anesthetist not involved with intra-operative care or measurements prepared the study medications according to the randomization protocol. Patients in group KMB received 10 mg (0.2 mL) ketamine (Ketam, EIPICO, Egypt, 50 mg/mL), 2 mg (0.4 mL) midazolam (Dormicum, Roche, Switzerland, 5 mg/mL) and 8 mg (1.6 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine (Marcaine, Astra Zeneca, France, 0.5%); those in group FB received 25 &#x003bc;g (0.5 mL) fentanyl (Fentanyl, Hameln pharmaceutical, Germany, 50 ug/mL) and 8 mg (1.6 mL) hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%. The medications were diluted in saline to a total volume of 3 mL and stored in identical syringes that were placed on a sterile spinal anesthesia tray and covered with a sterile drape to prevent contamination.</p><p>Monitoring included heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and electrocardiography. Patients were preloaded with Ringer's lactate 500 ml and lumbar puncture was performed in the sitting position at L4-L5 or L3-L4 intervertebral space with a 25-G spinal needle under the strict aseptic precaution. The medications were injected over 10 s with no barbotage and the needle orifice cephalad. After intrathecal injection, patients were immediately placed supine with left uterine displacement and received 100% O<sub>2</sub> (4 L/min) with face mask. After the delivery of the fetus, they oxytocin 20 IU was added to the intravenous (IV) fluids. The surgeon exteriorized the uterus in all patients. Intra-operative pain or discomfort after delivery was managed with 1 ug/kg fentanyl IV. If the patient complained of pain before delivery or fentanyl failed to relieve pain after delivery, general anesthesia was administered, and the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded before lumbar puncture, every 5 min during the first 30 min, then 45 min, 60 min, 2 h and 4 h after intrathecal injection. Sensory block was tested every 2 min with pinprick test in the mid-clavicular line, bilaterally, until it stabilized for three consecutive tests; then every 15 min till block regression to S1. Motor block was tested by the modified Bromage scale (0: No motor loss, 1: Inability to flex hip joint, 2: Inability to flex knee joint, 3: Inability to flex ankle) every 2 min till score 3 was attained; then every 15 min till resolution of the block. Motor block assessment was withheld during surgery. Peak sensory level, onset of sensory block (time from intrathecal injection to peak sensory level), duration of sensory block (time taken for regression of the sensory block from the peak sensory level to S1), onset of motor block (time from intrathecal injection to modified Bromage score 3), duration of motor block (time taken for regression of the motor block from score 3 to 0), and pain free period (time from intrathecal injection to first request of analgesia) were recorded. Apgar score at 1 and 5 min, and perioperative side effects including hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, sedation, pruritus, respiratory depression and dissociative manifestations as dizziness, delirium, or nystagmus were recorded. Hypotension was defined as MAP &#x0003c;20% of baseline values or systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;100 mmHg and was managed with increasing the rate of IV fluids and administration of ephedrine 3 mg IV, repeated as necessary. bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c;60/min and was treated with atropine sulfate 0.6 mg IV. Vomiting was treated with ondansetron 4 mg IV. Sedation was assessed every 15 min intra-operatively, then every 1 h during the first postoperatively for 12 h using a four-point scale (1: Awake, 2: Drowsy but responsive to verbal stimulus, 3: Drowsy but responsive to physical stimulus, 4: Unresponsive to verbal and physical stimulus). Respiratory depression was defined as a respiratory rate &#x02264;10/min.</p><p>Patients' satisfaction with anesthesia was evaluated on arrival to the postanesthetic care unit using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with &#x0201c;dissatisfied&#x0201d; at 0 cm and &#x0201c;very satisfied&#x0201d; at 10 cm.

The combination provided adequate surgical analgesia without significant adverse effects or any effetcs on neonate.</p><p>Various investigators,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that intrathecal ketamine (0.1 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) with bupivacaine (15 mg) stabilizes hemodynamics and prolongs postoperative analgesia without adverse effects. Use of ketamine as an adjuvant to the local anesthetic during spinal anesthesia for CS has been shown to reduce hemodynamic fluctuations and to have a local anesthetic sparing effect.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Ketamine may diffuse into the venous system of the spinal cord and result in cardiovascular stimulation that antagonize spinal anesthesia induced vasodilatation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the contrary, Unlugenc <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that intrathecal low-dose S(+) ketamine (0.05 mg/kg) with bupivacaine (10 mg) for CS did not affect hemodynamics, though it enhanced segmental spread and shortened the onset of anesthesia. Togal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] observed that ketamine (0.1 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (7.5 mg) had no effect on arterial blood pressure and sensorimotor blockade characteristics in elderly patients.</p><p>Spinal midazolam has been studied extensively; it enhances sensorimotor blockade and lengthens analgesia without affecting the hemodynamics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Previous studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] agree that 1-2 mg intrathecal midazolam is safe and efficacious. Prakash <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed no differences in arterial blood pressure and HR between patients who received bupivacaine and those who received either 1 mg or 2 mg midazolam with bupivacaine. The duration of postoperative analgesia determined by request for rescue medication was 6.1 &#x000b1; 1 h in patients administered midazolam 2 mg. On the other hand intrathecal ketamine has been shown to be associated with short lived postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although it is difficult to differentiate between the analgesic effects of ketamine and midazolam in the present study, intrathecal co-administration of both drugs probably acted in synergy that increased clinical benefits.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Ketamine has a local anesthetic activity and an analgesic effect mediated through noncompetitive inhibition of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors and binding to opiate receptors in the spinal cord,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] while the analgesic effect of midazolam is thought to be mediated through binding to specific benzodiazepine receptors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Decreasing the dose of intrathecal local anesthetics may reduce hemodynamic fluctuation, but may increase the frequency of visceral pain. Visceral pain commonly seen with exteriorization of uterus, is often associated with autonomic activity causing nausea, vomiting, sweating with changes in blood pressure and HR.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Addition of fentanyl to low-dose bupivacaine can improve the quality of analgesia, only in doses of 40 &#x003bc;g or greater during CS. However, pruritus has been shown to increase by 50% with fentanyl &#x0003e;35 &#x003bc;g. This is distressing for many patients and is a limiting factor for increasing the dose of intrathecal fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study, no patients complained of intra-operative pain in the KMB group compared to 6 (24%) patients in the fentanyl-bupivacaine group; also, the incidence of vomiting was significantly lower with the former, probably due to adequate analgesia and less hemodynamic fluctuations. This may explain the higher patients' satisfaction scores.</p><p>The limitations of the present study include the ketamine-related dissociative adverse effects such as salivation, dizziness, delirium, and sedation,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in addition to a concern about the neurotoxicity of intrathecal ketamine[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and midazolam[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
