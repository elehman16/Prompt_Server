At least 12&#x000a0;% of 12&#x02013;16 year old children are exposed to IPV in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United States, 16&#x000a0;% of all children witness IPV at some time during their childhood (2&#x02013;17 years of age) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a meta-analysis Evans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] found a strong association between exposure to IPV and trauma symptoms in children, in addition to small to medium associations between exposure to IPV and internalizing and externalizing problems. These findings emphasize the need for effective interventions for children exposed to IPV. Because IPV involves the whole family system, it affects children&#x02019;s lives directly and indirectly. Witnessing IPV or being physically involved in IPV may directly affect children&#x02019;s affective, behavioral and cognitive responses, their psychosocial adjustment and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. IPV may also affect children indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It may lead to deteriorated parenting and parent-child relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which may mediate the link between IPV and children&#x02019;s maladjustment on various dimensions. Therefore, treatment for children who have been exposed to IPV should target both direct and indirect effects of IPV.</p><p>Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is a well-established treatment for traumatized children. Although TF-CBT has been found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms among traumatized children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], we know little about its effective components and the role of parental involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, the literature suggests that TF-CBT may be less effective for children traumatized by exposure to IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One explanation may be that the standard components of TF-CBT have been developed for parents to learn how they can help the child to process traumatic experiences. These components may fail to address the pervasive impact of IPV on parents&#x02019; psychological functioning, their parental behavior, and the parent-child relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The present study aims to test the relative efficacy of two components added to TF-CBT focussing on parent-related aspects of IPV, namely parenting and parent-child interactions, and thereby provides crucial insight in the mechanisms and mediating effects of treatment on children exposed to IPV. The group-based treatment developed by Visser, Leeuwenburgh and Lamers-Winkelman in the Netherlands is called HORIZON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to a regular TF-CBT-based treatment, the HORIZON includes two specific components focusing on parents who have let their children to become exposed to IPV. The HORIZON thus consists of three parts, two specific parental components for IPV families and TF-CBT-based child and parent components.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Direct effects of IPV on children</title><p>Being exposed to IPV affects children on a variety of dimensions. Children&#x02019;s responses are often differentiated in <italic>emotional</italic>, <italic>behavioral</italic>, and <italic>cognitive</italic> responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To explain these direct effects, Emotional Security Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Cognitive Context theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have proposed several mechanisms that mediate the developmental pathways towards psychosocial maladjustment and symptoms, as well as moderating factors that may exacerbate or buffer against the effects of IPV on children.</p><p><italic>Emotional Security Theory</italic> is based on the assumption that children derive a sense of emotional security from their trust in the integrity of the family system. IPV undermines children&#x02019;s trust, leading them to make efforts to restore it. Although children&#x02019;s affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses and adaptations toward restoring a level of emotional security may be adaptive in the IPV context, they may be maladaptive in other contexts (e.g., school, peer contacts). This may result in emotional, social, and behavioral maladjustment and problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To illustrate, Davies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Katz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found that children exposed to IPV were less competent in modulating their emotions than children who were not exposed to IPV. This under-developed emotion competence may explain links between IPV and children&#x02019;s maladjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Children&#x02019;s immediate <italic>behavioral</italic> responses to IPV include approach and avoidance behaviors that serve to regulate exposure to the disturbing affect displayed in marital violence and its aftermath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Avoidance behavior is generally considered as a less adaptive coping strategy to respond to traumatic experiences than approach behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To illustrate, Gable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that approach motives and goals in relationships were reliably associated with less loneliness and more relationship satisfaction than avoidance motives. Although not consistently found, both approach and avoidance behaviors in the context of family conflict appear related to children&#x02019;s symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Children&#x02019;s <italic>cognitive</italic> responses to violence may shape their beliefs and expectations about aggression, about close relationships and about themselves. They might start to believe that aggressive behavior is an acceptable way of problem solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Children exposed to IPV and other forms of violence may come to value aggression more positively than other children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, Grych&#x02019;s Cognitive Context theory suggests that children may blame themselves for what happened or believe they are powerless to cope with IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, children may become more vigilant to threat-related cues in the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These beliefs and expectations may influence their behavior in peer-relationships, in family-relationships and in romantic relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Each of these cognitive responses of children can be assumed to exacerbate children&#x02019;s psychosocial maladjustment in response to IPV.</p><p>Components of TF-CBT such as emotion regulation, cognitive reprocessing, psycho-education and skill building have been shown to reduce internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and trauma symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge research has not yet explicitly addressed whether TF-CBT or TF-CBT-based interventions ameliorates children&#x02019;s symptoms by improving children&#x02019;s emotion regulation. Furthermore, TF-CBT was found to reduce trauma-related avoidance behavior in children exposed to IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whether children&#x02019;s approach behavior changes after TF-CBT or TF-CBT-based interventions is currently unknown. Also, the cognitive component of TF-CBT explores and corrects children&#x02019;s harmful attributions about the cause of, responsibility for, and results of traumatic experiences such as family violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Whether cognitive responses change after TF-CBT among children who have been exposed to IPV has not yet been examined. The present study examines how these emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses change over the course of treatment and how these changes affect treatment outcomes and children&#x02019;s psychosocial adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Indirect effects of IPV on children</title><p>Being exposed to IPV also affects children indirectly. Not only children, but parents are likely to be traumatized as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Parents experience a broad range of emotional, cognitive and behavioral consequences of IPV. These responses can be assumed to affect their parenting and the parent-child relationship. The <italic>Spillover hypothesis</italic> emphasizes that distressing experiences in the interparental relationship, such as IPV, carry over to parenting behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and to the parent-child interaction (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). We propose two mechanisms that may explain how the experience of IPV may affect parenting, a cognitive-emotional mechanism and a behavioral mechanism. In the following, we will describe these theoretical underpinnings of the two specific parental components of the HORIZON.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cognitive-emotional mechanism: parental availability</title><p>Mothers who have been part of IPV tend to underestimate the extent to which their child has been exposed to and is affected by the IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This underestimation is assumed to be partly due to the fact that mothers may focus their attention on themselves and their own traumatic experience rather than on their children&#x02019;s traumatic experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and to the fact that their children&#x02019;s behavior is a reminder of their own trauma which triggers avoidance e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Also, mothers who have experienced traumas, such as IPV or childhood abuse, showed difficulties in adopting an open, non-defensive style of communication when talking about emotions with their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, they appeared less child-centered and less available to their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, IPV has been linked to parenting styles that are characterized by emotional unavailability and psychological control e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, parents from violent families may be so absorbed by their own problems that they are less likely to take their children&#x02019;s perspective and to show insight in their children&#x02019;s developmental needs, behavior, and motives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This deteriorated insightfulness may partly explain why children traumatized by exposure to IPV benefit less from TF-CBT than children who were traumatized by experiences that did not have a traumatic impact on their parents at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>For children to feel secure and supported by their parents, parents need to be sensitive to their children&#x02019;s needs, accurately recognize their children&#x02019;s signals, and appropriately respond to these signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similarly, for children to benefit from a trauma-focused treatment, such as TF-CBT, parental involvement to support the child is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accordingly, increasing parents&#x02019; cognitive and emotional availability to the child should be a primary focus of treatment for children exposed to IPV. To this end, Visser, Leeuwenburgh, and Lamers-Winkelman developed a preparatory program for parents exposed to IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This preparatory program was aimed to increase parental availability and insightfulness in their children&#x02019;s needs. Parents are coached to enhance reading their children&#x02019;s behavioral and emotional signals and to adequately interpret these signals in light of the child&#x02019;s age, the development, and type of IPV the child has been exposed to. The preparatory program component precedes the TF-CBT-based treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Behavioral mechanism: parent-child interaction</title><p>Parents who have experienced and have been exposed to IPV tend to engage in ineffective parenting. Compared to non-exposed parents they used more negative and less positive parenting, are likely to use more harsh discipline towards their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], showed more aggression in the parent-child relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and were less supportive and less effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Buehler and Gerard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found that ineffective parenting mediated the link between marital conflict and children&#x02019;s maladjustment. In their study, ineffective parenting comprised of harsh discipline (e.g., spanking), low involvement (e.g., talking and reading with child), and reduced parental presence (i.e., time spent together). These findings suggest that IPV reduces parents&#x02019; capacity to support their child, to interact with him/her in a safe and comforting manner, and to be available to fulfill and sensitively respond to his emotional and cognitive needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>To optimally benefit from trauma-focused treatment, parental support is important for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accordingly, we propose that trauma-focused treatment for children exposed to IPV can be enhanced by improving parents&#x02019; emotional support and parent-child interaction. To this end, Visser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] developed the second specific parental component, the parent-child interaction sessions, to complement the TF-CBT-based treatment. These weekly sessions follow the child and parent TF-CBT-based treatment sessions. They aim to help parents to gain new insights in their children&#x02019;s functioning and to more accurately and positively respond to their child&#x02019;s emotions and behaviors by interacting with their child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial objectives</title><p>In the present project, we will examine the efficacy of the two parental components of the HORIZON, the preparatory program for parents and the parent-child interaction sessions. HORIZON is a TF-CBT-based group treatment for children exposed to IPV. For a complete description of the treatment in Dutch see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and for a summary see paragraph &#x02018;Intervention&#x02019;. In a randomized-controlled design, we will add the parental components to a TF-CBT-based core treatment to examine their independent and combined effects on parents&#x02019; and children&#x02019;s outcomes. Overall, we expect both parental components to add to the efficacy of the TF-CBT-based core treatment. Specifically, we expect that, as compared to parents who did not participate in the preparatory program, parents who participated in the preparatory program show a greater increase in parental availability. In the same vein, we expect that the parents who participated in the parent-child interaction sessions show a greater increase in effective and positive parenting and a greater decrease in negative parenting than parents who did not participate in these sessions. These effects of the parental components should contribute to parents&#x02019; and children&#x02019;s outcomes and reduction of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the present study is to examine the efficacy of two parental components that complement a TF-CBT-based core treatment for children who have been exposed to IPV. Specifically, the study involves a randomized controlled trial with a 2 (parent preparatory program present vs. absent) X 2 (parent-child interaction sessions present vs. absent) factorial design to evaluate the effects of these two parental treatment components on child symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>Our second goal is to evaluate the effects of these two parental treatment components on child adjustment. Our third goal is to investigate mechanisms underlying the efficacy of treatment for children who have been exposed to IPV by examining associations between: child symptoms, on the one hand, and, 1) child responses (i.e., child emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses, 2) parental availability and 3) parent-child interaction, on the other.</p><p>Our fourth goal is to examine specific hypotheses of change. Specifically, we will test whether, as predicted, the preparatory program leads to increased parental availability and whether the parent-child interaction sessions lead to improved parenting behavior. Also, we will explore whether these changes lead to a reduction in symptoms.</p><p>To ensure comparability of the randomized conditions, we will control for duration and severity of the IPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], parental psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and new incidents of IPV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study design</title><p>This multi-center study examines the addition of two parental components to a TF-CBT-based treatment for children exposed to IPV, which results in a 2 (preparatory program present versus absent) x 2 (parent-child interaction present versus absent) factorial randomized experimental component trial. The study includes pre-treatment (T1), treatment, post-treatment (T2), and a 6-month follow-up (T3) assessment, and will include 100 children and their custodial parents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the study design). The baseline assessment (T1, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) will take place one week prior to the start of the 6-week preparatory program. To ensure comparability across treatment conditions, in the &#x0201c;No preparatory program&#x0201d; condition, parents and children will be assessed 7 weeks before the beginning of the TF-CBT-based treatment. Additionally, parents and children will be assessed three times during treatment, namely at the beginning of the intervention (session 1), after sharing the trauma narrative of the child with the parent (session 9), and at the end of the intervention (session 15). These measurements allow us to test mediating pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and allow us to monitor, and if necessary control for, new IPV or other stressful incidents. The second assessment (T2) will take place one week after the last session of the TF-CBT-based treatment for all four conditions. The third assessment (T3) will be at a follow-up, six months after the last session of the treatment. Regardless of condition, all participants receive the standard TF-CBT-based treatment. The difference lies in the addition of the two parental components. Families who are assigned to &#x0201c;No preparatory program&#x0201c; or &#x0201c;No parent-child interaction&#x0201d; conditions will not receive an alternative component additionally to standard TF-CBT based treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study Design.

Typically, the intervention group consists of two child groups (4&#x02013;7 years and 8&#x02013;12 years, respectively) and one parent group. Usually there is only one parent group, because families often have more than one child who participate in the intervention, and because parents without visitation rights do not participate. The child groups receive treatment at the same time but in different rooms. The parents of children in both groups receive group sessions on the same time. Because it is not feasible for participating trauma centers to start four interventions at the same time, we cannot randomly assign individual children or parents to one of the four conditions. Therefore, we choose randomization by group just before the start of the group therapy and after T1. Parents and children are blind to treatment condition until randomization is carried out just before the (preparatory) program starts. Clinicians will be blind for treatment condition until all families are indicated for treatment. The assessments include videotaped observational tasks. Independent research assistants will code these videos. All coders are blind for treatment condition. Sometimes it will take a few months before families can participate in one of the four group interventions, due to waiting lists and enrollment numbers to form treatment groups. If necessary, parents and children will receive family or individual stabilization intervention during this time. Independent of their experiences with treatment preceding participation in the HORIZON, all participating families will be measured at T1 at the same time to ensure comparability of the families in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study population</title><p>The population of this study will consist of 100 children exposed to IPV and their custodial parent who are referred by the Dutch Youth Care Agency (Bureau Jeugdzorg) or a physician for treatment of the child after exposure to IPV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Typically, children are referred to the HORIZON treatment when they meet the following criteria established during an intake-interview with a trained therapist and standardized questionnaires: 1) the child has been exposed to IPV (or violence between a parent and a cohabitant); 2) the child is no longer exposed to IPV (or violence between a parent and a cohabitant) 3) the child is between 4 and 12 years old; 4) both custodial parents gave written informed consent consistent with the Dutch legislation; 5) the child has trauma symptoms or behavioral problems; 6) the child can control his or her (sexual) impulses; 7) the child&#x02019;s behavior is not dangerous to other children; 8) both child and custodial parent have sufficient cognitive and language capacities to follow a group treatment; 9) at least one custodial parent is able to participate in the parent-group.</p><p>If parents are unable to participate in the group therapy, for example, because they do not speak sufficient Dutch and have to receive individual treatment potentially with the help of a translator, parent and child will be excluded from the study. Children with severe psychopathology who represent a danger to other children receive individual treatment to stabilize their psychopathological problems. When stabilization is completed, children can participate in group therapy and will be included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Procedure</title><p>The inclusion of children and parents in this study is bound to legal requirements to obtain informed consent from both parents before children can be enrolled in a research study. This requirement is problematic when permission needs to be asked for treatment and research independently (e.g., mothers may refuse contact with father). Therefore, we ask both parents&#x02019; permission for treatment and participation in the study for the child at the same time. Another challenge is that in the context of domestic violence, parents typically argue about almost everything, including consent for treatment and research. Consequently, when interpreting the findings and response percentages, the requirements to obtain consent from both parents should be taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Objection by minors or incapacitated subjects</title><p>The code of conduct for minors in non-therapeutic research is applicable in this research project. The risk for participating in this project is considered negligible, but when a child seems adversely affected by the questionnaires or observational tasks it may be decided to (temporarily) discontinue participation in the project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Intervention</title><p>The HORIZON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] is a 21-session TF-CBT-based group intervention for children who have been exposed to IPV. The aim of the intervention is to help children process the traumatic experiences of having been exposed to IPV. The aim of the parent group is to guide parents to helping their traumatized children in this process. Both children and parents receive a therapy book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This book is used weekly during the therapy sessions for information about the topic, assignments, and drawings and in between sessions for homework.</p><p>For the description of the intervention we distinguish three parts. First, the <italic>Preparatory Program</italic> is developed for parents and consists of six sessions. As mentioned above, it aims to increase parental availability and insightfulness in children&#x02019;s needs. Parents are coached to accurately read the behavioral and emotional signals of their children&#x02019;s needs, and to adequately respond to these signals.</p><p>The second part of the intervention consists the TF-CBT based core program, which comprises of parallel groups for parents and children and consists of fifteen weekly sessions. Because the HORIZON is trauma-focused and based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, it includes similar components as TF-CBT that were described and studied by Cohen and Mannarino [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Specifically, it includes components such as psycho-education, relaxation, affective expression and modulation, cognitive coping and processing, trauma narrative, sharing the trauma narrative with their (non-violent) parent and parenting skills. Similar to TF-CBT these components are covered in the HORIZON by the following exercises and themes: psycho-education about therapy, violence and conflicts, and posttraumatic stress; training of emotion regulation skills; addressing incorrect attributions about conflict and violence; expressing and sharing the IPV experiences; managing anger, guilt and shame, handling nightmares; good and bad sides of mother and father; and future safety. These weekly sessions have a duration of 60 min. After each session, the therapists of both the parent and child groups will evaluate the session and share information about children&#x02019;s as well as parents&#x02019; progress.</p><p>The third part, the Parent Child Interaction Sessions (PCIS), takes place adjacent to the parallel parent and child group sessions when the parent group joins the children&#x02019;s group. During 30-min sessions, parents and children are given the opportunity to interact with each other. The aim of these sessions for the parents is to learn to show more emotional supportive behavior, more involvement (e.g., talking together), more praise, less harsh discipline, and increase parental presence (e.g., time spent together). During Parent Child Interaction Sessions, parents can train and practice this parenting behavior through exercises in the presence of a therapist. Additionally, therapists observe the parent-child interaction and intervene when necessary. Therapists also give parents feedback on their parenting behavior in Parent Child Interaction Sessions during the following session in the parallel parent group. Children will receive feedback on their interaction behavior directly during the sessions together with their parents.</p><p>During the study, all children and parents in all four conditions will receive the TF-CBT based core treatment as described in part two above. There is no waiting list or control intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Child symptoms</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Trauma symptoms</title><p><italic>Trauma Symptom Checklist for Younger Children</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

The BRIEF has a parent-report and a teacher questionnaire for 5&#x02013;18 years, and a self-report questionnaire for 11&#x02013;18 years. The BRIEF comprises eight clinical scales (inhibit, shift, emotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organize, organization of materials and monitor), two composite scores (behavior regulation and metacognition) and a general executive function summary score (Global Executive Composite). The internal consistency of the Dutch BRIEF is very high (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of the eight clinical scales ranged from 0.78 to 0.90) and the mean test-retest stability on the clinical scales was 0.81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p><p><italic>Fundamental needs:</italic> To assess the four fundamental needs proposed by Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], we use a measure, derived and translated into Dutch from Williams&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] measures.

The 20-item NOBAG scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] was developed to asses children&#x02019;s beliefs about the acceptability of specific aggressive behaviors in specific social contexts. The scale is divided in two parts. The 12-item subscale &#x02018;Retaliation beliefs&#x02019; consists of short scenarios in which one child (A) is aggressive towards another child (B). The respondent is asked if it is wrong or okay for B to react with verbal aggression toward A and, second, if it is wrong or okay for B to respond with physical aggression. The second subscale &#x02018;General beliefs&#x02019; consist of 8 items that assess general beliefs about aggression. Children can choose between four answer options: &#x02018;Don&#x02019;t agree at all&#x02019;(1), &#x02018;Don&#x02019;t agree a bit&#x02019;(2), &#x02018;Agree a bit (3), or &#x02018;Agree a lot&#x02019; (4).</p><p><italic>Attitudes about family violence</italic> (AAFV) scale assesses children&#x02019;s attitudes and beliefs about the acceptability of family violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].

The subscale &#x02018;Secure&#x02019; will be used, which assesses a secure pattern of emotional security. Children indicate the extent to which they agree with 7 statements using a four-point scale ranging from &#x02018;Complete disagree&#x02019;(1) to &#x02018;Complete agree&#x02019;(4).

To assess parental availability for the child we will use eight adapted items of the Daily Psychological Availability Scale. Items were measured using 7-point scales from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree). Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; was 0.78 for both fathers and mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].

Children answer, on a 5-point Likert scale, to which extent a reaction to a traumatic event was present during the past week. The instrument has 4 subscales: intrusion, avoidance, arousal, and other child-specific responses (e.g., feelings of guilt, regressive behavior, reckless behavior, fear of the dark, fear of going to the toilet at night, separation anxiety, sadness, crying, feeling tired, and psychosomatic complaints). A recent study found good psychometric properties for the scale, with Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of 0.92 for the total scale, and &#x003b1; ranging from 0.72 to 0.81 for the four subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The parent-reported questionnaire is intended for parents of children age 4 to 18 years. The scale consists of the same 34 items measuring intrusion, avoidance, arousal, and nonspecific symptoms during the last week. Previous research shows sufficient reliability (&#x003b1; total scale&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) and good convergent and discriminant validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. To assess concordance between parent- and child-reported trauma symptoms and parental insight in the child&#x02019;s trauma symptoms, we will instruct parents to fill out the questionnaire how they think the child will answer and will compare child and parent forms. This information is obtained at session 1, 9 and 15.</p><p><italic>During the therapy</italic>, in session 6, children will be asked to draw and talk about the most adverse incident they can remember about the IPV. This is part of the regular treatment protocol of the HORIZON for children. In addition, in session 6, we will ask the parents in the parallel group to write down what they think their child will talk about with respect to the most aversive IPV incident. The answers to this question from both parent and child will be compared. One of the aims of the preparatory program is to coach parents to differentiate between their own trauma-history and the one of the child. If this aim is achieved, we hypothesize that parents in treatment condition 1 &#x00026; 2 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) will more often provide an answer that is similar to their child&#x02019;s to the above question than the parents in treatment condition 3 &#x00026; 4 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Parent-child variables</title><p><italic>Attachment Security: The Security Scale</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] is a 15-item self-report questionnaire for children between the ages of 8 and 18 and measures attachment security with their parents. Children report on their attachment security with both parents separately. The scale consists of three dimensions: perceptions of responsiveness and availability of the parent, tendency to seek parental support in times of stress and the quality of communication with the parent. Children rate the items on a 5-point Likert-Scale ranging from &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; (1) to &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; (5) with a higher score indicating greater perceived attachment security. Several studies indicate adequate reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Kerns, Tomich, Aspelmeir and Contreras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] reported high internal consistencies for 10 and 12 year olds (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79). Test-retest reliability over a two-week period was high (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The Security Scale is related to other attachment measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. In a Dutch sample, internal consistency was &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77 for the mother version and &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85 for the father version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].</p><p><italic>Generalized Trust Beliefs: Children&#x02019;s Generalized Trust Beliefs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The original questionnaire assesses children&#x02019;s generalized trust beliefs across three bases of trust (reliability, emotionality and honesty) in four target groups (mother, father, teacher and peers). Reliability measures the belief that parents will keep their promises. Emotionality measures the belief that parents keep their secrets confidential. Honesty measures the belief that parents are truthful. For the purpose of this study, we only use the mother and father as targets, which results in a total of 12 items. Names and situations were adjusted to fit the Dutch population. Children are presented with specific situations of fictional children and instructed to imagine that they were the children in the stories. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;very unlikely&#x02019; (1) to &#x02018;very likely&#x02019; (5). Reliability and validity were acceptable in earlier research (total scale 0.76, reliability subscale: 0.67, emotionality subscale: 0.62, honesty subscale: 0.65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].

The brief child version of the GBPS has 25 items for each parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The parent version of the GBPS has 60 items and includes nine subscales: Positive parenting, monitoring, rules, discipline, inconsistent discipline, harsh punishment, ignoring, material rewarding, and autonomy.

Parents indicate, using 5-point scales, whether they &#x0201c;reacted enthusiastically to their child&#x02019;s sharing of a good event&#x0201d; (Active&#x02013;Constructive), &#x0201c;pointed out the potential problems or down sides of the good event&#x0201d; (Active&#x02013;Destructive), &#x0201c;said little, but my child knew I was happy for him/her&#x0201d; (Passive&#x02013;Constructive), and &#x0201c;seemed disinterested&#x0201d; (Passive&#x02013;Destructive).

This refers to the levels of environmental noise, crowding and disorganization in a household, in short: chaos. The questionnaire was translated into Dutch for this study, and includes 15 statements that are rated by the parents as &#x02018;not true&#x02019;, &#x02018;quite true&#x02019; or &#x02018;very true&#x02019;.

This Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale is a single-item pictorial measure for closeness to others. Parents and children describe their relationship by selecting a set of two circles. The degree of overlap between the circles stands for the degree of closeness to the other person. Parents rate on the relationship with their child and children rate on their relationship with the mother and father separately. Respondents are presented with 7 different sets of circles, ranging from a set with no overlap and a long distance between the circles and a set with almost complete overlap between the circles. The circles are held constant and only the overlap increases. Validity and reliability were adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. The Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale has not been used before to measure the parent-child relationship.

This questionnaire consists of 22 items measuring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during the last week. The Schokverwerkingslijst-22 measures three dimensions: intrusion, avoidance and hyper-arousal. Parents rate the items on a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to &#x02018;extremely&#x02019;. The measure has high internal consistency (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Further, we will use the <italic>Young Adult Self-Report</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. The Young Adult Self-Report will be used to assess psychopathology symptoms in parents. This questionnaire has the same format as the CBCL described above. The short version of 29 items will be used in this study to limit the amount of time needed to fill in the questionnaire. Previous research has shown that these items discriminated well between referred and non-referred subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>].

The Insightfulness Assessment is based on a semi-structured interview that evaluates the parents&#x02019; ability to seek explanations regarding the motives underlying their children&#x02019;s behaviors and to talk about them in an open, complex, insightful, and accepting manner. The interview is based on the parent viewing child-parent or child-examiner interaction segments which are video-taped beforehand and answering questions about the segments. The interview transcripts will be coded on 10 rating scales and classified into one of the following four categories: Positively insightful, One-sided, Disengaged and Mixed. This represents a constellation of parental thoughts, feelings, and perceptions regarding the child&#x02019;s inner experience. Each transcript is independently coded by two coders blind to any information about the study. In a previous study, inter-rater reliability ranged from 0.77 to 0.93; inter-rater reliability on the four-way Insightfulness Assessment classification system was 0.84 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p><italic>Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogues</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] (only at T1). In the AEED parents and children participate in an emotion discussion task, in which they recall and describe an event when the child felt happy, sad, mad, and scared, respectively. They are asked to jointly describe the event and to talk about what the child felt, thought, and did during the event. Construction of the stories is scored on 7 parent scales (Shift of focus, Boundary dissolution, Acceptance and tolerance, Hostility, Involvement and reciprocity, Closure of negative feelings and Structuring of the interaction) and 7 child scales (Shift of focus, Boundary dissolution, Acceptance and tolerance, Cooperation and reciprocity, Resolution of negative feelings and Elaboration of the stories). Also, the stories are scored on adequacy of the stories and coherence. Rating scales range from 1 to 9, a higher score indicates a greater presence of that particular construct. Ratings are based on the complete session. Scores result in a classification in one of four categories: emotionally matched, emotionally unmatched: excessive, emotionally unmatched: flat or emotionally unmatched: inconsistent. Each videotaped session is independently coded by two coders (research assistants). Coders are blind for experimental condition. In a previous study, inter-rater reliability ranged from 0.87 to 0.95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>].</p><p><italic>Positive filler task</italic>: To ensure all dyads end the AEED with a positive task before they continue with the Family interaction task, we will ask the child to briefly talk about his/her favorite food or hobby with his/her parent.</p><p><italic>Family interaction task</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] (only at T1). This observational instrument measures parent-child interaction and consists of four tasks in which parent and child are instructed to complete a series of interactive tasks together. The first task is a word guessing game, in which parent and child take turns in guessing what word/picture appears on the card of the other. The second task involves getting marbles into designated holes in a labyrinth. In the third task, parent and child have to plan a pretend birthday party. The final task is constructing different patterns of pieces that match given designs. Nine rating scales are used for this study: 3 parent scales (positive responsiveness, anger and hostility, quality of assistance), 3 child scales (persistence and diligence; anger, defiance and frustration; expression of positive affect) and 3 dyadic scales (collaboration and teamwork; positive affect; negative affect/conflict). Rating scales range from 1 to 5 and a higher score indicates a greater presence of that particular construct. Ratings are based on the complete session. Each videotaped session is independently coded by two coders (research assistants).

Dependent variables are child symptoms (primary outcomes) at the three time points (T1, T2, and T3) clustered into 1) Trauma symptoms, 2) Internalizing symptoms, 3) Externalizing symptoms. Analyses will be independently executed for the three dependent variables. Because children in each group receive intervention, a medium effect size is expected (f<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.15).

These analyses will allow us to determine whether the parent-child interaction variables and parental availability partly or fully mediate the effects of each parental component on child symptoms. Specifically, we will test whether, as predicted, the preparatory program leads to increased parental availability and whether the parent-child interaction sessions lead to improved parenting behavior. Also, we will explore whether these changes lead to a reduction in symptoms. Because at least partial mediation is assumed, a small to medium effect size is chosen (f<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10). Two models are tested. A first model with component 1 (preparatory parent program) and parent availability as independent variables. And a second model with component 2 (parent-child interaction sessions) and parent-child interaction as independent variables.

Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced, because there is no place for them in the therapy groups, and it is not possible for parents and children to start at a later time during treatment. Should participants withdraw from the treatment, these parents and children will be followed according to the intention to treat principle. They will be asked fill in the questionnaires and the observational tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aims to bridge the gap between clinical practice and scientific research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. It examines mechanisms underlying change in psychotherapy for children exposed to IPV, explains how components of therapy work, and identifies moderators of treatment effects. The results, which are obtained in a RCT-study in collaboration with different trauma centers, will provide unique insights to improve clinical decision-making.</p><p>First, the RCT-design provides the best possible controls for evaluating the efficacy of psychiatric treatment. Rather than using a waiting list control group, the study zooms in on two parental components and mechanisms of change not yet investigated. All children receive TF-CBT, an established treatment for traumatized children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], including psycho-education, parenting skills, relaxation, affective expression and modulation, trauma narrative, and cognitive coping and processing.</p><p>Second, the study focuses on the efficacy of two IPV-related parental components added to TF-CBT. To date, research on effective components of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder focused on trauma-oriented components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Research on effective components of TF-CBT focused on the trauma-narrative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>], on treatment lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>], and on inclusion of parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Nevertheless TF-CBT is less effective for children exposed to IPV than for children otherwise traumatized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Children exposed to IPV are not only traumatized, but IPV also directly and indirectly affects their emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses. By considering this complexity this study provides important insights into the efficacy of specific IPV-related parental components. These insights are crucial to improve the treatment and maximize its effects for this specific target group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>].</p><p>The use of multiple informants (parent, child and teacher) and independent observations and interviews are likely to diminish reporting-bias. To pinpoint underlying mechanisms and assess the longer-term consequences of the intervention multiple data collections takes place, including a follow-up at 6 months after the end of treatment. This converging evidence will allow us to establish the reliability and validity of the collected information considerably.</p><p>A specific limitation of research on child abuse in The Netherlands is that by Dutch law, both custodial parents have to give informed and written consent to participation of their child in the study. Conflict between parents may extend to conflict about the participation of the child in treatment and scientific research, which may bias the sample of participants.</p><p>In short, the current RCT-study will enhance our understanding of the efficacy IPV-related parental components added to TF-CBT for children who have been exposed to IPV. It will illuminate mechanisms underlying change by considering multiple dimensions of child responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (METC VUmc 2011/101/NL39277.029.12).
