Notably, a review of the medical literature does not identify any study which investigates the hypothesis that a requirement for signed consent for anesthesia may serve as a catalyst for an enhanced informed consent process.</p><p>The documentation of consent for anesthesia in majority of hospitals of Trinidad, relies on a simple clause in the surgical consent document which states that the patient consents to the operation &#x0201c;and to such general or other anesthetic and such further or alternative procedures as may be necessary.&#x0201d; Similar documents are used in at least one major Jamaican Hospital.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These &#x0201c;consent for operation&#x0201d; documents are administered by a member of the surgical team (usually a house officer) and are often signed prior to any contact with the anesthetist. A discussion between the patient and their anesthetist regarding their anesthesia care may subsequently occur to varying degrees during the preoperative anesthetic visit but a record of this discussion is rarely made except in high-risk cases or sometimes where regional anesthesia is proposed. The reliance on a &#x0201c;catch-all&#x0201d; phrase regarding anesthesia on the surgical consent document places no apparent legal or institutional obligation on the anesthetist in this setting to engage in a proper informed consent discussion with the patient and it is a reasonable inference that if the anesthetist was required to obtain separate signed consent it would increase the likelihood that this discussion does occur and would also be documented adequately.</p><p>With this background, this study sought to compare the efficacy of a separate informed consent process for anesthesia services at our tertiary care teaching hospital and the factors which may influence the consent process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This prospective study was conducted on the pre- and postoperative wards of a tertiary care teaching hospital during a 3 month-period.

The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of issues</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-32-18-g004"/></table-wrap><p>There was almost total agreement among both groups that permission was given without undue pressure and that they had sufficient opportunity to ask questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary finding of this study is that in our public hospital setting, the informed consent process may be better when a separate written consent was obtained for anesthesia as estimated by the adequacy of consent index.</p><p>Anesthesia procedures are clearly different from surgical procedures in their nature, purpose, and risk profiles. It is therefore logical that if informed consent for anesthesia procedures is obtained independently, and further, if it is obtained by a clinician (anesthetist) capable of formulating and discussing the anesthesia care plan (vis-&#x000e0;-vis its' risks, benefits, and alternatives), the patient is likely to have a better information.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The use and usefulness of consent forms have been contentious issues. The AAGBI has advised that a signed consent form is not necessary for anesthesia procedures because it felt that emphasis should be placed on the process of informed consent rather than on obtaining a signature on a form.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In addition, several studies have shown that &#x0201c;consent forms&#x0201d; are often too complex for the average patient to read and understand and, in fact, many patients sign consent forms without reading or understanding them.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Another criticism is that many consent forms appear to be constructed to protect hospitals and caregivers from liability rather than clarify information about procedures or aid patients in decision-making.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] These authors have suggested that the legal appearance and content of these consent forms are likely to inhibit, if not counteract, the goals of informed consent by adding to the perception that institutional protection takes precedence over patient care.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Despite these myriad concerns which question the value of consent forms, this study has demonstrated that the use of a consent form for anesthesia improved the adequacy of the informed consent process. It is quite likely that in this setting (where the institutional obligation for consent to anesthesia is fulfilled by a signature on the surgical consent document) a requirement to obtain separate written consent serves as an essential stimulus for a discussion between the anesthetist and the patient about the anesthesia care plan. This idea that a consent form may aid the consent process by acting as a prompt or a stimulus to an active discussion about treatment options has been supported by several authors.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Apart from the possible role as a catalyst to the process, the form itself may serve as a reminder or a checklist of the elements of the informed consent process which need to be addressed.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Another probable reason why the use of separate written consent helped rather than hindered the informed consent process in this study may be that the &#x0201c;Consent for Anesthesia&#x0201d; form was kept very simple, excluding details about the anesthetic techniques and risks that may have made the form difficult to understand. The onus therefore remained on the anesthetist to provide the patient with the information necessary for the consent to be informed. This approach of not providing detailed information on the form itself reduces the chances of the anesthetist just giving the patient the form to read and sign and thereby using the form as a substitute for the process. The fact that the anesthetist necessarily remained the source of the information would have also hypothetically allowed the information to be tailored to the education level of the patient. This may explain why no statistically significant relationship was found between educational level and adequacy of consent.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the use of separate written consent enhanced the overall adequacy of the informed consent process, several areas were identified where improvements are still needed. As much as 55% of patients who signed the anesthetic consent form did not think that they were adequately informed about rare but serious complications of the proposed anesthetic procedures. Several other studies have detected similar inadequacies in risk disclosure.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>One justification used in the past for the withholding of information is the notion that patient apprehension caused by &#x0201c;frightening&#x0201d; information results in raised catecholamine levels which make it more difficult to anesthetize the patient.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Stanley <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that patients' anxiety levels were unaltered by the provision of additional detailed verbal and/or written information.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Shimoda <italic>et al</italic>. went a step further and showed that patients who had anxiety about anesthesia before an operation indicated a greater need for detailed printed information compared with those without anxiety.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, several other studies investigating patients' desire for information perioperatively have found that, in general, there is a desire for more rather than less information.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Some practitioners may withhold information because they feel that it may deter a patient from undergoing a beneficial procedure. The AAGBI in their 2006 publication titled &#x0201c;Consent and Anesthesia&#x0201d; argued in favor of the converse, that any information which might lead a patient to cancel or defer a procedure should be considered significant.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Another major shortcoming identified in the informed consent process was the infrequency of discussion about alternatives to the proposed anesthetic procedures. Sixty-seven percent of patients who signed the consent for anesthesia form indicated that no discussion took place about the possibility of alternative anesthetic techniques. In our setting, with anesthetists often meet their patients on the day of surgery, hence the anesthetist primarily discusses what he/she intends to do, meeting the lower standard of legal acceptability but at the same time sacrificing the ideals of patient autonomy and shared decision making. This compromise is unfortunate because it has been shown that the preservation of patient autonomy is associated with improved patient satisfaction and more favorable medical outcomes.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The issue of postoperative pain control was another area that was not satisfactorily discussed by the anesthetists who obtained consent, with approximately 55% of patients overall indicating dissatisfaction with the information provided. Barneschi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the desire for information about pain in their study was particularly high (85%). This underscores the relevance of pain and analgesia as an issue in the informed consent process.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Although the results suggest that the information provided to patients was not as complete as it should be, patients apparently opted not to utilize the opportunities that they were given to ask questions. Crawford-Sykes and Hambleton reported that although Jamaican patients expressed a desire for information concerning anesthesia and surgery, they did not regard it as their right.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>A study conducted in the UK revealed that nearly all women before obstetric anesthesia (82-94%) wished to know about common, less severe side effects, while a substantial majority (70-77%) also wished to know about rarer but more severe complications, such as permanent neurological deficit, meningitis, and high spinal block.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Our study established a better knowledge of this aspect of anesthesia when a separate consent form was used.</p><p>The significance of the findings of this study should be however interpreted within the context of the limitations of the study. First, the adequacy of consent index was devised and used for the first time in this study and therefore it was not previously validated. Although eight different essential aspects of the informed consent process were assessed with this instrument, there are several other aspects which were not included. The most important one is probably the extent to which the patient was allowed to share in the decision-making process.</p><p>With respect to information provided to the patient about material risks, patients were asked if they &#x0201c;felt&#x0201d; that they were adequately informed. One problem with this approach is that it is subjective in nature, and a patient who claims to be satisfied may find other risks relevant if they were made aware of them. An alternative approach taken by other researchers was to measure objectively patients' recall[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and understanding of information provided.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>With respect to the methodology of this study, it can be argued that the introduction of a consent form for anesthesia on a trial basis, with the implication that there will be an assessment of the new measure, may have led anesthetists to artificially alter their practice, which could have introduced a &#x0201c;desirability bias.&#x0201d; Although this consideration was a real possibility, many anesthetists were not made aware of any details of the planned evaluation.</p><p>Another possible limitation involves the timing of the assessment. It has been shown that patients are best informed immediately after signing the consent form and from then on there is a deterioration of the recall of information.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The consequence of this is that patients may have forgotten some of the details about what they were told by the time the interviews were conducted. The other option of administering the questionnaire after the informed consent process but before the surgery could quite possibly have the undesirable effect of interference with the process of care. We felt that it was prudent to avoid this risk.</p><p>Nevertheless, it may be possible to recommend that the practice of obtaining separate written consent for anesthesia may be useful in selected settings.</p><p>We suggest that the consent form used should:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Be simply written without legal jargon.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contain cues to the anesthetist regarding the issues to be covered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not lengthy and in itself provide the information but should keep the onus on the anesthetist to do so (thereby allowing the information to be tailored to the individual patient's needs and educational level, while at the same time reducing the risk that the form be substituted for the informed consent process), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contain ample space to document the information discussed.</p></list-item></list>
