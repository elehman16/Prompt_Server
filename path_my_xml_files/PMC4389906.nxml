Various interventions have been evaluated in the general population to tackle hazardous or harmful drinking and alcohol dependence, but the literature evaluating interventions is very limited regarding intellectual disabilities. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that brief and extended brief interventions be used to help young persons and adults who have screened as positive for hazardous and harmful drinking. The objective of this trial is to investigate the feasibility of adapting and delivering an extended brief intervention (EBI) to persons with mild/moderate intellectual disability who live in the community and whose level of drinking is harmful or hazardous.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study has three stages, which include the adaptation of the Extended Brief Intervention (EBI) for people with intellectual disability, a single blind, randomised controlled trial of an individual Extended Brief Intervention to test the feasibility of the intervention, and a qualitative study that will assess the perceived acceptability and usefulness of the intervention. Fifty participants in total will be recruited from community intellectual disability services and social care or third sector organisations. The main outcome is a reduction in alcohol consumption measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Alcohol misuse is a relatively under-researched mental health problem in people with intellectual disabilities. Therefore, the study addresses both diagnostic issues and the delivery of a simple first stage intervention, which is available to the population of average intelligence and young persons in particular. The findings from the study will guide the preparation of a large-scale study to test whether this treatment is clinically and cost-effective in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN58783633">ISRCTN58783633</ext-link> (19 December 2013).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alcohol misuse</kwd><kwd>intellectual disabilities</kwd><kwd>brief intervention</kwd><kwd>AUDIT</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Alcohol is the most commonly used substance worldwide and contributes substantially to mortality, psychiatric and physical health morbidity and causes increased disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the sparse literature regarding substance misuse in people with intellectual disabilities (characterised by an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) less than 70, developmental delay and adaptive deficits), there is increasing interest in studying such problems in this population. This is because most now live in the community and are more likely to be exposed to substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. United Kingdom and United States population-based studies indicate that the prevalence of substance misuse in people with intellectual disabilities ranges from 0.5% and 2.5%, respectively, to as high as 25% for any substance in clinic samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Approximately 5% of the youth in drug and alcohol services have a degree of intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most common substance that people with intellectual disabilities tend to use is alcohol, followed by cannabis and cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aetiological factors that have been postulated to contribute to substance misuse in people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities include hyperactivity, lack of assertiveness, low self-esteem, susceptibility to peer pressure, desire for social acceptance, social isolation, early onset of drinking and lack of example setting in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Substances may also be taken as a maladaptive way of relieving stress or developing relationships within local communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Those most at risk are young males with a mild intellectual disability or borderline intelligence who live independently and are less likely to engage in activities and/or to experience mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Brief and extended brief interventions have been evaluated in the general population to tackle hazardous or harmful drinking and alcohol dependence. Despite the heterogeneity observed in the studies, a meta-analysis showed that participants generally have lower alcohol consumption at one year (mean difference: -38 grams/week, 95% CI: -54 to -23 and mean difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;-28, 95% CI: -62 to 6 grams/week, for brief and extended brief interventions, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The same meta-analysis reports that loss to follow-up ranges from 10% to 70% but only three studies reported such rates. However, the literature evaluating any interventions targeted at people with intellectual disabilities is uncommon. This is partly due to the general lack of evidence based interventions in this field, but also to the belief that interventions that are suitable for typically functioning adolescents and adults are also suitable for those with mild-moderate intellectual disabilities without need for adaptation. This seems counterintuitive as people with intellectual disabilities have cognitive deficits that impair their ability to learn or generalise new learning, and therefore may require interventions to last longer, to include maintenance sessions, and to be supported to seek help and attend appointments. It is often reported that staff delivering interventions to the general population may not be skilled to provide such treatment to people with intellectual disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A variety of approaches have been tried to help people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and substance misuse, including education about the risks associated with substance misuse, behavioural modification, and the use of adapted materials from Alcoholics Anonymous or similar organisations, mostly delivered in group settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As a whole, these studies suggest that the capacity of people with intellectual disabilities to learn new information is enhanced by providing additional cues and using techniques such as modelling, videotaped vignettes and role-playing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Often, sessions are augmented with coping skills lessons and assertiveness training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the studies conducted to date are small, run in specialist single centre settings and are uncontrolled.</p><p>Nevertheless, two studies merit further attention; one is a study of three sessions of group motivational interviewing over two weeks conducted with seven offenders with intellectual disabilities in a medium secure unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The authors found that the participants showed increased determination to reduce drinking at the end of the treatment. The second study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], was a 10-week evaluation of assertiveness training and modelling to educate about substance misuse and to help the participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;84) to respond appropriately when offered substances in their social network. The authors found that knowledge of the risks associated with use of illicit substances increased at the end of the intervention, and this was maintained at six- months follow-up. The methodological limitations of the studies include the uncontrolled design, the small sample size, insufficient details of reporting, inclusion of several types of substances in the educational materials and the delivery in a specific environment that is different from community living.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (PH24; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) recommends that brief and extended brief interventions are used to help young persons and adults who have screened positive for hazardous and harmful drinking. The interventions recommended are based on motivational interviewing/enhancement techniques, and are delivered by trained professionals. Their aim is to reduce alcohol intake, reduce risk-taking behaviour and even to consider abstinence. The sessions are short at 30 minutes and follow-up is offered. At all times, individuals who are referred for treatment have their capacity to consent to it assessed and, where further treatment is indicated, referrals to secondary specialist services should be made.</p><p>We chose to evaluate the Extended Brief Intervention (EBI) in the current study because it is a widely used and evaluated treatment in the literature for hazardous and harmful drinking. It is a low-intensity intervention and can be delivered by trained professionals in the public and voluntary sector.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The key research question is: Can we design a large scale, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will answer whether EBI is more effective than usual care in helping adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability to reduce their alcohol intake?</p><p>The feasibility trial will compare the use of EBI with treatment as usual in the participating areas and will enable us do the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>measure the number of eligible participants, including paid and family carers, willingness of clinicians to recruit participants, recruitment rate, loss to follow-up, adherence to the intervention, and standard deviation of the primary outcome measures.

Findings from these interviews will enable us to refine the EBI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study corresponds to Phase 2 of the Medical Research Council (MRC) complex interventions guidelines, which guides the development of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the study has three stages that will be discussed below.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Stage 1-Adaptation of the intervention</title><p>We will review the literature on EBI, and we will consult with service users and professionals about the number of sessions to be delivered and the materials to be used in each session. This is particularly important as people with intellectual disabilities have substantial cognitive deficits that require a longer duration of treatment, a mixture of materials, and the opportunity to test skills learnt over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. So while the adapted intervention will include the existing treatment, such as a detailed assessment of drinking behaviour and the development of coping plans, it will be also include strategies to make engaging with the intervention easier, such as repetition of information and longer sessions.</p><p>The treatment manual will be tested with three service users (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Inclusion criteria</xref> below) in terms of acceptability and clarity, and the intervention will be refined accordingly. A similar approach has been used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The data from these individuals will not be included in the final analysis of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Stage 2-Feasibility study</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>This will be a single blind, randomised controlled trial of individual EBI delivered as an adjunct to usual care for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Fifty participants, randomised to either the intervention arm or usual care, will be assessed at baseline, two months and three months. Research assistants carrying out assessments will be blind to the trial arm to which the participants are allocated.</p><p>Finally, qualitative interviews will be carried out at three months (see stage 3 below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be conducted within the Community Intellectual Disabilities Teams and social care services in three participating areas in England, UK, including urban and inner city locations. These teams offer specialist mental health, social care support and health services to adults with intellectual disability, as well as residential and supported living accommodation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities aged 18 years and over, and who are known to professionals within the intellectual disabilities services as possibly having an alcohol problem, will be eligible to be referred to the study. Each participant should have a carer or family member prepared to accompany them to their sessions and complete the study instruments.

A score of 8 and above indicates hazardous or harmful drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Questions 4, 5 and 6 specifically assess symptoms of dependence. The National Institute of Care and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] advises a reduction of scores in particular populations who may have lower prevalence of AUD, such as older people, females, and younger people. Local data, however, suggests that the prevalence of AUD in adults with mild/moderate intellectual disability in contact with services based on an AUDIT cut off of 8 is 22.5%, which is similar to the prevalence in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

It will be provided over five half-hour weekly sessions with a final one-hour session after eight weeks. It will be delivered by a trained therapist recruited from the NHS/private or third sector providing alcohol services in England. It is likely that the therapist may not have experience working with adults with intellectual disabilities; therefore, the research team members will provide training in the form of a one-day induction, including aspects of communication and how to overcome cognitive limitations in people with intellectual disabilities, interviewing techniques, use of the manualised treatment and guided reading to enhance clinical skills in working with this population. Furthermore, tapes of early treatment sessions will be reviewed by co-authors CK and KS. The therapist will be supervised regularly by CK, a consultant psychiatrist in addictions and trained in motivational interviewing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Treatment as usual: Service users with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities who are identified as having AUD usually receive little specific support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; however, if problems escalate to dependence, they may be referred and managed jointly with secondary substance misuse services. Therefore, they may be offered non-specific counselling on improving coping abilities, pharmacological interventions where there are comorbid mental health problems or to achieve abstinence, inpatient admission if required, encouragement to attend community services for alcohol disorders, social support and nursing input if they experience any physical signs of malnutrition or epilepsy and other alcohol-related morbidity.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome is a reduction in alcohol intake measured by the modified Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Definition of heavy drinking will be informed by a literature review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The research team statistician will generate the randomisation list. Any breach in blinding/unmasking, a common problem with single blind trials, will be monitored to ensure that the research assistants are not aware, as far as possible, to which group the individual was allocated.

Costs will include the intervention, training and health and social care provision. Health and social care resource use, employment and the impact on carers will be costed using national published values. The feasibility of a cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal cost perspective will also be assessed. Descriptive statistics for these variables will be reported and an initial analysis will calculate 1) the mean incremental cost per reduction in days of heavy drinking and 2) the mean cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained using the EQ-5D mapping algorithm. Previous studies in the general population have found that generic quality of life measures are not sensitive to reductions in alcohol misuse, particularly in hazardous drinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We will test whether this is also the pattern in adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and whether we can use these measures in a full trial using correlations, regression analysis and mapping. Some of the impact from long-term hazardous and harmful alcohol misuse can occur well into the future. Due to the short follow-up period, it is unlikely that the long-term impact will be captured within this trial, but this will require further investigation as part of a full trial using decision analytical models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Stage 3-Qualitative study</title><p>In order to assess the perceived acceptability and usefulness of the intervention, 50% of service user and carer dyads allocated to the EBI arm of the trial, will be interviewed at end of treatment (that is, 12 weeks).

Both service users and the research assistants will be trained in how to collect qualitative data and conduct the interviews.

All patient information sheets and consent forms will be in easy-read versions, and informed written consent will be obtained from all participants.

The latter is defined as treatment based on principles of behaviour modification and aims to incentivise and then reinforce changes in behaviour with the aid of vouchers, privileges, prizes or modest financial incentives that are of value to the client (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg51/chapter/appendix-c-contingency-management-key-elements-in-the-delivery-of-a-programme">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg51/chapter/appendix-c-contingency-management-key-elements-in-the-delivery-of-a-programme</ext-link>). Based on the various issues identified as potential difficulties in each option, we made the decision to start from a simpler project that has yet to be tested in this population. An easy-read version of the project proposal was presented to a service users&#x02019; group for advice and comments on how to present the study and describe the intervention. Two service users and their carers contribute to the trial steering committee and will conduct the qualitative interviews as described earlier. The service users will be involved in the interpretation of the interviews, write up the findings in an accessible format and disseminate them locally and nationally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide invaluable information on several aspects of alcohol and other substance misuse patterns in people with intellectual disability. Although not an epidemiological study per se, it will reveal important elements of treatment pathways and support needs for those individuals. Such information is currently either not available or mostly derived from clinic populations. Our sample will be drawn from a wide variety of community care.</p><p>Furthermore, there is limited literature on use of alcohol instruments such as AUDIT and RCQ in people with intellectual disabilities; therefore, the adapted tools used in this project will be particularly useful for further research but also in clinical practice in this field.</p><p>Most importantly, there is emerging debate about the impact of brief interventions delivered in primary care on alcohol problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Current literature suggests that they indeed reduce consumption, but there is little information on the content and fidelity of the intervention in published studies.</p><p>In carrying out the study, we will need to overcome generic difficulties in research in adults with substance misuse who may be not only be hard to reach but also unwilling to commit to treatment or may drop out. Access to participants may depend on local configurations of services, and therefore, the recruitment strategy will be crucial in carrying out the feasibility study. Therefore, our work will be sufficiently novel to contribute not only to the field of intellectual disabilities but to the existing research in this particular topic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of the manuscript submission the trial is still recruiting new participants.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBI-ID</term><def><p>extended brief intervention-ID</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ID</term><def><p>intellectual disabilities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQ</term><def><p>intelligence quotient</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CK has overall management of the research project, developed the intervention manual, supervises the therapist, will lead on dissemination of results within the substance misuse service and will contribute to all outputs such as papers in conference and journals.
