Recent data suggest that patients with COPD are three times more likely than individuals without COPD to report activity limitation, and three times more likely to have difficulty walking or climbing stairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The importance of maintaining or improving physical activity levels in patients with COPD is increasingly recognised, as low or decreasing levels of physical activity are associated with a worsening in health status, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and increasing rates of hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, sustained physical inactivity is also associated with a decline in muscle mass, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] which will, in turn, impact the ability of patients to exercise.</p><p>One of the main reasons for activity limitation could be lung hyperinflation, which not only affects patients with advanced COPD, but can also occur early in the course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A number of long-acting bronchodilators have been shown to reduce lung hyperinflation and thereby improve exercise intolerance, including the long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) indacaterol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the fixed-dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (IND/GLY; QVA149) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The improvements in exercise intolerance due to lung deflation by bronchodilator therapy have been frequently studied using standardised protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, improved exercise tolerance only permits increased physical activity &#x02013; it does not mean that patients will change their behaviour and become more physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite this, given the close relation between physical inactivity and unfavourable patient outcomes, it is the goal of such interventions to also improve physical activity in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unfortunately, few randomised, placebo-controlled studies have evaluated the effects of such therapies on objectively measured physical activity in patients with COPD. Those that have been conducted provided mixed results with regard to an improvement of physical activity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] although none of these studies were designed with physical activity as the primary outcome of the intervention.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of IND/GLY 110/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily (OD) versus placebo on lung hyperinflation as assessed by the measurement of inspiratory capacity (IC) and objectively measured physical activity in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, conducted at 30 secondary care (pulmonology) practices in Germany. It consisted of two 21-day treatment periods, with a 14-day washout between periods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12890_2016_256_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>At an initial screening visit (Visit 1), patients provided informed consent, inclusion/exclusion criteria were checked and their current COPD medication was reviewed and (if necessary) adjusted. The period between Visit 1 and Visit 2 was an individual run-in period, the duration of which depended on COPD medication washout. At Visit 2 (the first baseline visit), inclusion/exclusion criteria were reassessed, including spirometry before and after inhalation of salbutamol 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. Treatment Period 1 ran for 21&#x000a0;days, commencing with the randomisation visit (Visit 3), when eligible patients were randomised to one of two treatment sequences, and ending on Visit 4. This was followed by a 14-day washout period, which included the second baseline visit (Visit 5) on Day 29. Treatment period 2 then ran for 21&#x000a0;days from Visit 6 to Visit 7.</p><p>Physical activity was measured with an activity monitor that has been validated for use in COPD (Sensewear&#x000ae; armband; BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients were to wear the armband for the week (e.g., Monday to Monday) prior to the start of each treatment period (to collect baseline data), and for the last week of each treatment period. The armband was to be worn continuously day and night, except for time spent in personal hygiene. We assessed activity-related energy expenditure (i.e., total daily energy expenditure minus resting energy expenditure), minutes of at least moderate activity (&#x0003e;3 metabolic equivalents), steps per day, and physical activity level (total daily energy expenditure divided by resting energy expenditure) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We defined a valid day to have at least 21.5&#x000a0;h of monitoring (i.e., 90&#x000a0;% of the potential wearing time). The first day of each measurement period was not used for analysis as the measurement either started after the visit at the study site (baseline) or a reminder phone call from the study nurse (treatment period), resulting in highly variable wearing times on that day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The last day of each measurement period, when the patients had to come to the study site for the respective visit in the morning, was also not used, resulting in 6&#x000a0;days (each of 1440&#x000a0;min) of measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. On Visits 3, 4, 6 and 7, IC was assessed from slow vital capacity (SVC) spirometry manoeuvres at 30&#x000a0;min predose, and 15 and 45&#x000a0;min and 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5&#x000a0;h post-dose; forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was assessed from forced vital capacity (FVC) manoeuvres at 15&#x000a0;min predose, and 30&#x000a0;min and 1, 2, 3 and 4&#x000a0;h post-dose. Lung function was assessed according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society standards, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using established reference values for FEV<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and suggested reference values for IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Patients were to be withdrawn from the study if they experienced a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected throughout the study, with vital signs collected at each visit.</p><p>There was one substantial protocol amendment, to add an exclusion criterion (glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;mL/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>) and a laboratory parameter (creatinine clearance), and to correct some inconsistencies. A nonsubstantial amendment reflected a change from electronic to paper case report forms. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible patients were male or female, at least 40&#x000a0;years of age, current or ex-smokers with smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, and had signed an informed consent form prior to initiation of any study-related procedure.

Patients were also excluded if they experienced a COPD exacerbation in the 6&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening or during the run-in period, or a respiratory tract infection within 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to screening or during the run-in period, or had a contraindication for, or hypersensitivity to, anticholinergics, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, sympathomimetic amines, or lactose or any of the other excipients of the study medication. Participation in, or planning participation in, a pulmonary rehabilitation programme was also a reason for exclusion.</p><p>Consistent with similar studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] the following COPD medication was prohibited from the indicated time prior to Visit 2 and for the duration of the study: LAMAs (7&#x000a0;days); LABAs (48&#x000a0;h; 7&#x000a0;days for indacaterol); xanthines and oral phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors (7&#x000a0;days). Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) were permitted, at a stable dose throughout the study (patients on a LABA/ICS combination were to be switched to the nearest equivalent dose of ICS monotherapy at least 48&#x000a0;h prior to Visit 2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions</title><p>Study treatment was IND/GLY, at a dose of 110/50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g OD, and matching placebo, with patients, investigators and staff, persons performing the assessments, sponsor staff and data analysts blinded to treatment. Salbutamol was permitted as rescue medication, but not within 6&#x000a0;h of the start of any study visit.</p><p>Patients were randomised to one of two treatment sequences in a ratio of 1:1 using a randomisation number from a list generated by the study sponsor. This list was produced using a validated automated system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes and statistical methods</title><p>The two co-primary objectives were: To demonstrate the superiority of IND/GLY to placebo in terms of peak IC after 21&#x000a0;days of treatment; and to evaluate the superiority of IND/GLY to placebo in terms of average daily activity-related energy expenditure. Both co-primary objectives were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with the factors centre, baseline measure, period, patient within centre, and treatment. Multiplicity was controlled using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure, in which the two hypotheses were tested at the 2.5&#x000a0;% level in a first step. If at least one of the hypotheses could be rejected at this level, the remaining hypothesis was then tested at the 5&#x000a0;% level. Data for the two co-primary objectives are presented as adjusted (least squares) mean treatment differences, two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals and associated p values. <italic>Post-hoc</italic> analyses were performed to identify potential subgroups that were more likely to respond to IND/GLY treatment with regard to changes of activity-related energy expenditure.</p><p>Key secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of IND/GLY vs placebo in terms of average number of steps per day and the duration of at least moderate activity per day. Other secondary objectives were comparisons of IND/GLY with placebo in terms of peak IC and FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 1, and trough IC and FEV<sub>1</sub> after 21&#x000a0;days, with average physical activity level analysed as an exploratory endpoint. The secondary and exploratory efficacy objectives were analysed using a similar ANCOVA model to that used for the co-primary objectives, with the exception of steps per day. This was analysed using Friedman&#x02019;s test for paired data, with results presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) and associated p value. Use of rescue medication was also captured during the study, and the number of days on which rescue medication was used was calculated (expressed as per 100 study days).</p><p>The full analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who were exposed to at least one dose of study medication in one treatment period, and was used for all efficacy analyses. The safety set consisted of all randomised patients who were exposed to at least one dose of study medication in one treatment period and had at least one safety assessment; this was used for all safety analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>In a previous study, the mean difference between indacaterol and placebo for change from baseline in average daily energy consumption was 132.6 Kcal/day, with a within-patient standard deviation (SD) of 389.3 Kcal/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It was estimated that to observe this difference, 92 patients were needed in a crossover design. However, in order to observe significant differences in the other co-primary endpoint, IC, and in the other two activity parameters (steps per day and duration of at least moderate activity), a sample size was selected based on the parameter with the smallest effect size (observed mean indacaterol&#x02013;placebo difference of 711.5 steps per day with a within-patient SD of 2679.7 steps per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). For this parameter, 150 patients would give 90&#x000a0;% power with a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level.

It is therefore of clinical interest that the two co-primary endpoints in this study were met, with statistical separations between IND/GLY and placebo in terms of peak IC (i.e., hyperinflation) and activity-related energy expenditure. These significant improvements with IND/GLY vs placebo were accompanied by a significant improvement in the average number of steps per day, and a trend towards an improvement in the duration of at least moderate activity (although this difference didn&#x02019;t reach statistical significance).</p><p>The difference in peak IC (202&#x000a0;mL) exceeded the value of 100&#x000a0;mL that has been suggested to be potentially clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The two treatment periods gave consistent results for this parameter, indicating that the washout period was sufficient for the spirometry endpoints. There was, however, a substantial period effect in activity-related energy expenditure. In the first period, average energy expenditure increased from baseline in patients receiving IND/GLY. In Period 2, there was a decrease from baseline with both treatments. Notably, however, the baseline value in Period 2 of patients receiving placebo was higher than the other three baseline evaluations. As these were patients who received IND/GLY in the first treatment period this suggests that the 3-week treatment period may have been insufficient to fully evaluate the effect of IND/GLY on physical activity. It would be intriguing to evaluate the longer-term effect of IND/GLY on this parameter.</p><p>It should be recognised that the only intervention that patients received in the current study was pharmacological (either IND/GLY or placebo). Reducing hyperinflation with a long-acting bronchodilator has consistently been shown to increase exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, just increasing the ability of patients to exercise doesn&#x02019;t mean that they will make use of this additional capacity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] as shown in an indacaterol study in which despite an increase in exercise endurance of nearly 2&#x000a0;min (assessed using cycle ergometry) with indacaterol 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g OD compared with placebo, average energy expenditure and physical activity duration was slightly lower with indacaterol than placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast, in studies that assessed physical activity using the same standardised methodology as in the current study, significant differences were observed versus placebo in favour of indacaterol 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g OD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Even so, the improvements in physical activity observed in all of these studies are less than observed with behavioural interventions and patient education, the importance of which is increasingly recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Indeed, patient education forms an important part of recommended pulmonary rehabilitation programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting bronchodilator (tiotropium) and pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to produce sustained improvements in breathlessness and health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, such behavioural interventions can be very challenging to incorporate into clinical trials &#x02013; as demonstrated by a tiotropium study in which, despite complex individualised patient education and goals setting there were no statistically significant differences between tiotropium and placebo for any of the activity endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this context, it is notable that IND/GLY was associated with significant improvements in a range of physical activity parameters in the current trial.</p><p>The study was powered on number of steps, and it is important, therefore, that there was a significant improvement with IND/GLY over placebo for this parameter. A previous study has suggested that every additional 1000 steps per day at low average intensity is associated with a 20&#x000a0;% decrease in the risk of COPD hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although the 358 step difference between treatments in the current study is one-third of this value, this demonstrates the potential for a longer treatment intervention, perhaps in combination with a behavioural intervention, to have a significant impact on hospitalisation. This relatively short duration is one of the main weaknesses of the study. The crossover design is both a strength and a weakness; as patients act as their own controls, the variability of data is anticipated to be lower, permitting a smaller study. However, interpreting data from the second treatment period is especially challenging, since the physical activity results depend on a change in lifestyle. In addition, the population was not recruited based on their baseline hyperinflation or level of physical activity &#x02013; and there was a high degree of variability in baseline physical activity levels, with the duration of at least moderate activity varying from 3 to 498&#x000a0;min. Furthermore, the <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses suggest that the effects of IND/GLY on physical activity in this study are mainly driven by patients with more severe COPD. This hypothesis, however, would be clearly subject to further prospective trials and is not in line with our previous study using indacaterol in patients with a very similar degree of lung function impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The finding that the duration of at least moderate activity decreased with both treatments is unexpected, especially given that the average steps per day and physical activity increased as a result of treatment with IND/GLY. However, this group of patients appeared to have fairly high durations of physical activity on entry &#x02013; mean baseline values of 125 and 130 mins per day, which is about 30&#x000a0;% higher than in previous studies with similar COPD populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This would suggest that the patients in the current study had limited opportunity within their day-to-day lifestyle to increase the duration of physical activity.</p><p>As would be anticipated from previous studies, all of the secondary spirometry parameters were significantly increased with IND/GLY compared with placebo. The difference between IND/GLY and placebo for trough FEV<sub>1</sub> after 21&#x000a0;days (280&#x000a0;mL) was consistent with that observed in an exercise endurance study (200&#x000a0;mL), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and for the primary endpoint (at Week 26) of the pivotal registration study by Bateman et al (a difference of 200&#x000a0;mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The difference in trough IC after 21&#x000a0;days in the current study (200&#x000a0;mL) was also similar to the prior exercise endurance study (190&#x000a0;mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies, IND/GLY also demonstrated a good overall safety profile, with no unexpected findings in either the AEs or the serious AEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, in this study IND/GLY was associated with significant reductions compared with placebo in hyperinflation, and, despite no patient education or lifestyle advice, significant improvements in daily physical activity levels. This suggests that IND/GLY has the potential to impact two of the main clinical concerns in the care of patients with COPD. However, longer trials combined with either behavioural education or pulmonary rehabilitation are needed to demonstrate clinically more relevant effects on physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE, adverse event; ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; BMI, body mass index; CAT, COPD Assessment Test; CI, confidence interval; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s; FVC, forced vital capacity; GOLD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; IC, inspiratory capacity; ICS, inhaled corticosteroid; IND/GLY, fixed-dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (QVA149); LABA, long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist; OD, once daily; SAE, serious adverse event; SD, standard deviation; SVC, slow vital capacity; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12890_2016_256_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Raw mean peak inspiratory capacity after 21&#x000a0;days, overall and for each treatment period (full analysis set).
