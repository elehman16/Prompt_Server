plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in
female patients with shoulder pain. [Subjects] Subjects comprised 20 female patients with
shoulder pain. [Methods] Subjects were divided into 2 groups: a Hatha yoga exercise group
(n = 10) and a control group that performed no exercise (n = 10). The subjects&#x02019; body
composition, plasma malondialdehyde concentrations, and superoxide dismutase activities
were measured before and after a 16-week Hatha yoga exercise program. [Results] After the
16-week Hatha yoga exercise program, the exercise group had significantly lower plasma MDA
concentrations than the control group. In addition, the exercise group had significantly
higher plasma SOD activity than the control group. [Conclusions] Hatha yoga exercise
improves flexibility, muscle tone and strength, balance, and joint function. Our findings
indicate that regular and continuous yoga exercise effectively improved body composition,
decrease plasma MDA concentration, and increase plasma SOD activity in female patients
with shoulder pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Yoga</kwd><kwd>Malondialdehyde</kwd><kwd>Superoxide dismutase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Excessive exercise beyond an appropriate intensity or duration has negative effects on the

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key detoxification enzyme among the
antioxidant enzymes. SOD removes ROS by catalyzing and transforming superoxide into two
non-toxic substances, and is frequently monitored and measured as an indicator of oxidative
stress<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lee et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> have reported that yoga
exercise can be used to treat body composition and serum lipid profiles. Previous studies
have shown that breathing exercises undertaken during yoga reduce the prevalence of many
pathogens by decreasing free radicals. These exercises improve antioxidant responses during
musculoskeletal activities in elderly subjects and pregnant women by improving the oxygen
supply to various tissues with minimal exertion. In addition, Sinha et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that yoga exercises, performed
over a period of six months, increased antioxidant enzyme concentrations in the body of
healthy adult men. Another study showed that yoga exercises performed over a period of 16
weeks increased antioxidant enzyme activities, decreased lipid peroxidation, and improved
stamina<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to date, no
published review has evaluated the impact of yoga exercise on reactive oxygen species and
antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hatha yoga exercise on plasma
malondialdehyde concentration and superoxide dismutase activity. Our subjects were females
in their twenties with shoulder pain, who performed hatha yoga three times weekly for 16
weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ten females, in their twenties, were included in our study as the exercise group. All had

Meydani et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that conjugated
dienes of skeletal muscle increased after running exercise (75% of maximum heart rate,
15&#x02005;min, 3 times). Also, a recent study of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and healthy subjects demonstrated that lipid peroxidation was higher in the
vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) than at rest and 48 hours after performing knee extension
exercises until exhaustion in the COPD subjects.</p><p>The degree of oxidation is determined by exercise type, intensity, and duration<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lipid peroxidation generated by active oxygen and ROS is caused by
the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid, which is the main ingredient of biological
membranes. MDA levels are widely used as an index of lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Prolonged aerobic activities and low-intensity exercise require more energy than being at
rest, therefore the supply of oxygen to active tissues increases considerably. An increase
in maximal oxygen uptake through exercise is closely related to respiratory health. Several
researchers have indicated that the formation of free radicals is mainly the result of
muscle damage and fatigue induced by exercise.</p><p>In the present study, a significant difference was found in the plasma MDA concentration
between the two groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In the control group, the MDA concentration increased
significantly after 16 weeks (p &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas in the exercise group, there was no
significant difference during the various stages of exercise, but levels were highest
immediately after exercise.</p><p>This result is consistent with that of a previous study which showed that respiration of
mitochondria increased with exercise intensity. Exercise caused the production of oxygen
free radicals that increased oxidative stress, causing increased tissue damage and lipid
peroxidation. This was because MDA decreased after the one-off training exercise induced
oxidative stress, thereby causing an increase in lipid peroxidation. Long-term aerobic
training can increase the antioxidant capability of the human body, thereby helping to
maintain the oxidation-reduction balance<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>ROS generated through exercise play an important role in damaging to oxidized fragments in
main tissues, and excessive endogenous oxidants can damage to tissues through enzyme
inactivation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. However, antioxidant enzymes [e.g., SOD,
catalase (CAT), and GSH peroxidase (GPX)] that protect the human body from oxidative damage
can catalyze electron-reduction reactions of ROS. Among these, SOD is the most widely
measured as an index of oxidative stress. Many studies have reported that SOD activity in
skeletal muscles increases significantly after exercise. However, many studies have failed
to accurately determine the exercise adaptation pattern of SOD, despite using similar animal
exercise models. Powers et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>
investigated the effect of intensity and duration of exercise and muscle fiber types on SOD
activity in mice. An increase in SOD activity was observed in the gastrocnemius muscle of
mice who had engaged in only high-intensity exercise. However, exercise adaptation was more
significant in the soleus muscle, with an increase in SOD activity in response to exercise
duration rather than exercise intensity.</p><p>In the present study, there was a significant difference in plasma SOD activity between the
two groups (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In the control group it decreased significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05),
whereas in the exercise group it increased significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05). This result is
consistent with a previous study in which antioxidant enzyme activity increased after
exercise. This also supports the results of a previous study in which a yoga exercise
program that required minimum energy consumption was shown to increase antioxidant
capability. The results of that study indicate that yoga exercise over a period of 12 weeks
decreased plasma MDA concentration, reflecting decreased ROS levels, and increased plasma
SOD activity, reflecting reduced oxidative stress. Hatha yoga exercise offers health
benefits through improvement of flexibility, muscle tone and strength, balance, lung
capacity, and joint function. Moreover, meditation and breathing techniques inhibit ROS
generation and have a positive effect on antioxidant capacity by reducing stress hormones
and indicators of muscle damage. Our findings indicate that regular and continuous modified
Hatha yoga exercise would effectively improve body composition, decrease plasma MDA
concentration, and increase plasma SOD activity in female patients with shoulder pain.
Therefore, Hatha yoga exercise should be effective at preventing shoulder pain due to
various causes in female patients with skeletal muscle pain syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Alessio</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagerman</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Fulkerson</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Generation of reactive oxygen species after exhaustive
