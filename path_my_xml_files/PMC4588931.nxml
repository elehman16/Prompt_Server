One hundred patients (average age: 48 &#x000b1; 12.3, 61 males, 39 females) with a diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: taping and exercise (n=33), NSAIDs and exercise (n=29), or exercise only (n=38). All patients completed a two-week (four sessions) exercise program guided by a registered physiotherapist. The physiotherapist applied the kinesiology tape to the patients in the taping and exercise group who wore the tape full time for an average of 3.5 days. Patients were assessed pre and post treatment by a research assistant who was blinded to each patient&#x02019;s assigned treatment group. Patients were provided with a usage diary to record their compliance with the treatment protocol. Shoulder pain and function were assessed using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Constant Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A significant improvement in pain with arm elevation, SST, and Constant Scores was observed in all the groups: taping and exercise group (1.2&#x000b1;2.5, 1.6&#x000b1;2.2, 7.8&#x000b1;8.1, respectively; p&#x0003c;0.05), NSAIDs and exercise group (2.1&#x000b1;2.4, 1.5&#x000b1;2.7, 11.0&#x000b1;11.7; respectively; p&#x0003c;0.05), and the exercise only group (1.3&#x000b1;2.6, 1.4&#x000b1;2.2, 6.3&#x000b1;10.9, respectively; p&#x0003c;0.05). A significant improvement in activities of daily living and functional arm level was observed in the taping and exercise group (0.8&#x000b1;1.2, 1.6&#x000b1;2.2 respectively; p&#x0003c;0.05) and the NSAIDS and exercise group (1.0&#x000b1;1.6, 0.8&#x000b1;2.0 respectively; p&#x0003c;0.05). Between-group differences were not statistically significant. Although all treatment groups showed a slight trend toward increased strength, the results were not significant. Patients were more compliant with the kinesiology tape (100%) than the NSAIDS treatment regime (84%). 88.5% of participants reported on average less than 2/10 discomfort with the tape.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Kinesiology tape is as effective as NSAIDs as an adjuvant therapy to exercise at reducing shoulder pain and improving function in patients with subacromial impingement. Patients demonstrated increased compliance with the addition of kinesiology tape to an exercise program as compared to NSAIDS. Kinesiology tape appears to be well-tolerated and may prove to be a safer alternative to NSAIDs in the conservative treatment of shoulder impingement pain and dysfunction.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
