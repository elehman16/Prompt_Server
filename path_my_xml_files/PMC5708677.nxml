The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effect and the type of training task. The used tasks were based on different aspects of prosthetic handling: reaching, grasping, grip-force production and functional tasks. A single-blinded clinical trial, with a pre-posttest design was executed. Seventy-one able-bodied, right-handed participants were randomly assigned to four training and two control groups. The training groups performed a training program with an upper-limb prosthesis simulator. One control group performed a sham training (a dummy training without the prosthesis simulator) and another control group received no training at all. The training groups and sham group trained on five consecutive days. To determine the improvement in skills, a test was administered before, immediately after, and one week after the training. Training was performed with the &#x02018;unaffected&#x02019; arm; tests were performed with the &#x02018;affected&#x02019; arm, with the latter resembling the amputated limb. In this study half of the participants trained with the dominant hand, while the other half trained with the non-dominant hand. Participants executed four tests that corresponded to the different training tasks. The tests measured the reaching (movement time and symmetry ratio), grasping (opening time, duration of maximum hand opening, and closing time), grip-force production (deviation of asked grip-force) and functional (movement time) performance. Half of the participants were tested with their dominant arm and half of the participants with their non-dominant arm. Intermanual transfer effects were not found for reaching, grasping or functional tasks. However, we did find intermanual transfer effects for grip-force production tasks. Possibly, the study design contributed to the negative results due to the duration of the training sessions and test sessions. The positive results of the grip-force production might be an effect of the specificity of the training, that was totally focused on training grip-force production. When using intermanual transfer training in novice amputees, specific training should be devoted to grip-force.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>60-62300-98-119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romkema</surname><given-names>Sietske</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003142</institution-id><institution>Fonds NutsOhra</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1103-029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romkema</surname><given-names>Sietske</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Revalidatiefonds</institution></funding-source><award-id>R2011147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romkema</surname><given-names>Sietske</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>OIM Stichting</institution></funding-source><award-id>1103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romkema</surname><given-names>Sietske</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Stichting Beatrixoord</institution></funding-source><award-id>210.130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romkema</surname><given-names>Sietske</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants 60-62300-98-119 from ZonMW, (CS); 1103-029 from Fonds NutsOhra, (SR); R2011147 from Revalidatiefonds, (SR); 210.130 from Stichting Beatrixoord, (SR); and 1103 from OIM Stichting, (SR).

This finding can be used to improve prosthetic training [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Early in rehabilitation prosthetic users can start training prosthetic skills on the unaffected arm, so that the skills of the affected arm will enhance. In this way, the training can start directly after the amputation, as a result of which the handling and acceptance of the prosthesis could improve [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In three previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] we demonstrated intermanual transfer effects after a prosthetic training. Able-bodied subjects trained one arm (dominant side for half of the participants, non-dominant side for the other half), representing the &#x0201c;unaffected&#x0201d; arm, with a prosthesis simulator, a prosthesis that can be worn on a sound arm. Subsequently the other arm, representing the &#x0201c;affected&#x0201d; arm, was tested on motor skills also with the prosthesis simulator. Movement times diminished more in the training group than in a control group [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas the control of grip-force training showed no transfer effect. Recently, transfer of prosthetic skills between arms was shown for experienced myo-electric prosthesis users [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Movement times of myoelectric prosthesis users, using a prosthetic simulator on the unaffected hand, were shorter, and these users had significantly higher Box and Block Test scores and shorter duration of maximum hand opening than age-matched controls. From literature on intermanual transfer it is known that variations in the degree of transfer depend on characteristics of the training program, such as the learning condition (for example using visual feedback or not), duration of the inter-training intervals [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or the tasks that are used [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. How different task characteristics influence intermanual transfer effects in prosthetic training has not been investigated yet and was therefore the objective of the current study.</p><p>To reveal the magnitude of the intermanual transfer effect for different tasks, we first distinguished three aspects of prosthetic handling: 1) the effect of the extra weight and length of the prosthesis, which will affect reaching, 2) the coordination of the grip, that is, the opening and closing of the prosthesis hand, which should affect grasping, and 3) the accuracy of the grip-force produced during grasping objects with the prosthesis hand. In this study we examined the degree of transfer when a training focuses on each of these individual. Besides the selective training programs we also included a training program, in which all the aspects of prosthesis handling are trained. In this training program the trained tasks vary during training, which might lead to faster learning [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because the variation in tasks over time resemble daily life situations, this training program is regarded as a functional training program. The training programs therefore focused on reaching, grasping, grip-force production and functional tasks.</p><p>Due to lack of knowledge about aspects of prosthetic use, the three selected aspects were based on studies using able-bodied participants. The extra weight and length of the prosthesis simulator changes the inertia of the arm during reaching movements. Previous studies show intermanual transfer of the adaptations to the changes in inertia [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In previous studies the transfer of the coordination of grip-movements has been shown in, among others, dexterity skills [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a Pegboard task [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and prosthetic handling [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Likewise, intermanual transfer effect of control of grip-force has previously been found in precision grip lifting [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on these findings we expected to find an intermanual transfer effect on each of the aspects when used in a training program. Furthermore, the functional training group, where all aspects are combined helps in answering the question whether a variation of training tasks may help participants to learn to handle the prosthesis more proficiently than training just one aspect of prosthesis use.</p><p>In previous studies we compared a training program group with a control group that did not follow any training [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or that followed a sham training [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The sham training consisted of a dummy training without using the prosthesis simulator. For both the no-training and sham training an intermanual transfer effect was found. To examine the difference between the no-training and sham training, we included both in the current study. With this we intended to establish not only whether non-training differed from training, but also whether training needed to be specific or could be non-specific.</p><p>The aim of this study was to reveal if four different training programs, comprising reaching tasks, grasping tasks, control of grip-force tasks, and a combination of these tasks, will all result in intermanual transfer effects. We hypothesize that the (specific) training groups show larger intermanual transfer effects than the sham and no-training groups. It is generally assumed that it is hard to learn to control grip-force with a prosthesis [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], therefore intermanual transfer of a grip-force production training program is expected to give at most a small transfer effect. A functional training program, where all aspects of prosthesis tasks are included, comprises most task variability and we hypothesize that such a training program will give the most prominent transfer effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Right-handed, able-bodied participants between 18 and 40 years old were recruited and followed at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, between May 2013 and October 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188362.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The prosthetic hand had proportional speed control (15&#x02013;300 mm/s) and proportional grip-force production (0-&#x000b1;100 N). The cast extended into a splint along the forearm that could be attached using a Velcro sleeve. The prosthetic hand was controlled by changes in electrical activity related to muscle contraction. The muscle contraction was detected by two electrodes that were placed on the muscle bellies of the wrist extensors and flexors.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>OPTOTRAK</title><p>With the OPTOTRAK 3020 system (Northern Digital, Waterloo, Canada) the movements of the digits of the prosthesis hand in the reaching and grasping tests were recorded. Two infrared light emitting diodes (LED&#x02019;s) were placed on the top of the ulnar side of thumb and radial side of the index finger of the prosthesis hand. The positions of the two LED&#x02019;s were recorded from two sides above the table and were sampled with a frequency of 100 Hz. High frequency noise was removed from the data using a second order recursive Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz. The data was differentiated once to calculate the velocity and once again for the acceleration using a three point difference algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Procedure</title><p>All test and training sessions with the prosthesis simulator started with a standard procedure to fit the simulator. The electrodes were placed on the wrist extensor and flexor muscles. The maximum speed of the hand was set to the default setting of six (double channel control, fast open and slower closing). To determine the location of the electrodes and adjust the sensitivity, a MyoBoy (Myoboy; MyoBock Electrodes; Otto Bock, Duderstadt, Germany) was used. To set the sensitivity of the electrodes, the amplified signal had to be hold above a threshold of 1.5 V (high signal) for two seconds. After the simulator was fitted, the participant was positioned in front of the table with the elbow 90 degrees flexed. The participants&#x02019; position in front of the table depended on where, during the whole task, the prosthesis hand needed to grasp or hold an object. Verbal instruction on the execution of the tasks was given.</p><p>As described in the introduction we aimed to investigate three different aspects of prosthetic handling: 1) the effects of the weight of a prosthesis on reaching, 2) the coordination of opening and closing the prosthetic hand and 3) the production of the grip-force. The logic of the experiment was that the specific aspect was trained while at the same time the other aspects were restricted or kept similar as much as possible. To increase the effect of the training for the specific aspect that was trained, we systematically varied this aspect. For example, when training reaching, the hand opening and closing was turned off. Moreover, to enlarge the learning effects, the weight of the hand affecting inertia, and thus reaching control, was varied in the training sessions. Importantly, during testing both the other aspects were not restricted, and only one condition of the aspect was tested (i.e., no variation of the to be tested aspect was applied during the test).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Training and test sessions</title><p>Each training group had its own training program. The test sessions for all participants consisted of four test tasks all containing one of the training aspects (reaching, grasping, grip-force production and functional). Below, the training tasks, test tasks and specific materials are described for each of the training groups.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Reaching training program</title><p>Participants had to reach for targets that were printed on a laminated sheet (51 by 51 cm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188362.g004">Fig 4</xref>) laying at a fixed position on the table. They had to reach from the starting position in the middle to different targets numbered 1 till 8. The targets, circles with a diameter of two cm, were all positioned 25 cm from the starting position. This results in an index of difficulty (ID) of 4.6. (computed as ID = log<sub>2</sub> (2*target distance/target size; Fitts, 1954)).</p><fig id="pone.0188362.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0188362.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Sheet with reaching goals used during training.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0188362.g004"/></fig><p>An erasable marker was placed in the prosthetic hand after which the hand was turned off by the tester. The participant positioned the chair in such a way that all targets could be reached. First, the researcher called a number and after a verbal starting signal, the participant had to reach to the target and put a dot in this target using the marker. The dot gave the participant visual feedback about the result. Participants were asked to perform the movement as fast as possible to make sure that the movement was made fluently.</p><p>Using a prosthesis affects the weight of the arm, which affects the forces and torques in the muscles and joints that affect reaching control. To train the handling of the prosthesis three different conditions were applied in which the weight on the arm varied. The weight conditions were: the prosthetic simulator without extra weight, with 500 and with 1000 grams extra weight, respectively. The extra weight was placed around the wrist using Velcro. After eight trials (in all directions) the participant had a short rest. Half way the participant had a rest of two minutes.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Reaching test</title><p>During the reaching test, participants had to reach to four of the eight targets (1, 3, 5, and 7) to which they reached in the training. Each target had to be reached three times with the simulator holding the marker, without extra weight.</p><p>The reaching movements were recorded using OPTOTRAK (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">materials</xref>). Two variables regarding the reaching movements were derived and analyzed. 1) The movement time, the time used to execute the movement from the starting position till the target. 2) The symmetry ratio of the velocity profile, measured by the acceleration time divided by the movement time [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Grasping training program</title><p>Grasping was trained by letting participants catch balls that were rolling off a ramp with three different slopes (20, 26 and 32 degrees, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188362.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Five balls with different diameters (40, 45, 50, 65 and 70 mm) were used. Variation was added to the experiment by using different slopes and different ball sizes. The participants started with the prosthetic hand closed. The researcher held the ball at the top of the ramp and let it go after verbally indicating that this was going to happen. Participants were encouraged to catch the ball between the fingertips of the prosthetic hand.</p><fig id="pone.0188362.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0188362.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Ramp.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0188362.g005"/></fig><p>Since we were only interested in the grasping component of this task, the hand of the prosthesis simulator was stabilized with a wooden board with Velcro straps. In this way there was no reaching of the hand. The hand was fixed at 25 cm distance from the ramp, in such a position that the hand only had to be opened en closed to catch the ball. In this way handling the weight, or moment of inertia of the prosthesis, was not trained.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Grasping test</title><p>During the grasping tests, a ball rolling off the ramp needed to be caught with the prosthetic simulator hand, which was not fixed (i.e., reaching component was involved and thus inertia of the hand could affect movement). Participants held their hand behind a line, which was drawn 30 cm from the ramp. The grasping test was executed three times with the ramp at 20 degrees using a 70 mm ball.</p><p>OPTOTRAK was used to measure three variables during grasping: 1) The duration of the hand opening; the time it takes to open the hand, 2) the duration of maximum hand opening in the grasping profile, which was defined as the time from the end of hand opening to the start of hand closure (determined by a threshold of 3 cm/s), and 3) the duration of the hand closing; the time it took to close the hand.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Grip-force production training program</title><p>To train the control of grip-force delivered with the prosthetic hand, three tasks were used: the compressible object, the tracking and the matching task.</p><p>In the compressible object tasks, three deformable objects were used to train grip-force production [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Two different tasks were used. In the tracking task a pattern on a computer screen needed to be followed for 30 seconds by pressing the handle with the prosthetic hand. By pressing harder the line went up and by loosening grip, the line went down. The requested and performed forces were shown on the screen. The asked pattern consisted of different levels of absolute forces (ranged 5&#x02013;45 N) that varied in a blocked, sine wave or compound sine wave pattern. The course of the pattern appeared 200 ms before the participant had to produce the grip-force. The pattern started with a line of three seconds at a grip-force of ten Newton, to make sure that participants were able to position the prosthetic hand on the handle, and that all participants had the same starting position. After these first three seconds the blocked pattern started. After each trial the participant was allowed to take a break for a few seconds. For the matching task a handle was squeezed as fast as possible until the amount of grip-force (5&#x02013;45 N) shown with a cursor on the screen was reached. Both the requested and performed grip-force were shown. The grip-force needed to be hold for ten seconds.

Tasks were added as a within-subject factor for the functional (mug, jar-lid and pen case task) and reaching tests (direction 1, 2, 3 and 4). The tasks of the pretest were used as a covariate. Each training group was analyzed separately according to the above described method.</p><p>The reason that the pretest was added as a covariate was that the starting level of the different groups, e.g. the possible baseline differences, should not influence the results after the training. Effects of the covariates showed whether the results of the tasks in the pretest affected the findings.

Although a transfer effect of grip-force was shown to be possible in precision grip lifting in sound hands [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], based on the literature on prosthetic use we expected to find only minimal effects in grip-force production because this aspect of prosthesis handling is hard to learn [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, this grip-force production training is of importance in everyday life for grasping objects without dropping or breaking them. Interestingly, the change in performance over training in the training arm did not differ between groups, however, only the grip-force production training showed intermanual transfer. An important difference with previous studies that also tested grip-force production [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was that in the current study the training group followed a training that focused solely on the control of force using different types of tasks. The current results seem to suggest that a training program, in which a variety of grip-force production tasks are used, leads to intermanual transfer of the grip-force production.</p><p>No significant intermanual transfer effects in the functional test tasks were found, which is different from previous studies on prosthetic training [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also did not find transfer effects on the reaching and grasping tasks. Two aspects of the design of our study could have contributed to these results. First, the training sessions were shorter than in our previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In these previous studies, where we were able to reveal intermanual transfer effects using a functional training, participants were trained for at least 100 minutes (i.e., five sessions of 20 minutes). Due to the complexity and extent of the current study design this amount of training was not feasible; in the current study participants trained for a total time of 75 minutes. Beforehand, we regarded this training time as appropriate, because this total training time was longer than most other studies on intermanual transfer using a wide range of tasks, performed mostly with the anatomical hand, in which effects of transfer were found [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Second, next to the short training sessions, we used extensive test sessions. The duration of the pretests might be a reason that we did not find intermanual transfer effects in the current study. The pretest took more than 15 minutes, during which the participants might already have learned too much about handling the prosthesis with their &#x02018;affected hand&#x02019; so that training with the &#x02018;unaffected hand&#x02019; did not add anything to this learning. Such a learning effect may not be surprising because it is known from earlier studies [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that the highest learning curve takes place during the first trials. Even more, the test tasks were presented in blocked-random order, the best way to learn prosthetic handling [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results also show learning during the pretest, since, opposite to our previous findings, no further improvement is seen in the posttest and retention test. The lack of improvement over tests might imply that the intermanual transfer effect was too small to add significantly to the learning achieved during the pretest.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that the participants were able-bodied subjects. Due to the limited number of persons with an upper-limb amputation it was not feasible to reveal the effects of different training tasks in this target group. Individuals with an amputation will have cerebral reorganization after the amputation, though because intermanual transfer is studied limited in persons with an amputation we do not know how reorganization influences the extent of the transfer effect. Nevertheless a recent study showed that experienced prosthesis users show intermanual transfer effects from the use of the prosthesis on the affected side when using a prosthetic simulator on the unaffected side. Importantly, this study shows that the transfer between the simulator and the actual prosthesis is possible [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>When applying intermanual transfer in rehabilitation for persons with an upper-limb amputation, according to this study, grip-force production tasks seem the tasks that are most appropriate to use. Previous studies also show transfer effects of functional tasks [<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It needs to be noted that the design of this study might have made the effects of intermanual transfer in the other tasks undetectable. We encourage further research on task specific training because the effects can be important to enable early training after an amputation, with increased performance and acceptance as a result.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188362.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188362.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188362.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188362.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Johan Horst and Theo Schaaphok for their technical assistance with the simulator, and Emyl Smid and Wim Kaan for assistance with preparing the experimental equipment.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188362.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hicks</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gualtieri</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schoeder</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cognitive and motor components of bilateral transfer</article-title>. <source>American Journal of Psychology</source>. <year>1983</year>;<volume>96</volume>: <fpage>223</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>228</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0188362.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Karni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rey-Hipolito</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jezzard</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
