ray irradiation for mitigation of muscle hypertonia. [Subjects] The subjects were 20
patients with cerebrovascular disease. [Methods] Subjects were randomly allocated to an
intervention or control group. The intervention group received irradiation of the triceps
surae. Passive range of motion and passive resistive joint torque of ankle dorsiflexion
were measured before and after the intervention in knee extended and flexed positions.
[Results] In the knee extended position, the mean changes in passive range of motion were
2.70&#x000b0; and &#x02212;0.50&#x000b0; in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and the mean
changes in passive resistive joint torque were &#x02212;1.42 and &#x02212;0.26 N&#x000b7;m in the intervention and
control groups, respectively. In the knee flexed position, the mean changes in passive
range of motion were 3.70&#x000b0; and 0.70&#x000b0; in the intervention and control groups, respectively,
and the mean changes in passive resistive joint torque were &#x02212;2.38 and &#x02212;0.31 N&#x000b7;m in the
intervention and control groups, respectively. In both knee positions, the mean changes in
the two indices were greater in the intervention group than in the control group.
[Conclusion] High-intensity linear polarized near-infrared ray irradiation increases
passive range of motion and decreases passive resistive joint torque.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Infrared ray</kwd><kwd>Muscle tone</kwd><kwd>Cerebrovascular disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscle tone influences various movements, and reduction of excessive muscle tone is an
important treatment target for physical therapy. There are many therapeutic approaches for
hypertonia, and a lot of research has been conducted on this topic. Phototherapy, such as
laser therapy or linear polarized near-infrared ray (LPNR) irradiation, is one therapeutic
approach that has been shown to be effective<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The equipment required for LPNR irradiation
is a phototherapy device that emits infrared rays at deep penetrating wavelengths
(600&#x02013;1,600&#x02005;nm)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. LPNR irradiation is
commonly used in various therapeutic scenarios because of its noninvasiveness, safety, and
simplicity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The depth of penetration by emitted rays in phototherapy generally depends on the intensity
(output), and rays reach deeper regions as the intensity increases, but the burn risk also
increases. The maximum output of most LPNR irradiation therapy equipment is about
2,000&#x02005;mW<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and continuous irradiation at this intensity may cause burns. Thus,
irradiation is typically applied intermittently, with repeated irradiation lasting several
seconds followed by a rest interval<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. High-intensity LPNR (Hi-LPNR) irradiation
therapy using equipment with a maximum output of 10&#x02005;W has recently been reported<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Continuous irradiation at this output has
a very high risk of burns. The burn risk is reduced and deep penetration at the
high-intensity peak output is secured by applying pulse irradiation, which involves repeated
irradiation for several tens of milliseconds or hundreds of microseconds followed by a rest
interval<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. These high-intensity
phototherapy devices are already being used clinically, but reports on them are mainly
limited to pain relief or treatment of paralisis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We have previously reported in Japan the inhibitory effect of LPNR irradiation at an output
of 1,440&#x02005;mW on muscle tone in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The maximum output of Hi-LPNR is higher
than that of LPNR; therefore, the effect on deep tissue may also be greater. An inhibitory
effect of Hi-LPNR irradiation on muscle tone in patients with CVD is also expected, but no
study has been performed to test this. Therefore, we performed a study to clarify the effect
of Hi-LPNR irradiation on hypertonia in patients with CVD, and the findings of the study are
reported in this paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The objective and methods were explained to all patients, and written informed consent was
obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee at Honjo General Hospital
(approval number 20110907).</p><p>The study was conducted at Honjo General Hospital in Japan. The subjects were 20 patients
with CVD and hypertonia of the triceps surae muscle on the paretic side. The inclusion
criterion was a score &#x02265;1 on at least one item of the Ankle Plantar Flexors Tone Scale
(APTS)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The APTS is a plantar flexor
muscle tone evaluation index comprised of three items: stretch reflex, middle-range
resistance, and final-range resistance. Each item is evaluated on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 to 4 (Appendix 1). The stretch reflex mainly reflects neurological elements
constituting muscle tone, and middle- and final-range resistance mainly reflect
non-neurological elements of muscle tone<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion criteria were previous surgical treatment or drug
therapy for hypertonia, limited range of motion of the ankle joint on the paretic side with
a cause other than hypertonia, and the presence of pain or another factor that could
influence measurement. The same physical therapist performed all measurements. In addition,
one of the two assistants of the physical therapist helped to retain the position of the
lower limb during measurement, and they assisted with measurement.</p><p>The subjects were randomly allocated to an intervention group treated with Hi-LPNR
irradiation or a control group without irradiation (10 patients each, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the intervention and control groups</p><p>Hi-LPNR: high-intensity polarized near-infrared ray</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3817-g001"/></fig>). In the intervention group, the patients received 5-min Hi-LPNR irradiation while
side lying with the paretic side up and mild flexion of the bilateral hip and knee joints.
In the control group, the patients rested in the supine position for 5&#x02005;min.</p><p>Hi-LPNR irradiation therapy was delivered using the Super Lizer PX Type 1 (Tokyo Iken,
Tokyo, Japan). This equipment emits pulse irradiation (3-ms irradiation at 7-ms intervals)
with a maximum output of 10 W. Several probes with a changeable irradiation caliper were
available. A handheld irradiation probe with a 20-mm diameter was used in this study.
Although the maximum output is 10&#x02005;W, the output was set at 8&#x02005;W for this study, and the total
irradiation time was 5&#x02005;min. We determined the irradiation conditions after performing a
preliminary investigation and confirming that irradiation under these conditions could be
applied safely without adverse events.</p><p>Four sites on the origin side of the myotendinous junction of the triceps surae muscle on
the paretic side were irradiated. These sites were selected based on a study using LPNR
irradiation at 1,440&#x02005;mW that some of us had previously performed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which a muscle tone-inhibitory effect was noted in
this region. Each site was consecutively irradiated for 3&#x02005;s, and this procedure was repeated
for 5&#x02005;min. The tip of the irradiation probe was lightly touched to the skin and rested there
without excessive pressure. The myotendinous junction was confirmed by palpation and visual
examination.</p><p>The outcome measures were passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion (PROM) and passive
resistive joint torque of ankle dorsiflexion (PRJT), which were measured in the supine
position. For PROM, a line perpendicular to the fibula was regarded as the stationary axis,
and the 5th metatarsal bone was regarded as the migrating axis. The maximum dorsiflexion
angle was measured using a goniometer with 1&#x000b0; increments. The fibular head, lateral
malleolus, and head and base of the 5th metatarsal bone were drawn on the patient&#x02019;s skin
with a marker as indices during measurement, and dorsiflexion was slowly applied. The change
in PROM from before to after the intervention was calculated and analyzed.</p><p>PRJT was measured using a handheld dynamometer (HHD) (Power Track II, JTECH Medical, Salt
Lake City, UT, USA). The center of the sensor pad was touched to the head of the second
metatarsal bone, and the minimum force required to apply maximum passive dorsiflexion was
measured using the HHD. The force was applied to produce dorsiflexion that was as slow as
possible. The torque was calculated by multiplying the force measured by the HHD by the
distance between the lower end of the medial malleolus, which was the axis of ankle plantar
flexion, and the head of the second metatarsal bone. This value was regarded as the PRJT.
The change in PRJT torque from before to after the intervention was calculated and
analyzed.</p><p>PROM and PRJT were measured with the subjects in the supine position. The knee joint was
placed in a position of maximum extension or 90&#x000b0; flexion. The order of the knee joint
position and PROM and PRJT measurements was randomly set for each subject. Measurement was
performed immediately before and after irradiation in the intervention group, and
immediately before and after resting in the control group.</p><p>In the intervention group, the presence or absence of such as things as redness and
blisters at the irradiated site was examined by visual inspection. In addition, the subjects
were interviewed to determine if they felt an excessive sensation of heat or other
abnormalities. If redness, blisters, excessive sensation of heat, or other abnormalities
were found, Hi-LPNR irradiation was discontinued.</p><p>The age, duration of illness, and PROM and PRJT before the intervention were compared
between the two groups using the unpaired t-test; the gender distribution, paretic side, and
diagnosis were compared between the two groups using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; and the APTS
score was compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney test. The change in PROM
and PRJT from before to after the intervention was compared between the two groups using the
unpaired t-test to investigate the effect of Hi-LPNR.</p><p>In addition, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the minimal detectable change
(MDC<sub>95</sub>) was calculated. MDC<sub>95</sub> and the standard error of measurement
(SEM) necessary to calculate the MDC<sub>95</sub> were determined<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> with the equations below using test-retest data from a
control group:</p><p>SEM = (standard deviation of the difference in the value between test and retest
measurements)/&#x0221a;2</p><p>MDC<sub>95</sub>= 1.96 &#x000d7; &#x0221a;2 &#x000d7; SEM.</p><p>When the knee was extended, the MDC<sub>95</sub> in PROM was 3.36&#x000b0;, and that in PRJT was
1.44N&#x000b7;m. When the knee was flexed, the MDC<sub>95</sub> in PROM was 2.45&#x000b0;, and that in PRJT
was 1.07N&#x000b7;m. The effect of Hi-LPNR irradiation was investigated by comparing the average
change in PROM and PRJT in each group with these MDC<sub>95</sub> values. In addition, the
number of subjects in whom the change exceeded the MDC<sub>95</sub> was compared between the
two groups using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>The significance level was set at 5% in all tests. All analyses were performed using
statistical analysis software (IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 23.0&#x02005;J, IBM Japan, Tokyo,
Japan).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Subject characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

intensities (output). Hi-LPNR therapy equipment emits complex rays of 600&#x02013;1,600&#x02005;nm<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Rays with a wavelength shorter than 600&#x02005;nm are likely to be absorbed by blood hemoglobin,
and those with a wavelength longer than 1,600&#x02005;nm are likely to be absorbed by water
molecules. Accordingly, rays emitted by Hi-LPNR therapy equipment are unlikely to be
absorbed by blood (hemoglobin and water molecules) or influenced by heat dispersion through
blood flow and thus are superior in terms of heating the irradiated region. The origin of
the myotendinous tendon junction of the triceps surae muscle, which was irradiated in this
study, is present just under the skin, and Hi-LPNR may have reached the gastrocnemius and
soleus muscle. However, there have been no reports of the depth of penetration of Hi-LPNR
irradiation into the body, and the details remain to be investigated.</p><p>In general, polarized light includes linear, right-handed, and left-handed circularly
polarized light, but the effects due to the presence or absence of each type of polarized
light and the differences among the types of polarized lights have not been investigated.
The influence of differences in polarized light on skin wound healing and spinal cord injury
in animals has been reported<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, but there have
been no reports on the effect of the presence or absence of polarization and differences
among polarized lights on human muscle tone. We could not describe the effect of linearly
polarized light on muscle tone, and it remains important to clarify this in detail.</p><p>The ankle plantar flexor muscle is comprised of biarticular muscles (gastrocnemius and
plantaris muscles) and monoarticular muscles (the soleus, tibialis posterior, long fibular,
and short fibular muscles). The main muscles are the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which
account for 80% of the plantar flexion muscle force<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, hypertonia of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles
may have a marked influence on overall plantar flexor muscle tone.</p><p>The gastrocnemius originates in the medial and lateral epicondyles of the femur, and the
soleus muscle originates in the posterior tibial soleal line and fibular head. Both muscles
become the Achilles tendon and end at the calcaneal tuberosity. The gastrocnemius is a
biarticular muscle that crosses the knee and ankle joints, and the soleus muscle is a
monoarticular muscle that crosses only the ankle joint. When the knee joint is extended with
a fixed ankle joint position, the biarticular muscle is lengthened, but the monoarticular
muscle length is not changed; therefore, the tone of the plantar flexors in this position
reflects the tone of both the soleus and the gastrocnemius. On the other hand, when the knee
joint is flexed, the tone of the plantar flexors mainly reflects the tone of the
monoarticular muscle, because the biarticular muscle is relaxed.</p><p>In both knee positions, the mean changes in PROM and PRJT were greater in the intervention
group than in the control group. In addition, in the intervention group, the mean changes in
PROM and PRJT in the knee flexed position exceeded the MDC<sub>95</sub>. Furthermore, the
number of subjects with changes exceeding the MDC<sub>95</sub> was significantly greater in
the intervention group than in the control group. These findings suggest that Hi-LPNR
irradiation applied to the posterior surface of the crus improved muscle extensibility and
reduced the resistance to passive muscle stretch for the monoarticular plantar flexor
muscles, mainly the soleus muscle.</p><p>The MDC represents the marginal field for which the change between two measured values in
repeated measurement, such as test-retest, is due to measurement error, and the 95% CI of
the MDC, MDC<sub>95</sub>, is generally used<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes smaller than the MDC<sub>95</sub> could be due to
measurement error and therefore cannot be regarded as true changes<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes exceeding the MDC<sub>95</sub> can be interpreted
as true changes exceeding the error range, i.e., changes due to the effect of the
intervention.</p><p>The main factor limiting ankle dorsiflexion is limited stretch of the ankle plantar flexor
muscles, and PROM reflects the maximum stretch of the ankle plantar flexor muscles. In both
knee positions, the mean change in PROM was significantly greater in the intervention group
than in the control group. However, in the knee extended position, the mean change in PROM
was smaller than the MDC<sub>95</sub> in both groups, and there was no significant
difference in the number of subjects exceeding the MDC<sub>95</sub>. By contrast, in the
knee flexed position, the mean change in PROM exceeded the MDC<sub>95</sub> in the
intervention group, and the number of subjects exceeding the MDC<sub>95</sub> was
significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Therefore, we
suggest that the increase in PROM in the knee flexed position in the intervention group was
due to Hi-LPNR irradiation, but that the increase in PROM in the knee extended position was
due to measurement error, and we therefore suggest that Hi-LPNR irradiation increased ankle
plantar flexor muscle extensibility and increased PROM in the knee flexed position.</p><p>PRJT reflects the resistance to maximum passive muscle stretch. In both knee positions, the
mean change in PRJT was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control
group. The mean change was greater than the MDC<sub>95</sub> in the knee flexed position in
the intervention group but smaller than the MDC<sub>95</sub> in both knee positions in the
control group, and the number of subjects with changes exceeding the MDC<sub>95</sub> in the
knee flexed position was greater in the intervention group than in the control group. These
results suggest that Hi-LPNR irradiation increased ankle plantar flexor muscle extensibility
and reduced resistance to maximum passive muscle stretch in the knee flexed position,
decreasing PRJT.</p><p>Muscle tone involves a non-neural component that is based on the flexibility of fibrous
tissue, such as muscle fibers and fascia, and a neural component that is based on reflex
muscle contraction, such as the stretch reflex. In disorders of upper motor neurons,
including CVD, the stretch reflex is enhanced due to impairment of the descending inhibitory
system associated with central nervous system abnormality. Spasticity occurs due to an
exaggerated stretch reflex resulting from upper motor neuron lesions and is considered
velocity-dependent muscle hypertonia<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When spasticity persists for a prolonged time without appropriate treatment, the frequency
of muscle stretch decreases, and this leads to reduction of muscle fiber and fascial
flexibility, which are non-neural components of muscle tone. The threshold of muscle
spindles decreases with decreases in the non-neural component of muscle tone, thus
increasing the stimulation of muscle spindles and enhancing the stretch reflex, leading to a
vicious cycle of hypertonia. The neural and non-neural components of muscle tone are
therefore different but closely associated with each other. In this study, PROM and PRJT
were measured while the ankle plantar flexor muscles were slowly stretched. Thus, these
measures may have captured mainly the non-neural component of muscle tone, but they would
also have been influenced by the neural component if reflex muscle contraction occurred
during measurement (i.e., during passive stretch). Therefore, PROM and PRJT were measured in
the presence of both components of muscle tone. It is difficult to measure the muscle tone
while strictly separating the neural and non-neural components in the procedure, and this is
a limitation of this study.</p><p>As a muscle is heated, there is a reduction of stretch receptivity of muscle spindles and
inhibition of muscle tone (Ib inhibition) caused by an increase in Golgi tendon organ
activation-induced discharge by Ib fibers<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, suggesting that Hi-LPNR irradiation may reduce the stretch
receptivity of muscle spindles and subsequently reduce the excitation of the secondary
terminals, thus inhibiting the neural component of muscle tone. Heat stimulation also
increases extensibility of muscle fibers and fascia<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been suggested that heat increases the flexibility of
collagen in fasciae and tendons and the extensibility of muscle fibers, thus improving the
non-neural component of muscle tone.</p><p>We acknowledge that this study had some limitations. The rater performing the measurements
of PROM and PRJT and the Hi-LPNR irradiation was not blind to group allocation. In addition,
the present study only included 20 subjects, and in the future, it will be necessary to
increase the number of subjects. In conclusion, there was a significant difference in the
changes in PROM and PRJT between the intervention and control group. PROM in a flexed knee
position and PRJT in both a flexed and extended knee position changed more than the
MDC<sub>95</sub> in the intervention group. In conclusion, Hi-LPNR irradiation has an
inhibitory effect on muscle tone in patients with CVD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from the Japan
