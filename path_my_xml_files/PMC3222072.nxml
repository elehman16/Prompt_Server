In critically ill patients the ideal glycaemic range is uncertain, but is likely to be &#x02264; 10 mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. When compared to critically ill patients with so-called 'stress hyperglycaemia' those with known diabetes are at greater risk of complications from hypoglycaemia, yet appear to be less vulnerable to the toxicity of hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients with known diabetes are complex, but include relative insulin insufficiency, insulin resistance and hyperglucagonaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells in response to intestinal nutrient, has the capacity to lower blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In ambulant type-2 diabetics, exogenous GLP-1 decreases blood glucose via stimulation of insulin and suppression of glucagon secretion, as well as slowing of gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As the effects of GLP-1 on insulin and glucagon are glucose-dependent the risk of hypoglycaemia with its administration is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In ambulant type-2 diabetics the GLP-1 analogue, exenatide, has been reported to achieve comparable reductions in glycated haemoglobin, but with less hypoglycaemia and a reduction in glycaemic variability when compared to insulin glargine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For the above reasons GLP-1 is a potentially attractive therapeutic option for the management of hyperglycaemia in the substantial number of critically ill patients with pre-existing type-2 diabetes. This concept has been strengthened by our recent reports that acute administration of GLP-1 markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrients in critically ill patients with stress-hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an acute, exogenous GLP-1 infusion (1.2 pmol/kg/minute) on the glycaemic response to a postpyloric nutrient infusion in critically ill patients with known type-2 diabetes. Secondary aims were to explore mechanism(s) underlying glucose-lowering if demonstrated, and to determine whether glycaemic excursions could be limited to &#x0003c; 10 mmol/l with GLP-1 administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Critically ill adult patients known to have pre-existing type-2 diabetes that were admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit between Jan 2009 and May 2010 were studied.

This effect is attributable, at least in part, to relative insulin stimulation. While the study establishes that GLP-1 has the capacity to reduce glycaemia in this group, during GLP-1 infusion glycaemic excursions were limited to &#x0003c; 10 mmol/l in approximately 50% of patients. There was evidence that the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 was glucose-dependent (that is, the greater the glucose concentrations during placebo, the greater the reduction in glucose during GLP-1). Small intestinal nutrient did not suppress glucagon in critically ill patients with type-2 diabetes during either placebo or GLP-1 infusion.</p><p>The dose of GLP-1 was selected based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In ambulant type-2 diabetics, GLP-1 at higher doses (2.4 pmol/kg/minute) has a greater glucose-lowering effect, but is also associated with increased adverse effects, particularly nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such adverse effects may, potentially, be less common in sedated patient receiving small intestinal feeding, as opposed to nutrient administered orally to alert subjects. In view of our observations the effects of GLP-1 (or its analogues) at greater doses and/or in combination with insulin merit evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The feeding regimen was also based on our previous study in which nutrient was administered via a postpyloric tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Slowing of gastric emptying contributes to the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous GLP-1 in health, type-2 diabetics, and critically ill patients following an intragastric 'meal' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, the magnitude of the reduction in blood glucose is anticipated to be greater during intragastric feeding, particularly in those patients in whom gastric emptying is relatively normal. The rate of small intestinal nutrient infusion (1 kcal/minute) is less than optimal for maintaining nutritional requirement in this group. However, based our previous observations in non-diabetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], administering more calories increased the likelihood of unacceptable hyperglycaemia during placebo. While gastric emptying is frequently delayed in the critically ill, often markedly, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the rate of gastric emptying of nutrients in this group may approximate 1 kcal/minute, in health the rate is usually 1 to 4 kcal/minute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As the relationship between glycaemia and the rate of carbohydrate entry into the small intestine is non-linear in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it is likely that a small intestinal feeding rate or gastric emptying &#x0003e; 1 kcal/minute will lead to greater glycaemic excursions than observed in the current study. Other limitations of this study should be recognised. No reduction in fasting glycaemia was observed, probably reflecting the short duration of fasting and GLP-1 infusion (30 minutes) and the small cohort. Meier and colleagues have reported that fasting glycaemia is reduced by GLP-1 in type-2 diabetics following major surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and, in this study, pharmacological concentrations may not have reached steady state until a significant proportion of the fasting period had elapsed. The study was ceased prematurely in one patient receiving GLP-1 as the blood glucose was &#x0003e; 15 mmol/l and in three patients during placebo. When this occurred data were estimated using the last observation carried forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As the missing data occurred more frequently during placebo, and this approach is likely to underestimate the magnitude of the glycaemic excursion that would have eventuated, any bias would likely to be in favour of the null hypothesis. Given the outcome of studies relating to the effects of GLP-1 in ambulant type-2 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] it is perhaps surprising that GLP-1 did not normalise blood glucose. This may be because the cohort comprised patients who were acutely ill - all patients required mechanical ventilation (11/11), the majority had a high APACHE II scores, approximately 50% (6/11) had kidney failure, and approximately 30% (3/11) were receiving vasoactive drugs during the study. The maximal, or near-maximal, endogenous counter-regulatory hormonal response and administration of exogenous catecholamines are likely to affect glucose tolerance adversely and, may, attenuate the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1. Many patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit have less severe illnesses than those studied, and the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 may, potentially, be greater in this group. It would be useful to be able to predict 'GLP-1 responders'. Nauck and colleagues have suggested that glucose-lowering induced by GLP-1 is diminished in hospitalised patients receiving IV nutrition that presented with acute pancreatitis, or had elevated triglyceride concentrations or higher glycated haemoglobin at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is also likely that genetic variation will determine response to GLP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We were unable to determine which factors predicted glucose-lowering in this small sample.</p><p>The mechanism(s) underlying the glucose-lowering that occurs with GLP-1 in the critically ill are poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and this issue represented a secondary aim of this study. Serum insulin was increased markedly by GLP-1, but the insulinotropic effect may have been underestimated as the time between ceasing exogenous insulin and starting the study drug was only two hours which may have been insufficient for complete clearance of exogenous insulin. This time period was chosen to minimise the possibility of blood glucose concentrations &#x0003e; 10 mmol/l prior to commencement of the study drug. C-peptide, which is secreted in eqimolar concentrations to insulin, was unaffected. However, approximately 50% of the subjects had kidney failure, and metabolism of C-peptide is impaired to a greater degree in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. GLP-1 reduces fasting glucagon concentrations in health, ambulant type-2 diabetics, and critically ill patients with stress-hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] - and a reduction in glucagon was anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but GLP-1 had no effect on &#x00394;<sub>glucagon </sub>in this study. While this may suggest that hyperglucagonaemia in the critically ill diabetic patients is, relatively, resistant to suppression by GLP-1, the substantial heterogeneity of the cohort studied - in terms of pre-morbid conditions such as weight, insulin resistance and glucose control (glycated haemoglobin), as well as type and severity of acute illness - may have confounded interpretation, particularly as the sample size was relatively small. Loss of postprandial glucagon suppression is characteristic of type-2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To our knowledge this is the first report that glucagon secretion is similarly unaffected by enteral nutrient in type-2 diabetes who are critically ill. The lack of any effect of GLP-1 on 'postprandial' glucagon is, however, surprising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) contribute to insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and exogenous GLP-1 has been shown to have the capacity to attenuate the postprandial increase in NEFA in other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study GLP-1 had no apparent effect on lipidaemia, but, the small intestinal nutrient infusion did not increase NEFA during placebo. Accordingly, the lack of effect on NEFA may reflect the rate of caloric delivery (1 kcal/minute) and increasing caloric load could alter this result. It should also be noted that glycaemia itself is a potent modulator of islet cell function and by not using a glycaemic clamp we may have underestimated mechanisms underlying glucose-lowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other mediators that were not measured may also have contributed to the glycaemic effect. For example, in obese subjects the so-called 'inactive' GLP-1 metabolite (GLP-1(9-36)-NH<sub>2</sub>) has been reported to markedly ameliorate hepatic glucose production independent of its effects on islet cells, but concentrations of the metabolite were not measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study establishes that exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrient in critically ill patients with type-2 diabetes. However, glycaemia was maintained at &#x0003c; 10 mmol/l in only approximately 50% of patients. Accordingly, the use of GLP-1 as a single agent is unlikely to be an effective treatment unless increased dose(s) have a greater effect and/or glucose-lowering is markedly greater during intragastric feeding. If this proves not to be the case future studies should, arguably, focus on critically ill patients with 'stress hyperglycaemia' rather than those with pre-existing type-2 diabetes. The effect of GLP-1 in other patient groups who are less unwell (such as high dependency care units or on discharge to general wards) also warrants evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) decreases blood glucose via stimulation of insulin, and suppression of glucagon secretion, as well as slowing of gastric emptying.</p><p>&#x02022; The effects of GLP-1 on insulin and glucagon are glucose-dependent, therefore, the risk of hypoglycaemia with its administration is low.</p><p>&#x02022; In this study exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrient in critically ill patients with type-2 diabetes.</p><p>&#x02022; However, the use of GLP-1 (at 1.2 pmol/kg/minute) maintained glycaemia at &#x0003c; 10 mmol/l in only approximately 50% of patients with pre-existing type-2 diabetes.</p><p>&#x02022; Further study with an increased dose, administration during intragastric feeding, and/or administration with insulin warrants evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APACHE: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; AUC: areas under curve; BMI: body mass index; GLP-1: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1; INR: international normalised ratio; IV: Intravenous; NEFA: non-esterified fatty acid</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AMD was the co-contributor to study design, the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data and drafting the manuscript.
