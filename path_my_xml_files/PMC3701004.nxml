Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) is an advanced Diffusion Tensor Image (DTI) analysis technique that is sensitive to the effects of prematurity and may provide a quantitative marker for neuroprotection following perinatal brain injury or preterm birth. Here, we test the sensitivity of TBSS to detect diffuse microstructural differences in the developing white matter of preterm infants at term-equivalent age by modelling a &#x02018;treatment&#x02019; effect as a global increase in fractional anisotropy (FA). As proof of concept we compare these simulations to a real effect of increasing age at scan. 3-Tesla, 15-direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired from 90 preterm infants at term-equivalent age. Datasets were randomly assigned to &#x02018;treated&#x02019; or &#x02018;untreated&#x02019; groups of increasing size and voxel-wise increases in FA were used to simulate global treatment effects of increasing magnitude in all &#x02018;treated&#x02019; maps. &#x02018;Treated&#x02019; and &#x02018;untreated&#x02019; FA maps were compared using TBSS. Predictions from simulated data were then compared to exemplar TBSS group comparisons based on increasing postmenstrual age at scan. TBSS proved sensitive to global differences in FA within a clinically relevant range, even in relatively small group sizes, and simulated data were shown to predict well a true biological effect of increasing age on white matter development. These data confirm that TBSS is a sensitive tool for detecting global group-wise differences in FA in this population.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, and at Imperial College London.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used extensively to study the developing brain, providing high-resolution images of the soft cerebral tissue without exposure to ionising radiation. Quantitative MR techniques have revealed that subtle, diffuse disturbances in the developing white matter may reflect early brain injury <xref rid="pone.0067706-Counsell2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and regional tissue loss, primarily in the cortical and subcortical grey matter, appears to accompany preterm white matter injury <xref rid="pone.0067706-Inder1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067706-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Converging evidence suggests that these changes predict neurocognitive and neuromotor abilities in early childhood and occur during a window of critical vulnerability in the neonatal period <xref rid="pone.0067706-Volpe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067706-Rathbone1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>With increasing understanding of the biological pathways underlying preterm brain injury, early neuroprotective strategies for the preterm infant have been proposed and clinical trials undertaken with some success <xref rid="pone.0067706-Bierer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067706-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, due to the relative time between treatment and clinical endpoint in such trials, they are limited in the speed and efficiency at which novel interventions can be evaluated. Without early markers of outcome, establishing surrogate biomarkers that are sensitive to preterm brain injury and predictive of future outcome is a pressing need for these children and essential for the planning and implementation of future clinical trials.</p><p>Neuroimaging is increasingly being employed to support biological and clinical research and for the discovery of potential biomarkers. We have previously shown that TBSS <xref rid="pone.0067706-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, a whole-brain DTI analysis technique, is sensitive to the effects of preterm birth, predictive of neurodevelopmental outcome and can be used as a powerful biomarker for neuroprotection in small groups of neonates with severe brain injury <xref rid="pone.0067706-VanKooij1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Anjari1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067706-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. TBSS may therefore represent a method for assessing the efficacy of future treatments strategies in preterm neonates in early phase trials, without the need to recruit large numbers of subjects or rely on long-term behavioural or functional follow-up assessments as clinical endpoints.</p><p>It is not clear how sensitive TBSS is to the subtle and diffuse alterations in the developing white matter that are known to predict functional outcome in preterm populations, particularly when sample sizes or effect sizes are relatively small. Previous studies have estimated that diffuse white matter injury in preterm infants can be associated with decreases in tissue anisotropy of up to 30% by term-equivalent age compared to healthy, term-born controls <xref rid="pone.0067706-Anjari1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Skiold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This suggests that an equivalent increase in a preterm population could predicate a clinically relevant recovery of function. Here, we model global, diffuse increases in fractional anisotropy (FA) of increasing size to test the ability of TBSS to detect such changes in the neonatal preterm brain. As proof of concept we compare these simulations to a true biological effect of increasing postmenstrual age at scan on white matter development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Ethical permission for this study was granted by the Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte&#x02019;s and Chelsea (QCCH) Research Ethics Committee.

We demonstrate that the simulated data can be used to estimate the sensitivity of TBSS to a biological effect of increasing age at scan on white matter development. These data indicate that using TBSS as a biomarker may allow early trials of potential neuroprotective strategies to measure outcome earlier in development and with fewer subjects. The data also provides a guide to estimate the sensitivity of TBSS for future study design in this population.</p><p>With the poor prognosis of many preterm infants in later life, much attention is focused on developing neuroprotective strategies to target the early neural substrates of neurodevelopmental deficits commonly seen in this population <xref rid="pone.0067706-Limperopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Maitre1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In recent years, it has been shown that up to 75% of preterm infants display diffuse alterations in the developing white matter by term-equivalent age <xref rid="pone.0067706-Dyet1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, alterations that have been quantified as changes to tissue microstructure that, in part, predict poor neurodevelopment <xref rid="pone.0067706-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-VanKooij1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Counsell2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Huppi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Tusor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Computational MR analysis has already proven powerful in investigating the efficacy of potential therapeutic strategies in neonates <xref rid="pone.0067706-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and with the increasing availability of advanced imaging in the clinical setting, robust, objective and powerful image analysis techniques such as TBSS have the potential to aid clinical decisions and provide early biomarkers for future trials.</p><p>To demonstrate the potential sensitivity of TBSS in such trials, we simulated a systemic treatment effect by increasing FA across the whole brain by between 1 and 20%. The global pattern and treatment levels were selected to reflect the potential improvement putative neuroprotectants could provide and is in line with the magnitude and pattern of microstructural alterations previously observed in this population. We have previously shown with TBSS that prematurity at birth is associated with a global reduction of white matter FA at term-equivalent age <xref rid="pone.0067706-Ball2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These observations are consistent with region-of-interest studies that demonstrate reductions in FA of similar magnitudes across several white matter regions <xref rid="pone.0067706-Skiold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although few published trials of early interventions for preterm children using MRI to assess early brain development exist, systemic administration of neuroprotective agents such as melatonin in experimental models of preterm brain injury results in reduced white matter damage in several white matter structures including the corpus callosum, cingulate, external capsule and throughout the periventricular white matter <xref rid="pone.0067706-Welin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Olivier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, we have shown that hypothermic treatment of neonatal brain injury results in global increases in FA that are predictive of favourable outcome in early childhood <xref rid="pone.0067706-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Tusor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and two non-pharmacaological, randomized controlled trials that aimed to improve outcome in preterm infants by reducing stressful experiences during treatment in the NICU, found improvements in diffusion measures across several white matter regions-of-interest in the range of 5&#x02013;15% <xref rid="pone.0067706-Als1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Milgrom1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>In terms of the magnitude of treatment effects, using TBSS in term-born infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, it was demonstrated that moderate hypothermia induced a mean (&#x000b1; S.D.) increase in FA of 31.3 (&#x000b1;7.8)% across the white matter <xref rid="pone.0067706-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the absence of focal cerebral lesions, treatment effects in the majority of preterm infants are not likely to be as dramatic. However, early alterations in developmental care can result in increases in FA of around 15% that are associated with improved behavioural function in infancy and neurodevelopment in childhood <xref rid="pone.0067706-Als1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-McAnulty1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that chronic lung disease, already shown to be independently associated with developmental outcome in preterm infants <xref rid="pone.0067706-Short1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, is associated with a 6.4% decrease in FA across the majority of the FA skeleton <xref rid="pone.0067706-Ball2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Respiratory morbidity is an example of a potentially modifiable risk factor in this population that results in widespread decreases in the microstructural integrity of developing white matter, treatment of which may result in changes approximate to those modeled in this study. We propose that these data demonstrate the potential of TBSS in evaluating the short-term impact of putative neuroprotectants in future early-phase clinical trials.</p><p>These data could represent a guide to those planning a similar study in neonatal populations; however some limitations must be considered. Firstly, despite recent advances in the field, few software tools exist for power calculation in neuroimaging studies <xref rid="pone.0067706-Mumford1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Traditional power analysis techniques are not directly applicable to neuroimaging due to the complex nature of the data. Those techniques that do exist are designed for functional MRI (fMRI) analysis and depend on either <italic>a priori</italic> region-of-interest selection that doesn&#x02019;t account for multiple comparisons between correlated voxels <xref rid="pone.0067706-Mumford1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, or assumptions based on random field theory that are violated by TBSS and its use of non-parametric statistics to determine significance <xref rid="pone.0067706-Joyce1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067706-Smith3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Although we are unable to provide a true power analysis, the work presented here is analogous to earlier attempts at defining power empirically in fMRI analysis <xref rid="pone.0067706-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, where groups of individual voxelwise activation maps obtained from fMRI were subsampled and repermuted and power defined as the % overlap between the resulting group maps and a gold standard (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067706-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Further it is unlikely that a real course of treatment would result in a response of equal magnitude in every individual. To explore this issue, we simulated a range of treatment effects at each level and demonstrated that the sensitivity of TBSS to detect global changes in FA is relatively stable across a range of treatment levels. Although this simulation better approximates the variation in treatment response that could be expected in a clinical trial, our relatively simple model of global change in FA does not account for possible regional variation in treatment response or non-linear treatment effects. Future work could further extend this framework to include a range of treatment levels and patterns based on earlier experimental pharmacokinetic or dose-ranging studies on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>We observed a false positive rate of 10%, in terms of significant differences detected between unmodified FA maps. This has some implication for the treatment analysis, and other TBSS analyses in that a number of significant regional &#x02018;effects&#x02019; were detected in groups after a relatively small global increase in FA. This suggests that TBSS is highly sensitive to group composition, particularly in small group sizes when only supra-threshold voxels are considered as a measure of significance. Therefore, when a significant regional effect is observed between two relatively small groups without due cause, the possibility that it underlies a more global effect that the study is underpowered to detect should be considered. Note that this is likely to be true for all voxel-based, whole-brain analyses.</p><p>Finally, artificial noise was not added to the simulated treatment effects on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The inclusion of an arbitrary amount of Rician-distributed noise is often necessary when performing diagnostic tests with fully simulated MR data in an attempt to replicate the characteristics of a true MRI dataset <xref rid="pone.0067706-VanHecke1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In this study, treatment effects were based on a voxelwise increase of FA in MR datasets acquired <italic>in vivo</italic>, hence a realistic amount of noise was already present within the images tested, although noise characteristics can differ according to MR scanner and acquisition protocol.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, TBSS represents whole-brain, observer-independent DTI analysis methods shown to be sensitive to global increases in FA in a neonatal population. In addition, simulated DTI data can be used to estimate the sensitivity of TBSS to real biological effects. This suggests that TBSS represents a powerful tool in the search for early biomarkers of cerebral development, neurodevelopment outcome and neuroprotection in this vulnerable population.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0067706-Marlow1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
