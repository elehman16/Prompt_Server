The aim of this study was to compare the histologic and histomorphometric aspects of bone particulated allografts, Cenobone and ITB-MBA, in the reconstruction of vertical alveolar ridge after maxillary sinus augmentation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This clinical trial was performed among 20 patients. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of 10 participants. The first group received Cenobone and the second group received ITB-MBA. Tissue samples were prepared 6 months later at the time of implant installation and after successful maxillary sinus floor augmentation. Tissue sections were examined under a light microscope. The data were analyzed by Chi-square and <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean trabecular thickness of the samples in the Cenobone group was 13.61 &#x000b1; 7.47 &#x003bc;m compared to 13.73 &#x000b1; 7.37 &#x003bc;m in the ITB-MBA group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.93). A mild inflammation process (Grade 1) was detected in both the groups. The amount of remaining biomaterial in the Cenobone group was estimated to be 8 &#x000b1; 19% vs. 7 &#x000b1; 12% in the ITB-MBA group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.30). Bone formation was reported 49.71% in the Cenobone group vs. 40.76% in the ITB-MBA group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.68).

Br&#x000e5;nemark <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] were the first to describe bone to implant contact called osseointegration. Albrektsson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] defined the term direct contact between living bone and implant at the light microscope level. Supporting alveolar ridge minimizes the reduction process of the remaining ridge upon tooth extraction and determines maximum function of the prosthesis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Bone preservation not only supports fixed and removable prostheses but also ensures proper and successful osteointegration of implanted prostheses.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Changes in alveolar ridge dimensions results in difficulties in the placement of a conventional bridge or implant prostheses, and in cases of serious degeneration, implant placement will face problems and requires complex treatment such as bone graft procedures, which increases the cost of treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Autogenous bone graft has been considered the gold standard for bone graft applications for a long time. In recent decades, research on bone substitutes has increased due to lack of autograft bone in some patients, need for additional surgery procedure on graft donor, and limitation of available bone amount.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The ideal bone grafting material should have both osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties and should also be able to osseointegrate to the implant surface. These properties vary in different bone grafting materials.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Osteoinduction is defined as primitive, undifferentiated, and pluripotent cells that are stimulated by inductive means in order to induce bone-forming cells and osteogenesis process. Osteoconduction is defined as the bone growth on a surface which is called as an osteoconductive surface allowing the osteogenesis process on itself, down into the pores.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Allografts are bone tissues that are derived from the same species and are treated with various techniques, e.g., freeze dried or exposed to radiation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is expected that the grafting materials that are utilized in floor augmentation could provide the bone formation process by replacing the bone materials due to capillary infiltration and supporting the implants.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The most frequently used allograft are known as freeze-dried bone-allogeneic grafts (FDBA) and Decalcified freeze-dried bone allogeneic (DFDBA), the latter includes more osteogenic potential due to target bone morphogenic protein graft.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Previous researches have been performed regarding the benefits of bone allografts for the reconstruction of alveolar ridge, which have proved to have positive results, although they are mostly limited to animal models.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Cenobone is a biocompatible bioimplant with allograft origin. This bioimplant maintains the extracellular matrix, which acts as a scaffold and causes the accumulation of fibroblasts and blood vessels. In a study, the biocompatibility of Cenobone was investigated as graft material, which showed positive results.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>A preliminary study by Amouian indicated that the use of Cenobone can stimulate bone formation with a notable increase in the clinical width at 2 and 5 millimeter of alveolar crest for implant placement.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Rokn <italic>et al</italic>. reported no statistically significant differences in bone generation among ITB, CenoBone, and Grafton, and concluded that allografts manufactured in Iran can be suitable alternatives to Grafton with similar good properties.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the histological and histomorphometric aspects of bone particulated allograft (Cenobone) use versus ITB-MBA allograft in the reconstruction of vertical alveolar ridge after maxillary sinus augmentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this semi-experimental clinical trial, 20 patients were enrolled and treated between 2012 and 2013; 20 males and females (mean age: 49 &#x000b1; 4.32 years) were enrolled in this study after taking medical history and performing dental examinations, which included standard radiographs at the department of periodontology in Babol University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Based on the formula: <inline-graphic xlink:href="JISPCD-6-480-g001.jpg"/> with confidence interval of 95% and power of 80%, and based on the previous study, the number of samples was calculated to be 10.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Babol University of Medical Sciences.

The sinus lift technique was performed after applying local anesthesia using 2% xylocaine with 1:80000 adrenaline (Darupakhsh, Tehran, Iran); the flap was prepared by a horizontal dissection in alveolar crest using a no. 15 scalpel such that it was shifted approximately 2 mm to the palatal side. Then, two vertical dissections were made in the mesial and distal area. Thereafter, the full thickness flap was pushed upward by a Prichard periosteal flap elevator by a blunt dissection method, such that the sinus area and a bone window were fully available. Using a round burr, a window was made in the wall of the maxillary sinus, and the sinus membrane was then released and elevated and the collagen membrane (ITB) (Iranian Tissue Bank Research and Preparation Center, Tehran) was placed under the sinus membrane. Then, the sinus was partially filled with Cenobone (Tissue Regeneration Co., Kish, Iran) in one group and with ITB-MBA (Tehran University, Iran) in another group, which are two types of mineralized allograft bone powders (1000&#x02013;2000 &#x003bc;m).

Sarkarat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] compared Cenobone and OSSEO+ and reported that both types of allografts showed relatively similar effects in maintaining the height and width of the alveolar ridge. This result confirms our results that Cenobone stimulates bone formation. It has been proven that utilization of allogeneic graft materials can substitute autografts in the surgical treatment of bone reconstructive surgery. Harvesting autograft bone can cause additional and unwanted trauma to the patients, and using allografts can be a suitable alternative link that has the same healing effects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a histologic analysis by Stentz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using demineralized FDBA plus barrier membrane therapy, the authors indicated that, in large size defects, this combination treatment modality could obtain optimum osseointegration. In contrast, De Vicente <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that the implants and bone defects around them were filled with FDBA showing similar BIC to the implants that their defects had just covered with collagen membranes. These differences may be related to the origin and methods of preparation of FDBA, and if the preparation methods were the same in different bone banks, this would be due to individual donors&#x02019; ages and gender, disease and injury, medical treatment, or genetic variability. In addition, shape and size differences of FDBA particles could affect the inductive ability. On the other hand, the time difference between death and bone extraction may negatively alter the bone inductive ability. Surface roughness of the implant is another factor that may have an impact on the phenotypic expression characteristics of cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, adding FDBA can have advantages over membrane, which is currently a matter of controversy. In the present study, bone formation was measured to be 49.71% in the Cenobone group vs. 40.76% in the ITB-MBA group, which was not a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.68). Results from previous studies reported bone volumes between 20% and 37% after 5&#x02013;8 months of healing.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In a similar study Hakimi investigated the osteoconductive potential of bovine-derived porous hydroxyapatite plus demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft in the maxillary sinus engraftment, the author reported that the amount of new bone formation was measured to be 5.36% (after six months) and 43.68% (after twelve months). They concluded that histomorphometric and histologic evaluation may play determinant roles in the evaluation future implant site status.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Strietzel[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] compared the tissue composition of augmented sites after the use of a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (ncHA) bone substitution material and after a 2-year follow up; in a bone core histomorphometric study, he found that the mean percentage area of bone colonizing the defect was 52.3%. He also reported that the amount of percentage area of the ncHA decreased from the peripheral (23.4%) to the central zones (15.1%), however, the differences were not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.262). It appears that the application of allografts has a significant induction on bone formation effect. However, it has been documented that repeated trauma to the implant or the neighboring surface in the process of healing could negatively affect the survival of the implant.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Lumetti <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that, if the implant is installed after 6 months of bone healing, the degree of osseointegration is increased; most implant failures occurred during the healing period and the second stage surgery.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In our study, volumetric assessment of bone volume, such as trabecular thickness, did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, trabecular thickness in patients with ITB-MBA bioimplant was higher than the Cenobone group. The better efficacy of ITB-MBA may be associated with higher osteoconductivity than Cenobone. However, Cenobone showed effective osteoconductivity in some studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>This study demonstrates that the use of Cenobone and ITB-MBA as a graft material for sinus floor augmentation resulted in bone mass gain in both the groups. Although the graft materials were biocompatible, both materials were not completely resorbed after 6 months, and the remains were integrated into the bone.</p><p>Of the study limitation were difficulties in case selection, impossibility of follow-up of more than 6 months, and uncooperative patients. According to the results obtained from our study, we recommend using allografts in alveolar ridge restoration in order to improve clinical outcomes of implant treatment. More large-scale studies designed as randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials with larger study population and long-term follow up are needed to improve evidence on the survival and success rate.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by the research deputy, Babol University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank the administrative and secretarial staff of the Department of Periodontology, Dental Faculty, Babol University of Medical Sciences for their contribution.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avila-Ortiz</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Elangovan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanchette</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>2014</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>950</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24966231</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>YN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alveolar ridge preservation prior to implant placement with surgical-grade calcium sulfate and platelet-rich plasma: A pilot study in a canine model</article-title><source>Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants</source><year>2007</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>656</fpage><lpage>65</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17929529</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alveolar ridge preservation during and after surgical tooth removal.
