Children are special in this regard because in them, it is a very complex phenomenon. It is very difficult to differentiate restlessness or crying due to pain from that of hunger or fear in children. Caudal analgesia is the most useful and popular pediatric regional block used today. It is one of the regional anesthetic techniques frequently used for operations below the diaphragm in children. The main disadvantage of caudal anesthesia is the short duration of action after a single injection of local anesthetic solution. Even long-acting local anesthetic drug such as bupivacaine provides only 4&#x02013;8 h of analgesia. The use of caudal catheter to administer repeated doses of infusion of local anesthetic solution is not popular, partly because of concerns about infections. Ketamine is an anesthetic and analgesic agent with a wide range of applications in pediatric anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, epidurally administered ketamine exerts profound analgesic actions at spinal cord level without exerting any systemic side effects. Hence, addition of ketamine (preservative free drug which is safe for epidural administrations) to caudal bupivacaine has been shown to prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing orchidopexy and inguinal herniotomy.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are few studies in which an attempt was made to determine the optimal dose of ketamine for caudal epidural blockade in children. Semple <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] concluded that the optimum dose of ketamine for caudal epidural blockade is 0.5 mg/kg. Hence, this study was designed to compare the efficacy of caudal block with bupivacaine and mixture of bupivacaine with ketamine for postoperative analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing surgery below the level of the umbilicus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Local Ethical Committee and parental consent, 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and ASA II children between 1 and 10 years of age, who were undergoing surgery of the urogenital region (herniotomy, orchidopexy, and urethroplasty), were included in the present study. The children having allergy or sensitivity to bupivacaine and ketamine or having any contraindication to caudal injection, i.e., infection at the site, bleeding disorder, and caudal vertebral anomalies, etc., were excluded from the study. In this randomized trial, patients were randomly allocated to either Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 30) where bupivacaine was used or Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 30) where bupivacaine and ketamine were used by drawing slips from a sealed envelope before induction of anesthesia.</p><p>

</p><p>The parents were instructed to keep the children nil orally up to 6 h before surgery, and clear fluid orally was allowed only up to 3 h before surgery. General anesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5&#x02013;6 mg/kg via a 22&#x02013;24 gauze intravenous (IV) cannula in a dorsal vein on hand or by inhalational induction with N<sub>2</sub>O, oxygen, and halothane according to age and preference. Before surgery, every child received caudal injection according to its allocated groups. The surgery was allowed to perform, and anesthesia was maintained with N<sub>2</sub>O, oxygen, halothane, and muscle relaxant through either Bain coaxial system or Jackson-Rees modification of Ayre's T-piece. Routine monitoring of each and every child included precordial stethoscope, electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> through pulse oximeter, and temperature. After surgery, the children were transferred to recovery ward and were observed up to 1 h in recovery ward and then in postoperative ward for 24 h, and observations were recorded at 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. In postoperative ward, anesthetist on duty, the person who was blinded to analgesic technique observed the patient for the following parameters.</p><p>Duration of analgesia was recorded by objective pain scale (OPS) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] to equate pain and discomfort in young children with changes in standardized behavioral and physiological parameters.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Each criterion scores from 0 to 2 to give a total score of 0&#x02013;10. Duration of analgesia was defined as the time between caudal injection of the drug and first administration of postoperative analgesia. End of adequate analgesia means that pain score was four or more than four. If the analgesia was not required within the 24-h observation period, duration of analgesia was counted as 24 h. Analgesia was given to children when their OPS reached four or more and consist of paracetamol syrup 15 mg/kg by mouth every 4 h as required. The timing of micturition and any evidence of nightmares, hallucinations, or odd behavior were noted. The total requirement of postoperative analgesia in the 24-h period was noted.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Objective pain scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-488-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Motor block was assesed by Bromage scale[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>

The limitation of the single-shot caudal blockade is its finite and short duration, which reduces its utility as postoperative analgesic. Even long-acting local anesthetic drug such as bupivacaine provides only 4&#x02013;6 h of analgesia. Therefore, there is a continuous search for an ideal adjuvant to prolong the duration of analgesia.</p><p>Another concern is regarding caudal block analgesia is whether to give light general anesthesia or not? In our study, we induced the children either with IV pentothal or with gaseous inhalation agent before caudal block and found that this allows caudal block to be performed with more ease and intraoperative surgical conditions also remain satisfactory.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>We have opted for bupivacaine as a local anesthetic agent in the concentration of 0.25% at a dose of 1 ml/kg. Most of the authors[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have used bupivacaine as a local anesthetic agent of choice, though the volume and concentration may differ from study to study.</p><p>Several studies have provided evidence of the long-lasting profound analgesia, which is produced in children after administration of caudal ketamine with bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Ketamine, a derivative of phencyclidine, has a chemical structure similar to that of bupivacaine and therefore has local anesthetic effects. These local anesthetic effects are also caused by <italic>N</italic>-Methyl-D-aspirate receptor antagonism (NMDA receptors are in substantia gelatinosa in the spinal cord), opioid &#x000b5; receptor agonism and voltage-sensitive sodium channel interaction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Efficacy of caudal epidural ketamine in children has been demonstrated in a number of studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Semple <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] studied the optimal dose of ketamine for caudal epidural blockade in children. The study compared the 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg dose of caudal ketamine with 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine. They concluded that the optimum dose of ketamine for caudal epidural blockade is 0.5 mg/kg.</p><p>In our study, we have used caudal bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml/kg in Group A and caudal bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml/kg with ketamine (preservative free) 0.5 mg/kg in Group B that is in accordance with the study conducted by Semple <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study, duration of analgesia after caudal block was documented using the objective pain score. The OPS is an observational pain scoring system which has been validated for use by parents. Using ANOVA, we observed that the mean duration of action with bupivacaine plain was 5.63 &#x000b1; 0.98 h while its range varied between 3 and 7 h. In bupivacaine with ketamine group duration of action was in the range of 3&#x02013;19 h, and its mean duration of action was 10.18 &#x000b1; 2.24 h <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, which is highly significant. The results indicate that caudal bupivacaine and ketamine combined prolonged postoperative analgesia by 5&#x02013;6 h and significantly reduced the need for subsequent postoperative analgesia by more than 50% compared with caudal bupivacaine alone. Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] compared the analgesic effects of bupivacaine 0.25% (1 ml/kg) with and without ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy. Although there was no significant difference in the quality of analgesia between the groups, only 7% of patients who received the ketamine/bupivacaine combination required any further analgesia in the first 24 h after surgery, compared with 20% and 50%, respectively, of children in the ketamine-only and bupivacaine-only groups. Similarly, Cook <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated that the addition of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg to bupivacaine 0.25% (1 ml/kg) provided a longer median duration of postoperative analgesia after orchidopexy (12.5 h) than either clonidine 2 &#x000b5;g/kg (5.8 h, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) or epinephrine 5 &#x000b5;g/ml (3.2 h, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The degree of motor blockade was also comparable in both the groups. No motor blockade was seen after 6 h of observation in both the groups. Martindale <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in 2004, compared the motor blockade using Bromage scale. Duration of motor blockade was 2.4 h, 2 h, and 1.8 h in caudal bupivacaine group, bupivacaine with ketamine, and IV ketamine group, respectively. Racemic bupivacaine is gradually being replaced by ropivacaine or levobupivacaine. This change is driven by the reduced potential for systemic toxicity and the lower risk of unwanted motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] There was no significant difference in the time taken to eat and drink between both the groups. There were no differences between the groups in terms of motor block, urinary retention, or postoperative sedation. One patient in Group B had urinary retention for which he was catheterized in the evening. Nausea and vomiting was not a major problem in any of the groups. In our study, success rate of caudal administration was 98%, remaining 2% of the patients, although not included in the study were due to some anatomical variation of the sacral canal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>On the basis of results derived in this study, it is concluded that ketamine in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, added to 0.25% bupivacaine for caudal
