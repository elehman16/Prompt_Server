The effects of short antibiotic therapy on gut microbiota can last more than 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Elderly patients operated on may often suffer from functional intestinal nuisances in the postoperative period, which may require further investigations and treatments. The possibility of modulating intestinal microflora by means of probiotic formulations could potentially lead to a better functioning of gut mucosal barrier, resulting in reduced septic complications.

This may lead to higher risk of infectious complications due to bacterial translocation. Also, the imbalance in components of gut microflora is responsible for intensified symptoms perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that probiotic formulations are not effective to reduce the rate of postoperative septic complications in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, literature lacks studies investigating the effect of probiotics administration in the early post-operative period on symptoms perception in elderly patients undergoing large bowel resection.</p><p>In our series, we observed a lower frequency of evacuations in patients receiving probiotics, although not statistically significant; stool consistency was slightly higher in patients receiving resection not preserving ileo-caecal valve treated with probiotics. HRQoL was comparable in both groups, but patients in the probiotic group achieved a better social functioning than controls at 1- and 4-week follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Even if therapy with probiotics did not show a protective effect on postoperative complications, frail patients undergoing resection of ileo-caecal valve may benefit from an early probiotics administration pathway after perioperative antibiotic treatment. Bowel frequency may be lower, irrespective of the type of surgery. These observations support the usefulness of early probiotic administration in achieving a prompt restoration of function and return to everyday activities.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations used</title><p>HRQoL: health-related quality of life; IRB: internal review board; SF-36: short-form-36 questionnaire; SD: standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>G.P.: conception and design, interpretation of data, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>G.S.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>G.C.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>A.C.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>R.M.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>S.D.F.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>F.R.: acquisition of data, drafting the manuscript, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>S.C.: critical revision, interpretation of data, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>G.R.: conception and design, critical revision, given final approval of the version to be published</p><p>F.S.: conception and design, critical revision, given final approval of the version to be published</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' information</title><p>GP: Resident in General Surgery at Second University of Naples.</p><p>GS: PhD, Researcher, Aggregate Professor of General Surgery at Second University of Naples.</p><p>GC: Resident in General Surgery at Second University of Naples.</p><p>AC: Medical Student (Research Assistant) at Second University of Naples.</p><p>RM: Medical Student (Research Assistant) at Second University of Naples.</p><p>SDF: M.D. (Research Assistant) at the Second University of Naples.</p><p>FR: Medical Student (Research Assistant) at Second University of Naples.</p><p>CS: Full Professor of General Surgery at Second University of Naples, Chief Division of General and Geriatric Surgery Second University of Naples.</p><p>GR: Associate Professor of Gastroenterology, Second University of Naples.</p><p>FS: Associate Professor of General Surgery at Second University of Naples.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Declarations</title><p>Funding for this article has come from personal funds.</p><p>This article has been published as part of <italic>BMC Surgery </italic>Volume 13 Supplement 2, 2013: Proceedings from the 26th National Congress of the Italian Society of Geriatric Surgery.
