The objective of this study was to determine whether a family meetings intervention was superior to usual care in postponing nursing home placement of patients with dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia living at home at enrolment and their primary family caregiver. Dyads of caregivers and patients were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;96) or usual care (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions with the primary caregiver and four family counseling sessions that included family members and friends.

No significant difference between the intervention and the usual care group was found in time until institutionalization (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 2.74). The per-protocol analysis revealed no significant effect either (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.57), although the number of placements among the adherers was relatively low (9.4%).

Most patients with dementia still live at home and are cared for by a family member <xref rid="pone.0042145-AARPandNationalAlliancefor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042145-Dutch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Caring for these patients at home, however, is associated with a high burden and an increased risk of mental health problems. Approximately 20% of patients is institutionalized in the first year after dementia has been diagnosed. This rises to 50% after five years and approaches 90% after eight years <xref rid="pone.0042145-Luppa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>A poor health of the caregiver is one of the most important predictors for nursing home placement of demented persons <xref rid="pone.0042145-Luppa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042145-Spitznagel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Since institutionalization of patients is a heavy cost driver, any intervention that can relief the burden of caregiving and (thereby) delay nursing home placement is likely to be very cost-effective. Several caregiver interventions targeting psychosocial factors have proven to be effective in helping caregivers to postpone nursing home placement of patients with mild to moderately severe dementia when compared with usual care <xref rid="pone.0042145-Brodaty1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042145-Olazaran1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The essential components of effective interventions were individual targeting, psycho-education, counseling and support <xref rid="pone.0042145-Belle1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042145-Mittelman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A systematic review reported a risk reduction of 0.33 after 6 or 12 months of intervention, which indicates 33% less institutionalization compared to the minimal support or usual-care control group <xref rid="pone.0042145-Olazaran1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, one RCT which tested the effectiveness of a counseling intervention including family meetings, found that in the first year after intake the intervention group had less than half as many nursing home placements as the control group <xref rid="pone.0042145-Mittelman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. After a period of 11 years, the intervention led to a substantial median delay in nursing home placement of 557 days (or approximately 1.5 years) compared to the control group while maintaining a comparable quality of life for the caregivers <xref rid="pone.0042145-Mittelman2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This intervention was developed to mobilize support of naturally existing family networks and consisted of individual counseling sessions, family meetings, support group participation and continuous availability of ad hoc telephone counseling.</p><p>In the Netherlands, several supportive services for family caregivers are available, but family meetings are rarely organized and never in a structured way. It is not clear yet how much value family meetings may have on top of usual care when implemented in real life practice. To estimate this, we conducted a randomized trial among primary family caregivers of community dwelling demented patients investigating the effectiveness of structured family meetings in comparison with usual care on postponing patient institutionalization. The effects of the intervention on preventing the development of depression and anxiety in caregivers are reported elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0042145-Joling1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042145.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0042145.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. The design of this study has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0042145-Joling2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients and their primary caregivers were recruited through memory clinics (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;91), services delivering case management (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;79), general practices, home care settings and meeting centers for people with dementia and their caregivers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) across the Netherlands. Caregivers were eligible if they were the primary family caregiver of a community dwelling relative with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and had at least one other family member or friend available to participate in the family meetings. If there was more than one family caregiver caring for the patient, the primary caregiver was identified as the person who coordinated the caring process, usually the person who spends the most hours on caregiving tasks. Caregivers were excluded when 1) they met the criteria for a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder as measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) <xref rid="pone.0042145-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 2) the patient was already scheduled to move to a nursing home in short notice, 3) they had severe somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity which would impair participation in the study, or 4) they had insufficient language proficiency in Dutch for adequate participation in the family meetings and interviews. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. In case of mental incompetence of a patient the family caregiver signed the consent for the patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre approved the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Caregivers randomized to the intervention group were invited to participate in six in-person counseling sessions: one individual preparation session, followed by four structured meetings that included their relatives and/or friends, and one additional individual evaluation session. The family meetings were held once every 2 to 3 months in the year following enrollment in the program.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Preparation Meeting</title><p>The first individual session was aimed to prepare the caregiver for the family meetings and to propose the idea of seeking help from family and friends.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Family meetings</title><p>The aim was to offer psycho-education, teach problem solving techniques and mobilize the existing family networks of the patient and primary caregiver in order to improve emotional and instrumental support. The content of the sessions was guided by the needs of the caregiver. During the first family meeting the purpose of the meetings, the protocol, ground rules and the counselor&#x02019;s role were explained to the caregiver and the family. Relevant issues were identified (e.g. management of patient behavioral problems, coping with feelings of guilt) and the counselor motivated the family to form ideas to help the caregiver and to delegate tasks. The follow up meetings reviewed the previous session, previous commitments and the progress of tasks. Ad hoc telephone counseling from the same counselor was available continuously to caregivers and their families beyond the scheduled sessions and was provided on demand of the caregiver.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Evaluation session</title><p>After the final family session, an individual session was held to evaluate the caregiver&#x02019;s satisfaction with the intervention program and to start additional support when requested.</p><p>The counselors who led the family meetings had an advanced degree in nursing, social work, psychology or an allied profession and were trained prior to the study by the research team. One counselor was assigned to each caregiver to establish an ongoing relationship with a person familiar with the situation. The family meetings were audio taped for supervision and reviewed randomly and on request to give feedback to the counselors. To encourage and evaluate protocol adherence, after a family session, the counselor filled in a standardized form and was contacted by the researcher (KJJ) individually to monitor and discuss difficulties.

Usual care in the Netherlands may consist of a range of health care and welfare services and can differ across participants. However, family meetings are rarely organized and never in a structured way or with follow-up sessions. They also tend to focus on providing clinical information and not on increasing family support and relieving the caregiver. Usual care participants were free to use all types of care, including community-based mental health services or support resources other than family meetings at any time throughout the 18 months follow-up, therefore reflecting standard care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Primary Outcome</title><p>The primary outcome for this analysis was the time to nursing home placement of the patients in calendar days.

Patients and their primary family caregiver were randomized as a dyad, stratified by recruitment centre, in blocks of four to either usual care or the family meetings intervention. The interviewers who measured the outcomes were blinded to group allocation. The participants and the counselors conducting the family meetings were aware of the intervention assigned.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We compared the baseline characteristics of dropouts and those who completed the 18-month measurement by performing logistic regression analysis. Survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of family meetings compared to usual care on the primary outcome measure. The unadjusted difference in time until institutionalization between both groups was tested with the log rank test. Adjusted differences were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the intervention group, compared to the usual care group. Time to event was measured in days from date of the baseline assessment to the date of admission to a long-term care institution. For patients who died without prior institutionalization, date of death was used as a censoring event. Patients who were still living in the community at the end of the study period were censored at the date of the 18 months follow-up assessment. For patients who were lost to follow up, the date of the last contact was used as the censoring date. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of censoring patients who died without ever being placed. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Previously, a NYU caregiver intervention showed that a counseling program including family meetings was effective in preventing nursing home placement. Analyses of data collected over an 18-year period indicated a median delay in placement of 1.5 years <xref rid="pone.0042145-Mittelman2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our results are not in line with these positive findings.</p><p>There may be several explanations for the lack of effects in our study. First, standard care in the Netherlands provided to caregivers and patients is already intensive. Most recruitment sites provided intensive routine care such as case management and support groups, and other health care services were also accessible for caregivers. An explanation might be that the family meetings in addition to the already intensive standard care do not result in significant benefits.</p><p>It might also be argued that the intervention lacked sufficient intensity to influence this outcome. Family meetings might be more beneficial if delivered more intensively over a shorter period of time or in combination with other intervention components. However, since there are already many supportive services available to caregivers in the Netherlands, the contrast with usual care would still be small.</p><p>The lack of effects in our study may also be due to the fact that the participants&#x02019; adherence to the intervention was not optimal. We applied several strategies to maintain a high level of participation. The sessions were scheduled at the convenience of the family as much as possible and the counselors provided the family meetings in the caregivers&#x02019; homes if they were unable to leave the patient. Nevertheless, only about half of the intervention caregivers completed the majority of the sessions. This could also mean that this type of intervention is not what these caregivers perceive to need.</p><p>According to the audiotapes that were listened, the standardized forms that were completed by the counselors after every session and the contact between the research team and counselors during the intervention period, the counselors carried out the intervention as instructed. Furthermore, all counselors were uniformly trained, used a structured manual and may be assumed to be adequately qualified to lead the family meetings. Therefore, we assume that the actual quality of the intervention was no reason for the lack of effects in our study.</p><p>The results of our trial make a valuable contribution to the existing literature. Our study is the first study outside the original NYU development site to investigate the effectiveness of structured family meetings compared to usual care. Other strengths are the relatively large sample size and the lack of missing data on the primary outcome. For all patients, we were able to trace their status, also after caregivers stopped actively participating in the study. Considering the randomized design, the independent assessments, the concealed allocation and the adjustment for baseline differences associated with the outcome, it is unlikely that selection bias has influenced the results.</p><p>A subgroup analysis suggested that the &#x02018;risk&#x02019; of institutionalization in &#x02018;younger&#x02019; patients was higher among intervention participants than for participants receiving care as usual. This finding was unexpected. It may reflect that family counseling may boost the caring capacity of the caregiver and family, but it can also have precisely the opposite effect, particularly in younger caregivers, by making them realize at an earlier stage that their limits have been reached and that admission to a nursing home is appropriate. As we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis this finding should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Our study also has some limitations. Adherence to the intervention protocol was not optimal. Perhaps, a more multifaceted approach would have given better results. On the other hand, the results reflect the effectiveness in usual routine care for caregivers who were interested in this particular intervention. In view of the generalizability, it is also important to note that the mean age of our sample was rather low for a sample of patients with a diagnosis of dementia.</p><p>Another limitation involves the power of the study. The study was originally powered to derive a relevant effect on the development of mental disorders in the caregiver <xref rid="pone.0042145-Joling2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The somewhat limited power of 76% might explain why we were not able to detect a difference between the intervention and control group with regard to institutionalization. One possibility to increase power is to extend follow-up, which could provide a sufficient number of events (and time) to derive a significant effect.</p><p>In conclusion, although most caregivers participating in the family meetings intervention felt supported, the intervention was not more effective than usual care in delaying time until institutionalization of patients. An remaining question in psychosocial intervention research for caregivers of persons with dementia is what works for whom and what timing is appropriate? It might be that family meetings are more effective when targeted at those caregivers most in need. Based on our findings we cannot state which specific subgroups of caregivers might benefit most from this intervention. However, we did find that caregivers who were satisfied about the family meetings experienced a higher lack of family support at baseline than the other intervention caregivers <xref rid="pone.0042145-Joling1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This might indicate that family meetings should be targeted at the more &#x02018;dysfunctional&#x02019; families, nonetheless delivering a more intensive program in which motivating caregivers should be an important component.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042145.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0042145.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0042145.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0042145.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0042145-Ferri1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
