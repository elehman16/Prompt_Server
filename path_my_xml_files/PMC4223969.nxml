Data collection tools included demographic characteristics questionnaire, Pittsburgh Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire, and World Health Organization, Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) WHOQOL-BREEF questionnaire. Sampling was done by convenient sampling. Firstly, Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality Questionnaire was completed and the pregnant women with sleep disorders were selected as the subjects. After completion of sampling, the subjects were randomly assigned to two groups of study and control. Education of sleep health behavior was provided in the study group by the researcher during four 1-h sessions. Then, WHOQOL-BREEF and Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire were completed again in two groups in the first follow-up session (1 month after educational intervention) and in the second follow-up session (2 months after educational intervention) held by the researcher.

Over 72% of women experience frequent wake up at midnight during pregnancy. Changes in sleep pattern cause dysfunction in daily activities and tiredness for the mother. In addition, lowered mental and psychological comfort due to insomnia leads to increased anxiety, fear of taking care of the infant and acceptance of motherhood role in the family.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Meanwhile, results of literature review studies on sleep disorders in pregnancy show higher risk of pre-term delivery, low birth weight (LBW), an increase in pregnancy period and intrapartum problems, prolonged discovery phases, assisted delivery, Cesarean sections, pregnancy and postpartum depression, a negative effect on family and indirectly on the society, and impose economic burden to the society.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The strategies to lower mortality in pregnancy period in developed countries led to development of pregnancy period care and maternal health outcome. According to World Health Organization's (WHO) statement, health refers to physical, mental, and social welfare without existence of a disease and disability. However, prenatal care in developed countries goes beyond traditional preventive help, diagnosis and management of problem and factors effective on maternal health, and focuses on vast actions to support and encourage the family to adapt with the mental aspects related to child birth and to increase social awareness toward birth, delivery, and their possible effects on the family. These developments of support reflect the development of quality of life (QOL).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, an increase in prenatal awareness and preparation makes it possible for the mothers to pass this stage of life with fewer complications more pleasantly, which can be fulfilled through a behavior change resulting from correct education. Therefore, researchers consider pregnancy as an appropriate time to make a behavior change.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Education of sleep healthy behaviors leads to improvement of pregnant women's sleep quality through increase of awareness.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Also, research showed that physical and social functions and vitality, as dimensions of QOL, are reduced during pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] On the other hand, sleep quality in pregnancy period affects the QOL of women, who are the central core of a family, through its effect on physical, mental, psychological, and social health. There is little research on the effect of sleep healthy behavior education on the sleep quality of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the world. In Iran, no studies have been conducted on this issue. With regard to the fact that individuals&#x02019; concepts of QOL are influenced by their beliefs and cultures, the necessity of the research in this context is highlighted. The researchers decided to conduct a study in this context in order to increase the support of women during pregnancy in the direction of &#x0201c;a healthy child from a healthy mother&#x0201d; slogan. in the direction of &#x0201c;a healthy child from a healthy mother&#x0201d; slogan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a clinical trial conducted on 130 pregnant women referring to two selected health care centers affiliated to Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Makou during June-Oct 2012. The sampling was done by convenient sampling (from all qualified women referring to the above-mentioned centers).</p><p>Three questionnaires that were adopted in the present study were a demographic characteristics questionnaire, Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire, and WHOQOL-BREEF. After preparation of the questionnaires and obtaining a written permission from the nursing and midwifery school and ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, the qualified pregnant women were selected.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were age 20-40 years, gestational age 16-20 weeks (based on the first day of the last menstruation prior to pregnancy or the sonography result of the first trimester), no diagnosed physical and mental diseases (medicational and psychological), Iranian nationality, ability to read and write, not smoking, no drug abuse or consumption of alcoholic drinks, and not taking sleep and hormonal medications. After obtaining an informed written consent, a two-section questionnaire including women's demographic characteristics and Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire were distributed among the qualified individuals to fill them up. After revision of the questionnaires, the subjects with scores &#x02265;5 were diagnosed as subjects with sleep disorders (<italic>N</italic> = 112). Immediately following this, WHOQOL-BREEF was given to them to be filled up in a quiet place. Then, the subjects with sleep disorders were randomly assigned to two groups of study (<italic>n</italic> = 56) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 56) based on random numbers chart. This was a single-blind design. Education of sleep health behavior was administered to the study group participants during weekly four 1-h sessions with different contents in the form of three 12-member groups and two 10-member groups in one of the health care centers through lecture and slides show accompanied with distribution of an educational booklet to the subjects. Control group just received conventional prenatal care [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Diagram 1</xref>]. Both the groups were blind to the type of education given.

Index scores &#x0003c;5 show good sleep and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index scores &#x02265;5 show bad sleep. Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire was finally designed by Buysse <italic>et al</italic>. in 1989 with a sensitivity of 89-6% 89%, specificity of 86.5%, validity of 88% (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88), and reliability of 83%.

Inadequate sleep, especially due to frequent sleep disorders, is accompanied with problems in various domains of life including physical, mental, social health, as well as dysfunction in daytime activities.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Frequent sleep disorders notably lead to smoking, lack of physical activity, obesity, and drinking alcohol heavily, and indirectly result in worsening of QOL (similar to chronic heart failure CHF and clinical depression) by disturbing physical, mental, and psychological health. Therefore, changing these high-risk behaviors is more crucial than modification of sleep-related problems in the general population. In other words, sleep-related problems due to unhealthy behaviors even worsen chronic diseases by disturbing all dimensions of QOL and their effect on patients&#x02019; mental status function.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The findings of the present study, with emphasis on the importance of sleep quality in improvement of QOL in pregnant women in the second and third trimesters, confirmed the results of previous studies. The pregnant women had low quality of sleep and QOL at the beginning of the study, but education of sleep health behaviors improved QOL in its physical, social, mental and psychological, and environmental domains in pregnant women with sleep disorder through improvement of their sleep quality. Debhura <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed reduction in physical and social functions and limitation of women in doing their duties due to the physical problems that women with sleep problems have. Ekaterina[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also showed that discomfort, physical signs, and low-quality sleep or sleep problem had potential effect on QOL and signs of depression toward the end of pregnancy, which is consistent with the present study reporting the improvement of physical, social, mental and psychological, environmental domains, and QOL through promotion of sleep quality as a result of sleep healthy behavior education in pregnancy. Tara and Daniel[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that inadequate sleep in 14 days of a month was associated with general, physical and mental health, individuals&#x02019; daily activities level, day time depression signs, suffering, pain, desire to smoke and drink alcohol, lack of physical activities, and obesity, which is consistent with the present study results that suggest strategies to modify physical, mental and psychological problems, and to provide an environment effective on QOL and its dimensions in pregnancy. Bendad and Abedian[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that the causes of sleep disorders in pregnant women included physical problems (nausea, vomiting, heart burn, low back pain, urinary frequency, fetal movements, leg cramps, abdominal edema, heat intolerance, headache, itching, short breath, load of negative thoughts, unplanned pregnancy, and fear) and environmental problems (noise at home, phone caller, sleep partner, environmental noise, lack of adequate darkness, inappropriate temperature and bed, and insects), which are consistent with the present study reporting the positive effect of modification of physical, psychological, and environmental problems on sleep quality in pregnancy. Sleep disorders are among the common complaints of pregnant women and are less noticed as they are considered as a normal issue in pregnancy while they can result in numerous problems in pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period.</p><p>With regard to the importance of preservation of pregnant women's physical, psychological, social, and environmental health, it is suggested to include education of sleep healthy behaviors in conventional prenatal care as a routine disciplinary care plan as well as an appropriate counseling in this period to prevent sleep disorders in an effort to improve maternal health and for fulfillment of the slogan &#x0201c;a healthy child from a healthy mother&#x0201d;. This study, like other studies, faced limitations including little effect of respondents&#x02019; psychological characteristics on their answers to the questions asked by the researcher, which were out of researchers&#x02019; control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>A large number of pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders in the pregnancy period, and based on our obtained results, education of sleep healthy behaviors improves QOL and physical, psychological, social, and environmental health in this period. It is suggested to include application of healthy behaviors educational methods in the list of midwifery educational textbooks. It is also suggested to include routine application of healthy behaviors education in countrywide continuing education for all midwives, which they should consider in their maternal care, patients&#x02019; delivery, and postpartum period, as well as in health care system of Iran, hopefully, to bring about new ideas in this
