Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223), a first-in-class &#x003b1;-emitting radiopharmaceutical, has demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit in patients with CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases.

During the first 28 weeks of follow-up, EQ-5D was completed every 2 months, and FACT-P was administered once at week 44 (22 weeks after last study drug administration).

Analyses were carried out on the intent-to-treat population, but limited to patients with a baseline assessment and &#x02265;1 post-baseline assessment (i.e. weeks 16 and/or 24 or both). Three analyses were conducted using the EQ-5D utility score (utility score) and FACT-P total score: a responder analysis investigating treatment effects on percentage of patients experiencing meaningful QOL improvement on treatment; a similar on-treatment analysis of percentage of patients experiencing meaningful QOL worsening; and an overall analysis (using data collected during treatment and follow-up) investigating treatment effects on mean QOL and mean change from baseline over time [<xref rid="MDW065C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For all analyses, when treatment differences were significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for FACT-P total score, subscales were evaluated to determine which were associated with the differences. When a significant QOL difference between treatment groups was found, regression models with docetaxel status (yes/no) and interaction terms were used to determine whether the treatment effect was different between pre-docetaxel and post-docetaxel subgroups; similar models were used to determine whether treatment effect was different between current bisphosphonate use (yes/no) subgroups [<xref rid="MDW065C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>When defining &#x02018;meaningful improvement&#x02019; (or &#x02018;meaningful worsening&#x02019;), the upper limit of the minimally important difference (MID) range was used [<xref rid="MDW065C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDW065C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="MDW065C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="MDW065C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], minimizing the likelihood of falsely identifying a patient as having improvement (or worsening). The utility score MID was 0.1; MIDs for FACT-P total score and subscales are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdw065/-/DC1">supplementary Table S1, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>. <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests were used to test for an association between treatment and likelihood of experiencing meaningful improvement (i.e. responder) or worsening in QOL [<xref rid="MDW065C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Except for PRS, patients experiencing a QOL increase &#x02265;MID from baseline at week 16 and/or week 24 were considered responders. Conversely, those experiencing a decrease in QOL score &#x02265;MID from baseline at these time points were considered to have experienced worsening QOL. For PRS, a responder was defined as having a score increase of &#x02265;2 without initiating opioid treatment. A patient initiating opioid use after baseline was assumed to have worsening pain and therefore to be a non-responder from that time forward.</p><p>Mixed-effect analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) regression models assessed the average treatment effect on utility score and FACT-P total score throughout the study. Covariates or main effects used were QOL score at baseline and on treatment at week 16 or 24, total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration (&#x02265;220 or &#x0003c;220 U/l), current bisphosphonate use (yes/no), and prior docetaxel use (yes/no). Time was a random effect. A linear regression model, with the same covariates and main effects as the mixed-effect model, was used to conduct ANCOVA to provide descriptive assessments of treatment effect on utility score and FACT-P total score and subscales at each assessment time point. In both models, the dependent variable was mean change in score from baseline. To obtain estimates of the mean QOL on study, regression models were also run using mean score as a dependent variable [<xref rid="MDW065C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Missing data were assumed to be missing completely at random for all analyses; no imputation was done to estimate missing observations. To investigate potential selection bias due to missing data, pattern-mixture models were used to re-evaluate the mixed-effect ANCOVA analyses and test for evidence of differential response based on extent of missing data [<xref rid="MDW065C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The regression model included a variable for extent of missing data (classifying patients as having complete versus incomplete data), and interaction terms with this variable and each respective covariate. Statistical tests were conducted to determine whether missing data status was a significant predictor of treatment effect on utility score and FACT-P total score. If so, this would provide evidence of bias in the mixed-effect ANCOVA analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="mdw065_s3"><title>results</title><p>All analyses were carried out on the intent-to-treat population of 921 patients randomized to receive either radium-223 (<italic>n</italic> = 614) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 307).

In patients receiving radium-223, a significantly higher percentage experienced meaningful improvement in QOL and a lower percentage experienced meaningful worsening in QOL versus placebo. Radium-223 treatment appeared to result in higher mean QOL scores on study versus placebo, a function of slower deterioration over time. This trend was consistent across four of five FACT-P subscales, indicating that treatment effects extend across multiple QOL domains. Analysis of pain-related and non-pain-related components of the PCS suggests that pain reduction primarily contributed to PCS treatment differences. This effect is consistent with other ALSYMPCA analyses showing that radium-223 significantly prolonged time to first opioid use [<xref rid="MDW065C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and that radium-223 was equally effective, regardless of opioid use at baseline [<xref rid="MDW065C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These data are consistent with those of an earlier phase II study, showing pain response (reduced pain and stable analgesic consumption) in 71% of patients with CRPC receiving radium-223 [<xref rid="MDW065C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Treatment effects in utility and FACT-P total scores appeared consistent across pre-docetaxel and post-docetaxel subgroups, and except for change from baseline in mean utility score, treatment benefit is consistent across current bisphosphonate use (yes/no) subgroups.</p><p>QOL deterioration over time for CRPC patients is well documented, and may be a prognostic factor for more rapid disease progression [<xref rid="MDW065C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="MDW065C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Agents such as radium-223 that delay QOL deterioration or improve overall QOL and OS are valuable additions to treatment; there is evidence of a durable response to radium-223 over time, as measured by FACT-P total score and subscales. Recent analyses of QOL data from enzalutamide and abiraterone studies in CRPC patients documented the QOL decline in patients using FACT-P, and reported these agents' beneficial effects on QOL [<xref rid="MDW065C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="MDW065C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, several confounding factors make comparisons of QOL findings across these studies and ALSYMPCA difficult. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis of FACT-P data from the abiraterone trial, where 48% of patients were classified as responders, used the same meaningful improvement in FACT-P total score as the current radium-223 analysis, but the abiraterone analysis used only data from patients with a low FACT-P total score at baseline (i.e. those with the greatest chance for improvement). Furthermore, there were more FACT-P assessments (at cycles 1, 4, 7, 10, and every 6 cycles thereafter) than in ALSYMPCA because of longer treatment duration, giving patients more opportunities to be responders [<xref rid="MDW065C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, statistical analyses used across studies, and differing assumptions in each model, make direct comparisons of QOL findings challenging.</p><p>Limitations of the ALSYMPCA analyses reported here include the results being from <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses. However, collection of QOL data in ALSYMPCA was done prospectively, and measured using validated QOL instruments, one (FACT-P) specific for prostate cancer. If the assumption of data missing completely at random was not correct, some analyses may be biased. However, the pattern-mixture model analysis was done to detect evidence of informative missing, and no evidence was found. Decreases in EQ-5D and FACT-P completion rates over time were a potentially confounding factor, although a pattern-mixture model showed no evidence that missing data biased the analyses. Moreover, responder analysis used the upper limit of the clinically meaningful range for FACT-P subscales to minimize the likelihood of falsely identifying a patient as a responder. A limitation of the analysis of pain improvement is that once a patient initiated opioid therapy, significant increases or decreases in pain management could not be accurately assessed. Regarding multiple testing, a conservative approach using the Bonferroni correction (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.008) when evaluating the three main analyses applied to utility and FACT-P total scores would change only the conclusion regarding FACT-P responder analysis, to non-significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.020) after applying the correction. Even with these conservative approaches, significantly more patients receiving radium-223 experienced a meaningful increase in QOL.</p><p>The findings reported here and in the primary report of ALSYMPCA [<xref rid="MDW065C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] suggest that in the clinical practice setting, radium-223 treatment was associated with both increased survival outcomes and clinically meaningful improvements in QOL. Furthermore, pain is often associated with SSEs (e.g. spinal cord compression) in CRPC patients, and radium-223 demonstrated an additional clinical benefit of delaying SSE occurrence (by 5.8 months). Analysis of utility scores in ALSYMPCA before/after SSE and before/after disease progression found that the radium-223 QOL benefit was greatest in stable disease and pre-SSE settings [<xref rid="MDW065C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting that delay to first SSE is associated with better QOL. Overall, interest in monitoring QOL during treatment in patients with CRPC is increasing, and recommendations have been made to include patient-reported outcomes and QOL, using instruments such as FACT-P [<xref rid="MDW065C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A recent report of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) validated tool to assess magnitude of clinical benefit scale (ESMO-MCBS), which assesses QOL and survival, rated radium-223 as having the highest level of clinical benefit [<xref rid="MDW065C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These QOL instruments continue to be evaluated and refined in this population, especially in configuring questions addressing clinical relevance from the oncologist's perspective and symptoms of greatest concern to patients [<xref rid="MDW065C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDW065C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Examples of QOL instruments that may provide valuable insights in this CRPC setting are the EORTC QLQ-BM22 instrument for patients with bone metastases [<xref rid="MDW065C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the FACT-Bone Pain [<xref rid="MDW065C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, analyses of EQ-5D and FACT-P data from the ALSYMPCA trial demonstrate that improved survival with radium-223 is accompanied by significant QOL benefits, including a higher percentage of patients with meaningful improvement in QOL and an overall slower decline in QOL over time.</p></sec><sec id="mdw065_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Bayer HealthCare</funding-source>, Whippany, NJ, USA.
