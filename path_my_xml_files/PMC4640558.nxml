We randomized 40 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (4:1) to three escalating doses of SRT2104, a selective activator of SIRT1, or placebo. Across all SRT2104 groups, 35% of patients (p&#x0003c;0.0001) achieved good to excellent histological improvement based on skin biopsies taken at baseline and day 84 but was not consistently in agreement with PASI. Improvement in histology was associated with modulation of IL-17 and TNF-&#x003b1; signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation target genes. 27 subjects (69%) across all treatment groups, including placebo, experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. The majority of AEs were either mild or moderate. Most common were headache (8%), dizziness (8%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), and psoriatic arthropathy (8%). Average drug exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner for escalating doses of SRT2104 and had high intra-subject variability in exposure (AUC %CV: 51&#x02013;89%). Given the interesting signals of clinical activity, impact on gene expression and the generally favorable safety profile seen in this study, further investigation of SIRT1 activators for the treatment of psoriasis is warranted.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01154101">NCT01154101</ext-link>

Studies suggest that CR extends lifespan in lower organisms and mammals and improves a number of metabolic and inflammatory parameters. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a NAD+ dependent class III histone deacetylase, has a number of cellular substrates including PGC-1&#x003b1;, NCoR, p300, NF&#x003ba;B, FOXO and p53 and has been implicated in regulation of metabolism, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer and aging A direct role of SIRT1 in promoting keratinocyte differentiation has been shown and is supportive of earlier findings that resveratrol, a plant derived polyphenol which activates SIRT1, inhibited proliferation of human keratinocytes and suppressed angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. SRT2104 is novel, selective small molecule activator of SIRT1 that has been advanced into clinical development [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pre-clinically, SRT2104 has shown efficacy following oral administration (10&#x02013;300 mg/kg/day; for five to 28 days) in a number of <italic>in vivo</italic> inflammation models including lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Taken together with the finding that SIRT1 activators are effective in attenuating cytokine production, SIRT1 activation offers a potential new approach for treating psoriasis. In the present work, we hypothesized that SRT2104 as a selective SIRT1 activator may demonstrate anti-psoriatic activity by promoting keratinocyte differentiation, reducing inflammation and/or inhibiting angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0142081.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142081.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Ethical Conduct of the Study</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (version October, 2008) and the relevant regulations under 21 CFR parts 312, 50 and 56. A signed informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to performing any study related procedures. The study protocol and ICF were approved by institutional review boards of each participating study site (The Rockefeller University IRB, Schulman Associates IRB, and New York University IRB).

Additionally, subjects had to be able and willing to provide written informed consent and had to have a baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) of &#x02265; 10 and were candidates for systemic psoriasis therapy, in the opinion of the investigator. Patients were excluded if they had received biologic agents within 5 half-lives (or within 3 months if half-life unknown) prior to first dose of study drug, systemic non-biologic psoriasis therapy or psoralen and ultraviolet light A (PUVA) phototherapy within four weeks prior to the screening visit, or had topical psoriasis treatment or ultraviolet light B (UVB) phototherapy within two weeks prior to the screening visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was conducted at eight centers in the United States.

Subjects within each cohort were randomized 4:1, in a dose-escalating manner, to receive SRT2104 at one of the three doses&#x02013; 250, 500 or 1000 mg / day or matching placebo for 84 consecutive days. Each cohort of subjects was dosed sequentially. Dosing in the second and the third cohort did not commence until subjects in the previous cohort completed at least 28 days of dosing and a review of safety parameters (physical examination findings, vital signs, ECGs, adverse events (AEs) and laboratory values) was completed by an Internal Safety Review Committee. All subjects were provided with one dosing bottle per day that contained one, two or four capsules (250 mg each, active or matched placebo) for oral ingestion. Subjects self-administered IP with 250 to 500 mL water, approximately 15 minutes following the consumption of a standardized meal, at the same time every dosing day.</p><fig id="pone.0142081.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0142081.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Flow Diagram.</title><p>The scheme graphically outlines the design and conduct of the clinical study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0142081.g001"/></fig><p>No concomitant medications or herbal products were permitted during the trial except&#x02013;i) medications administered to treat an AE, ii) topical class 6 and/or 7 rescue corticosteroid treatment for psoriasis flares to be applied only to face, axillae and groin (topical treatments were not to be applied to other areas, in particular the plaque being assessed for efficacy, at or near the biopsy site), and iii) chronically prescribed non-psoriatic medication or herbal or dietary supplements administered at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Study Evaluations</title><p>The primary clinical activity endpoint was measured as a change in histological assessments of skin biopsies of psoriatic lesions from baseline to day 84 according to the following Histological Response Criteria:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>No improvement&#x02014;No improvement in epidermal thickness, keratinocyte differentiation or K16 expression on keratinocytes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Good improvement&#x02014;Reduction in epidermal thickness by at least 30%, normalized keratinocyte differentiation, most keratinocytes still express K16</p></list-item><list-item><p>Excellent improvement&#x02014;Epidermal thickness reduced to normal or almost normal, normalized keratinocyte differentiation, absent keratinocyte expression of K16</p></list-item></list><p>Skin biopsies were obtained from the same designated plaque. A central blinded reader at Rockefeller University (Dr. J.

The histological analysis followed the parameters for the study by Zaba et al [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Secondary clinical activity end points were the assessment of effect of SRT2104 on PASI and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] scores in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis after 28, 56, and 84 days of exposure. Additional objectives of the study included assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of SRT2104 as measured by biomarkers of psoriasis and/or sirtuin pathway activation (including hsCRP, FGF21) and determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. A sparse sampling approach was used to collect PK samples. Area under the Curve (AUC) of SRT2104 for a steady state dosing interval (0 to 24 hours) was computed using population PK modeling; Cmax was based on the highest observed plasma concentration. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation was used to assess association between skin concentration and plasma concentration, and PASI response. Subjects were assessed for safety and tolerability by adverse events, laboratory parameters, physical examination, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Microarray Analysis</title><p>Quality control of microarray chips was carried out using standard QC metrics and R package microarray Quality Control Images were scrutinized for spatial artifacts using Harshlight [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary clinical activity endpoint was the Histological Response, which was based on histological assessment of skin biopsies after day 84 of treatment (defined in the study evaluation section). Sample size was based on feasibility rather than statistical operating characteristics. The primary, prospectively defined analysis of clinical activity was a comparison of the proportion of subjects achieving good or excellent improvement relative to a historical placebo response rate of 5%. A one-sample, one-sided binomial test was used to assess statistical significance at the alpha 0.05 level. Normality assumptions were not tested. Because previous studies have indicated that the pharmacokinetic exposure is relatively variable [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], an exposure-response analysis was used to further evaluate activity. The imputed AUCs from the SRT2104 treated groups were natural-log transformed and dichotomized at the midpoint for a low and high exposure group. Point estimates and 90% exact confidence intervals (CI) were constructed for differences between the proportion of responses, defined as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;excellent&#x0201d; histological improvement, for each of the SRT2104-treated groups (250mg, 500mg, and 1000mg), exposure groups (High and Low) and the placebo group. Given the small sample size, less stringent 90% CIs were considered appropriate. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons and no missing values were imputed.</p><p>Point estimates and 90% exact confidence intervals based on the Blyth-Still-Casella method [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were constructed for the secondary endpoints of clinical activity (PASI-50 (data not shown) and PGA of &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not clear&#x0201d;) for the difference between the proportion of responders for each of the SRT2104-treated groups, exposure groups and the placebo group. Mixed effects ANOVA was used to estimate mean PASI over time; model terms included baseline PASI, treatment, day and treatment-by-day interaction. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, min, max and 90% CI) of the percent change in PASI are provided for SRT2104-treated groups, exposure groups and placebo group. Post hoc exploratory analyses of response predictors were performed using a stepwise linear regression for Day 84 total PASI score and stepwise logistic regression for Day 84 PASI25, which was an indicator variable if the subject responded with at least a 25% reduction in PASI. Baseline PASI was entered in these models. Parameters were entered/retained in the model if p&#x0003c; = 0.2000.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Patients</title><p>The CONSORT 2010 flow diagram of this study is shown in <xref rid="pone.0142081.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

In our trial, based on histopathology, we saw substantial improvement in 9 subjects following 84 days of treatment with SRT2104. Although absorption was relatively linear with dose, we did not observe a dose-response in the histology endpoint. A trend for dose/exposure was observed with the more classical psoriasis endpoints of PASI and PGA. The reasons for this are unclear but the observed high inter-patient variability in the exposure of SRT2104 and lack of detailed PK data across the course of the study may have been a factor.</p><p>While this study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing, the comparison of histological improvement against a historical placebo response rate of 5% was significant. An estimation approach was used for the direct comparison against the placebo arm in our trial because the study was not sufficiently powered to detect statistical differences; furthermore, as one patient responded to placebo within a small sample size, the historical rate was used to prevent an overestimation of the placebo effect. If we assume 1 in 10 patients respond to placebo, we will need 15(19) patients per group to detect significance differences between rate of response of SRT2104 250mg and Placebo using a 1-tail (2-tail) fisher&#x02019;s exact test; likewise, for the rate of the 500 mg group, 19(24) patients will be needed. Concern about the small sample size led to the decision to prospectively define the historical placebo response rate of 5% as the primary comparator for analysis for this trial. Given the small sample size, it is unclear whether the proportion of placebo responders seen in our small trial would be replicated in a larger experiment. PASI, PGA and gene expression data all supported the primary histological endpoint.</p><p>The role of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-17 in psoriasis pathogenesis is well documented [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the current study, transcriptomic analysis revealed that SRT2104 significantly reduced known IL-17 and TNF&#x003b1; responsive genes including SERPINB4, S100A12, SERPINB3, kynu etc. even though the sample size for this analysis was small. Keratinocytes are a key driver of pathogeneic inflammation through integrating responses to TNF&#x003b1; and IL-17. SRT2104 treatment suppressed keratinocyte differentiation relevant genes including SPRR2c, SERPINB4, and SERPINB3. One of the most highly modulated genes by SRT2104 included Kynu that regulates tryptophan metabolism. Although the precise role of this pathway in psoriasis is unknown, upregulation of tryptophan catabolism has been shown to confer antibacterial effector functions [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly kynu is part of the etanercept molecular scar signature that is not modulated by etanercept therapy even though clinical efficacy is achieved. Possibly, SRT2104 may be modulating the lipid barrier of the epidermis of psoriatic skin via modulation of keratinocyte differentiation genes, which would be consistent with the observed improvement in skin histology. These results indicate a combinatorial effect of SRT2104 on TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-17 inflammatory signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation that could be a contributing factor towards improvement in clinical scores by the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104.</p><p>Exposure for 84 days is the longest treatment duration with SRT2104 to-date. All dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed which would have curtailed dose escalation; however, only subjects treated with SRT2104 withdrew from treatment prior to completing the 84 day regimen. Adverse events were infrequent and typically mild to moderate and included gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, dizziness, psoriatic arthropathy and transaminase elevations.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics were modeled based on a sparse sampling approach. As has been observed in other studies with SRT2104 [<xref rid="pone.0142081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], inter-subject variability was high (AUC %CV &#x0003e; = 50%:) leading us to examine clinical activity using exposure groupings as well as dose level, although in this study average exposure increased in a dose-dependent, but not fully proportional, manner. Because higher levels of SRT2104 in psoriatic lesions were predictive of improvement in PASI, more predictable absorption, and thus more predictable SRT2104 concentration in the skin, could lead to a more predictable level of response.</p><p>The armamentarium of approved treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis includes agents with serious potential side-effects and substantial inconvenience, suggesting that a well tolerated orally-administered treatment could have a place in the therapeutic options for subjects with plaque-type psoriasis. Given the interesting signals of clinical activity, impact on gene expression and the generally favorable safety profile seen in this study, further investigation of SIRT1 activators for the treatment of psoriasis is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>SRT2104 Plasma: Skin Concentration.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>SRT2104 Pharmacokinetic Parameters by Treatment and Exposure groups.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Proportion of Subjects Improvement Based on PGA Score&#x02013;Day 84.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s006"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Top Differentially Expressed Genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142081.s007"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>GSEA Analysis of the Responder Group.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142081.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0142081.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
