In recent decades, health care has tended to be organised by means of problem-based, disease-oriented care programs. However, one disease and/or its intervention could influence the diagnosis, impact or treatment of another disease. These interactions between diseases and their treatment complicate the determination of disease-specific treatment goals. Thus, for older persons with multiple health problems, this model does not suffice [<xref rid="AFV174C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="AFV174C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In these older patients, illness presentation and the consequences of disease are better clarified with integrative disease models rather than by simple medical models [<xref rid="AFV174C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since well-being and providing for oneself without assistance from others is of increasing importance for older patients with multiple health problems [<xref rid="AFV174C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], care for older people needs to shift from problem-based, disease-oriented care aiming at improvement of outcomes per disease to goal-oriented, integrated care. An integrated, care model, aiming at global health outcomes, is more suitable than a model mainly aiming at improving individual disease outcomes [<xref rid="AFV174C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The problems older people face are not always known to care providers. The general practitioner (GP) may sometimes suspect the presence of some of these problems, but usually only acts on demand. Therefore, this model of care should be provided in a proactive way to set and prioritise goals together with the patient and to empower the patient to reach these goals.</p><p>Although this shift in care model sounds ideal in theory, actual implementation in primary care can be difficult. Models that have been investigated range from light interventions to intensive guided care [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFV174C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, until now, no important positive effects have been shown. Also, although some studies examined cost savings, to our knowledge few studies have evaluated cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Two systematic reviews reported on complex or multi-factorial interventions to prevent functional decline and hospitalisation. The review of Beswick <italic>et al</italic>. showed an effect on nursing home admission, hospital admission and physical functioning, and the review of Lin <italic>et al</italic>. showed no benefit on hospitalisations and institutionalisations and a small effect on functional ability. The effect of complex interventions could probably be larger if the people who are most likely to benefit are targeted. Simple and effective screening is therefore needed [<xref rid="AFV174C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the above-mentioned two systematic reviews, the included studies used several selection tools to target the interventions, such as the opinion of the physician about the person's health, computer-assisted predictive index for risk of hospitalisation and functional decline, and tests for physical functioning. Often somatic or physical problems were used to select people for interventions. As we found in our research that complex problems, i.e. the accumulation and interaction of different health problems, also psychological and social health problems, lead to a decline in physical, mental and social functioning [<xref rid="AFV174C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in our study we aimed our intervention at those who have problems in several different health domains. Also the intervention targets multiple health domains.</p><p>The ISCOPE (<bold>I</bold>ntegrated <bold>S</bold>ystematic <bold>C</bold>are for <bold>O</bold>lder <bold>PE</bold>ople) study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a simple structural monitoring system to detect the deterioration in somatic, functional, mental or social health of individuals aged 75 and over followed by the execution of a care plan for those people with a combination of somatic, functional, mental and social problems. The ISCOPE study operationalises horizontal care by developing a care plan for older persons with complex problems, i.e. a combination of functional, somatic (health and illness), mental and/or social problems. The care plan focuses on function rather than on disease and aims to restore, maintain or maximise functional independence, or to compensate for loss of autonomy by appropriate support (functional approach). Although the approach is functional, underlying disease can still be a focus of attention. The goals, wishes and expectations of the older person are the starting point for the care plan [<xref rid="AFV174C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To identify older persons with complex problems proactively, the ISCOPE study uses a simple structural screening and monitoring system to detect deterioration in somatic, functional, mental or social health of individuals aged &#x02265;75, and brings this to the attention of the GP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design overview</title><p>The study is an observer-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the level of the general practice.

In the initial invitation letter, we provided as little information as possible about the intervention to prevent behavioural change in the control group of GPs [<xref rid="AFV174C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Before inviting the older people to participate, we asked GPs to classify all enlisted older people into three categories according to their own perception: (i) not vulnerable, (ii) possibly vulnerable and (iii) vulnerable. The GPs were asked to classify their older people according to their perception of vulnerability of the older person to capture characteristics of the non-responder group. GPs were not provided with a specific definition of vulnerability. Instead, they were asked to indicate &#x02018;in their opinion&#x02019; which of their patients were considered vulnerable in the context of this study [<xref rid="AFV174C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Recruitment of participants</title><p>In the Netherlands, all community-dwelling persons are registered at a GP. During the inclusion period (September 2009 to September 2010), all persons aged &#x02265;75 received an invitation by mail from their GP to participate in the study. The GPs excluded people with terminal illness or an expected life expectancy of &#x02264;3 months. Also included with this invitation were a screening questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv174/-/DC1">Supplementary data, File 1, available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</ext-link>) addressing four domains of health and an informed consent form. All older people who participated in the screening provided written informed consent. After 3 weeks, the non-responders were contacted again by telephone and, if required, were assisted by telephone or visited at home to fill in the screening questionnaire. A total of 7,285 older persons responded by sending in the complete screening questionnaire (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AFV174F1">1</xref>).

A positive answer to two or more questions in a domain led to a positive score on the domain.

Individuals with problems on three as well as four domains were classified as having complex problems which is associated with poor outcomes on disability, feelings of loneliness, health-related quality of life and GP contact time [<xref rid="AFV174C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the intervention practices, the GPs received the results of the screening questionnaire of their own patients.

This care plan consisted of two steps. The first was an inventory of the existing health problems using problem areas as introduced by Bangma, stemming from Dutch rehabilitation medicine: somatic, activities of daily living (ADL), social, mental and communicative problems [<xref rid="AFV174C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The wishes and expectations of the older person about goals to be achieved were explored in a dialogue with the participant and informal caregiver(s). Subsequently, a care plan was made, taking the priorities and goals of the older person and informal caregiver as a starting point (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv174/-/DC1">Supplementary data, File 3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv174/-/DC1">available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</ext-link>). The GP/practice nurse, together with the older person, formulated actions to be taken and evaluation plans for follow-up. Other care professionals were involved where needed (multidisciplinary consultation). For the purpose of the present study, to be able to complete the care plans within the set time period of the study, the participating GPs made care plans for a maximum of 10 randomly chosen participants with complex problems. These care plans were made in a time period of 2&#x02013;3 months. For the other selected participants, care plans could be made after the first 10 randomly chosen participants. For the participants with complex problems who were not selected, usual care was provided. These participants were not included in the final analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p>At baseline and at 1-year follow-up, participants were visited by a research nurse to measure outcomes.

Quality of life was measured by Cantril's ladder that has steps ranging from 0 to 10 [<xref rid="AFV174C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ADL was measured with the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS) [<xref rid="AFV174C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The GARS is a questionnaire that assesses disabilities in competence in nine BADL items and nine instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) items. (range 18&#x02013;72, higher score means more disability).</p><p>These primary outcome measures were chosen, because our ultimate goal was to improve functioning and the ability to live independently.

To evaluate the experiences of the GPs with the screening and care plans, two focus groups were organised (each with four GPs). In both groups, three GPs had extra staff available to enable them to place more focus on the care of their older patients. The first group consisted of GPs who did not manage or only partly managed to complete care plans, and the second group consisted of GPs who completed all the care plans.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2c"><title>Informal caregivers</title><p>At baseline and at 1-year follow-up, informal caregivers were sent a questionnaire about the amount of time spent on care for the older participant (hours per week spent on household activities, personal care and activities outside the house), the burden of this care (score 0&#x02013;10) and their quality of life (score 0&#x02013;10) [<xref rid="AFV174C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Other secondary outcomes</title><p>Cognitive function was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with scores ranging from 0 to 30 points (higher score means less cognitive problems) [<xref rid="AFV174C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The GDS-15 was administered only to participants with an MMSE score &#x02265;18 points.

Based on this result, we decided on a change of 1.0 point as a clinically relevant difference.

A comparison was made of socio-demographic data, diseases (International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes), medication, use of care and the GP's appraisal of vulnerability.

A sensitivity analysis for effectiveness was performed in the group of participants with problems in four domains.

The model included a variable for time of measurement (baseline and 1-year follow-up) and a variable for allocation (with value 0 in control patients and value 1 at 1-year follow-up in intervention group patients). The estimate for time of measurement shows the change in score for the control group. The estimate for the allocation shows the difference in change in score between the intervention and control group. Because we assumed that the intervention would have no effect on mortality (which was confirmed by the analysis on mortality) and we were exploring the effect in those who survived, participants who died during follow-up were excluded from the primary outcome analyses. The LMM analysis corrects for outcomes missing at random.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Analysis of focus groups</title><p>Focus group interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.

GPs experienced more control over the care situation and were more aware of the functioning and wishes of the older people. However, they found the protocolised way of working difficult and suggested that it was perhaps more suited to the practice nurse. Some GPs preferred to focus on the medical task.

Three GPs did not manage to make any care plan at all. The median number of problems, goals and actions in the care plans was 3 (IQR 2&#x02013;4), 4 (2&#x02013;5) and 3 (2&#x02013;5), respectively. The five most prevalent problems were depressive complaints (20% of patients), loneliness/isolation (19%), decreased mobility (19%), memory complaints (17%) and hearing complaints (12%).

The GPs had successfully taken on the functional approach, as seen from the contents of the care plans. GPs experienced better overview of care needs and more stability, e.g. less unexpected care demands, in the care for individual patients with complex problems. Older patients with complex problems were already largely satisfied with the care offered by their GP, and the change in satisfaction was therefore small. Nevertheless, no significant improvement was found in quality of life or functional status after 1-year follow-up in participants with complex problems in the intervention group compared with those in the usual care group. In addition, there was no significant difference in change of somatic problems and mental/social functioning, or in complexity. Except for the care plans, patients in the intervention group had the same amount of healthcare use and costs as the control group.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Comparison with literature</title><p>Two systematic reviews evaluated studies on complex interventions (with individualised assessment and provision, or referral to appropriate care) to prevent functional decline in older people [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="AFV174C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although one review showed a reduction in admissions to hospitals/nursing homes, a reduction in falls and an improvement in functioning, the effects were only modest [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the effects were mainly in studies conducted before 1993, suggesting that modification of care after 1993 was of little additional value; this idea has recently been confirmed [<xref rid="AFV174C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The more recent review showed small effects on functioning, but mainly in studies performed in the USA and not in non-US countries [<xref rid="AFV174C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This latter review showed no effects on hospitalisation, institutionalisation or mortality; in addition, due to significant heterogeneity between the reviewed studies, the net benefit could not be determined [<xref rid="AFV174C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two other systematic reviews on comprehensive care programs for people with multi-morbidity were also unable to determine net benefit due to heterogeneity [<xref rid="AFV174C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="AFV174C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The present study also examined the cost-effectiveness and preferences of GPs and older persons which, until now, have scarcely been investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The ISCOPE study was performed in a large number of practices in urbanised and sub-urbanised areas, involving single-handed practices and group practices, thereby guaranteeing generalisability to other practices in the Netherlands. Outcomes were measured during home visits, thereby increasing the reliability and completeness of the measurements. Because &#x0223c;37% of the older people did not participate in the ISCOPE study, this could have led to a selection of healthier (or perhaps less healthy) older persons or people more likely to accept the suggested intervention. A non-response evaluation showed that non-participants were slightly more vulnerable than the participants; this difference might decrease with more extensive reminding procedures.</p><p>Although only three GPs were unable to make any care plan, we have no data on the fidelity to the intervention after the initial establishment of the care plan. This might have been an issue contributing to the lack of effect.</p><p>We were unable to obtain repeated assessments over a longer period. Repeated assessments might have amplified the proactive aspect of the intervention, possibly leading to a detectable effect on the outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Possible reasons for no effect in functioning</title><p>There are a few possible reasons for the lack of effect on the functioning of older persons in the present study. First, many changes in the care for older people in primary care have been instigated since the early 1990s [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The present study started in a climate of growing interest in preventive and proactive care for older people, which ensured enthusiasm among participating GPs; government and care professionals were already moving in this direction. In 2007, the National Program for Elderly Care was set up, aiming to improve the quality of care for older people by developing coherent care better suited to the individual needs of older persons (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nationaalprogrammaouderenzorg.nl/english/the-national-care-for-the-elderly-programme/">http://www.nationaalprogrammaouderenzorg.nl/english/the-national-care-for-the-elderly-programme/</uri>). Although this climate of change implies that GPs were keen to participate in this study, no extra provisions (i.e. financial compensation to implement proactive care for older people) were yet in place; this keeps the risk of contamination in the usual care practices low. However, GPs (also in the control group) might have had an increased awareness of the need to work proactively for their older patients, as policy reports on this subject were issued in 2007 and 2010 (mission statements of the Dutch College of General Practice (DCGP) (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://nhg.artsennet.nl/English.htm">http://nhg.artsennet.nl/English.htm</uri>) and of the Royal Dutch Medical Association (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://knmg.artsennet.nl/Over-KNMG/About-KNMG.htm">http://knmg.artsennet.nl/Over-KNMG/About-KNMG.htm</uri>), and a guideline for the care for older people in general practice issued by the DCGP (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://nhg.artsennet.nl/English.htm">http://nhg.artsennet.nl/English.htm</uri>).</p><p>Second, unsolicited care programs or other devices might not work, because those who would expect benefit from the offered service or device have already obtained it [<xref rid="AFV174C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFV174C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, because the initiative for a care plan did not originate from the participant, executing the plan did not bring the desired changes.</p><p>Third, interventions targeted at specific risk factor management may be more effective than organisational interventions with a broader focus [<xref rid="AFV174C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="AFV174C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Indeed, the focus of our intervention may have been too broad and may have diluted the effect of each particular outcome measure, thus reducing the power to detect a difference. For this reason, we used quality of life as primary outcome, and we also investigated combined scores of questionnaires as a secondary outcome; however, this also revealed no effect of the intervention.</p><p>Fourth, the intervention may not have been sufficiently intense to be able to cause effect. However, one meta-analysis demonstrated that the intensity of the complex interventions made no difference to its effectiveness [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Possibly, the participants were relatively healthy with little room for improvement. However, a sensitivity analysis in the group with problems in four domains also failed to show an effect.</p><p>Five, a change in approach in organisation and delivery of care does not necessarily lead to effects on the level of functioning or quality of life of the patient. The two meta-analyses showed no positive effect on functioning of any of the interventions, possibly due to the use of non-responsive ADL and IADL instruments [<xref rid="AFV174C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="AFV174C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Perhaps outcomes related to healthcare delivery, such as patient experience with continuity of care [<xref rid="AFV174C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or more individualised outcomes such as goal attainment scaling [<xref rid="AFV174C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], might have elicited more response than traditional outcome measures of functioning [<xref rid="AFV174C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFV174C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Unfortunately, at the start of the present study, these latter outcomes were not widely available for practical use in research with community-dwelling older people but might be promising for use in future studies.</p><p>Six, a randomised trial may not be appropriate for this sort of interventions as the services offered comprise a complex mix of uncontrollable variables embedded in a social process, more than a treatment program alone [<xref rid="AFV174C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The success of the offered services depends on factors other than functioning (such as building a relationship with the client, the perceived need for care, past experiences with health care, etc.) which cannot be measured or controlled in such a way as to meet the requirements of randomised controlled trials. The increase in satisfaction with care among both the older people and the GPs might reflect these factors. Although failure to show an effect should not be used solely as an excuse to discontinue the service, it remains important to find evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of new ways of working.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications</title><p>The question remains as to which outcomes will convince healthcare professionals and policymakers in their decision-making regarding implementation of an intervention. The present study showed no beneficial effect on functioning and quality of life of older persons or on healthcare costs; therefore, this integrated care model cannot be recommended for this particular goal. Nevertheless, in the Netherlands, healthcare organisation for older people in general practice has assumed its own momentum. GPs are increasingly interested and motivated to implement proactive care to prevent functional decline in vulnerable older persons [<xref rid="AFV174C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and see this as an improvement of their care. Since 2011, health insurers in the Netherlands have provided funding to GPs to innovate services towards proactive care for older people, encompassing two main elements: case finding and care plans. This lack of congruence between research and policy is an issue that should receive more attention.</p><p>Integrative and proactive care for older community-dwelling people will probably be an essential instrument in primary care to be able to manage the care since (in the present political climate) the need to cut costs results in more older people living independently in the community rather than in care homes, but still requiring health care. This study also shows that GPs working with a proactive care plan report the benefit of increased stability in the care of older persons. We think that horizontal care using care plans for older people with complex problems can be a valuable tool in general practice. However, since no direct beneficial effect was found for older persons, based on this study, we cannot recommend this intervention to improve patient outcomes in general practice.
