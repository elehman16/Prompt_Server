The effect of equicarbohydrate partial exchange of kiwifruit varieties &#x02018;Hayward&#x02019; green (GR) and &#x02018;Zesy002&#x02019; (SunGold; SG) for a starchy wheat-based breakfast cereal (WB) on the characteristics of the postprandial glycaemic response and satiety was therefore determined. A total of twenty non-diabetic subjects (mean age 36 years; mean BMI 24&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) consumed four meals, each containing 40&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate, in random order, after an overnight fast. The meals were: (1) glucose; (2) 70&#x000b7;29&#x000a0;g breakfast cereal; (3) 200&#x000a0;g of GR plus breakfast cereal (30&#x000b7;93&#x000a0;g); and (4) 200&#x000a0;g of SG plus breakfast cereal (27&#x000b7;06&#x000a0;g). Throughout the 180&#x000a0;min postprandial period, capillary blood glucose concentrations were monitored, and satiety rated by a visual analogue scale. Partial kiwifruit substitution of WB significantly reduced postprandial glycaemic response amplitude (glucose, 3&#x000b7;91; WB, 3&#x000b7;66; WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;GR, 2&#x000b7;36; WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SG, 2&#x000b7;31&#x000a0; mmol/l; least significant difference (LSD) 0&#x000b7;64; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001) and incremental area under the blood glucose response curve (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min) (glucose, 228; WB, 180; WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;GR, 133; WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SG, 134&#x000a0;mmol/l&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;min; LSD 22&#x000b7;7; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001). The area between baseline and response remained positive in kiwifruit-substituted meals but became negative after 120&#x000a0;min with glucose and WB, indicating that kiwifruit improved homeostatic control. Kiwifruit substitution of cereal did not significantly reduce satiety. We conclude that either &#x02018;Hayward&#x02019; or &#x02018;Zesy002&#x02019; kiwifruit may be used in equicarbohydrate partial substitution of starchy staple foods to reduce glycaemic response and improve glucose homeostasis without decreasing satiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Glycaemic response</kwd><kwd>Carbohydrate exchanges</kwd><kwd>Kiwifruit</kwd><kwd>Appetite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>GI, glycaemic index</kwd><kwd>GR, <italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic> &#x02018;Hayward&#x02019; (marketed as Zespri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Green Kiwifruit)</kwd><kwd>SG, <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic> &#x02018;Zesy002&#x02019; (marketed as Zespri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SunGold Kiwifruit)</kwd><kwd>VAS, visual analogue scale</kwd><kwd>WB, wheat-based breakfast cereal</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The acute glycaemic response to digestible carbohydrates in foods has been associated with a range of medical conditions<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Blood glucose is known to cause diffuse and progressive damage to tissues and control systems throughout the body in the processes of glycation and glycaemia-induced oxidation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Intense insulin demand evoked by rapid postprandial increases in blood glucose is also believed to be harmful, by placing a burden on the &#x003b2;-cells of the pancreas<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and by the action of insulin as an active regulatory hormone. The intense production of insulin can lead to a hypoglycaemic overcompensation after the insulin-stimulated return of blood glucose to baseline. In the hypoglycaemic state, a number of physiological systems may be adversely affected, including appetite control and cognition<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With a growing global incidence of glucose intolerance, associated with obesity and ageing<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, there is an increasing demand for foods and approaches that can be used in the practical dietary management of postprandial glycaemia. One of the strategies that has been used in dietetic practice is to substitute highly glycaemic carbohydrates in the diet with less glycaemic carbohydrates using the &#x02018;carbohydrate exchange&#x02019; system<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. However, rather than simply substitute one carbohydrate source for another, it would be beneficial if the exchange could be used as an opportunity to improve the nutrient profile of the diet by including nutrient-rich carbohydrate products such as fruit, particularly as many fruit constituents may have a role in ameliorating the effects of glycaemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Even outside the context of carbohydrate exchange, it is valuable for consumers to be able to gauge the likely relative effect that fruit is likely to have on glycaemic response.</p><p>In a previous study (JA Monro, H Edwards, S Mishra, D Hedderley and J Podd, unpublished results) of the effects of kiwifruit on the blood glucose response to a glycaemic breakfast cereal, we found that breakfast cereal plus kiwifruit caused a lower glycaemic response than breakfast cereal plus the same amount of sugars, of the same monosaccharide composition, as in the kiwifruit. The kiwifruit was able to significantly reduce the amplitude of the response and the area under the blood glucose response curve between 0 and 120&#x000a0;min, and eliminated the hypoglycaemic reaction between 120 and 180&#x000a0;min. Therefore, the kiwifruit appeared to be having an effect on the blood glucose response profile by mechanisms unrelated to its sugar component, but possibly related to other factors such as organic acids, phenolics and dietary fibre properties that might differ between cultivars.</p><p>In diet management to minimise exposure to glycaemia and control energy intake, sugar-rich foods such as fruit should ideally be included by equicarbohydrate substitution, rather than being added to the customary diet. The fruit carbohydrate should replace a carbohydrate of equal or higher glycaemic index to avoid increasing glycaemic response.When the substitution involves kiwifruit partially substituting readily digested starch in a processed cereal-based product, such as wheat biscuit (glycaemic index (GI)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70), one could expect a substantial lowering of the glycaemic response, because the fruit sugars are approximately half fructose (GI of about 22)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and other components of the fruit further reduce glycaemic response, as discussed above, giving whole kiwifruit a low GI of about 50<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, a possible consequence of reducing glycaemic impact, and of replacing a proportion of glucose by fructose as a result of partially substituting kiwifruit for breakfast cereal, is that the satiating effect of the meal may be reduced. Appetite is thought to be partially controlled by blood glucose concentrations<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and fructose has been reported to be less satiating than glucose<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. If so, it is possible that kiwifruit substiutution could lead indirectly to reduced satiety and increased energy intakes.</p><p>The aim of the present study was, therefore, to determine the extent to which equicarbohydrate partial substitution of a starchy staple by kiwifruit in a meal would lower meal glycaemic impact, and the extent to which satiety would be affected by the substitution. A secondary aim was to compare the relative effectiveness of the kiwifruit cultivars &#x02018;Hayward&#x02019; and &#x02018;Zesy002&#x02019; with respect to reducing glycaemic impact and maintaining satiety.</p><sec sec-type="materialsandmethods" id="sec1"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Meal components</title><p><italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic> &#x02018;Hayward&#x02019; (marketed as Zespri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Green Kiwifruit) (GR) and <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic> &#x02018;Zesy002&#x02019; (marketed as Zespri<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SunGold Kiwifruit) (SG) kiwifruit were provided by Zespri Group Ltd, Tauranga, New Zealand, in a ready-to-eat state of ripeness, and processed within a few days of receipt. They were peeled and the hard apical core removed from the green kiwifruit, then halved and frozen (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C). The frozen fruit were allowed to thaw partially and were then crushed to a coarse pulp by briefly (10&#x000a0;s) chopping in a Halde food processor. The pulp was then divided accurately into individual 200&#x000a0;g portions, each stored within a plastic, capped, freezer-proof sundae container until required.</p><p>The wheat-based, high-starch, low-sugar breakfast cereal was a commonly consumed commercial whole wheat biscuit (Weet-Bix&#x02122;, Sanitarium), purchased from a supermarket (WB).

and appetite</title><p>All four subjective VAS measures of satiety and appetite gave very similar profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). The scores on the four dimensions were also combined for each meal, for each individual, to obtain individual overall satiety scores that were used for statistical analysis. The VAS scores are directly related to appetite/hunger: the higher the score, the greater the hunger. The glucose reference had a small impact. In the meals in which kiwifruit substituted part of the WB, and in the WB meal, all of which contained 40&#x000a0;g of available carbohydrate, appetite immediately after consuming the foods was suppressed to a similar degree, but slightly though not significantly more by WB than by kiwifruit-substituted WB. Given that over 50&#x000a0;% of the WB had been substituted by kiwifruit, and that the volumes of the meal had been made similar by adjusting water intake, satiety was reduced little by partially exchanging cereal for kiwifruit.

The results show that kiwifruit-based carbohydrate exchanges led to a substantial reduction in glycaemic response. This reduction is likely to have resulted from a combination of the effects of digestion-resistant non-carbohydrate components of kiwifruit with the effect of replacing starch with fructose, which has a much lower intrinsic glycaemic potency than glucose derived from starch. In the present study the meals were made equicarbohydrate with respect to carbohydrate released after digestion, so the increase in carbohydrate mass on hydrolysis of starch to sugar had been allowed for.</p><p>In a previous study we showed <italic>in vitro</italic> that under gastrointestinal conditions, and at relevant concentrations, cell wall remnants (dietary fibre) of kiwifruit were able to reduce glucose diffusion rate and luminal mixing, each by about 40&#x000a0;%<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Both processes are involved in the transfer of digestion products to the gut wall for absorption. At a micro level, reduced diffusion and mixing will retard processes such as enzyme movement and end product transfer, resulting in a reduced rate of digestion. In addition to dietary fibre a range of secondary metabolite compounds not measured in the present study have been shown to be present in kiwifruit<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and some of them may affect glycaemic response. Organic acids in kiwifruit flesh<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, which has a pH of about 3&#x000b7;4, may contribute to a reduced glycaemic response by lowering rates of gastric emptying<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Phenolics present in kiwifruit may also contribute to a suppression of the glycaemic response by a number of mechanisms, as has been demonstrated in a range of plant-based foods<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Such properties are not unique to kiwifruit, but are likely to be manifested by many of the fruits and vegetables that contribute functionally beneficial components to the diet.</p><p>Nonetheless, kiwifruit have a very high density of nutrients such as vitamin C<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, and as they become widely consumed in Asian countries, which are also facing an epidemic of diabetes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, it is important to show how they may be incorporated into the diet to increase nutrient intake while not exacerbating glycaemia. Equicarbohydrate exchange, as the present paper shows, is an effective strategy to concurrently achieve both an increase in nutrient intake and a decrease in glycaemic impact. It may therefore be beneficial in both decreasing exposure to glycaemia and in protecting against the long-term damage that it may cause.</p><p>It has been suggested that fructose is highly lipogenic, partly because fructose does not have the satiating capacity of glucose<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the results presented here have shown either that the quantity of fructose consumed in two kiwifruit was not sufficient to reduce satiety when exchanged for glucose, or that other kiwifruit components with satiating activity counteracted any reduction in satiety.</p><p>There is also evidence that fructose is highly lipogenic because it takes a more direct metabolic pathway to lipogenesis than glucose. It has even been suggested that high fructose intakes are partly responsible for the current epidemic of obesity and the metabolic syndrome<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. In the context of kiwifruit-based carbohydrate exchanges, the dietary increase in fructose as a result of including two kiwifruit per d would be about 12&#x000a0;g/d. As long as other sources of fructose in the diet are not excessive, an additional 12&#x000a0;g is unlikely to be harmful, particularly when, as in the present case, it is the result of almost isoenergetic equicarbohydrate exchange of two carbohydrate foods, with no loss of satiety. Furthermore, there is evidence that fructose acts cooperatively to encourage glucose disposal, and that there is nothing intrinsically harmful about fructose <italic>per se</italic> when consumed in the quantities and in the glucose:fructose ratios that would be supplied by fruit and vegetables in a healthy diet<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to lowering dietary glycaemic impact, inclusion of kiwifruit by partial substitution of a starch-based staple such as noodles or rice would alter the nutrient profile of the diet, increasing intakes of vitamin C, K, vitamin E and antioxidants and a range of other nutrients, all in a low-energy-density format of fresh fruit.</p><p>As all meals used in the present study were of equal available carbohydrate content (40&#x000a0;g), it is possible to estimate GI values for the carbohydrates in the meals from the 120&#x000a0;min iAUC given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab05">Table 5</xref>. Compared with glucose (GI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) the GI of the wheat biscuit was 78&#x000b7;9, and after partial substitution with kiwifruit the GI values were reduced to 58&#x000b7;5 for WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;GR and 59 for WB&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SG. The GI values are estimates because the carbohydrate quantity used was 40&#x000a0;g, whereas the standard quantity for determination of GI is stipulated as 25&#x000a0;g, or more commonly 50&#x000a0;g of available carbohydrate (Australian Standard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> AS 4694-2007)<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the present study was about the relative glycaemic effects of meals expressed as glucose equivalents, because people eat foods and meals, and not simply the carbohydrates in them. The results will be most accurate and relevant when based on customarily consumed intakes.</p><p>The serving size given on the wheat biscuit nutrient information panel is 33&#x000a0;g (two biscuits). With an available carbohydrate content of 56&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;% measured in the present study, a serving would deliver 18&#x000b7;8&#x000a0;g of available carbohydrate. A 50&#x000a0;g intake of available carbohydrate would require that 2&#x000b7;7 servings be consumed, compared with 2&#x000b7;1 servings for the 40&#x000a0;g available carbohydrate intake used in the present study. Also, GI as a measure of relative glycaemic potency of carbohydrate in a food is likely to be slightly more accurate with a glucose reference intake of 40&#x000a0;g than 50&#x000a0;g, because error due to the non-linearity of the glucose equivalent dose&#x02013;glycaemic response curve will be less at lower glucose equivalent doses<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Overall, the results indicate that inclusion of kiwifruit in diets by equicarbohydrate substitution of highly digestible starch components, to enrich the diets functionally and nutritionally, will also lead to glycaemic benefits. At the least, despite the perception of kiwifruit as a sweet-flavoured fruit, there is no indication that consuming it will have a negative glycaemic impact when it is introduced to a diet without increasing the available carbohydrate load.</p><p>This paper has been about the interaction of kiwifruit and breakfast cereal in glycaemic response. Although it is relevant to dietary management in diabetes, the gut-level mechanisms involved are likely to be very similar in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Thus the relative effects of kiwifruit are likely to be similar, although the absolute blood glucose responses would no doubt be greater in a diabetic cohort. The promising findings in the research with healthy individuals presented here should, nonetheless, be repeated with a diabetic cohort.</p><p>A possible limitation of the present study is that the kiwifruit was stored as a frozen slurry, to standardise serving size and stage of ripeness, whereas kiwifruit are mostly consumed as whole fruit. However, it is most likely that the kiwifruit consumed as fresh fruit would have had a lower glycaemic effect than observed for the frozen kiwifruit preparations consumed in the present study, due to the influence of fruit tissue structure, which suggests that the present findings are robust. In further studies concurrent measurement of insulin responses may help better interpretation of the effects of kiwifruit, and there remains a need for research to quantify the roles of the various non-available carbohydrate components &#x02013; phenolics, dietary fibre, organic acids &#x02013; whose glycaemic response-lowering effects appear to be superimposed on the effect of substituting fructose for glucose derived from starch.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Zespri International Limited for funding the research reported here.
