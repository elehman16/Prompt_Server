Multiple reviews have been performed of the available data.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Many data from pre-clinical models provide support for the benefits of PRP in augmenting osseous union and some authors conclude there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate proof of principle.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, other authors conclude that the evidence remains ambiguous as numerous studies, particularly when considering clinical trials in people, fail to provide consistent or convincing evidence of benefit.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Contradictory results from different studies and contradictory conclusions from different reviews preclude making a general conclusion as to whether PRP is likely to augment bone healing.</p><p>Some of the possible reasons for discrepant results include investigation in different species, use of PRP with different bone defect or fracture models, use of different PRP products, and use of different outcome measures to assess efficacy. All of these variable have likely contributed to the extreme heterogeneity in the data available.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] As a result, further research is needed to determine which specific types of PRP may be beneficial in improving bone healing and in which specific medical conditions. In order to address this issue there is a need for well-controlled experiments using thoroughly characterized PRP products, including in preclinical animal models.</p><p>Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture with osteotomy in client-owned pet dogs provides a potentially useful and unique opportunity for assessing the effects of PRP on bone healing. Naturally-occurring rupture of the (ACL) is extremely common with one report estimating that 1.2 million surgeries are performed each year in the USA to treat ACL rupture in dogs.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] High tibial osteotomy, and more specifically tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO), is one of the most commonly performed surgeries to treat dogs with ACL rupture.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This surgery involves performing a metaphyseal rotational osteotomy to decrease the tibial plateau angle (posterior tibial slope), thus minimizing femorotibial subluxation and helping dogs cope with being ACL-deficient (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g002">2</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Although results with this procedure are usually good, complications can include delayed osseous union, nonunion, and mechanical failure with loss of reduction prior to attainment of osseous union, similar to HTO in human patients.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Accordingly, if PRP were effective in enhancing the rate of osseous union it would have clinical utility for dogs treated with TPLO. In addition, should PRP augment bone healing in dogs treated with TPLO, a human PRP with similar characteristics would be worthy of investigation for its potential application in people.</p><fig id="pone.0177597.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0177597.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Representative medial-lateral radiographs for one dog pre-operatively, immediate post operatively, and 4, 7, and 10 weeks post operatively.</title><p>Caudal femoral subluxation is apparent on the pre-operative medial-lateral view and is resolved on all subsequent medial-lateral views.

This study was approved by the Clinical Research Committee at the University of Georgia and all owners provided written consent for enrollment of their dogs. Enrollment criteria included that the dog needed to be diagnosed as having ACL rupture based upon orthopedic examination and pre-operative radiography as is routinely performed for dogs with ACL rupture. Further, all dogs were between 2 and 10 years of age and weighed at least 25 kilograms. All dogs needed to have a tibia that was of appropriate size to be treated with a 21 mm radius TPLO saw blade and stabilized with a 6-hole custom 3.5 TPLO plate. All dogs were free of any other medical problems and were not receiving any medications at the time of TPLO.</p><p>Enrolled dogs were randomly assigned to either the treatment (PRP) or control (saline) group using a random number generator. All dogs were anesthetized using the same anesthetic medication protocol including pre-medication with 0.005 mg/kg body weight of dexmedetomidine (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) and 0.1 mg/kg of hydromorphone (Hospira Inc, Lake Forest, IL). Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg/kg of Ketamine (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL) and 0.25 mg/kg of diazepam (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) and maintained with Isoflurane (Piramal, Bethlehem, PA).</p><p>Once anesthetized, and immediately preceding surgery, an 18-gauge 2-inch intravenous catheter was aseptically placed in a jugular vein for those dogs included in the PRP group. Fifty-two mls of blood was collected into two 60-ml syringes preloaded with 8mls of ACD-A to provide a total volume of 120 ml of anticoagulated blood. A 0.5 ml aliquot of this blood was mixed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then assessed to characterize the cellular concentrations in the whole blood using an automated hemacytometer (Element HT5, Heska Corporation, Loveland, CO). The sample was mixed with EDTA prior to assessment of the cellular composition as some evidence suggests that use of EDTA prior to analysis optimizes platelet enumeration.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The remaining anticoagulated blood was used to prepare PRP using a commercially available system (Angel System, Arthrex Vet Systems; Naples, FL) using the manual function and visually distributing the red blood cell, platelet-poor plasma, and PRP fractions. After preparation, an aliquot of the PRP was similarly mixed with EDTA and assessed using the same hemacytometer similar to previous work.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>After blood acquisition and while the PRP was being prepared, surgery was commenced including arthroscopic evaluation of the affected stifle and intra-articular structures including the ACL and menisci. Ruptured ACLs were debrided and torn menisci were treated with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Immediately following joint inspection the TPLO was performed. All surgeries were performed by the principal investigator and specific attributes of the surgical procedure were standardized for all dogs. These attributes include that no elevation of the soft tissue envelope from the posterior or lateral aspects of the tibia with packing of gauze was performed. No dogs had simultaneous correction of either torsional or varus/valgus malalignment. The same TPLO saw blade was used in all dogs and saline irrigation during osteotomy performance was consistent for all dogs. Standardized locking titanium bone plates and screws were used in all dogs.</p><p>After the osteotomy was made it was distracted to enable placement of the activated PRP gel or lavage with saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In order to create the PRP gel 5,000 IU of bovine thrombin (Thrombin-JMI<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer, New York) was re-constituted with 5 ml of 10% calcium chloride solution (Ansyr<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, Hospira/Pfizer, New York) to create an activation solution. The PRP was then mixed with this solution in a 10:1 ratio based upon PRP volume (PRP:activation solution) to form a malleable PRP gel, also referred to as a platelet-rich fibrin matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g003">Fig 3</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The PRP and activator were manually mixed in a sterile glass blood tube for approximately 10&#x02013;30 seconds as gel formation proceeded. Approximately 90% or more of the PRP was subjectively incorporated within the fibrin gel with relatively little (less than 10%) liquid PRP releasate. The PRP gel was manually introduced into the osteotomy site at the time of surgery in all cases treated with PRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The osteotomy site was distracted and irrigated with saline in control patients. The osteotomy was then reduced and stabilized using a commercially un-available titanium 6-hole locking TPLO plate (Arthrex Vet Systems, Naples, FL) and 1 cortical and 5 locking titanium screws (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177597.g002">2</xref>). Compression of the osteotomy was performed using the single hole in the bone plate distal to the osteotomy that allows for placement of a cortical bone screw in the load position with 5 locking screws placed in the other holes; all screws were bicortical.</p><fig id="pone.0177597.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0177597.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>The activated PRP immediately after it has formed a malleable gel and with placement into the distracted osteotomy.</title><p>Note that the osteotomy would be reduced and stabilized following distraction and PRP placement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0177597.g003"/></fig><p>Following surgery, post-operative orthogonal posterior-anterior and medial-lateral tibial radiographs were made to confirm appropriate surgical performance.

The one-tailed t-tests demonstrated significantly greater 12-point radiographic healing at 7 and 10 weeks with use of PRP. However, the repeated measures analysis of covariance provided a more thorough analysis of explanatory variables that might have affected outcome using the radiographic and ultrasonographically acquired data. Those analyses showed that the only significant predictors of outcome were time since surgery and patient age. Even though there was not a significant difference between the two treatment groups with regards to body weight, gender, or age, the mean age of patients in the treatment group was slightly less than that in the control group. As a result, it seems likely that the small, and potentially clinically irrelevant, differences in radiographic scores seen between the two treatment groups at the 7 and 10 week time points was likely attributable to small differences in patient age rather than use of PRP. Accordingly, we reject our hypothesis that use of this specific PRP formulation would speed bone healing in dogs treated with a high tibial osteotomy.</p><p>With the aforementioned conclusion stated, it is worth considering the attributes and limitations of this study. Given the limitations of clinical research, this was a well-controlled study with a substantial number of dogs, the dogs treated in this study are similar in age and weight to those dogs typically treated with TPLO,[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and that the statistically insignificant (or marginally significant) differences in radiographic healing scores between the two groups were small at all time points (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177597.t004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177597.t005">5</xref>). Further, significant effects of time since surgery and age (radiographically) were detected for all radiographic (5-point and 12-point) and ultrasonographic (cortical, callus, and power Doppler) measures of healing. Given that both time since surgery and animal age are biologically plausible explanatory variables affecting bone healing, these results provide some evidence that the outcome measures were valid in addition to being derived from clinically relevant modalities. In turn, we do not believe that the outcome measures were insensitive or use of a greater number of dogs would elucidate a clinically relevant benefit of this type of PRP for dogs treated with TPLO. This conclusion is based in part on the opinion that differences in radiographic healing scores of &#x02264; 0.2 (5-point scale) or &#x02264;1.01 (12-point scale) do not justify the use of this PRP in dogs treated with TPLO. However, it is possible with inclusion of a greater number of dogs that the effect of treatment could become statistically significant, albeit it is difficult to assess the number of dogs needed for a multivariate analysis that accounts for repeated measures over time and covariates such as age, body weight, and body condition score.</p><p>In addition to the possibility of a type II statistical error, there are several possible reasons that this study failed to provide evidence of augmented bone healing using PRP. One possible explanation for the lack of a significant treatment effect is that the elution of anabolic growth factors from activated PRP gels are transient.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Visser <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) demonstrated that elution of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 eluted from canine platelet-rich fibrin membranes and matrices was greatest within the first 24 hours and was essentially negligible by 5 days.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Using the specific PRP production and activation methodology as was used in this study, we similarly identified that elution of both TGF-&#x003b2;1 and PDGF-BB was greatest in the first 24 hours and substantially lower by day 3 in vitro and virtually negligible by day 5 (data not shown). As a result, the possible benefits of PRP on bone regeneration may be hampered by fleeting delivery of anabolic growth factors.</p><p>A second possible reason that this study did not provide evidence of enhanced bone healing with use of PRP is that we performed a high tibial osteotomy that results in substantial bone apposition in a group of healthy patients scheduled for an elective surgery. With substantial bone apposition in a healthy groups of patients osseous healing proceeded uneventfully in the control group. Further, the lack of a gap probably mitigates identification of enhanced bone regeneration, which can be visualized more easily within a gap or defect.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Likewise, we obtained no histologic or mechanical data to assess the effects of PRP as these were client-owned dogs. Although these latter outcomes measures may increase the possibility of detecting a significant difference between groups they are not clinically applicable, whether in dogs or people.</p><p>A third possible explanation for an inability to identify a treatment effect is that we used a heterogeneous population of study subjects. This characteristic of the study potentially decreased sensitivity in comparison to if an experimental study were performed in which breed, age, weight, body condition score, and gender were uniform using a population of purpose-bred research dogs. Likewise, although the same post-operative activity restriction was advised for all dogs included in this study there is likely variability in post-operative activity of client-owned dogs that could be more rigorously standardized with purpose-bred research dogs. However, the inclusion of clinically-relevant heterogeneity is also a desirable characteristic of this study as it provided a relevant representation of clinical practice in which heterogeneity exists, whether treating canine or human patients</p><p>A fourth possible reason for failure to augment bone healing could pertain to the specific PRP that was used in this study. At least two studies have demonstrated that the concentration of calcium in collagen gels and PRP scaffolds affect mouse osteoblast and human umbilical stem cell viability with higher concentrations of calcium having negative effects on cellular viability.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177597.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Specifically, use of 10% calcium chloride solution combined with PRP in a 1:10 ratio were associated with less umbilical stem cell viability than use of a lower concentration (2.5%) of calcium chloride with the PRP scaffold.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In this study, we used 10% calcium chloride combined with thrombin in a 1:10 ratio for PRP activation, similar to the higher concentration used in the aforementioned study.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In addition, bovine thrombin is known to induce immune or inflammatory reactions in people and rodents.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The use of bovine thrombin in this study may have induced an immune or inflammatory response that could have precluded benefit with use of the PRP. Further, high platelet concentrations in PRP are not always beneficial and some studies have shown that higher platelet or growth factor concentrations are detrimental to tendon and bone healing.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177597.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] We used PRP with a high platelet concentration and this may have precluded any benefit of such treatment.</p><p>Although the results of this study fail to demonstrate a benefit of bone healing, it is important to not extrapolate these results to conclude that PRP cannot have any positive effect on bone regeneration. Conclusions made based upon studies of PRP should remain specific to the species studied, the medical condition or model in which the investigation was performed, the characteristics of the PRP, and with consideration to the outcome measures used. While understanding those guidelines and the inability to draw definitive conclusions that extrapolate to other species, but also considering the possible translational relevance of this study, these data do not support investigation of a similar human PRP in conjunction with a well-apposed and rigidly stabilized osteotomy in people, such as a closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy. This latter conclusion is obviously tenuous because this study was performed in dogs and not people. However, these results and this latter conclusion is at least consistent with numerous clinical studies in people that fail to identify a positive effect of PRP on bone healing, even when open fracture gaps and open osteotomies are considered.[<xref rid="pone.0177597.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Rather, further studies should likely be performed in relevant models or human clinical populations in which bone loss, fracture gaps, or delayed union are present so as to optimize the likelihood of identifying a treatment effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177597.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Ultrasonography scores.</title><p>This file includes all the ultrasonography scores for all dogs included in this study including scores of cortical bone healing, assessment of healing callus, and power doppler assessment.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177597.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177597.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>MRI scores.</title><p>This file includes all collected MRI data.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177597.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177597.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Radiographic scores.</title><p>This file includes all radiographic scores for assessment of fracture healing.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177597.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177597.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>This file includes the completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177597.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lynn Reece, Lisa Reno, Ethan Karstedt, Kathleen Hoover, Dr. Melissa Smith, Dr. Francisco Guevara, Kate Birdwhistell, Hallie Wachsmuth, Zachary Kaminsky, Jessica Posey, McKenzie Towe, and Larsen Vaughn for assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0177597.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Templeman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Weinlein</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Nonunion of the Femur and Tibia: An Update</article-title>. <source>The Orthopedic clinics of North America</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>47</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>365</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>75</lpage>.
