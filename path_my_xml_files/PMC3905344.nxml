Recent evidence of epidemiology studies has shown the necessity for diagnosing and curing these patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Dysthymic disorder is a prevalent disorder with the estimated prevalence rate of between 3% and 6%. Thirty-six percent of the psychiatric outpatients suffer from dysthymic disorder and a considerable number of those who refer to primary healthcare centers suffer from this disorder. Thus, annual costs of these patients are higher than those who do not have comorbidity with dysthymia disorder.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Inefficiency of medications or controversy over their efficiency for curing mild and chronic depressions[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have led to the application of non-medication treatments for these patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapies have been introduced as one of the most effective therapies for severe depression disorder and dysthymia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, some studies have questioned its efficiency for curing dysthymia and some others have considered it the same as placebo.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Although, cognitive-behavioral therapies have been known as one of the effective therapies for clinically depressed patients,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] cognitive-behavioral therapies may not have equal effects for the patients with different cultural and religious backgrounds.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Almost all authorities agree that cultural variables are important for the diagnosis and treatment of mood problems. In fact, the ignorance of cultural differences in clinical studies not only is mismanagement in research policy but also results in serious misinterpretations of the findings of clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Increasing studies of psychiatry, spirituality and religion deal with the necessity of mixing original religious teachings and cultural beliefs and convictions related to health in psychotherapeutic strategies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] On this basis, different psychotherapeutic models have been created in different cultures by integrating psychotherapy and religious teachings. Some examples of these approaches include religious cognitive-behavioral therapy model for curing depression disorder,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] spiritually focused therapy,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] religious psychotherapist plan for depression and anxiety[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and spiritually augmented cognitive behavioral therapy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Strengthening effectiveness of conventional psychotherapies with spiritual teaching is increasingly considered in eastern and Islamic countries. One can name mixed cultural-religious psychotherapy model for curing depression and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Controlled clinical trials of efficacy and their better adequacy compared to similar non-religious therapies have been demonstrated for the Muslim population.</p><p>Many systematic review studies have been conducted to study the point whether religious psychotherapy reduces depression and anxiety in patients with religious backgrounds and how consistent its effects can be. In this systematic review, random and semi-random controlled clinical studied were entered. The results showed that: Religious psychotherapy (RPT) was a reliable approach for psychotherapy and its effectiveness in the treatment of depression and anxiety was comparable to other therapies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Religious psychotherapy accelerated improvement of depression and anxiety symptoms and reduced psychological problems of psychosomatic patients.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This model had more effectiveness in terms of reducing symptoms and preventing from the relapse of depression periods.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nevertheless, some studies have shown that this psychotherapy model has not been different from other therapies during the 6 months follow-up stages.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This clinical trial was conducted considering the current challenge in terms of the adequacy of cognitive-behavioral therapies for curing dysthymic patients and the necessity of strengthening psychotherapy with cultural and spiritual backgrounds on the one hand and the ambiguity in its stable effects and adequacy in different cultures. Thus, in order to answer these controversy, the aim of this study was to compare efficacy of spiritual (Islamic approach) integrated psychotherapy (SIPT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on the intensity of depression symptoms and dysfunctional attitudes of patients with dysthymic disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The research method was a mixed method design with two qualitative and quantitative phases. In the first phase and using the qualitative method model, grounded theory of spirituality integrated psychotherapy model was formulated. The second phase was a double-blind randomized clinical trial with a control group (waiting list). The participants (people with dysthymic disorder) were included in the study from different ways of requesting from general practitioners, psychiatrists, calling through notification in health centers (Noor and Alzahra Medical Centers), dormitories and faculties of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Isfahan Goldis Psychological Services Center. Initial screening was done through a clinical interview and structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Positive cases who were qualified for entering the study were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions (experimental groups) or waiting list. The experimental and control groups were evaluated by Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) and dysfunctional attitude scale (DAS-26) in 4 sessions during the study (before the intervention, 4 weeks after starting, after ending the therapy and three months later). Inclusion criteria included dysthymic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR, age between 20 and 65 years old, minimum literacy, no consumption of any psychiatrist medicine in the past 3 months and lack of participation in psychotherapy sessions in the past 6 months, Persian language, being Muslim and consent to the participation in this project. Exclusion criteria included suffering from one of the severe physical diseases, serious neurology, mental retardation, psychosis disorders or symptoms, bipolar disorder, depression disorders resulting from drug and alcohol abuse and other psychiatric disorders with depression as their secondary symptoms, reluctance of the patient to continue the therapy, serious suicide ideation and risk of suicide, which require emergency intervention. After performing the pretest by a doctor of clinical psychology, the intervention started by therapists. The raters and therapists were not aware of each others&#x02019; work.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Spirituality integrated psychotherapy</title><p>The content and process of spirituality integrated psychotherapeutic intervention included theoretical model, intervention strategies and implementation guideline, which was extracted from religious (Islamic) sources in the first phase of the study and using grounded theory and was prepared in 8 sessions. This phase of the study lasted for 18 months. Based on the grounded theory,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] the data paths were gathered and analyzed in different ways. First, religious and psychology experts were interviewed in Iran and their viewpoints were collected until data saturation, and followed by their analysis and conceptualization. In the next phase, religious sources including written and electronic sources were searched with regard to questions and goals and under the supervision of experts of religious sciences considering the interview data. Then the data were classified and analyzed in terms of content. Content of therapeutic protocol included religious theoretical viewpoint for explaining the formation of depression disorders and therapeutic methods including cognitive, behavioral, emotional-spiritual methods with religious content and behavioral recommendations in Islamic sources. Therefore, 8 weekly sessions of 45 min were held for each individual.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Medication</title><p>Medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist and using standard medication protocol for patients suffering from dysthymia according to comprehensive textbook of psychiatry[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and considering the medications available in Iran.

Medication had no significant effect on the reduction of dysfunctional attitudes. Thus, it can be inferred that spirituality integrated psychotherapy, which was prepared as a qualitative study (grounded theory) can be effective in the reduction of depression symptoms and cognitive vulnerability of the patients suffering from dysthymia.</p><p>The findings of this part of the research supported this viewpoint that different dimensions of religion play a major role in the treatment of hopelessness considering cognitive, behavioral, emotional and existentialism components[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and spirituality based therapies, which concentrate on the components of control, meaning finding, identity and communication can strengthen the efficacy of therapy in terms of reducing depression symptoms, especially chronic depression, whether in combination with conventional psychotherapies or by themselves.</p><p>The findings of this research were in line with a part of research results given by Azhar and Warma.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In their study, spirituality focused psychotherapy was more effective than the therapy in the waiting list and medication groups at the end of intervention but it was not different from that of the medication group in the follow-up stage. The present research findings supported the findings of Propest <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the above mentioned research, the patients showed more improvement at the end of the intervention period under cognitive-behavioral religious therapy (0.845 improvements). Findings of the current research were similar to those of some studies in this field.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Probably, effectiveness capability of combining spirituality focused intervention with psychotherapy is related to the fact that semantic-religious teachings for life provide feeling of orientation for life, support and optimism for the clients.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Moreover, when therapy is coordinated with cultural structures, spiritual needs and content of religious thought of the patients, response to and acceptance of the therapy are improved.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, findings of this research on the efficacy of sprituality integrated psychotherapy were not parallel with some findings of Azhar and Warma.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The groups did not have significant difference one month after starting the intervention and after ending the intervention but the effect of spiritually focused cognitive therapy was more consistent in the follow-up phase. Probably, lack of coordination between the mentioned findings and those of this research was resulted from the nature of this disorder (grief reaction in the mentioned study and dysthymic disorder in the present work). The findings of this research regarding the effectiveness of spirituality integrated psychotherapy supported Bartoli's approach[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] about the necessity of incorporating religious components in the intervention designs of dysthymic disorder.</p><p>Another important finding of this study was the confirmation of CBT effectiveness in terms of the symptoms of the patients suffering from dysthymia. These findings were in line with broad meta-analysis results of Wampold <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Chen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with regard to CBT effectiveness on dysthymic disorders. The mentioned studies showed that effectiveness of CBT therapy was significantly different from that of the waiting list and pseudo-therapy conditions in all the stages. There was another similarity between this finding and meta-analysis results of National Health Institute, Research Cooperation Plan for Depression Therapy,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which showed the equal effect of medication and CBT.</p><p>Another result of this clinical trial was the efficacy of medication on dysthymic symptoms. This part of the study was in line with the findings of Lima and Hatf,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which is one of the largest systematic reviews of medication therapy for dysthymic disorder. One of the similarities of this study to the studies which were entered into the mentioned review was the evaluation tool for determining medication effectiveness, which is usually SSRTs. Their general results demonstrated that antidepressants are adequate and effective for curing dysthymic disorder in comparison with placebos and the difference of different medicines is mostly found in their complication profile and loss of patients during the therapy. Adequacy evidence is stronger for SSRTs and TCAs group.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In the present study, SSRTs were prescribed in more than 90% of the cases and the difference of this research from the findings of other studies was that the present work did not compare the complications of drugs.</p><p>Confirming the efficacy of spirituality integrated psychotherapy and its probable preference over the consistency of the effect of therapy and correction of dysfunctional attitudes supports this model's theoretical bases and shows the coordination between theoretical framework and therapeutic solutions. It seems that performing cognitive, behavioral, ontological and spiritual strategies extracted from religious sources such as viewpoints of Imam Ali based on the creation of realistic attitude and adjustment of expectations with the current realities,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] strategy of Imam Sadegh for creating and practicing a positive attitude toward future and searching for positive points in past experiences to change the present mood[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and recommendations of Imam Bagher in terms of searching for meaning in hardship and positive and divine interpretation of incidents[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] along with the application of other believing-behavioral skills such as meditation, prayer and involvement with enjoyable spiritual activities have caused changes in the mood and behavior. Since the efficiency and acceptance of any type of psychotherapy depend on the adjustment of its content with cultural backgrounds and values of the people, spirituality integrated psychotherapy (SIPT) is more suitable for Muslims and these people will be better candidates for such a therapy.</p><p>On the other hand, effectiveness of spirituality integrated psychotherapy (SIPT) and its relative preference over biological and cognitive-behavioral therapies result from the nature of dysthymic disorder and multi-component nature of spirituality integrated psychotherapy. Dysthymic disorder has turned into an established lifestyle due to its chronic nature and this therapy tries to change life quality by targeting at cognitive, emotional, behavioral and spiritual components. The present authors agree with Peterson and Seligman[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] that spirituality and religion with the mechanisms and interfaces such as the effect on personal coping processes, problem solving skill, increase of self-esteem, hope, sincerity, control, comfort, emotional support, spiritual support and integrated (monotheistic) interpretation of the world, are effective on the individual solidarity and well-being and increase intra-psychological abilities to change lifestyle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this randomized clinical trial revealed that because of their religious background, in Iranian patents with dysthymic disorder spiritually augmented psychotherapy is more effective than medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to modify dysfunctional attitudes. However, there is not difference between SIPT and CBT to reduce severity of depressive symptoms.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study was its short follow-up period (three months) and it is necessary to have a longer follow-up period in future studies. The second limitation was about the effectiveness index of test scores and statistical differences. It is suggested for future studies to include percentage of the improved patients and clinical significance as the criteria. Another limitation was that medical intervention of this study which was compared with other methods was not a specified medicine with definite dosage but the medicines were those prescribed by the
