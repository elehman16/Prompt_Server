Results. Overall information was transferred by the GPs in 179 of the 772 first palliative contacts (23.2%). The number of contacts in the experimental group in which information was available increased significantly after intervention from 21% to 30%, compared to a decrease from 23% to 19% in the control group. The training had no additional effect. The content of the transferred information was adequate in 61.5%. There was no significant difference in the quality of the content between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The introduction of a handover form resulted in a moderate increase of information transfers to the GP co-operative. However, the total percentage of contacts in which this information was present remained rather low. GP co-operatives should develop additional policies to improve information transfer.

As most patients would prefer to die at home among their family and friends, well organised primary palliative care to ensure this quality is essential.[<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>During the past decades important changes have taken place in the primary health care system for out-of-hours service provision that now threaten the continuity of care. GPs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark have reorganised their out-of-hours care from rota groups to larger scale GP co-operatives.[<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The same shift has taken place in the Netherlands where GP co-operatives now serve 90% of the population. Patients are likely to receive out-of-hours care from a doctor they have never seen before, and night shifts are frequently the responsibility of young GPs who work only as locums in the co-operatives.</p><p>The out-of-hours period is therefore a potentially problematic time for the delivery of high-quality palliative care. Transfer of information between GPs and their out-of-hours co-operatives is essential to ensure continuity of care. Unfamiliarity with the patients and their problems will have an impact on service provision and may lead to poor symptom control and inappropriate hospital admissions.[<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This may contribute to the patients&#x02019; preferred place to die being disregarded.[<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>A main obstacle to the delivery of high-quality palliative care in the out-of-hours period as expressed by GPs in the United Kingdom is inadequate information on patients they are called to see.[<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This was confirmed by Dutch GPs in a focus-group study.[<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Some doctors even suggested that passing on notes on palliative patients by their GPs should be compulsory.[<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Information exchange impacted strongly on their experiences of palliative care encounters within the out-of-hours system. They felt that they were often the ones to pick up the pieces when it came to palliative care problems if in-hours GPs failed to transfer information.[<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Some barriers to writing information transfers are on the operational level: lack of time, technical problems, and unclear procedures. Another reason for not transferring information was that the GP had not expected deterioration of the patient&#x02019;s condition.[<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the Netherlands now, almost 60% of dying patients with non-acute illnesses die at home.[<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Within primary care, the GP is the key professional, and almost 100% of the inhabitants have their own GP.[<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The aging population and the growing number of non-acute deaths are expected to intensify the GPs&#x02019; involvement in palliative care.[<xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This also means an increasing workload for out-of-hours palliative care.</p><p>We aimed to investigate if the introduction of and training in using structured handover forms could improve transfer of information between GPs and the out-of-hours service concerning palliative care.</p><sec id="s0002"><title>Research questions</title><p>Does the introduction of structured handover forms improve: (a) the frequency and (b) the adequacy of information provided for out-of-hours palliative care, compared with usual care?</p><p>In this study, patients receiving palliative care included cancer and non-cancer patients. Palliative care was defined according to the European Association for Palliative Care: palliative care is the active, total care of a patient whose illness is not responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, other symptoms, and social, psychological, and spiritual problems is paramount.[<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0004"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a controlled trial. The GP co-operation in Amsterdam provides out-of-hours services from two clinics at night and six clinics during the evenings and weekends for a population of 800,000 inhabitants. An appointment for urgent health problems for a consult or visit is made by telephone. In Amsterdam &#x0223c;150,000 contacts a year are handled by the GP posts.</p><p>Two groups of GPs were formed according to the boundaries of the GP clinics in which they co-operate: (1) all GPs working in the western half of Amsterdam (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;240) and (2) all GPs working in the eastern half of the city (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;186). By flipping a coin we randomly assigned group 1 to the experimental condition and group 2 to the control condition. We studied all out-of-hours contacts with the GP co-operative of Amsterdam concerning patients in palliative care from 1 December 2005 to 30 September 2007. In the case of patients who had had several contacts with the GP co-operative, only the first contact was included.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population included all GPs working in Amsterdam.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>We planned to include 500 contacts in order to detect an absolute increase of information transfers of 10% after intervention with an &#x003b1; of 5% and a power of 90%.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Procedure</title><p>The baseline period for the experimental and the control group started on 1 December 2005 and continued until 28 February 2007, when a sufficient number of baseline contacts was achieved. The intervention was performed from January 2006 to 28 February 2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). On several dates during this period we organised training sessions for GPs in the experimental group to introduce the handover form. The GPs did not use the handover forms before they were trained. Contacts with patients from GPs who had attended the training sessions were registered as follow-up contacts after the date of the training. The intervention was concluded on 28 February 2007 through a final letter to all GPs in the experimental group &#x02013; those who had attended the training as well as those who had not &#x02013; containing the handover form and the procedure to be followed. From that moment on, all patient contacts were registered as follow-up contacts.

The own GP of a patient decided whether a patient was receiving palliative care and a handover form should be sent. The handover form has to be sent by fax to the GP co-operative, where a secretary enters the data into the database system on the same day, creating a new record for this patient if no previous information is available. These data are made available for a locum when a patient receiving palliative care contacts the GP co-operative. An educational intervention was designed to practice working with this tool (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TB5">Box 1</xref>). All GPs in the experimental group received a letter to inform them about the project and to invite them for a single one-hour training session.</p><table-wrap id="TB5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>Process and content of the intervention.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Process of intervention:

This database contains medical data on all calls with the GP co-operative. It also contains all information transferred by GPs about their patients.The records of all phone calls during the study period were searched electronically. We identified palliative care contacts by means of a search with the text words &#x0201c;palliative, &#x0201c;terminal&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;carcinoma&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;inoperable&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;opioid&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;fentanyl&#x0201d;. This search yielded palliative care contacts regarding cancer and non-cancer patients but also other contacts, for example, when a patient used an opioid for acute low back pain. A GP with extensive experience in palliative care (BS) subsequently examined the identified records and identified palliative contacts according to the definition on palliative care stated above. The context of the complete Callmanager record found in this way with the anamnesis, the description of the symptoms, and the actions undertaken by the locum made this possible. All non-palliative contacts were excluded. A sample of the identified records was examined by a second experienced GP (NB) but no differences in judgment were found. The sensitivity of the search was checked by comparing the electronic search results with hand-searched data (BS) in Callmanager from all contacts during a period of a month. As this did not produce any new contacts regarding palliative care patients, we decided not to carry out a hand search for the entire study.</p></sec><sec id="s0011"><title>Outcome measure</title><p>The outcome measure for the first research question was the proportion of contacts in which information was present at the GP co-operative.</p><p>For the second research question, the outcome measure was the adequacy of this information. We therefore noted the presence or absence of the following items: diagnosis, prognosis, medication, current problems, management plan, patient&#x02019;s knowledge of prognosis, patient&#x02019;s wishes, carers and professionals involved, previous contacts, and availability of own GP. We also noted the time interval between the entrance of the transferred information in Callmanager and the first out-of-hours contact. We defined an information transfer as adequate if:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Transferred information was present at the GP cooperative and</p></list-item><list-item><p>The information was not older than a month and</p></list-item><list-item><p>The information contained the following three elements:</p></list-item><list-item><p>diagnosis</p></list-item><list-item><p>medication</p></list-item><list-item><p>current problems.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We based our definition of adequacy on a previous study [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that showed that locums consider the quality of the transferred information as sufficient if it contains the three elements specified above, and is up-to-date.</p></sec><sec id="s0012"><title>GP and patient characteristics and type of contact</title><p>We registered the GPs&#x02019; gender, age, and type of practice. These data were found in the public accessible registration of GPs.</p><p>The patient&#x02019;s gender, age group, and place of residence were registered for all contacts. The reason for the encounter, the diagnosis, and whether a patient was terminally ill or not were registered if the locum had noted this in their records.

Patient characteristics and type of contact in intervention versus control condition were compared using Chi-square tests.</p><p>Research question (a): we defined the effect of the intervention as the difference in the presence of information transferred between the experimental group versus control group at baseline and follow-up, i.e., the time (pre/post) by intervention effect.</p><p>To analyse the effect of the intervention on the transfer of information, we performed a logistic regression. In this analysis we had to deal with the exceptional situation that contacts from different patients from a GP in baseline versus follow-up groups were studied. We therefore used the method of Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) that allows the inclusion of all contacts in the analysis and allows for dependency of patients from the same GP in baseline and follow-up. We used the same method to analyse determinants for information transfer. The outcome variable was the dichotomous variable presence versus absence of information transfer. As we studied contacts from different patients in baseline and follow-up groups, covariates could vary at baseline and follow-up. We therefore analysed possible differences for the variables gender and age group of the GP, type of practice, residence (home, residential care home), terminal status, cancer, and the continuous variable age class for the four groups separately (experimental baseline and follow-up group; control baseline and follow-up group). We did not adjust for clustering because we do not know which GPs cooperate with each other.</p><p>In the GEE analysis we adjusted for significant differences in GP and patient characteristics.</p><p>Research question (b): the effect of the intervention on the dichotomous variable <bold>&#x0201c;</bold>adequate information transfer available<bold>&#x0201d;</bold> was analysed using the same method.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0014"><title>Results</title><p>We retrieved 3665 records during the trial period of 22 months, of which 1993 non-palliative records were excluded.

Regarding the second research question, in the subgroup of GPs who attended the training, information was adequate in 19 out of 32 contacts with handover form, versus 13 out of 19 in the subgroup of GPs who only received the final letter (n.s.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding from this controlled trial is that the introduction of an information handover form on their palliative patients to the out-of-hours GP co-operative had a positive, statistically significant, influence on the proportion of contacts in which information on the palliative patient was available in the co-operative. However, despite the absolute increase of 9%, the percentage of contacts in which information was available remained low (30%) in the experimental group. The majority of GPs did not attend the training and received only the introduction letter and the handover form. There is no proof that the one-hour training session contributes to the effect. No significant further benefit from our intervention was identified in terms of the adequacy of the information available.</p><sec id="s0021"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Previous studies showed that, similar to our results, GPs do not routinely write information transfers, [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] whereas in the U.K. Burt et&#x000a0;al. found that a transfer of information was available in 1.2&#x02013;13%; Munday et&#x000a0;al. found that transferred information was present in 21% of the patients who contacted the out-of-hours co-operative. In the Netherlands, De Bock et&#x000a0;al. found that a transfer of information was available in 20%.[<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In comparison with these studies, our improvement towards 30% can be qualified as a positive result.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no studies on initiatives to improve the writing of information transfers, although an electronic Palliative Care Summary (ePCS) is currently being implemented throughout Scotland to provide out-of-hours staff with up-to-date summaries coming from GP records. This is considered by both patients and professionals as a potentially useful and feasible innovation.[<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Working with handover forms sent from in-hours practices to out-of-hours providers is recommended in the literature to address the problem of an isolated working doctor in the night.[<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Many GPs complete special notes only when they think an out-of-hours call is likely, rather than &#x0201c;not unexpected&#x0201d;. This is often at the very end of life [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but anticipatory care has to start amply before the terminal phase. Our intervention made an appeal to GPs to overcome the barriers in writing an information transfer to the out-of-hours co-operative by convincing GPs of the importance of good anticipatory care and by giving them a standardised handover form. This minimised time constraints by offering a pre-printed form with all necessary headings.</p><p>The effect of the intervention, however, remained moderate. Our intervention focused mainly on the improvement of transferring information. This is perhaps not enough to bring about a change in behaviour of the GPs.</p><p>There are many reasons why GPs do not transfer information about their patients receiving palliative care. One could be that GPs are available themselves for their terminally ill patients during out-of-hours periods. Burt et&#x000a0;al. stated that GPs are often reluctant to define patients as &#x0201c;palliative&#x0201d;, in spite of their terminal condition, and therefore are unlikely to recognise the need for information handover.[<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Another reason for under-estimating the importance of transferring information could be that the GPs did not expect a rapid deterioration.[<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Apart from the barriers caused by time constraints (writing an information transfer is time-consuming) and technical problems (no standardised form available, no internet connection) there are problems inherent to the relation between the doctor and the patient receiving palliative care. First of all, a major problem is the timely recognition of the palliative phase by the GP.[<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] One of the perceived barriers in the communication between GP and patient is the unpredictability of the clinical course and the uncertainty of an exact prognosis in palliative care. This means that it is difficult for a doctor to address items concerning prognosis and end-of-life decisions with his patient in time. Another factor may be that GPs have only a few patients receiving palliative care and that they are not focused on the need of anticipation.</p><p>Where GPs in Scotland found that special notes to inform the out-of-hours service about patients were not specific enough for patients receiving palliative care [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we found that the quality of the information noted and sent was adequate in 61.5%. Perhaps the main obstacle in writing information transfers has been overcome when a GP starts writing them.</p></sec><sec id="s0022"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>A strength of the study is that we included all contacts with the GP co-operative with patients receiving palliative care from a full population of GPs in Amsterdam. We studied the availability of information about all patients for whom a call was made.</p><p>One factor that might have contributed to our positive result may be that the intervention was based on our prior needs assessment by means of focus-group discussions. It made clear that GPs felt that there was a need for better communication. They were therefore susceptible for a change in behaviour.</p><p>A limitation is that we do not know how many times information was transferred for patients for whom no call was made, nor did we register whether regular updates were sent.</p><p>Due to the small number of contacts per GP, it was not possible to examine to what degree the same GPs write information transfers.</p><p>It is possible that changing GP&#x02019;s habits take longer than our study period, which may have contributed to the relatively small effect we found. One could also argue that the effect of this intervention possibly fades out in time when GPs are not frequently reminded.</p><p>Although studying the complete text of the contacts with the GP co-operative made it possible to identify palliative care contacts, it is possible that not all palliative care contacts were recognised as such.</p></sec><sec id="s0023"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Further improvement could be made by a change of attitude of GPs, which could be brought about by giving them feedback on their information transfer. When one of their patients receiving palliative care has had contact with the GP co-operative, they could be contacted the next morning by an assistant of the GP co-operative to inform them whether adequate information on this patient had been available to the locum. A future study should therefore also include the effect of direct feedback to GPs that did not send information.</p><p>Better logistics through the use of an electronic information system would be helpful. It is then possible to flag patients in the system of the GP co-operative, to retrieve information on patients written in daytime and to ask the GP electronically for a regular update on an automatically generated review date. These suggestions could be included in quality standards for GP co-operatives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The introduction of a handover form resulted in a moderate increase of information transfers to the GP co-operative. Training in using this form did not contribute to the effect. The total percentage of contacts in which this information was present remained rather low. GP co-operatives should develop additional policies to improve information transfer. When information was provided its content was mainly adequate.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The Ethics Board of the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, was informed about the study, and they decided that the study did not require a formal ethical review.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="s0026"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.
