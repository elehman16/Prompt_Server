Robenacoxib is a new NSAID with high selectivity for the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 isoform of COX. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib for the management of peri-operative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs. The study was a prospective, randomized, blinded, positive-controlled, non-inferiority, multi-center clinical trial. A total of 174 dogs undergoing major soft tissue surgery were included and randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive either robenacoxib (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;118) or the positive control, meloxicam (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;56). Each dog received an initial dose subcutaneously prior to surgery (robenacoxib 2&#x000a0;mg/kg, meloxicam 0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg), followed by daily oral doses (robenacoxib 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg/kg, meloxicam 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg) for 12&#x000a0;days (range 10&#x02013;14) after surgery. Pain and inflammation were assessed subjectively using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS) by clinicians as the primary end point and additional evaluations by the clinicians and animal owners as secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both treatments provided similar pain control, with no significant differences between groups for any efficacy variable using non-parametric analyses (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). In no dog was analgesic rescue therapy administered. Non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib compared to meloxicam was demonstrated statistically for the primary and all secondary endpoints using parametric analysis of variance, although the data were not normally distributed even after log transformation. For the primary endpoint (reciprocal of the modified GCPS score), the relative efficacy of robenacoxib/meloxicam was 1.12 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.97-1.29.</p><p>Both treatments were well tolerated and did not affect buccal mucosal bleeding time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A treatment regimen of robenacoxib by subcutaneous injection followed by oral tablets had good tolerability and non-inferior efficacy compared to meloxicam for the management of peri-operative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Analgesia</kwd><kwd>Dog</kwd><kwd>Meloxicam</kwd><kwd>Peri-operative</kwd><kwd>Robenacoxib</kwd><kwd>Soft tissue surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Soft tissue surgical procedures in the dog are associated with post-operative pain and peri-operative analgesia is therefore recommended in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The duration of pain control required varies between cases, but in some instances is needed for seven days or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The most frequently used analgesics in dogs are opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The introduction of newer NSAIDs which are selective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform of COX (COX-2) should permit relief of pain and inflammation whilst minimizing the adverse effects of non-selective COX inhibitors in causing gastrointestinal tract damage and interfering with blood clotting pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Robenacoxib is a new NSAID with several properties of interest for use in dogs undergoing surgery, including a fast onset of action and the availability of both injection and oral formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Robenacoxib has a high safety index in healthy dogs, which is attributed to its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. First, robenacoxib is highly selective for COX-2 in dogs, and at recommended dosages inhibits COX-2 while sparing COX-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Second, robenacoxib is cleared rapidly from the central body compartment, but persists at sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib has been demonstrated in dogs undergoing orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib were evaluated in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery. Since other NSAIDs are already registered in the European Union (EU) for this indication, and widely used, the study was a non-inferiority comparison to a positive control, meloxicam. Meloxicam was selected as it is registered in the EU for the reduction of post-operative pain and inflammation following soft tissue (and orthopedic) surgery after a single injection pre-surgery, used extensively, and its efficacy is proven for soft tissue surgery pain in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The hypothesis of the study was that robenacoxib would have non-inferior efficacy and tolerability compared to meloxicam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, blinded, multi-center clinical trial conducted at 16 French and 9 German veterinary practices.

The 2:1 ratio was used to obtain data in more dogs receiving robenacoxib and was predicted to cause only a modest (approximately 10%) reduction in statistical efficiency compared to a 1:1 ratio.

Owners were not blinded to treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Concomitant treatments</title><p>Drugs which could affect efficacy assessments were disallowed, including: analgesics (opioids and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists), other NSAIDs, corticosteroids, macrolides and tetracyclines. Opioids were not used as premedication as this was not routine practice in France and Germany at the time the study was conducted. However rescue analgesic therapy (of any type) was permitted at any time if the clinician judged it was necessary. Since use of analgesic therapy was allowed for animal welfare reasons, and was not a specific predefined efficacy endpoint, no specific criteria were defined in the protocol when rescue therapy should be used. Standard parameters relating to anesthetic premedication, induction, maintenance and recovery were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessment</title><p>Investigators were instructed that the same clinician (a veterinarian) should make all efficacy assessments for all cases at each site, whenever possible. The frequency of exemptions to this rule was not assessed. The clinicians were trained on the efficacy scoring methods before the start of the study with the objective to standardize assessments. However no validation, for example no assessment of intra and inter-observer variation, was made.</p><p>The primary endpoint for efficacy comprised the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], assessed by the clinician at seven examination times (T, hours) as indicated in Tables&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>: T1 (extubation), T1&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x000a0;h, T1&#x02009;+&#x02009;2&#x000a0;h, T1&#x02009;+&#x02009;4&#x000a0;h, T1&#x02009;+&#x02009;8&#x000a0;h, T1&#x02009;+&#x02009;24&#x000a0;h and day (D)12.

Reciprocal pain scores were used, so that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for (1/mean score robenacoxib)/(1/mean score meloxicam) needed to completely lie above 0.80.</p><p>Since most efficacy variables were not normally distributed even after log transformation (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 using the Shapiro-Wilk test), groups were also compared using the non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test in addition to the ANOVA/RMANOVA analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical chemistry, hematology and bleeding time</title><p>As normality of these data was not proven, non-parametric methods were applied. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare the two groups before surgery, after surgery, and the change between before and after surgery.

A variety of methods are available for the clinical assessment of pain in animals. In this study, the primary endpoint was the clinician&#x02019;s assessment of the GCPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. At the time of initiation of the study, weighing factors for the indices had not yet been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and therefore unweighted results are reported. The results of the primary endpoint were supported by six secondary endpoints. No significant differences between groups were observed using the non-parametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for the primary and all six secondary efficacy variables. Non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib compared to meloxicam was also demonstrated statistically for both the primary and all six secondary efficacy using ANOVA and RMANOVA analyses. However the reliably of those ANOVA and RMANOVA analyses is uncertain since the data deviated significantly from a normal distribution, in spite of log transformation, for all endpoints except inflammation. In addition the GCPS is the sum of ordinal or ranking scales and is not an interval scale, and therefore in principle non-parametric statistics should be used. However to our knowledge no suitable non-parametric methods exist for non-inferiority analysis, which was the primary objective of the study. Therefore a combination of non-parametric and parametric tests was used, and using both approaches provides greater confidence that robenacoxib had non-inferior efficacy compared to meloxicam.</p><p>The major limitations of the study are discussed below. First, although the dogs were assessed reasonably intensively by the clinician in the first 24&#x000a0;hours after surgery while hospitalized, the follow-up from day 2 onwards was sparse and consisted mainly of daily assessments of the dog&#x02019;s demeanor and mobility by the owner. A final examination was made by the clinician when the stitches were removed at day 12. Second, although the clinicians were masked to treatment groups, via the use of a dispenser, the dog owners were not blinded. For this and other reasons, the primary endpoint of the study was based on the clinician and not the owner scores. Third, no specific assessment was made of sedation, and therefore we do not know if sedation could have confounded the efficacy assessments. However signs consistent with sedation were only reported in one dog (&#x0201c;apathy&#x0201d; in the robenacoxib group) and to our knowledge neither meloxicam nor robenacoxib have any reported sedative properties. No sedative effects were reported with administration of high dosages of robenacoxib (40&#x000a0;mg/kg daily for 1&#x000a0;month) to dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Fourth, although the clinicians were authorized to provide rescue therapy at any time after surgery if needed, no dog received such therapy. Other authors have automatically administered rescue therapy to dogs if a minimum score was reached, for example a modified GCPS score (without part B) &#x02265;5 or an unmodified score (with part B) &#x02265;6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although not planned in the protocol of this study, we determined that the number (percentage of total) of dogs with a modified GCPS score &#x02265;5 was 47 (39.8%) in the robenacoxib group and 26 (46.4%) in the meloxicam group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.42). For the unmodified score (with part B), the number of dogs with a score &#x02265;6 was 60 (50.8%) in the robenacoxib group and 35 (62.5%) in the meloxicam group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19). Therefore different investigators may have concluded that many of the dogs in the study required additional analgesia. The relatively high number of dogs with GCPS scores above the thresholds defined above is probably due to the fact that opiates were not used in any dog. Optimal control of post-operative pain requires mixed therapy with NSAIDs and opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Fifth and last, the limitations of non-inferiority studies using positive controls are well-known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this case, however, use of a placebo would have raised ethical and recruitment issues in this study conducted in France and Germany since a number of NSAIDs are registered for peri-operative use in dogs in the EU and are widely used. Meloxicam was selected as the positive control since it is registered and extensively used in dogs, and its efficacy administered by injection prior to surgery in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery has been proven via superiority to butorphanol or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To our knowledge there exist no published data on the efficacy of oral meloxicam to treat post-operative pain for 12&#x000a0;days in dogs, as used in our study. The efficacy of meloxicam versus placebo was demonstrated for up to 72&#x000a0;hours after ovariohysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, oral 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg meloxicam had significant efficacy in the urate synovitis model in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore we conclude that there is satisfactory evidence for the efficacy of meloxicam to control pain and inflammation in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery, and thus it was a suitable positive control for this study. However in none of the above mentioned published studies was the GCPS used, as in our study. In optimally designed non-inferiority studies, the methods and outcome measures should be similar to those used in the original studies of the active control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Superiority of deracoxib versus placebo, and firocoxib versus a negative control, was reported recently from two studies in dogs undergoing soft tissue using similar methods to our study including use of the GCPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The frequency of rescue therapy in those studies with treatment as a single dose pre-surgery followed by 2&#x000a0;days post-surgery was higher [deracoxib 2/16 (12.5%), placebo 9/16 (56.25%), firocoxib (16.4%), negative control (50.6%)] than in our study with robenacoxib (0%) or meloxicam (0%).</p><p>A feature of our study was the choice of a non-inferiority threshold (&#x003b4;) value of 0.20. The &#x003b4; value should reflect the largest margin that is clinically acceptable. In fact the results show that non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib to the positive control would also have been achieved if we had defined &#x003b4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 for the primary endpoint i.e. with a maximum of 5% difference in modified GCPS scores. Furthermore, robenacoxib had numerical superiority to meloxicam for the primary endpoint (relative efficacy 1.12) and for five of the secondary endpoints (range 0.95 to 1.31). Therefore, the data support the conclusion of non-inferior efficacy.</p><p>In both groups plasma cortisol concentrations were approximately doubled after surgery, relative to pre-anesthesia values, and had not returned to control values at the last time point of 8&#x000a0;hours after extubation. The extent and duration of the observed rise in cortisol concentrations are consistent with published literature in which increases by factors of 2 to 3 lasting 2 to 4&#x000a0;hours are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in cortisol concentrations. In a previous study, no change in plasma cortisol concentrations was noted with meloxicam in dogs undergoing mammary gland excision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Robenacoxib and meloxicam were both well tolerated in this study. Although adverse effects were reported in 29 of 174 dogs, most were assessed as mild or benign and classified as either not or only possibly treatment related. The adverse effects reported most frequently were occasional vomiting and loose stools. There were also no biologically relevant changes in hematology and biochemistry variables, and no significant change in buccal mucosa bleeding time, with either robenacoxib or meloxicam. The latter result is not surprising for robenacoxib, since it does not inhibit COX-1 at recommended dosages in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or affect buccal bleeding time at therapeutic or elevated dosages in healthy dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Buccal bleeding time also did not increase with meloxicam, although this might be expected from the fact that 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg meloxicam by injection significantly inhibits COX-1 in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. No significant differences in buccal mucosa bleeding time were noted previously in dogs receiving meloxicam compared to placebo in dogs undergoing abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The rationale for the development of highly COX-2 selective NSAIDs such as robenacoxib is that they should offer the same efficacy but better safety than older less selective NSAIDs such as meloxicam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The finding of no significant differences in tolerability between robenacoxib and meloxicam in this study is not surprising, however, since the study was underpowered to detect differences in safety parameters, with only 174 dogs and a relatively short treatment duration (maximum 16&#x000a0;days). In addition we did not include specific safety investigations, for example gastroscopy, which might have revealed differences in tolerability as noted previously for other NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this clinical trial, a treatment regimen of robenacoxib, consisting of a single subcutaneous injection prior to surgery (2&#x000a0;mg/kg) followed by once daily administration of tablets post-operatively at 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg/kg for 12&#x000a0;days, had good tolerability and non-inferior efficacy compared to meloxicam for the control of pain and inflammation in dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery.</p><sec><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Due to the confidentiality of records from owners and veterinarians in this clinical trial, the data base cannot at present be made freely available.
