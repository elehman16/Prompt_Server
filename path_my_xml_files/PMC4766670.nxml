While current guidelines for schizophrenia care recommend antipsychotic medication to be essential for long-term maintenance treatment, non-adherence to this medication is found to be a predictor factor for re-hospitalisation and relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also recommended that mental healthcare interventions and services should explicitly direct healthcare providers to ensure that early psychosis intervention teams are in place and provide appropriate psychosocial interventions for these people within the &#x02018;critical period&#x02019; (i.e., the first 3&#x000a0;years of illness), which can address their specific needs for better engaging and retaining in the services/interventions provided, enhanced insight into the illness and its treatment and optimal self-management of the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, it can facilitate early recovery and prevent their progression to chronic illness.</p><p>Systematic reviews on clinical trials of treatments in psychosis, particularly those with chronic psychosis, suggest that these patients&#x02019; adherence to oral antipsychotics are generally poor with average adherence rates of 30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the advent of new (atypical) antipsychotics with less side-effects, some side-effects of these novel drugs such as tardive dysknesia and obesity are severe. While there has been increasing number of patients using these atypical antipsychotics, there is little evidence that progress has been made on increasing these patients&#x02019; medication adherence. Poor medication and other treatment compliance may then result in frequent recurrences and high relapses from schizophrenia, which would much increase the medical costs and burden of society, for example, ranging from U.S. dollars of 4&#x02013;12 billion and contributing to 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% of the total medical or Medicare costs of developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Early intervention for people with first-episode or recent onset psychosis involving education and experiential learning in dimensions of awareness of illness, relabeling of symptoms and need for treatment is considered essential to enhance their motivation to engage in psychosocial intervention and rehabilitation programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adherence therapy may be useful for these peoples with early psychosis to improve their insight to the illness and its medication/treatments, and enhance their motivation and self-efficacy in self-management of their illness and relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>&#x02018;Adherence&#x02019;, sometimes interchangeably with &#x02018;compliance&#x02019;, means that a client accepts the advice of healthcare professionals to take medication according to a medical prescription, and it reflects the client&#x02019;s perspective regarding the importance and purpose of taking the prescribed medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, the effects of psycho-education and other models of psychosocial intervention on adherence to medication in schizophrenia are multifaceted and complex, with modest and inconsistent effects on successfully improving patients&#x02019; treatment adherence, functioning and/or other psychosocial outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For instance, psycho-education programs for people with psychotic disorders aimed to enhance knowledge about mental illness and its medications/treatments; however, the findings of most recent studies were non-significant on promoting positive attitudinal and behavioural changes in these patients&#x02019; treatment adherence and improve the service utilization and re-hospitalisation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>While poor insight has shown to be associated with poor outcome in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], insight is regarded as a multi-dimensional construct with at least three interrelated components, including awareness of having a mental illness, understanding the need for treatment and its compliance, and the ability to re-evaluate and re-label unusual events as pathological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These components of insight appear to be distinct constructs with different neurocognitive and psychosocial correlates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Acute and severe psychopathology (e.g., suspicions and delusional beliefs) and any delay in seeking treatment during the early stages of schizophrenia associated with insight into the illness can render it difficult for prompt and efficacious interventions and understanding about the significance of medication adherence, thus reducing the likelihood of their adherence behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients&#x02019; insight into treatment can be associated with their negative symptoms and internalized stigma.</p><p>This may be because similar to other chronic illnesses, these interventions have inadequately focused on facilitating these patients to accept their illness and its treatment and/or resolve their resistance or ambivalence to changing their lifestyle and behaviours, as required by the treatment regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most approaches to psychosocial intervention in schizophrenia mainly provide knowledge of the illness and its treatment and prognosis, perceived (or experienced) stigma, coping and behavioural adjustments, and therapeutic alliance with professionals. However as suggested by recent expert consensus guidelines for schizophrenia treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], motivational interviewing (MI) technique has recently been adopted in adherence therapy (AT) for people with schizophrenia to enhance their adherence to medication by helping them understand and accept their medication receiving and cope with the life situations concerning the adverse effects of the medication taken. Unlike most of the other psycho-educational and behavioural approaches to medication adherence, MI is a goal-directed, patient-centred interventional style, which specifically works on facilitating and engaging intrinsic motivation within individual patients and helps them explore and resolve ambivalence to an adherence behaviour, for empowering them to consider making changes in such non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The MI-based intervention has demonstrated preliminary positive evidence on reducing psychotic symptoms and relapse rate in a few European countries and Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of adherence therapy for Chinese people with schizophrenia and its subtypes on symptom severity, medication adherence, re-hospitalization rate, functioning, and insight into illness/treatment over a 18-month follow-up, when compared with those receiving treatment as usual (TAU). It was hypothesised that that the AT group would demonstrate significantly greater improvements on symptom severity and other clinical outcomes (e.g., medication adherence and re-hospitalization rates, and insight into illness/treatment) at immediately and over 18&#x000a0;months after completion of the intervention, than the TAU group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-blind randomised controlled trial of a motivational interviewing-based adherence therapy for outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, using a repeated-measures control group design and an intention-to-treat basis. The trial was undertaken in Hong Kong between December 2012 and May 2015 and all subjects were assessed by a psychiatrist to be mentally competent to follow the instructions of the intervention used and followed up over 18&#x000a0;months (Period: May 2012-December 2014), respective of whether they completed the intervention or not.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and settings</title><p>The controlled trial was conducted at two Community Psychiatric Nursing Services (CPNS) in the two largest geographical regions of Hong Kong (i.e., the New Territories and Kowloon). There were 3000 patients with schizophrenia and its subtypes such as schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders; of which, 1200 were eligible participants (40&#x000a0;% of the total patient population) who met the study criteria at below and were accessible. The main reasons for those excluded from this study (as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) included: good medication compliance (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;600), unable to be accessed (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;200), having chronic physical illness or cognitive impairment (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;350), and mentally incompetent to participate (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;450). From 1200 eligible participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 650 (54&#x000a0;%) could be contacted and agreed to participate and 134 were recruited after obtained their informed written consent by a research assistant. There were 70 patients (11&#x000a0;%) approached but refused to participate mainly due to lack of time or unwillingness to discuss their medication adherence. Sixty-seven participants per CPNS were selected randomly from each of the two patient lists (in alphabetical order with their names), using computer-generated random numbers prepared by an independent statistician. After completed the baseline measures during home visit, 134 participants were assigned randomly by the research assistant into either AT or TAU (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;67 in each group) by drawing a labelled card (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;AT&#x02019;; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;TAU&#x02019;) from an opaque envelope.

These scales showed very good internal consistency among the participants at baseline measurement in this study (i.e., Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas were 0.89 for ARS, 0.91 for PANSS, 0.88 for ITAQ, and 0.93 for SLOF). Total number and duration (days) of psychiatric re-hospitalisations of each participant were self-reported by the participants and then checked against the outpatient clinic/CPNS records at pre-test and three post-tests. Patients&#x02019; demographic and clinical data (e.g., gender, age, dosage of antipsychotic medication in terms of haloperidol equivalents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and duration of illness) were collected at recruitment.</p><p>The single-item ARS developed by Staring et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was a simple, user-friendly and valid measure to assess level of medication adherence; whereas, pill counts and urine tests have recently been recognised for its potential inaccuracy and time constraints for estimation of usage of antipsychotic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The AT conducted by a trained community psychiatric nurse (nurse therapist) during home visit was based on the principles of MI, involving cognitive, motivational, insight-inducing, and behavioural training, which are viewed as particularly useful for people with addictive and resistant behaviours or ambivalent to changing their attitude/behaviour towards psychiatric treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The nurse therapists used the five principles of MI with a non-confrontational approach, including expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, avoiding from argumentation, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], for discussing their attitudes and beliefs towards their illness and medication adherence. While it was considerably more difficult to discuss issues of motivation in patients with severe psychotic (positive and negative) symptoms, MI combined with principles of cognitive therapy (e.g., awareness and acceptance of experiences, problem-solving and coping skills training, and behavioural rehearsals of adherence) was found useful to focus on particular consequences of illness and treatment behaviours on individual patients, thus engaging them in resolving their ambivalence to their illness-related and life problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The AT consisted of three phases (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), adopting a few strategies to address Chinese cultural tenets (i.e., cultivating an open and accepting mode of responses and expression of feelings, resolving strong self-centredness, discussing perceived social stigma, and encouraging family support and collectivism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Phase 1 (one session) of AT aimed to engage participants in addressing their needs and concerns in medication adherence, leading them to set goals and action for change in non-adherence. Phase 2 (two sessions) focused on education about the illness and its treatment, then explored patients&#x02019; strengths and barriers to medication adherence and facilitated them to recognise main barriers to their adherence such as perceived stigma, undesirable side-effects of medication and inadequate social support, and finally, developed coping strategies in taking medication over a long term. Phase 3 (three sessions) aimed to rationalise patients&#x02019; beliefs and concerns about medication management, resolve difficulties in adhering to medication regimen and improve social network and relationship, thus empowering relapse prevention and better integration into the community.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Motivational interviewing-based adherence therapy for people with schizophrenia</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Phase/Session</th><th>Interventions</th><th>Main assignments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Phase 1 (1 session)</td><td>Purposes:</td><td rowspan="2">Reviewing antipsychotic medication use and the impacts of psychotic symptoms on medication (and treatment) adherence, the desired and unwanted effects of medication, anti-psychotic side-effects, and attitude and satisfaction with medication taking.<break/>Examining and addressing beliefs and concerns towards adherence, and plan for problem-solving.<break/>

Intra-class correlations of outcome measures between CPNs in each of the two study settings were similar and very small, ranging 0.001 to 0.0005, which indicated very minimal nested design effects (i.e., between the six nurse therapists) on the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Effects of motivational interviewing-based adherence therapy</title><p>The findings of this controlled trial provide evidence on the significant positive effects of this 6-session adherence therapy (AT) for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in community mental health care. The results supported the study hypotheses that when compared with those in usual psychiatric outpatient care, the participants in AT indicated much better patient outcomes (i.e., psychotic symptoms, medication adherence, insight into illness/treatment, functioning, and length of psychiatric re-hospitalisations) with large effect sizes (partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28&#x02013;0.40) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] over 18-month follow up. These findings also suggest that adherence therapy originated from Western culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] can be effective not only in people with addictive and behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but also in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</p><p>The AT used in this study based on motivational interviewing technique is one of few interventions attempted globally to enhance patients&#x02019; insight into their medication and/or other treatments and motivation to self-manage their medication and illness-related behaviours in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This AT has demonstrated promising patient outcomes over a long-term (18&#x000a0;months) follow-up. Whilst recent literature on adherence therapy in Thailand and European countries can only show positive effects on psychotic patients&#x02019; medication adherence and relapse rate over &#x0003c;12&#x000a0;months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the findings in this study provide strong evidence on this promising approach to AT to significantly enhance these patients&#x02019; insight into their illness and motivation to change positively in their adherence behaviours. Therefore, it demonstrates substantive improvements in a wide variety of patient outcomes, including psychotic symptoms, duration of hospitalisations and psychosocial functioning.</p><p>Although the patients&#x02019; hospitalisation rate in terms of frequency of re-admissions in psychiatric hospital/unit at T1 &#x02013; T3 did not differ between groups, the duration of re-hospitalisations of the TAU group were consistently and significantly worsened, and their symptom severity (PANSS score) and functioning (SLOF score) were gradually deteriorated, over the 18-month follow-up. High percentages of the participants in the TAU had at least one hospitalisation over the follow-up (T1-T3: 76, 79 and 73&#x000a0;%, accordingly), whereas, the AT group reduced from 74&#x000a0;% at T1 to 48&#x000a0;% at T3. The results in the TAU group showing gradual mild deterioration in mental state and functioning over the 18-month follow-up might reflect the cumulative effects of non-adherence to medication to these patients over time. As all the patients were within 3&#x000a0;years and/or first-episode of illness at recruitment and low to medium dosages of antipsychotic medications, it needs time for them to show progressive deterioration in psychotic symptoms and other clinical outcomes across time as the result of poor medication and treatment adherence. These results would support the recommendation of recent practice guidelines for the importance of ensuring accessibility and adherence to treatment in the first 3&#x000a0;years of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, it remains unanswered whether the significant improvements in patient outcomes are solely the effect of AT or a combined effect of this therapy and other psychosocial and family interventions and/or psychiatric treatments that are considered potentially therapeutic but had not yet been included in the data analysis. Further research with structured, integrated rehabilitation programme to explore the therapeutic effects of its individual components, and/or compare the effects between the components, is recommended; and one of which will be the AT used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Fidelity of adherence therapy</title><p>The AT was conducted by six trained community psychiatric nurses (three from each of the two CPNS under study) who received two full-day training, together with supervised practices on four patients, according to the AT instructor programme. However, it was guided by a validated manual and delivered by these six nurse therapists with a high level of treatment fidelity (i.e., rated &#x02018;competent&#x02019; in &#x0003e;92&#x000a0;% of the items in the AT manual). In contrast to recent studies of AT, there were very high completion rate (95&#x000a0;% versus 50&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% in other studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] of the intervention and on other hand, low attrition rate (4&#x000a0;% versus 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], over an 1-year follow-up. This AT showed much clear benefits in terms of psychopathology and treatment insight and adherence for people with acute to approaching chronic schizophrenia (3&#x02013;36 months of illness), indicating poor medication adherence and moderate levels of psychotic symptoms and functioning. The sample recruited (&#x0003e;70&#x000a0;% poorly adhered to medication at baseline) was comparable and thus representative to the largest proportion of psychotic patients found during the first few years of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; this has also responded to the limitation of recent AT studies in which most participants reported mildly/moderately impaired in medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths of adherence therapy</title><p>This is one of very few clinical trials of effective adherence therapy currently available for improving patients&#x02019; insights into and adherence to anti-psychotic medication in schizophrenia and showing benefits in a variety of patient outcomes such as psychotic symptoms, re-hospitalisation rates and psychosocial functioning. This effective intervention is particularly important to these patients who would have a high relapse or recurrence rate (70&#x02013;90&#x000a0;%) over the first few years after discharge from hospital or acute stage of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is also worthwhile to note that this AT can improve not only these patients&#x02019; positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination and delusion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] but also treatment-resisted negative symptoms (e.g., amotivation, anhedonia and socially withdrawn). This result could be due to the effect of motivational interviewing technique in which the participants were facilitated non-judgementally to explore and resolve ambivalences on management of their illness, treatment and life problems and engaged with their intrinsic motivation to change treatment/illness-related behaviours such as medication adherence and self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Genuine empathy, acceptance and envisioning for a better future in motivational interviewing can be helpful to access motivation and foster therapeutic growth and change specific behaviours regarding those negative symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Several studies reported an oversight of the impact of clinicians&#x02019; characteristics in treatment effectiveness, recommending that further studies utilise patient-centred working staff who were already part of the patient&#x02019;s clinical team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The AT in this study was administered by the community psychiatric nurses of the randomly selected participants after baseline measurements had been taken. This AT were also modified to more focus on participant involvement during its second half or third phase (3 sessions), echoing the importance of enhancing a sense of self-control for the success in treatment, as suggested in studies of psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Recent reviews on AT noticed that effects of AT decay over time, or find that therapy over a course of 5&#x02013;6 sessions was insufficient to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Importantly, our results can conclude a sustained effect across most outcome measures, with the observation of significantly reduced re-hospitalisations at the 18-month follow-up. Previous findings suggested that the effects of adherence therapy targeting at patients&#x02019; beliefs and insights into their illness/treatments seemed to be inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; whereas, this study confirms that such approach can be effective to outpatients with moderate psychotic symptoms in the early stage of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The findings also echo the recommendations by Gray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that adherence modifying factors essentially centred on improved self-determination, patient choice, and shared decision making. Further, AT is able to embody the advantages of continuous boosting up patient&#x02019;s motivation to manage barriers to medication/treatment on top of essential psychosocial support and psychopharmacological education. This therapy can also acknowledge the utmost importance of patient involvement in treatment decisions, understanding about their treatments/medications used, and possible consequences of adherence or non-adherence to medication such as risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], thus allowing patients to decide with fully informed, voluntary choices in taking their medication.</p><p>An investigation of not only individual patients&#x02019; perceptions of and satisfaction with the AT but also the therapeutic process, in terms of motivators and challenges and degrees of engagement and involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], are essential to better understand the active ingredients of a motivation-enhancing behavioural intervention. Further investigation of the relationships between the perceived benefits/strengths of AT and its major components and therapeutic mechanisms can be performed using individual/group interviews and/or structured observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, with a longer-term follow-up (e.g., 24&#x000a0;months), other sustained benefits or outcomes used in psychosocial intervention studies such as improvement in global functioning, satisfaction with mental health services and quality of life, as well as its cost-effectiveness, can be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>A few limitations are noted in this study. First, over 60&#x000a0;% of the patients in the two CPNS were found not eligible to or excluded from the study, although the refusal rate was very low (4.5&#x000a0;%) when approached 650 patients for study participation. These non-participants might not be similar to the participants and their responses to the AT in this study, thus reducing the generalisability of the findings. In addition, the patients who were volunteered to participate were mainly those with full- or part-time employment (64&#x02013;67&#x000a0;%), relatively shorter duration of illness (&#x0003e;55&#x000a0;% having less than 1&#x000a0;year of illness) and satisfactory accommodation and family support, and hence might be highly motivated to attend the six AT sessions (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.6 sessions, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1). The patterns of socio-demographic and illness characteristics and levels of medication adherence or motivation to change might also not be representative to other Chinese populations with psychotic disorders. Therefore, this selective sampling should be cautioned when comparisons are made between this and other studies of medication management programmes.</p><p>Second, all of the outcome measures were reported by the participants, except the level of adherence rated by the research assistant and community psychiatric nurse. There were no biological assays such as hair, urine or blood specimens, which are considered more objective and reliable measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], to validate or confirm with the non-invasive ones in this study. Third, multi-level modelling of data should have been performed for repeated-measures outcome analysis in this study to reduce the errors or problems with ANOVA test on sphericity assumption (constant variances of difference scores), nested design effect (sampling hierarchy in relation to more than one nurse therapists and settings used), and requirements for complete designs and data sets (or very few missing data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Last, the participants and nurse therapists were not blind to the intervention taken and Hawthorne effect (e.g., preconceived benefits of AT) among them could not be excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>AT can be a systematic, multifaceted and client-centred therapy model with evidenced benefits and applicability to outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in a Chinese population. This therapy can also be provided by other mental health professionals if appropriately trained and become an integral part of the community-based rehabilitation programme provided by outpatient care service, together with pharmacological and other psychiatric treatments. In view of this motivational interviewing-based AT being shown effective in Chinese patients with schizophrenia, it deserves further research in the suitability for more representative samples and wider and more systematic implementation in community mental health care for patients with diverse characteristics, levels of medication adherence and illness groups.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARS</term><def><p>Adherence Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AT</term><def><p>Adherence Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPNS</term><def><p>Community Psychiatric Nursing Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPN</term><def><p>community psychiatric nurse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAI</term><def><p>Drug Attitude Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITAQ</term><def><p>Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PANSS</term><def><p>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLOF</term><def><p>Specific Level of Functioning Scale TAU, Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and study design: WTC, JM, EC and RG; Data collection, analysis and interpretation: WTC, RG and JM; Preparation for the manuscript: WTC; and, Final approval of the version to be published: JM, EC and RG.
