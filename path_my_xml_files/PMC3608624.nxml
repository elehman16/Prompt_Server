A total of 3,570 obese participants with no excess of alcohol consumption at baseline (1,795 and 1,775 in the control and surgery group, respectively) were included in the analyses. Changes in transaminase levels during follow-up were compared in the surgery and control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to usual care, bariatric surgery was associated with lower serum ALT and AST levels at 2- and 10- year follow up. The reduction in ALT levels was proportional to the degree of weight loss.

The aim of the current report was to examine the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on serum transaminases in the prospective, controlled study, the Swedish obese subjects (SOS) study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) Study</title><p>The SOS study is a non-randomized, matched, prospective, controlled, intervention trial that compares the long-term effects of bariatric surgery and usual care in obese subjects. The SOS study and its inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described <xref rid="pone.0060495-Sjostrom1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and they were identical for the two treatment groups. Briefly, from September 1<sup>st</sup> 1987 to January 31<sup>st</sup> 2001, a total of 4,047 obese individuals were recruited: 2,010 individuals who selected surgical treatment constituted the bariatric surgery group and a matched control group of 2,037 individuals was enrolled based on 18 matching variables.</p><p>Individuals in the surgery group underwent either nonadjustable or adjustable banding (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;376), vertical banded gastroplasty (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1369) or gastric bypass (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;265). Subjects in the control group received the conventional treatment for obesity at their center of registration (advanced lifestyle modification, other or no treatment). Inclusion criteria were age between 37 to 60 years and BMI of &#x02265;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for men and &#x02265;38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for women. The exclusion criteria were: earlier bariatric surgery, earlier surgery for gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer during the past six months, ongoing malignancy, active malignancy during the past five years, myocardial infarction during the past six months, bulimic eating pattern, psychiatric or cooperative problems contraindicating bariatric surgery, regular use of cortisone or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment; excess of alcohol intake and alcohol or drug abuse, and other severe illnesses. The current and past health status was assessed by extensive questionnaires, completed by patients, and subsequently by health examination. The daily alcohol consumption was collected from the validated SOS dietary questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0060495-Lindroos1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The baseline examination took place approximately four weeks before the date of bariatric surgery for both the surgery patients and the matched control individuals. At baseline examination and after 2 and 10 years, anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters were measured. Blood samples were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast and analyzed at the Central Laboratory of Sahlgrenska University Hospital (accredited according to European Norm 45001).</p><p>In the current report, changes in serum transaminase levels and body weight were calculated as the difference between follow up (2 or 10 years) and baseline values. In addition, incidence of high transaminase during follow-up, as well as remission from high transaminase at baseline were analyzed. Specifically, the high transaminase group was defined by AST levels &#x02265;33 U/L or 29 U/L and ALT levels &#x02265;43 U/L or 30 U/L in men or women, respectively, as cut-offs. These transaminase cut-off levels have been shown to define NAFLD, indicated as liver fat content &#x0003e;5.6% by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in individuals with alcohol intake &#x02264;20 (men) or &#x02264;10 g/day (women) <xref rid="pone.0060495-Kotronen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To be consistent with this previous report, SOS study participants with baseline self-reported alcohol consumptions of &#x0003e;20 g/day (men) or &#x0003e;10 g/day (women) were not included (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;427) in the current analyses. Furthermore, individuals lacking data on baseline AST and ALT levels (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50) were also excluded from the analyses resulting in a total of 3,570 subjects examined in the current report. The ALT/AST ratio was calculated in the follow up as an index of severe liver damage <xref rid="pone.0060495-Angulo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Follow-up data were available for 3,102 (87%) persons after 2 years, and for 2,157 (60%) after 10 years. The cut-off date for our current analysis was March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2009.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>SOS trial has been registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT01479452, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01479452?term=NCT01479452&#x00026;rank=1">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01479452?term=NCT01479452&#x00026;rank=1</ext-link>).

Bariatric surgery is the most effective strategy to achieve and maintain weight loss <xref rid="pone.0060495-Sjstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the present report, the long-term effect of bariatric surgery on serum transaminases has been examined.</p><p>A sustained reduction up to 10 years of both ALT and AST levels was observed in the surgery compared to the control group. Several studies investigating the effect of bariatric surgery on liver enzymes and NAFLD have shown an improvement of serum transaminases and hepatic histologic features after surgery <xref rid="pone.0060495-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060495-Pontiroli1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The novelty of the current report is the observation of a beneficial effect of bariatric surgery on serum transaminases that is maintained up to 10 years after surgery. These data suggest that bariatric surgery has a long-term protective effect against chronic liver damage. The effects after 10 years were smaller than after 2 years and this is likely due to the weight regain observed 10 years after bariatric surgery <xref rid="pone.0060495-Sjstrm2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, analysis of the relation between changes in transaminase levels and changes in body weight showed that weight gain was associated with a significant increase of transaminase levels. ALT showed a continuous linear reduction with increasing weight loss at the 2-year follow up which was maintained at the 10 year follow up. These data indicate that sustained weight loss has a beneficial long-term effect on chronic liver damage and that this effect is proportional to the weight loss reduction.</p><p>When changes in AST levels were examined, a reduction related to weight loss was observed at the 2-year but not at the 10-year follow up. The reason for this unexpected finding is unknown but it may be due to factors that have changed over time (e.g., age, environmental factors, lifestyle habits, medications) and influenced transaminase differently <xref rid="pone.0060495-Siest1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that despite the absence of reduction at 10-year follow up, the AST levels remained lower in the surgery when compared to the control group.</p><p>Furthermore, the long-term effect of bariatric surgery on HT incidence and remission was examined. The incidence of and the remission from HT at both 2- and 10-year follow up were significantly more favorable in the surgery group compared to the control group. Similarly, the prevalence of an ALT/AST ratio &#x0003c;1, an index of severe liver disease <xref rid="pone.0060495-Angulo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, was lower in the surgery group compared to the control group at both 2- and 10-year follow up.</p><p>Taken as a whole, these data suggest that weight reduction has a positive effect on liver transaminases and chronic liver damage.</p><p>Strength of the present report is that we examined the effect of bariatric surgery on liver transaminase in a large obese cohort with a long-term follow up. Previous reports with different study design and shorter follow up have shown that both weight loss induced by lifestyle intervention and bariatric surgery reduce serum transaminase levels and NAFLD <xref rid="pone.0060495-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060495-Pontiroli1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our data confirm these short-term effects in a matched, controlled, prospective study including more than 3,000 obese individuals and also show that the effects are sustained during a 10-year follow up. A limitation of the present report is that the effect of bariatric surgery on transaminase levels was not a predefined endpoint of the SOS study, although the transaminase level measurements were performed prospectively. Thus, our analyses should be considered exploratory. Another limitation is that even though no clinical diagnosis of advanced chronic liver disease was present, we cannot exclude the presence of relevant liver injury at baseline.</p><p>Taken all this together it may be speculated that sustained weight loss obtained by bariatric surgery reduces liver damage and may possibly prevent hepatic long-term sequelae. Further longitudinal studies, using more sensitive techniques to assess chronic liver disease, are warranted to confirm these data. In conclusion, this report shows that bariatric surgery is associated with long-term reduction of serum transaminases in obese individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060495.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
