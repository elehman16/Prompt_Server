Due to the limitations of conventional treatments, alternative IBS treatments are used by many patients worldwide. Samryungbaekchulsan (SRS), a herbal formula, has long been used for alleviating diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) in traditional Korean medicine. Otilonium bromide (OB) is an antimuscarinic compound used to relieve spasmodic pain in the gut, especially in IBS. Although herbal formulae and Western drugs are commonly coadministered for various diseases in Korea, few clinical studies have been conducted regarding the synergic effects of these treatments for any disease, including D-IBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This trial is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, four-arm, parallel study. After a 2-week preparation period, 80 patients with D-IBS will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups consisting of SRS (water extract granules, 5&#x02009;g/pack, three times a day) with OB (tablet form, one capsule three times a day) or their placebos, with treatment lasting for 8 weeks. Post-treatment follow-up will be conducted 4 weeks after the end of treatment. The primary outcome is the finding obtained using the Subject&#x02019;s Global Assessment of Relief method. The secondary outcomes are the severity of symptoms related to D-IBS, determined using a 10-point scale, and the change in symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has full ethical approval of the Ethics Committee of Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary&#x02019;s Hospital (IS15MISV0033) and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (30769).

It affects approximately 20% of the population worldwide, according to population-based studies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;6</xref> In addition, recent evidence suggests that IBS is not only a functional disease but also an organic disease with a complex of symptoms, including infection, immune activation, serotonin dysregulation, bacterial overgrowth, central dysregulation, brain&#x02013;gut interaction and genetics.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref> Based on their predominant bowel habits, patients with IBS can be divided into diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), constipation-predominant IBS or mixed IBS.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 6 9</xref> Recently, smooth&#x000a0;muscle relaxants, bulking agents and antidiarrhoeal agents have been used in the treatment of IBS.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, these methods are often not effective, and many patients with IBS also use complementary treatments, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, psychological treatment and lifestyle correction.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 11 12</xref>
</p><p>Samryungbaekchulsan (SRS; Shenlingbaizhu-san in traditional Chinese medicine; Jinryobyakujutsu-san in Kampo medicine), which was introduced in the famous classical compendium of herbal formulae &#x02018;Formulary of Peaceful Benevolent Dispensary&#x02019;, consists of 10 herbs (Atractylodes rhizoma Alba, Poria sclerotium, Dioscoreae rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma, Coicis semen, Nelumbinis semen, Platycodonis radix, Dolichoris semen, Amomi fructus and Ginseng radix). In traditional Korean and Chinese medicine, this herbal formula has been used to treat GI disease, and various studies have been published regarding the treatment of IBS with SRS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;18</xref> SRS has been shown to have antiacetylcholine and antibarium chloride effects and to suppress gastric secretion and small intestine motility.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, no clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of SRS for IBS when coadministered with a conventional drug.</p><p>Otilonium bromide (OB) is widely used for the prevention and reduction of symptoms in patients with IBS.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> OB has been shown to inhibit L-type and T-type calcium channels, muscarinic receptors and tachykininergic responses in human cultured smooth muscle cells and rat colon strips.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> According to a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT), OB (40 and 80&#x02009;mg) is more effective for treating IBS than placebo, not only for the reduction of bloating and abdominal pain but also for protection from relapse owing to its long-lasting effect.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref>
</p><p>According to the guidelines of the Korean Society of Gastroenterology, antispasmodic agents are recommended for the treatment of D-IBS (grade 1B),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and SRS is the preferred drug for diarrhoea treatment in Korean medicine.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Recently, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the coadministration of herbal formulae and conventional drugs for IBS in China.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> However, there has been no such clinical study in Korea, even though both herbal medicine and conventional drugs are widely used for IBS treatment in the clinical field. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SRS, OB and the coadministration of both drugs.</p><p>In this study, we expect that the combined administration of OB and SRS will result in synergistic effects that improve D-IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, discomfort (the main effect of OB) and diarrhoea-like stool patterns (the main effect of SRS).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the coadministration of SRS and OB to patients with D-IBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Necessity of the trial</title><p>Recently, herbal medicines and Western drugs have been coadministered for various medical therapies. This is particularly true in Korea, where approximately 76% of patients have used the combination of herbal medicines and Western drugs.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, only a few studies have evaluated the interaction between Western and herbal medicines. Despite the need for combined treatment in patients with various diseases, there are no standard clinical guidelines or scientific evidence regarding coadministration because of a lack of research and data.</p><p>D-IBS is a disease that is difficult to cure, and many patients require treatment with both Western and herbal drugs to experience an improvement in their symptoms. Therefore, it is very important to conduct a clinical study regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined administration of SRS and OB in patients with D-IBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Basis of drug selection</title><p>According to guidelines for IBS treatment, the OB recommendation level is high (ie, the level of evidence is moderate and many experts recommend using it), and it is the most reasonable treatment option.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> SRS is the herbal formula used most often by clinical Korean and Chinese medical doctors for abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort and chronic diarrhoea, which are typical symptoms of D-IBS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17 24</xref> Based on these studies and clinical applications, OB and SRS were selected for this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesise: (1)&#x000a0;that coadministration of SRS and OB will have a more positive effect on D-IBS symptoms than either SRS or OB alone; (2)&#x000a0;that after 8 weeks of treatment with SRS, OB or both drugs, the Subject&#x02019;s Global Assessment of Relief and severity of D-IBS symptoms will be more improved than after treatment with placebo and (3)&#x000a0;that coadministration of SRS and OB will be safe for patients with D-IBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

The patients will visit four times, on weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. The primary outcome measurement will be evaluated at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, and the secondary outcome measurement will be evaluated at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Participants will be assessed for efficacy and safety of the treatment through visits (0, 4, 8&#x000a0;and 12 weeks) and telephone questionnaires (2&#x000a0;and 6 weeks). In addition, laboratory tests will be conducted at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. According to the intervention protocols, the clinical research coordinator (CRC) will encourage patients and participants to complete follow-up at every visit.</p><p>During the drug-administration period, SRS or its placebo will be given as one pack of water extract granules three times a day, 30&#x02009;min before each meal.

According to experimental research, SRS has an anticholinergic effect that improves intestinal digestion and absorption, and inhibits intestinal movement, resulting in the prevention of diarrhoea and abdominal pain.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition, clinical studies have shown that the use of SRS in patients with D-IBS is effective for improving diarrhoea.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> Some studies have reported that coadministration with SRS and trimebutine maleate or SRS and paroxetine is more effective than trimebutine maleate alone for the improvement of IBS symptoms.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16 25</xref> Other studies have reported that SRS exerted more beneficial effects on patients with IBS compared with Smecta or probiotics.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 37</xref>
</p><p>However, although there is a growing interest in the use of herbal medicines such as SRS in IBS, and related studies are continuously being published, there have been only a few well-designed RCTs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23 26</xref> To overcome the limitations of the previous studies, this trial was designed as a double-blind, double-dummy, four-arm, parallel-group RCT. The efficacy of SRS will be evaluated via the Subject&#x02019;s Global Assessment of Relief and the improvement in symptoms associated with bowel movements and abdominal pain. The results of these assessments are expected to provide distinct clinical evidence for the use of SRS in D-IBS treatment.</p><p>OB is a representative conventional medicine used for D-IBS treatment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 21 23 38 39</xref> It is a spasmolytic agent that exerts its activity primarily in the distal GI tract through the inhibition of Ca++&#x000a0;flux&#x02009;and direct activation of contractile proteins in the smooth muscle.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> OB has also been shown to reduce hypermotility and modulate visceral sensation, the effect of which is to improve D-IBS symptoms.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> RCTs using OB for the treatment of D-IBS have been conducted. In these studies, treatment with OB resulted in a greater improvement in symptoms related to D-IBS (defecation frequency, regular intestinal habits, reductions in frequency of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and discomfort, severity of abdominal bloating) and better protection from symptom relapse compared with placebo.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23 38</xref>
</p><p>IBS is a disease with a high rate of progression and frequent recurrence. For this reason, patients with IBS often require a variety of treatment methods.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 6 10</xref> Among these methods, the combination of herbal and conventional drugs is widely used and is more effective for improving IBS symptoms than conventional drugs alone.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 35</xref> However, there are several limitations to the coadministration of herbal and conventional drugs in IBS. Specifically, there is a high risk of bias in related studies, and there are insufficient clinical guidelines regarding the interaction of herbal and conventional drugs in D-IBS, including SRS and OB. Therefore, it is necessary to perform well-designed RCTs to evaluate the coadministration of herbal and conventional drugs.</p><p>Because only a few studies have evaluated the combination of herbal and conventional drugs, our proposed study will significantly contribute to overcoming the limitations of previous studies and provide basic medical evidence for the coadministration of SRS and OB for D-IBS treatment. Therefore, this RCT has several characteristic features. First, this trial will be the first to investigate the efficacy of SRS and OB combination therapy for D-IBS. The results of previous studies suggested that the combination of OB and SRS will improve two major D-IBS symptoms at the same time: abdominal pain and discomfort (major effect of OB) and diarrhoea (main effect of SRS). This study will assess this hypothesis and provide a basis for the use of SRS and OB combination therapy for D-IBS. Second, the participants in this trial will be grouped into four arms, making it possible to compare the efficacy of combined treatment with the efficacy of each individual treatment. Third, this trial will evaluate the safety of the subjects using several assessments, including a periodic assessment of subjective symptoms, physical measurements and laboratory testing. The results of the safety analysis may provide evidence for the safety of treatment with the combination of herbal and conventional drugs in D-IBS. Fourth, this trial was the first clinical study related to combination treatment with Western and traditional herbal medicine in Korea to receive approval from the KMFDS. Through the systematic management of the trial under the auspices of the KMFDS, a high-quality trial will be performed, and the results of this study will provide information for use in further clinical applications.</p><p>Although our trial is designed with a small sample size, it has a creative and systematic research design, and the results will be useful basic clinical evidence in the field of integrated herbal and conventional drugs for the management of D-IBS.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The research plan and design began in April 2015.</p><p>The study received the IRB&#x02019;s final approval after two deliberations.
