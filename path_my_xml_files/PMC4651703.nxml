Background</title><p>The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines emphasize the importance of rapid and definite tracheal intubation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The guidelines also suggest that skilled rescuers should be able to secure the airway without interrupting chest compressions to visualize the vocal cords and allow the passage of the tracheal tube [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The Pentax Airwayscope (AWS; Hoya, Tokyo, Japan) is a videolaryngoscope reported to provide an indirect view of the airway [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies indicate that AWS is useful not only for difficult airway management but also for emergent tracheal intubation during resuscitation by simulation analysis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The McGRATH (McGRATH; Aircraft Medical Ltd., Edinburgh, UK) is a device that has been developed with a high-resolution video camera, providing direct and indirect views of the glottis, and is reportedly useful for intubating several difficult airways [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While AWS and McGRATH are both considered convenient tools for difficult or emergent airway management, their indirect monitors may not be useful in the presence of hematemesis or vomitus in the pharynx [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In such patients, direct laryngoscopes such as the Macintosh laryngoscope (McL) may be superior to videolaryngoscopes for definite tracheal intubation.</p><p>The utility of direct (McL) and indirect laryngoscopes (AWS and McGRATH) for tracheal intubation has not yet been validated; therefore, we decided to compare the utility of McL with that of AWS and McGRATH in hematemesis and vomitus settings. Because direct clinical evaluation is unethical, we hypothesized that AWS and McGRATH would improve intubation in simulated hematemesis and vomitus settings and compared them with McL in terms of the ease of tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists using an adult manikin with hematemesis and vomitus simulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>From November to December 2014, 17 doctors with more than a year of experience in anesthesiology or critical care medicine were recruited from medical personnel taking an airway management or sedation training course at the Osaka Medical College. Written informed consent was obtained before the study. This study was approved by the Osaka Medical College Research Ethics Committee (Approval number 1321).</p><p>The Airway Trainer (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway), designed to accurately represent an adult male, was used for the study simulations and intubations. Participants used a tracheal tube (Portex, St. Paul, MN, USA) with an internal diameter of 7.5&#x02009;mm.</p><p>Simulated stomach contents (vomitus; simulated stomach contents, Laerdal, Norway) or simulated blood (hematemesis; simulated blood, Kyoto-Kagaku, Japan) were added to the pharynx of the manikin. The contents were prepared by dissolving 10&#x02009;g of powder in 200&#x02009;mL of water according to the manufacturer's instructions and were poured into the pharynx to the level of covering the epiglottis to simulate vomitus or hematemesis. The lower esophagus was clamped with forceps to keep these liquids in the pharynx. We also clamped both bronchi instead of the trachea because clamping the trachea impedes smooth tracheal intubation. The different views (normal, hematemesis, and vomitus setting) of the three devices are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The manikin was placed on a hard, flat table for &#x0201c;on the resuscitation bed&#x0201d; simulation. Each participant was instructed to insert the tracheal tube with the three laryngoscopes (McL, AWS, and McGRATH), attach a bag valve mask, and attempt to ventilate the lungs of the manikin. In McL and McGRATH trials, participants used size 4 blade. In AWS trial, standard Introck (ITL-SL, HOYA, Japan) was used. Participants were given 10&#x02009;min to practice intubation, with the instructor available for advice. The appropriate equipment for each trial was placed in a box next to the manikin's head. Intubation started when the participant picked up McL, AWS, or McGRATH and ended at the point of manual ventilation after tube insertion. The number of intubation sessions was recorded for both tracheal and esophageal intubations. At the end of the study, participants rated the difficulty of using each device using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0&#x02009;mm (extremely easy) to 100&#x02009;mm (extremely difficult).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed utilizing JMP 11 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results obtained from each trial were compared using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance for intubation time and VAS and chi-square test for the success rate. Data are presented as means &#x000b1; standard deviations (SDs). A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>The study was designed as a randomized crossover trial to minimize the order effect. In each McL, AWS, and McGRATH trial, participants performed tracheal intubation in all three simulations (normal, hematemesis, and vomitus). The order of intervention was randomized for each participant using the random number table, resulting in a total of nine interventions per participant.</p><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of our preliminary study on the time required for intubation with McL and McGRATH in the vomitus setting in eight participants. The mean (SD) time was 11.1 &#x000b1; 3.3&#x02009;s for McL and 5.9 &#x000b1; 3.6&#x02009;s for McGRATH. Using an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> error of 0.05 and a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> error of 0.2, we estimated that 15 participants would be adequate for each group. Therefore, we planned to recruit 17 participants for each group to adjust for missing data.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>The mean clinical experience of the 17 participants (11 male, 6 female) was 6.4 &#x000b1; 3.6 years. The number of times the participants had worked before participating in the trial with McL, AWS, and McGRATH was 911.8 &#x000b1; 501.1, 128.8 &#x000b1; 94.2, and 68.2 &#x000b1; 66.0, respectively.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1.

The VAS score was not significantly different between McL and McGRATH in both the hematemesis and vomitus settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Airway management is considered an essential element, particularly for in-hospital CPR. While conventional direct-view laryngoscopes such as McL are the most widely used for tracheal intubation, it is difficult to master the skills required for use, and the incidence of inaccurate intubation can be unacceptably high for occasional operators [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are several reasons for the difficulty in airway management during resuscitation, such as chest compression, position of the rescuer or victim, and restriction of the airway management device [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A major problem encountered during airway management is vomitus or blood in the pharynx and neck fixation with the cervical collar. A nonnegligible number of patients exhibit vomiting or hematemesis during sudden cardiac arrest, leading to difficulty in tracheal intubation during resuscitation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In such situations, Easy Tube or combitube may be safe against aspiration and can therefore be used in vomiting or bleeding patients unless the glottis cannot be visualized. However, these devices usually do not complete protection of the trachea, and definite tracheal intubation is preferable in some circumstances [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Pentax-AWS Airwayscope is a videolaryngoscope for tracheal intubation designed to provide a clear view of the glottis and its surrounding structures. It improves the laryngeal view, and its tube guide facilitates rapid and reliable tracheal intubation under vision, even in difficult situations such as cervical neck immobility or morbid obesity [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicates that AWS is suitable for tracheal intubation during various difficult airway management and simulated emergency situations [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, one clinical study showed that AWS did not show superiority to McL in prehospital settings, as opposed to simulated in-hospital situations [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We speculate that vomitus or hematemesis may have contributed to the lower success rate of AWS in the prehospital situations.</p><p>McGRATH is a portable videolaryngoscope that provides excellent laryngoscopic views in patients with normal airways and patients in whom direct laryngoscopy is difficult or fails [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While AWS provides only an indirect view of the glottis, McGRATH provides both direct and indirect views. There are several reports on the utility of these devices for airway management during resuscitation.</p><p>The present study found that the intubation time with AWS was significantly longer in the vomitus and hematemesis settings than in the normal setting, accompanied by a significant intubation success rate difference. In contrast, the intubation time did not significantly increase with McL and McGRATH. Only one or two participants failed in the hematemesis setting and all anesthesiologists were successful in intubating in the vomitus settings with McL or McGRATH. One probable reason for the difficulties experienced with AWS is that the video monitor is severely disturbed by vomitus and hematemesis. In contrast, as McGRATH can provide not only an indirect video monitor view but also a direct laryngeal view, participants could perform definite tracheal intubation, even in vomitus and hematemesis settings. Furthermore, because McGRATH provides a better laryngeal view compared with the conventional McL [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it may be useful for emergent tracheal intubation in vomitus and hematemesis settings.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, intubation was performed on a manikin, which leads to shorter airway intervention times than those required for actual patients [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Second, the use of these three devices may be less than ideal in patients with difficult airways, such as those with a severely restricted mouth opening or a small jaw. Third, the simulations do not account for other factors related to resuscitation, such as chest compression and cervical stabilization [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Finally, the homogeneity of hematemesis and vomitus cannot completely simulate clinical situations.</p><p>For future directions, there is a controversy whether securing the airway using tracheal intubation is the best way of airway management during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, in the next study, it may be interesting to evaluate the efficacy of supraglottic devices such as laryngeal mask, laryngeal tube, or combitube for airway management in the hematemesis or vomitus settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of our study, we conclude McGRATH and McL can show superior performance compared with AWS for tracheal intubation in adults with vomitus or blood in the pharynx. Future studies examining accumulated evidence of clinical experiences and randomized trials of McL, AWS, and McGRATH in actual patients with hematemesis or vomitus are required to clarify the findings of this simulation study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CPR:</term><def><p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERC:</term><def><p>European Resuscitation Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AWS:</term><def><p>Pentax-AWS Airwayscope</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>McGRATH:</term><def><p>McGRATH MAC</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>McL:</term><def><p>Macintosh laryngoscope.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors have no affiliation with the manufacturers of any of the devices described in the paper and declare no financial interest in the material described in it.
