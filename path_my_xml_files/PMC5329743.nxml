These cells are part of the inner lining of blood vessels and have metabolic and also synthetic functions[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When endothelial cells are functioning abnormally or &#x0201c;endothelial dysfunction&#x0201d;, it is associated with poor vascular reactivity, pro-thrombosis, pro-adhesion, pro-inflammation, and growth promotion[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Several recent reviews on cardiovascular complications associated with energy drink consumption suggest that the impact on endothelial function could be a factor in subsequent cardiac events[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some of their ingredients individually or in combination may be associated with reduced endothelial function[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Mechanistically, endothelial dysfunction, where the endothelium&#x02019;s ability in regulating vascular resistance is impaired, may be related to reduced coronary blood flow[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Following exposure to stress such as exposure to cold, mental arithmetic, anger, exercise, cigarette smoking, cocaine, excess food or alcohol, the impaired ability to dilate the coronary arteries could result in supply-demand imbalance or coronary spasm, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia, coronary vasospasm, thrombosis and/or cardiac arrhythmia[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Importantly, this acute endothelial dysfunction could lead to ischemia, which in turn could lead to serious arrhythmia, coronary vasospasm, and myocardial infarction[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>This study describes the acute changes of normal endothelial function after consumption of a single can of a popular energy drink[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After fasting from caffeine for at least 24 h and food for at least 8 h prior, eleven healthy non-smoker medical students (9 males), average age 24.5 years (range 23-27 years), average BMI 22.8, received an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and pulse check, and underwent baseline testing (BL) of endothelial function using the technique of endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) with high-resolution ultrasound according to recommended guidelines of the University of Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program Core Laboratory by a single registered vascular ultrasonographer who was certified by the University of Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program Core Laboratory[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>After resting supine for 10-min in a temperature-controlled room, a blood pressure cuff was placed on the widest part of proximal right forearm approximately 1 cm distal to the antecubital fossa. Using a 10 MHz resolution linear array vascular ultrasound transducer with a Philips iE33 ultrasound machine, the brachial artery was located above the elbow and scanned in longitudinal sections. After recording baseline B-mode digital images of the brachial artery and spectral Doppler images of flow, the forearm cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 min to induce reactive hyperemia. Immediately after deflation, spectral Doppler images are obtained to verify hyperemia. FMD of the brachial artery was measured 60 and 90 s after cuff deflation. The relative FMD (%) was calculated as the ratio between the largest post-cuff release and the baseline diameter. Each image was checked for quality control, and each artery diameter was measured from the media to media points by two experts, 3 measurements at the QRS complex, repeated on 3 separate beats, and then averaged.</p><p>The subjects then drank an energy beverage (EB), a 24-oz can of Monster Energy Drink<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in approximately 1 min.

They found that an hour after consumption of an energy drink, there was an acute decreased in endothelial function and increased platelet aggregation[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Another study involving 25 healthy young adults (13 male, aged 22.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 years) who consumed either 355-mL Red Bull or 355-ml tap water noted that 2 h later, while blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output were significantly increased, there was no reduction in endothelial function <italic>via</italic> finger skin microcirculation[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>A 47-year-old healthy Caucasian male was noted to have a progressive attenuation of peak flow-mediated dilatation at 45 and 90 min following consumption of a 24-oz can of Monster Energy Drink<sup>&#x000ae;[7]</sup>.</p><p>Energy drinks likely increase myocardial oxygen demand, and this may be increased under stress. For example, one study has noted that the combination of Red Bull and mental stress results in greater increases in heart rate and blood pressure, <italic>i.e</italic>., a greater cardiovascular load[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>While our study has noted a change in endothelial function after consumption of energy drinks, which is consistent with some of the previous studies, it still however conflicts with other studies. A possible explanation for these contrasting results on endothelial function, blood pressure, and heart rate in response to energy drinks include difference in methods of assessing endothelial function, difference in methods of monitoring blood pressure, difference in types of energy drinks consumed, difference in study participant profiles, and varying environmental stimuli[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Further investigations should take in account these differences, and also investigate how energy drink consumption in stress conditions affect endothelial function, as it would help simulate conditions in which energy drinks are used in real-life.</p><p>Weaknesses of our study include the fact that human measurement was performed on the arterial segments, which may be less accurate than automated detection methods. However one study analyzing variability and reproducibility of FMD found that the mean absolute difference in %FMD from baseline FMD assessment was 1.04% and 0.99% for short-term (48 h) and medium-term (3 mo) repeat measurements, respectively[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Potential improvements in the future include a water load as a control, and having FMD baseline measurements performed on one day, followed by the FMD measurements with energy beverage consumption on the next day. In addition, this was a small sample, and such medical student volunteers may be healthier than the normal population.</p><p>Consumption of energy drinks may lead to an acute attenuation of endothelial function. Given the popularity of energy drinks, especially among youth, the combination of their consumption and exercise/extreme sports, and the rise in emergency room visits associated with their consumption, it is important that the specific physiological effects they are having be elucidated. Due to the potential endothelial dysfunction that may occur with energy drinks and the potential morbidity when consumed with exercise, further research is needed to explore these mechanisms and significance of their effects.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Energy drinks are being consumed more and more worldwide, and have been associated with deaths in adolescents and young adults, especially when consumed while exercising. Adverse cardiovascular events can be caused by abnormal endothelial cell function or &#x0201c;endothelial dysfunction&#x0201d;.
