Analysis of biopsy and/or resection specimens is routinely performed in many cancers in an attempt to identify molecular abnormalities that can provide useful diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information and assist clinicians in the decision-making process.</p><p id="Par3">Nevertheless, it has been increasingly recognised that tissue-based genetic tests are limited by some inherent characteristics of cancer such as intra-tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Tumour lesions are composed of clones of cancer cells that may differ in terms of genetic make-up and aggressive potential. The relative contribution of each clone to the overall tumour phenotype and disease burden at a given time is also largely affected by a number of factors including exposure to treatments that exert a selective pressure on cancer cells and ultimately drive tumour evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, genetic analyses on pre-existing archived tissue and/or random sampling of small amount of tumour may result in a suboptimal portrayal of the tumour molecular profile and be of limited value in routine practice.</p><p id="Par4">Over the last few years, detection and analysis of circulating, cell-free, tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood has emerged as an alternative analytic method with the potential to overcome the above limitations and provide a real-time, exhaustive characterisation of cancer genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although the exact mechanisms whereby cancer cells shed DNA into the bloodstream have not been fully elucidated, it is now clear that a simple blood sample (i.e., liquid biopsy) is a valuable source of genetic material likely to encompass the wide intra- and inter-lesional tumour heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Compared with conventional, tissue-based, sampling procedures, blood sampling is quicker, less invasive and by far more convenient for both patients and clinicians/health providers. All these advantages make liquid biopsy also particularly suitable for the dynamic assessment of tumour response to treatment or monitoring of disease status during follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The clinical usefulness of ctDNA analysis is confirmed by the recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 as a blood-based diagnostic tool for the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) mutations and selection of non-small cell lung cancer patients who are candidates for erlotinib treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Also, algorithms have been proposed for non-invasive diagnosis and discrimination of cancer type based on copy number variation in ctDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In colorectal cancer, detecting and quantifying ctDNA by using common somatic mutations (i.e., <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>) and/or tumour epigenetic alterations (i.e., <italic>CDKN2A</italic> or <italic>RASSF2A</italic> methylation) has been demonstrated to be feasible and clinically relevant. Studies have reported an association between presence of post-operative ctDNA and risk of tumour recurrence in early-stage colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> or presence/levels of ctDNA and overall tumour burden/prognosis in metastatic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, tracking <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and other genetic aberrations accounting for primary or secondary resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies is an attractive dynamic method to monitor the emergence/evolution of resistant clones to cetuximab or panitumumab and to potentially allow the implementation of adaptive treatment strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Nevertheless, limited information is available on the feasibility and clinical potential of ctDNA analysis in non-metastatic rectal cancer. Algorithms for risk stratification have been recently developed for these patients and risk-adapted therapies increasingly investigated in clinical trials and ultimately implemented in routine practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It is possible that, in this setting, the analysis of ctDNA may provide valuable information to combine with standard clinico-pathological and imaging data and lead to a better assessment of individual patient risk and more refined treatment approaches. Only a few studies have been conducted so far in rectal cancer patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The results of these studies are difficult to interpret and compare especially due to the small numbers and significant heterogeneity with regard to the methods used for the assessment of ctDNA (i.e., total circulating cell-free DNA, DNA integrity index or tumour-specific molecular alterations) and the outcome measures selected for the evaluation of tumour response to treatment (i.e., pathological downstaging or tumour regression grading).</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, we aimed to contribute to the existing data around liquid biopsy in non-metastatic rectal cancer by assessing feasibility, hurdles and potential clinical implications of using <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutations as markers for ctDNA detection in a relatively large prospective series of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients who were included in a randomised phase II trial (EXPERT-C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par8">EXPERT-C (Trial registration: ISRCTN Register: 99828560) was an international, multicenter, randomised phase II trial in which patients with high-risk LARC were treated with 12 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CAPOX (oxaliplatin 130&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 and capecitabine 1700 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for 14 days, every 3 weeks) followed by chemoradiotherapy (50.4&#x02009;Gy in 28 fractions with concomitant continuous capecitabine 1650 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day over 6 weeks), total mesorectal excision (4 to 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy) and 12 weeks of adjuvant CAPOX (as above) with or without weekly cetuximab (400&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> loading dose, 250&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> subsequent doses)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Distant metastases were an exclusion criterion and ruled out with a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen. During treatment, MRI and CT scans were repeated after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy with MRI scans being centrally reviewed by a blinded radiologist.

OS was measured from date of randomisation to death from any cause. Patients without an event were censored at last date known to be alive. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to summarise the survival estimates while the Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the survival rates between patient groups with and without adjustment for the effect of covariates. The proportional hazards assumption was tested with the use of Schoenfeld residuals. Interaction tests were conducted to investigate whether a differential treatment effect (i.e., with or without cetuximab) was present for CR rate, PFS and OS within the patient groups analysed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par18">Of 164 eligible patients who were randomised in the EXPERT-C trial, 97 (59%) were assessable for the analysis of <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutations in ctDNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In some of these patients, the discrepancy between the results of tissue and plasma mutational analysis could be partly explained by a number of factors such as low frequency of the mutant allele in plasma, limited tissue availability (i.e., only one sample available, either biopsy or resection) or low tumour infiltration in tissue specimens (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

Eight patients (5%) were not assessable in either tissue or plasma. In an exploratory analysis, data on <italic>KRAS</italic> status in ctDNA were combined with previously obtained data on <italic>KRAS</italic>/<italic>NRAS</italic> status in tumour tissue and patient outcome assessed by presence/absence of these mutations.

To our knowledge only 4 small studies addressing this topic have been published.</p><p id="Par26">By using a real time PCR technique Zitt <italic>et al</italic>. analysed the levels of circulating cell-free DNA in 26 patients who were treated with pre-operative, fluorouracil-based, chemoradiotherapy for cT3&#x02013;4 mid-low tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A reduction of DNA levels was observed after completion of chemoradiotherapy in all patients but neither baseline nor post-treatment DNA concentrations were predictive of pathological downstaging. A significant difference between responders (i.e., ypT0&#x02013;2) and non-responders (i.e., ypT3&#x02013;4) was found only after surgery (i.e., further decrease of DNA in responders but increase of DNA in non-responders, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006). In a larger study including 67 patients with cT3-4 and/or N+ tumours, Agostini <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the circulating cell-free DNA integrity index (i.e., a ratio between long and short DNA fragments) was statistically significantly different between responding and non-responding patients (as defined by the degree of tumour regression according to the Mandard score) only after completion of fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0009) but not at baseline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The DNA integrity index at this time point was also found to be the only independent predictive factor of response to neoadjuvant treatment in multivariate analysis. The potential of the DNA integrity index in this setting was confirmed by Sun <italic>et al</italic>. who showed an association between this parameter (both at baseline and after neoadjuvant treatment) and pathological tumour regression grading according to the Dworak&#x02019;s score in 34 patients who received an oxaliplatin-based chemoradiotherapy for cT3-4 and/or N+ rectal tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, while the rate of <italic>KRAS</italic> codon 12 mutation decreased with chemoradiotherapy in all patients with no difference between responders and non-responders, a higher rate of MGMT methylation at baseline was predictive of pathological response. Finally, in a recent report of 4 LARC patients whose ctDNA was tracked in serial blood samples by using two patient-specific chromosomal rearrangements, Carpinetti <italic>et al</italic>. showed an overall lack of correlation between normalisation of ctDNA and amount of residual disease in the surgical specimens after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, changes of ctDNA levels after surgery appeared to predict tumour recurrence.</p><p id="Par27">The aims of our study were to confirm that ctDNA analysis is feasible in a population of non-metastatic rectal cancer patients, to assess <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutations as markers for ctDNA detection, and to explore potential clinical implications of detectable <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in ctDNA. For this purpose, we analysed a relatively large and homogeneous series of patients with MRI-defined, high-risk, LARC who were treated with an investigational strategy plus or minus cetuximab within a randomised phase II trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The results support the potential of ctDNA as biomarker for LARC based on a number of interesting findings. Also they highlight possible challenges for future prospective ctDNA-based studies in this setting.</p><p id="Par28">By using a pragmatic approach and restricting our analysis to the three most common <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in exon 2 in the overall study population and to less common, patient-specific <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in selected cases, we initially found that ctDNA was detectable in approximately 40% of patients. Interestingly, the rate of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in plasma did not appear much different between patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type and those with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumours. Also, in some patients from the latter group, the analysis of ctDNA showed the presence of additional <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations that were not detected on tissue. These observations support the higher sensitivity of ddPCR compared with the standard PCR-based techniques that were originally used for tumour mutational analysis in our series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, when tissue-derived DNA of patients with discordant results was assessed by ddPCR, high concordance for <italic>KRAS</italic> status (i.e., 85%) was observed between tissue and plasma. On the other hand, the lack of complete concordance between tissue and plasma (i.e., 15% of patients had <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in plasma only) suggests the ability ctDNA analysis to provide a more comprehensive characterisation of tumour molecular profiling and minimise the impact of tumour heterogeneity/random tissue sampling on routine mutational testing procedures. In support of this contention, in 2 out of 22 patients with concordant results, the <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation was found only after the analysis of DNA which was extracted from different FFPE tissue sections.</p><p id="Par29">Generally, one of the main concerns regarding the use of highly sensitive techniques is the clinical significance of sub-clonal somatic mutations that occur at a low frequency and therefore would be below the detection threshold of common diagnostic platforms which are used in routine practice. Studies in metastatic colorectal cancer, however, suggest that increasing the detection sensitivity for tumour <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations may actually refine patient selection for anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies by identifying a higher proportion of patients who fail to respond to these agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, detection of low-frequency <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant alleles in blood of patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumb may represent an early sign of expansion/emergence of tumour resistant clones, predict forthcoming clinical progression and warrant consideration of alternative treatment strategies to overcome resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this study, we could not demonstrate that refining the <italic>RAS</italic> wild-type population by taking into account the results of the ctDNA analysis had an impact on the overall effect of cetuximab. In line with our previous reports of this trial where patients were classified according to either <italic>KRAS</italic> exon 2&#x02013;3<italic>/BRAF</italic> or extended <italic>RAS</italic> tissue mutational status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, adding cetuximab to chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy did not significantly improve the outcome of wild-type tumours. It should be noted, however, that in the EXPERT-C trial the use of cetuximab was investigational and there is still no evidence that EGFR is a valuable therapeutic target for LARC. Furthermore, some of the limitations of this study (i.e., retrospective analysis and relatively small sample size) and the use of a multimodality treatment approach including radiotherapy may have introduced significant biases and limited the ability to assess the role of either <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>RAS</italic> mutations as negative predictive biomarkers for cetuximab in this setting.</p><p id="Par30">Despite the high sensitivity of ddPCR, more than one third of patients with <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutant tumours in our study were not found to harbour the corresponding mutation in plasma. One could argue that this may be partly explained by the decision to consider data from the analysis of resection specimens as representative of the tumour mutational status even in the absence of an assessable biopsy sample at baseline. However, the degree of concordance between paired specimens in our series was high and there was no case where the emergence of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant clones following neoadjuvant treatment could be suspected. Furthermore, it is important to note that our data are in line with those previously reported in series of non-metastatic patients with colorectal cancer or other tumour types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Overall, this indicates that alternative strategies could be necessary to exploit the clinical potential of ctDNA analysis in larger populations. Although undetectable plasma <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutations could just reflect the absence of micrometastatic disease, ctDNA assays designed to detect multiple tumour-specific somatic aberrations may prove to be more sensitive and useful than those detecting single gene mutations (especially if present at a low allelic frequency). In this regard, it is interesting to note that, in our study, a difference between tissue and plasma was noted in terms of relative frequency of specific <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. While this could be a random effect, it may also suggest that, at least in the setting of non-metastatic disease/limited tumour burden, tumours with specific <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (i.e., G12V) are less likely to release DNA in blood compared to those harbouring different mutations (i.e., G12D).</p><p id="Par31">Although studies suggest that ctDNA analysis could be used as a minimally invasive, dynamic tool to predict prognosis and response to adjuvant treatment in localised colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the results of our analysis do not appear to support this contention. In fact, even though an association between baseline poor-prognosis features and detectable ctDNA such as advanced T stage was found, there was no difference in outcome between patients with or without detectable ctDNA. It is possible, however, that this apparent discrepancy may be due to the timing of blood sampling (i.e., pre-operative in our study vs. post-operatively in other series) and the biological difference between detectable ctDNA at each of these time points. Furthermore, the treatment strategy used in the EXPERT-C trial with upfront administration of systemic chemotherapy might have limited the negative prognostic impact of ctDNA, this hypothesis being supported by the relatively low incidence of distant metastases observed in this trial and in other similar studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Our study is the largest analysis of ctDNA in non-metastatic rectal cancer. It suffers, however, from a number of limitations such as the retrospective approach, the limited number of assessable patients and the use of detection techniques with different sensitivity in tumour tissue and plasma. Furthermore, the availability of only one blood sample per patient at baseline precluded the analysis of changes of ctDNA during/after neoadjuvant treatment which are likely to be more informative in terms of assessment of treatment response and consideration of adaptive treatment strategies. Nevertheless, the data here reported confirm that <italic>KRAS/BRAF</italic> mutations in ctDNA can be detected by ddPCR with high sensitivity and provide further support for the initiation of prospective trials investigating the potential clinical applications of ctDNA analysis in the setting of LARC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec9"><p>
