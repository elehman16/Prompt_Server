For this purpose, the practitioner had to move from the navel about one finger width cranially. From there fingers were placed slightly next to the right, next to the median line. At this point, fingers slowly slid posteriorly into the abdomen. Once palpation advanced deeply enough, a lens-sized solidification could be palpated. Small circulations, vibrations or inhibitions on this point were applied until the tonus and sensitivity were clearly reduced.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentences in the Discussion section overlap with the text from Reference 22 in the original article:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;In a prospective randomized trial preterm infants received moderate pressure massage and were compared to control with light pressure massage.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;The moderate massage stimulated the vagal nerve leading into increased gastric motility.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187784.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Haiden</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pimpel</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kreissl</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jilma</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name> (<year>2015</year>) <article-title>Does Visceral Osteopathic Treatment Accelerate Meconium Passage in Very Low Birth Weight Infants?- A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial</article-title>. <source>PLoS ONE</source>
