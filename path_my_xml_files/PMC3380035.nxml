The core ADHD symptoms include lack of attention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity <xref rid="pone.0037280-Barkley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Goldman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Many children and adolescents with ADHD also frequently suffer from lack of social competence and have language difficulties, learning problems, and difficulties in interacting with parents and teachers. The fundamental basis for the social skills problems are the attentional and cognitive difficulties, such as difficulties with problem solving, planning, mood regulation, and motivation delay. These difficulties are closely related to the condition <xref rid="pone.0037280-Landau1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037280-Whalen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Pharmacological treatment of children with ADHD shows beneficial effects on core symptoms in about 80&#x00025; of the patients <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storeb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is a question if pharmacological treatment alone has sufficient effect on the social skills problems <xref rid="pone.0037280-Cyr1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037280-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In both the European clinical guidelines for hyperkinetic disorders and the NICE guidelines, parental training and social skills training for the school-aged children are recommended <xref rid="pone.0037280-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have identified four meta-analyses on social skills training for children with ADHD. Two of them state that social skills training for children with ADHD has no effect <xref rid="pone.0037280-Kavale1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-VanderOord1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and two of them state that social skills training for children with ADHD has a significant beneficial treatment effect <xref rid="pone.0037280-deBoo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-MajewiczHefley1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we conducted a Cochrane systematic review of randomized clinical trials to investigate the effect of social skills training for children with ADHD. Our review showed no statistically significant treatment effects either on social skills competences (positive value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; better for the intervention group) (SMD 0.16; 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.04 to 0.36; 5 trials, n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;392 participants), on general behaviour (negative value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; better for the intervention group) (SMD 0.00; 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.21 to 0.21; 3 trials, n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;358 participants), or on ADHD symptoms (negative value &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; better for the intervention group) (SMD &#x02212;0.02; 95&#x00025; CI &#x02212;0.19 to 0.16; 6 trials, n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;515 participants). Because of the high risk of bias (systematic errors) in all the included trials and insufficient power (few participants in the trials), these findings are inconclusive. All the included trials had no blinding of outcome assessment and more than half of the trials had high risk of bias regarding generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment which makes the results questionable and inconclusive. Our review suggests that there is little evidence to support or refute social skills training for adolescents with ADHD. Therefore, there is a need for more trials, with low risk of bias and with a sufficient number of participants, investigating the efficacy of social skills training versus no training for both children and adolescents <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storebo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, we designed the social skills training attachment (SOSTRA) trial on the basis of this review and efforts were made to avoid systematic errors in its design <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storebo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our hypothesis was that adding social skills training plus parental training to the standard treatment would give a statistical significant difference on the children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms, their social and emotional competences compared with standard treatment alone.</p><p>Some studies suggest a possible connection between insecure attachment patterns and ADHD, and the specific attachment style has a prognostic influence <xref rid="pone.0037280-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037280-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. ADHD is an inherited disease, and parent&#x02019;s own ADHD symptoms might also predict the outcome <xref rid="pone.0037280-Lionel1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore we also assessed possible predictive value of the child&#x02019;s attachment competence and the parent&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>Previously we have described the design and plan for the analysis of the SOSTRA trial <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storebo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Briefly, children aged 8 to 12 years who had been diagnosed with ADHD and their parents were randomized to experimental and control treatment. The experimental treatment consisted of social-skills training plus parental training combined with standard treatment versus standard treatment alone. The design was a randomized, two-armed, parallel group, assessor-blinded superiority trial. The children were examined at baseline and three months and six months after randomization. In this trial we included a baseline assessment of the child&#x02019;s attachment competence and the parent&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms, and analysed the prognostic influence of these factors.

They were screened according to the following inclusion criteria: ADHD diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, 1994), 8 years to 12 years at the time of the start of assessment, and parents willing to take part in the trial and giving consent for medical treatment of the child as well as to participation of the child in the trial. Exclusion criteria were: schizophrenia or all the autism diagnoses according to DSM IV, violent and criminal children, both verbal and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) below 80, previously medicated for ADHD, and resistance against participating.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measures and Reliability</title><p>The children were screened at entry by the The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged Children (K-SADS). This semi-structured interview includes algorithms from the DSM-IV in children and adolescents <xref rid="pone.0037280-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The K-SADS was administered by the first author who was trained to administer the K-SADS (OJS). The child was screened for autism and the parents completed the Social Communication Questionnaires (SCQ). Children with scores above 15 on two SCQ questionnaires were excluded <xref rid="pone.0037280-Rutter1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

After assessment and confirmation of the ADHD diagnosis, the family was offered medical treatment for the child following a medication protocol. The children had never previously received medical treatment for ADHD. We followed defined treatment algorithms for the medication of ADHD. The treatment started with the first choice: methylphenidate; the second choice: dexamphetamine; and atomoxetine was considered in patients where there was a suspicion of abuse of dexamphetamine or a significant anxiety component change. During the eight months following randomization, the children were not offered any supplementary treatment, such as anti-psychotics or antidepressants. All children were examined one week and again one month after the start of medical treatment; positive effects and adverse effects were evaluated. The standard treatment involved an educational parent group, where the parents met three times during the eight week trial and received general information about ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>The experimental intervention</title><p>Social-skills training aimed to improve and maintain the individual&#x02019;s social skills. The children were taught how to adjust their verbal and nonverbal behaviour in their social interaction. Social-skills training also included efforts to change the child&#x02019;s cognitive assessment of the &#x02018;social world&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Fohlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The training generally focused on teaching the children to &#x02018;read&#x02019; the subtle cues in social interaction, such as learning to wait for their turn <xref rid="pone.0037280-Liberman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The children in SOSTRA were offered weekly 90 minute social-skills training sessions in a total of eight weeks. Each group included two therapists trained in social-skills training before the trial. Therapists from the Langager School in Aarhus gave continuous supervision throughout the trial. Each session was video recorded, and the therapist completed forms confirming that he/she had followed the manual. These videos and forms were used to ensure that the planned material in the intervention was being sufficiently implemented. The intervention manual, which may be obtained from the corresponding author, conforms to the programme of several randomized trials <xref rid="pone.0037280-Antshel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Pfiffner1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Different methods of teaching the children social skills were used, all of which have proved successful in other social-skills programmes <xref rid="pone.0037280-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Didactic instructions were used, including work with symbols, games, creative techniques, music, story reading, and movies. Each session had a theme, such as self-worth, nonverbal communication, feelings, impulse control, aggression management, conflict resolution, and problem solving. Many of these themes are recommended as important topics in social skills training by the NICE guidelines <xref rid="pone.0037280-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The treatment focused on strengthening the ability of the children to control them to start a self-help process.</p><p>During the process where the children received social skills training, the parents attended parental training. The themes from the children&#x02019;s groups were discussed during the parental groups. The children&#x02019;s homework was also discussed. The efficacy of the intervention was assessed by studying the amount of improvement in ADHD symptoms and social skills per se, or by assessing psychological functioning on a broader aspect, including the quality of peer relationships and emotional competency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of a type I error (&#x003b1;) of 5&#x00025; and a type II error (&#x003b2;) of 20&#x00025;, thus a power of 80&#x00025;, and an allocation ratio of 1:1. With a minimally clinical relevant difference of 4 points between the intervention group and the control group on the Conner&#x02019;s 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition Rating Scale &#x02018;hyperactivity-impulsivity&#x02019; subindex (the primary outcome) and an assumed standard deviation of 5 points on the same scale <xref rid="pone.0037280-Corkum1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, a sample size of 26 participants in each group was needed. We based our minimal relevant difference in mean score of 4 on the primary outcome the &#x02018;hyperactivity-impulsivity&#x02019; subindex on Conners&#x02019; scale on the existing literature and prior experience from our research department. The index Hyperactivity-Impulsivity on Conners&#x02019; scale consists of 18 items and may range from 0 to 54. We consider the difference in means to be of clinical relevance in this patient group and under the present settings <xref rid="pone.0037280-Corkum1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. If we are able to change the symptom severity by 4 or more in this hard to treat patient group we find this clinically relevant. The chosen SD, of 5, can be viewed upon as a tad low, however, under the present setting with the present population and specific intervention conditions, we foresaw limited variation. The estimate of the SD for the Hyperactivity-Impulsivity index on Connors&#x02019; scale is primarily influenced by the data from Horn et al. <xref rid="pone.0037280-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the outcomes was based on the &#x02018;intention-to-treat&#x02019; principle and primarily conducted with adjustment for the protocol specified stratification variables (sex and presence of co-morbidity) and secondarily conducted without this adjustment <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storebo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The group coding was concealed for the statistician. The level of significance was 0.05.</p><p>The mixed-model repeated measures method (SAS version 9.1) was used to compare the effect of the two interventions over time on the outcome measures. The model is the following: Outcome measure &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; a&#x022c5;sex &#x0002b; b&#x022c5;co-morbidity &#x0002b; c&#x022c5;intervention-group &#x0002b; d&#x022c5;t &#x0002b; e&#x022c5;t<sup>2</sup> &#x0002b; f&#x022c5;intervention-group&#x022c5;t &#x0002b; g&#x022c5;intervention-group&#x022c5;t<sup>2</sup>, where co-morbidity, sex and intervention-group are binary indicator variables and t is treated as a continuous variable; a through g are coefficients to be estimated during the analysis. The basic model is Outcome measure &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; a&#x022c5;sex &#x0002b; b&#x022c5;co-morbidity &#x0002b; d&#x022c5;t &#x0002b; e&#x022c5;t<sup>2</sup>, where the outcome measure is modelled as a linear function of time (t) and time squared (t<sup>2</sup>). The latter term is included to model a time course that may be almost linear initially and then blunted as time goes by. If sex or co-morbidity is having an impact on the outcome measure this effect is compensated for by including the terms sex and co-morbidity in the model to improve the precision.</p><p>To model a possible impact of the intervention on the mean level, the slope of the linear function (t), and the slope of t<sup>2</sup> the terms intervention-group &#x0002b; intervention-group&#x022c5;t &#x0002b; intervention-group&#x022c5;t<sup>2</sup>, respectively, are added to the model.</p><p>A sequential hypothesis testing was used, which is appropriate for polynomial models. Since the measurements within a given patient are probably dependent, this dependency is modelled by a co-variance matrix, common to all patients. Initially, three types of covariance matrices were examined: compound symmetric, AR(1), and unstructured. Using the Akaike and the Schwartz Bayesian criteria, the best of these three covariance structures was chosen.</p><p>Prior to each analysis the six distributions of the outcome measure defined by time and intervention-group were examined to see if the assumption of normality was fulfilled (tests of kurtosis and skewness as well as Shapiro Wilks test (p&#x0003c;0.01) plus inspection of histograms and probability distributions). Prognostic factors measured were: assessment of the attachment between the child and the parents and an assessment of the parent&#x02019;s own ADHD symptoms <xref rid="pone.0037280-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Target1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Of the 165 planned measurements per outcome measure, the percentage missing ranged from 1.3&#x00025; to 7.2&#x00025;. Two out of the 165 sets of questionnaires were missing. The rest of the missing data were due to inadequate answering of the questionnaires and resulted in a few missed indexes on some of the participants.</p><p>For the purpose of this trial the baseline values of the variables CAI group, ASRS score (father), and ASRS score (mother) were re-coded into binary variables (CAI-binary, ASRS (father)-binary, and ASRS (mother)-binary, respectively).

The most common reasons for not wanting to participate were: not having time to participate in the groups; or not wanting the children to receive medication for their problems. 74 children were assessed, 18 children were excluded (17 boys and 1 girl). This left 56 children (39 boys, 17 girls) to be randomized in total. They were all of Danish ethnicity. The 18 children were excluded because of not fulfilling the diagnosis of ADHD, or had autism, psychosis, low IQ, or the child/parents not wanting to participate in the groups.</p><fig id="pone-0037280-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0037280.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CONCERT flowchart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0037280.g001"/></fig><p>

We could not find support for our hypothesis that adding social skills training and parental training to the standard treatment would give a statistical significant difference on the children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms and social and emotional competences compared with the standard treatment alone.</p><p>One of the baseline findings in SOSTRA is especially interesting, as only 7.3&#x00025; of the children had a secure attachment competence, as opposed to 61&#x00025; in a normal population <xref rid="pone.0037280-ShmueliGoetz1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This has also been found in other studies <xref rid="pone.0037280-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Niederhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and supports the contention that there is an association between attachment problems and ADHD. Several studies show that insecure attachment competences in the small child is significantly associated with ADHD symptoms <xref rid="pone.0037280-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037280-Niederhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the study by Clarke et al. they found that the nature of the attachment insecurity in the ADHD children were heightened emotional expressions; showing as strong out of control affects. The authors argue that treatment for ADHD must incorporate relationship-building components. Niederhofer and colleagues suggest that insecure attachment should be included in the list of problems associated with ADHD. Therefore, it may be speculated that these children need a form of treatment that focuses on their inability to form relationships and their social problems. There is a tendency towards more medication for children with ADHD and even if this treatment has a short-term effect, it is not addressed to alleviate social skills problems <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storeb1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Social skills training are recommended as a part of a cognitive/behavioural treatment intervention regimen in both the European and the Nice Guidelines <xref rid="pone.0037280-Atkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0037280-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This recommendation must be discussed as there at the moment is no evidence for this treatment. However, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence of effect! There is a need for more research on this topic, and it seems like that there is necessary to develop another more profound type of social skills training. There is a need for another type of social skills training, which can help the children to deal with their attachment problems as well. This may mean a longer treatment programme, and a treatment that can change more profound aspects of the child&#x02019;s personality. This treatment needs to focus on the cognitive aspect and also the affective.</p><p>In the SOSTRA trial we discovered a large effect over time for both the groups together, e.g., the children&#x02019;s social problems scores, aggressiveness, and hyperactivity scores showed highly significant changes towards fewer symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037280-t003">Table 3</xref>). We cannot state anything about the reason for this, apart from the fact that this development reflects the intervention effects of standard treatment as well as regressions towards the mean. Our SOSTRA trial has several limitations. Most important is the small number of participants. Based on our sample size calculation and our decision on a clinical relevance, we did not find any significant effects of social skills training. If more patients had been included we might have been able to discover smaller significant effects. We used a beta of 80&#x00025;, which gives a 20&#x00025; chance for a type 2 error. We cannot exclude that such an error may have occurred. Another limitation is the use of teacher-rated measurement scales. The teachers might not be able to track potential small changes in the children&#x02019;s symptoms in classes with 25 other children. Furthermore, the therapists who were responsible for the children during the experimental intervention were also (but not on the same day) responsible for the parent group in the control arm. It is possible that these therapists have transferred elements from the experimental treatment to the parent group receiving the control intervention consisting of standard treatment. Finally, some of the children moved to another school during the trial, so different teachers completed the outcome forms, resulting in random errors.</p><p>The strength of the SOSTRA trial is that we published the design protocol before we embarked on the trial <xref rid="pone.0037280-Storebo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We performed our sample size calculation based on the primary outcome measure, conducted a computer generated randomization procedure, and conducted a proper allocation concealment to reduce selection bias. Finally, to strengthen reliability, we videotaped our manual based interventions. Furthermore, we conducted blind outcome assessments, data management, and intention-to-treat analyses, and reported on all outcomes as stipulated in our protocol. Hereby we tried to minimize bias <xref rid="pone.0037280-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0037280-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. We also included a parent group that was designed to support the children&#x02019;s group, giving the parents information about the topic that their children were working with, and also assuring the parents that the children could manage their homework in social skills training. Another strength of the SOSTRA trial was the measurement of attachment styles in children with ADHD.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In accordance with our Cochrane systematic review on social skills training for children with ADHD, we found no significant benefit or harm in any of the outcome measures of the SOSTRA trial. This suggests that on the basis of our sample size calculation and our consideration of a necessary relevant effect size, currently, there is no evidence to recommend or reject social-skills training with or without parental training for ADHD children. This result and the fact that 93&#x00025; of the children who were assessed by the Child Attachment Interview at baseline had a insecure attachment disorder, leads us to believe that there may be a need for more profound, longer lasting types of interventions that might result in a change in children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms, to improve their social and relational competence, and thereby avoid serious further development of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0037280.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
