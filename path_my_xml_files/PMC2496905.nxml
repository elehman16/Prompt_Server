This means many people are treated as having type 2 diabetes at diagnosis as they are adults who are not immediately insulin dependent. LADA can be distinguished from type 2 diabetes by antibody tests. Patients who are antibody positive have an autoimmune reaction which is similar to that of type 1 diabetes and is not found in type 2 diabetes. We would like to examine the best way of treating LADA in the early phase of the conditions, with tablets (similar to type 2 diabetes) or with insulin (similar to type 1 diabetes).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is an open parallel group prospective randomised trial. Participants need to have a GAD antibody test results of 101 WHO units or more and a diagnosis of diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis. Participants will need to have been diagnosed within 12 months and not treated with insulin at study entry. They will be randomised to receive either insulin (NovoMix 30) or tablets (diet treated followed by metformin followed by glitazone (with or without metformin) followed by insulin). Primary outcome assessment will be for change in HbA1c and change in fasting C-peptide over 24 months. Secondary outcome measures will include Quality of life, GAD antibody levels, adverse events, inflammatory markers, insulin resistance, and markers of the metabolic syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study seeks the best treatment for early LADA in terms of maintaining glycaemic control and maintaining natural insulin production.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN63815121</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Type 1 diabetes</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease. There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. Although type 1 diabetes often develops in young people, it can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune process resulting in a selective destruction of the pancreatic insulin-secreting &#x003b2;-cells. The destruction of &#x003b2;-cells leads to hyperglycaemia due to a lack of insulin. The immune changes are reflected by the presence of islet cell antibodies (ICA) and antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Type 2 diabetes</title><p>Type 2 diabetes most often develops in adults and is characterized by insulin resistance and subsequent insulin deficiency. Approximately 10% of patients with type 2 diabetes have antibodies to GAD and/or ICA and progress to insulin dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The term LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) has been introduced to define adult diabetes patients who are initially non-insulin-requiring but with immune markers of type 1 diabetes, who progress to insulin dependency.</p><sec><title>LADA</title><p>Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults is a type 1 diabetes which shows slow progression to insulin dependence instead of acute onset as is seen in 'classical' type 1 diabetes. It is an autoimmune condition unlike type 2 diabetes and therefore can be distinguished from type 2 by blood tests for antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Early studies in Japan (n = 58) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have suggested that LADA patients should start insulin within 1 year of diagnosis in order to maintain near normoglycemic control. It is also suggested that this treatment can prevent slowly progressive beta-cell failure. Patients taking insulin had an improved C-peptide response (i.e. improved Beta cell function and natural insulin production), stable HbA1<sub>c </sub>values and reduced auto-antibody level.</p><p>However, oral agents such as glitazones have anti-inflammatory activity and could potentially also be an effective treatment for patients in the non-insulin dependent stage of their diabetes. Rosiglitazone given in combination with insulin was found to maintain C-peptide levels better than insulin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Laboratory studies support an anti-inflammatory role for glitazones which could be beneficial for people with LADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Sulphonylurea treatment may be harmful to people with LADA as they may deplete the already low reserves of insulin. In some studies, LADA patients given sulphonylurea (with or without insulin) have persistent antibodies and poor fasting glucose concentrations compared to people on insulin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p><p>The team at the School of Medicine in Swansea University [SB, HD and RW] have undertaken a Cochrane systematic review to examine interventions for LADA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] which found that sulphonylurea should not be used in LADA but there is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of LADA. To date there are no other systematic reviews.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To compare the effectiveness of treatment regimes for type 1 diabetes compared to regimes for type 2 diabetes in LADA.</p><sec><title>Primary objectives</title><p>To examine the effect of standard treatment for type 1 (insulin [NovoMix 30] therapy) compared with standard treatment for type 2 diabetes (tablets), on (1) change in fasting serum C-peptide level over 24 months and (2) change in HbA1c level over 24 months in patients with LADA.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To assess the effect of standard type 1 treatment (insulin) on average number of times the fasting plasma glucose level is above 8 mmol/l (141 mg/dl), quality of life [ADDQol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]], proportion of patients with insulin dependence (as judged by C peptide level below 0.38 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]), GAD antibody level, HOMA, hypoglycaemic events (particularly hypoglycaemic events), weight/blood pressure/total cholesterol and inflammatory markers in LADA patients compared to standard type 2 diabetes treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This trial is a multi-centre open parallel group prospective randomised trial. Participants are recruited from their primary health care practitioner following a routine test for GAD antibodies. They are seen in secondary care at 3 centres in Wales (Swansea, Carmarthenshire and Cardiff). The protocol has been approved by the Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee for Wales. Each recruited subject has to sign a consent form and give their consent to randomisation.</p><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Insulin arm: Patients will be given advice on diet and exercise and life style and will be started on NovoMix 30, one dose of 6 U at the evening/main meal. Dose will be adjusted in increments of 2&#x02013;6 U depending on fasting glucose level [See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>]. When total dose equals 16 U patient will be started on 4 units with breakfast and continue with 16 units with evening meal. Breakfast and/or evening meal dose will be adjusted where necessary at increments of 2&#x02013;6 U depending on fasting and/or pre-evening meal glucose level. [See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> below]. Patient needs to keep a daily diary of insulin doses taken.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Insulin treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6823-8-8-1"/></fig><p>All patients will see a dietician before insulin treatment is initiated. Patients will be contacted weekly by phone in the first month, fortnightly in the second month and once a month thereafter. Patients will monitor their blood glucose twice a day for 3 days of the week.</p></sec><sec><title>Tablet arm:</title><sec><title>[Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>] Step 1</title><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Standard treatment arm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6823-8-8-2"/></fig><p>Patient's not treated with tablets will be given a 3 months trial of lifestyle modification including advice on diet, exercise and smoking. If HbA1<sub>c </sub>remains at 7% or above the patient will progress to step 2. Patients will be progressed to step 2 if their GP has already put them on metformin (put in at number of metformin tables that GP has recommended) or sulphonylurea or if their baseline HbA1<sub>c </sub>is above 8% (patients will start on one 500 mg tablet per day). This means that sulphonylurea will be discontinued in all patients. Patients on step 1 will be progressed to step 2 before the 3 month period if they have already had a 3 month period of diet before starting the study AND during phone contact they report to be symptomatic (thirst, fatigue, polyuria) and unwell. In these cases, patients may be invited to attend clinic before the 3 month period to be given metformin.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 2</title><p>Life style modification and Metformin. If the patient has a HbA1<sub>c </sub>of 7%&#x02013;7.5% they start on 500 mg &#x000d7; 1 per day for the next 3 months. If the HbA1<sub>c </sub>is 7.6%&#x02013;8.0% they would start the first week on 500 mg &#x000d7; 1 day and then for the remaining period of the three months will take 500 mg &#x000d7; 2 day. If the HbA1<sub>c </sub>is above 8.0% then patient will be on 500 mg &#x000d7; 3 per day. This will be titrated at the rate of 500 mg &#x000d7; 1 for the first week, 500 mg &#x000d7; 2 for the second week and 500 mg &#x000d7; 3 for the remaining time of the 3 month period. If unable to tolerate metformin then the participant will be given Glucophage SR and if unable to tollerate this they will then progress to Step 3. If HbA1<sub>c </sub>remains at 7% or above then those on 1 tablet per day will be moved to 2 tablets per day, those on 2 tablets per day will be moved to 3 tablets per day, those on 3 tablets per day will be move to maximum dose of 2 gms per day. If after 3 months the HbA1<sub>c </sub>is above 7% even with maximum dose, then progress to Step 3. If during telephone contact the patient report symptoms then they may be titrated up. In summary, patients will be have their HbA1c evaluated every 3 months and will be titriated accordingly.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 3</title><p>Life style modification and Glitazone [Rosiglitazone]. Patients with a HbA1<sub>c </sub>of 7% or above will be given 4 mg once per day for 3 months. If after a 3 month period the HbA1<sub>c </sub>remains at 7% or above then titrate to maximal dose of 4 mg twice per day with or without Metformin. If HbA1<sub>c</sub>remains at 7% or above for an additional 3 months then move to step 4. Therefore, glitazone monotherapy will be used if Metformin intolerant otherwise glitazone will be added to the metformin (as per standard practice). Before initiation of Rosiglitazone a repeat medical history will be taken with special emphasis on cardiovascular disease, if patients have a history of cardiovascular disease (defined as IHD, PVD) they will not be initiated on Rosiglitazone but will move directly to Step 4 (insulin). Patients on rosiglitazone will be monitored using the adverse events form, for symptoms of heart disease specifically for chest pain and shortness of breath. Any adverse events suggestive of heart disease will result in Rosiglitazone being discontinued and the patient moving to step 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 4</title><p>Life style modification and insulin therapy (oral agents will be stopped). Titration will be based on fasting blood glucose level (as given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The initiation of insulin will the same as for the insulin arm and will follow the protocol detailed above.</p><p>All tablet treated patients will be asked to keep a diary of daily medication and record blood glucose levels weekly.</p><p>All changes in medication will be notified to the patients GP.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Study population and inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Subject are recruited from their primary care practitioner if they have a diagnosis of diabetes with a GAD antibody result of 101 WHO units or more.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1.

A linear regression model will be used to examine the effect of baseline GAD level, age, sex and baseline fasting C-peptide or HbA1c level as covariate and a treatment term on the change in HbA1c and C-peptide levels. In addition, repeated measures analysis (area under the curve, maximum minus minimum, time taken to maximum, time taken to minimum and slope) for C-peptide and HbA1c will be performed. ANOVA for repeated measurements with be used when variables are normally distributed.

To find a difference of 0.7% in average HbA1c (standard deviation = 1.5%) we would need 97 analysible people in the insulin and the standard care arms of the study (power 90%, significance = 5%). This would detect an average difference of 0.2 nmol/l in fasting C-peptide. As the power calculation is based on patients in China, we will re-calculate the sample size based on the standard deviation of the first 30 patients recruited in our study. We will examine the standard deviation of the HbA1c and the fasting C-peptide in all 30 patients at 3 months (regardless of treatment) in order to re-estimate the sample size assuming a difference of 0.7% in HbA1c and 0.2 nmol/l in fasting C-peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation procedure</title><p>WYC will provide SB with a randomisation sequence from a computer randomisation programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

We provide newsletters, an internet site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.locallada.swan.ac.uk"/> and a helpline for people diagnosed with LADA. This is the first study in Europe examining the best first line treatment at the primary care level for the early management of people with LADA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>LADA: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults; GAD: Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase; ICA: islet cell antibodies; HOMA: Homeostasis Model Assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This work is funded by Novo Nordisk Ltd, a commercial company that make insulin. They are supplying the insulin for this trial. The protocol went through the Novo Nordisk Scientific Committee before funding was approved. However, Novo Nordisk will not have any contact with patients, will not have access to results, or be involved interpreting, writing up or publication of the final results. This is an investigator lead trial and the running of the trial is independent of the funding organisation (Novo Nordisk Ltd).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to the design of the protocol giving advice for their own research expertise. StB and JWS have advised on treatment regimes, JL and DP advised on the protocol from the perspective of the patient, WYC and IR designed the analysis and statistical sections, KR, KW and MW advised on the implementation and running of the trial in the local area and SB, HD, CB and RW wrote the early drafts of the protocol in which other authors amended.
