In a cross-over design, the subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of BDP and placebo. Treatment periods were 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout period. The subjects had endoscopic biopsies and blood tests at baseline and after each treatment period. They were instructed to maintain a diary of symptoms. Immuno-histochemical studies were performed for interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed for IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17F, IL-25, IL-33, chemokine ligands (CCL)2, CCL5, CCL11, GM-CSF, and TGF-beta levels.

We do need to acknowledge here that two subjects included in the study had &#x0003c;15 eosinophils/hpf at the time of enrollment. Both of them had a biopsy-proven diagnosis of EoE before starting topical fluticasone therapy. Although the esophageal eosinophilia improved (and continued to be low during the washout period), these patients were still clinically symptomatic, hence, they were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were the following: (a) subjects with suspected or proven inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, or collagen-vascular disease; (b) subjects who had used oral, inhaled, or swallowed corticosteroids in the past 3 months; (c) subjects who were pregnant or breast-feeding; (d) subjects who were not able to swallow BDP or who were intolerant to the medication; and (e) subjects with a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, unless they had been stable in the past 6 months.</p><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study. Thirteen subjects who met the criteria as outlined above were enrolled to participate in the study. Four withdrew consent. Nine patients eventually completed the protocol. The subjects had baseline endoscopies with biopsies as well as baseline blood tests. They were randomized into two groups to receive either swallowed BDP (inhalation aerosol 80-&#x003bc;g, 2 puffs inhalation twice a day) or placebo for 8 weeks based on randomization list provided by a statistician. The subjects were instructed to avoid eating and drinking and to stay in an upright position for 30 minutes after the dose. After a 4-week washout period, the subjects were crossed over to the opposite group for 8 weeks each.</p><p>During the screening period of 12 weeks before the treatment periods, the enrolled patients were asked to discontinue all previous topical corticosteroids for EoE and to discontinue dietary restrictions, if any. A physician not involved with the study other than setting up the randomization scheme and medication packets held the randomization key, and did not play any other role in the study to prevent unblinding. The subjects maintained a daily diary that documented drug compliance; symptoms such as dysphagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, food impaction; and other medications taken. The subjects were evaluated at 4 weeks during treatment periods for review of symptoms and at the end of treatment (EOT) periods by using peripheral blood testing and endoscopic esophageal biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="arh0021702020001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.

A minimum of two biopsy specimens each were obtained from the proximal, middle, and distal esophagus, and were sent for pathologic evaluation per standard protocols. The biopsy specimens were processed routinely and evaluated by using light microscopy (&#x000d7;400) by a pathologist (F.R.).</p></sec><sec><title>Immune-Histochemical Staining for MCT and Various Cytokines</title><p>The tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, after which 4&#x02013;5&#x003bc; thick sections were cut and mounted onto Plus slides (Fisherbrand, Pittsburg, PA). These sections were baked for 60 minutes at 60&#x000b0;C, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and submitted to antigen retrieval by using 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 for 20 minutes in a steamer, followed by 20 minutes of cooling to room temperature. All staining steps were performed on the Dako Autostainer Plus Agilent Technologies, US Headquarters Santa Clara, CA. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, and the slides were washed with Dako's Wash Buffer. Primary antibodies for MCT (AA1, M7052; Dako North America, Carpenteria, CA) and IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, GM-CSF, and TGF-&#x003b2; (C-19, sc-1292; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), in 1:200 dilution were applied for 60 minutes. By using Dako's Envision + Polymer secondary antibody (30 minutes at room temperature), the Dako DAB+ chromogen (Agilent Technologies) was applied to visualize the staining pattern. The slides were counterstained with Dako's Mayer's hematoxylin (Agilent Technologies), and the coverslip was mounted with Permount (Fisherbrand, Pittsburg, PA). The staining was interpreted as none, 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) or 3+ (strong), and the numbers of cells were interpreted as low, moderate, and high.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Tissue Cytokine Expression: Isolation of RNA from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue and Real-Time PCR</title><p>A 3-mm punch biopsy was used to remove a core of tissue from a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block, which was then dissolved in xylene. RNA was recovered by using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) per the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was reverse transcribed by using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies).

Five patients had complete resolution of esophageal eosinophilia, and, in one patient, the number of eosinophils decreased from 120 to 8 eosinophils/hpf on BDP. Of these, four had been randomized to drug first and then had been crossed-over to placebo. For three of these patients who were &#x0201c;drug-first,&#x0201d; the tissue eosinophil count bounced back up significantly when they were crossed-over to placebo.</p><p>Of the nine patients who completed the study, five were randomized to placebo first. Of these, three patients had significant resolution of tissue eosinophilia, which was maintained when crossed over to BDP. These three patients may have had PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, which is clinically, endoscopically, and histologically indistinguishable from EoE.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> One subject had been on swallowed fluticasone before and may have continued to experience the lingering effects of the fluticasone. For others, a variability in eosinophil counts over time, as seen in asthma, could explain this observation.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Two subjects continued to have significant tissue eosinophilia as well as clinical symptoms. We need to address the observation that subjects 3 and 4 had &#x0003c;15 eosinophils/hpf at the beginning of the study.</p><p>All the subjects enrolled in the study had an established diagnosis of EoE based on biopsy findings of Esophagogastroduodenoscopy undertaken after at least 8 weeks of PPI trial (&#x0003e;15 eosinophils/hpf). The biopsy results noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> represent a subsequent Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed before initiation of the study. These two subjects had previously been treated with swallowed topical fluticasone, which was discontinued in the 3-month washout period before enrollment in the study. It is possible that the effects of previous topical steroid therapy still lingered. These subjects continued to be symptomatic despite improvement in esophageal eosinophilia and, therefore, were included in the study. Alternatively, it is possible that there could be baseline variability in the number of eosinophils infiltrating the esophagus over time, similar to observations in asthma in which subjects may have intermittent airway eosinophilia.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>There was a modest decrease in the peripheral blood eosinophilia with the BDP treatment, but it did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.050). Other studies did not show this parameter as a reliable test to monitor the response to treatment. Peripheral eosinophilia (&#x0003e;300&#x02013;350 eosinophils/mm<sup>3</sup>) has been documented in 40&#x02013;50% of patients with EoE in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Straumann <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> in 2008, showed a statistically significant decrease in peripheral blood eosinophil count with budesonide therapy, however, the shifts in esophageal and peripheral blood eosinophilia were not entirely concordant. We did not find any correlation between peripheral blood high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and esophageal eosinophilia.</p><p>Numerous studies have established the key role of Th2 pathway cytokines in the development of EoE, with IL-13 being a key cytokine involved in eosinophilic trafficking to inflammatory sites.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We found a significant decrease in tissue IL-13 immunohistochemical staining from baseline to EOT within the BDP group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005) but not within the placebo group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.7). The decrease in IL-13 expression with the BDP treatment may be considered as an objective measurement of response to treatment. Mast cells produce an abundance of cytokines that activate eosinophils and molecules that directly promote tissue remodeling.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Two unique mast cell-related transcriptomes have been recognized.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> We found a significant decrease in the tissue MCT staining in esophageal tissues from baseline to EOT in the BDP group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas the change within the placebo group was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.893).</p><p>We further looked at the messenger RNA expression of various other inflammatory markers. For this part of the study, we were able to compare only between the baseline and the treatment groups because there was insufficient tissue from the placebo group. CCL2 and CCL5 are chemokines involved in leukocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites. Their role in EoE has not been investigated. TSLP is a cytokine produced by epithelial cells and targets dendritic cells to secrete Th2-inducing cytokines and chemokines.<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> IL-25 also is an epithelium-derived cytokine that promotes airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma.<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> IL-17F is an IL-17 family cytokine that has been shown to be associated with chronic inflammatory lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subjects with atopy.<sup><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Little is known about the role of each of these cell products in EoE pathogenesis. In our study, the expression of CCL5 and IL-17F in the treatment group decreased in statistically significant amounts when compared with baseline. There was a modest decrease in CCL2, IL-25, and TSLP expression between treatment and baseline that did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The role of these cytokines as potential end points for therapeutic interventions remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Topical steroids are the mainstay of EoE treatment in children and adults. Swallowed aerosolized fluticasone and oral viscous budesonide are the commonly used forms.<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Several randomized clinical trials examined the use of topical steroids for EoE.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Two systemic reviews with meta-analyses showed an impressive (10- to 13-fold) reduction in mucosal eosinophilia, although the reduction in clinical symptoms ranged from none to threefold only.<sup><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Most patients relapse if topical steroids are stopped after initial treatment. Our study showed that BDP was an effective treatment option for EoE, based on resolution of clinical symptoms as well as esophageal eosinophilia in patients treated with the drug. No significant adverse effects were reported with the study drug.</p><p>Measurement of morning cortisol levels would have been helpful to assess the effect, if any, of swallowed BDP on adrenal function. Dohil <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> found no difference between pre- and posttreatment morning cortisol levels in children with EoE treated with oral budesonide. A recent study reported adrenal insufficiency in 10% of children treated with swallowed glucocorticoids for &#x02265;6 months and was found only in those treated with fluticasone propionate of &#x0003e;440 &#x003bc;g/day.<sup><xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The changes in tissue mast cell numbers and IL-13 expression also supported our conclusion about its effectiveness as a potential alternative to fluticasone propionate and budesonide for treatment of EoE. Although the 8-week treatment period may not be sufficient, the cross-over design of the study added to the power of the study and made this conclusion reasonable. The major limitation of our study was the small sample size. Larger prospective studies that investigate the effect of the drug for a longer duration of time are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare pertaining to this article</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was made possible by the &#x0201c;Young Faculty Support Award&#x0201d; of American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (provided to G.
