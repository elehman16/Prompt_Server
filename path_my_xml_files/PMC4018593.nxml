Therefore, while the problems of undernutrition (e.g., growth retardation and micronutrient deficiencies) still exist, the burden of overweight/obesity and diet-related chronic diseases is increasing. The prevalence of overweight (body mass index &#x02265;85<sup>th</sup> reference percentiles) among urban 15-39- and 40-69-year-old is estimated at about 22 and 40%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Some of major causes of obesity include a low resting metabolic rate, environmental factors, family behavior patterns, and poorly developed satiety response;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] while for obese individuals, successful weight loss and maintenance are often difficult.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Increased daily energy expenditure is composed of three major components: (1) Resting metabolic rate (RMR), (2) the thermic effect of feeding (TEF), and (3) the thermic effect of activity (TEA).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] RMR constitutes 60-75% of daily energy expenditure and is the energy associated with the maintenance of major body functions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In fact the changes in body weight are the function of energy balance; meaning that weight gain will happen if energy expenditure is less than intake, and it will be lost if energy expenditure would be more than intake.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The results of weight loss treatments not only help obese subjects to have fit body, but also they can decrease obesity related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Dietary interventions, especially low calorie diets, have been considered as the first line treatment for obesity and overweight, which lead to decrease energy metabolism through lowering resting metabolic rate, reduction of thermic effect of food and decreasing the energy cost.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, there are some important limitations for calorie restriction diets. The important restrictions among them include the modest weight loss (often less than 5-10 kg after 52 weeks), their difficulty for obese patients to follow because of limited food intake.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA, have shown that when people significantly reduce their calorie intake, they undergo a metabolic adaptation that results in a slower metabolic rate. The slower metabolic rate results in a behavioral adaptation in which individuals become less physically active.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In present study, we want to know how calorie intake in irregular amounts (different phases of high and low calorie intake) can affect the RMR, body weight, and adaptation of subjects compared to constant calorie restriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was done in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committee of Shahid Beheshty University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

One hundred and six female subjects were screened for the study; 32 were excluded at the first step because of being outside of inclusion criteria, 74 patients were randomly allocated to each arm of study using a random numbers table, so that the half of the patients of each clinic was assigned and alternate diet [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Obese and overweight (BMI &#x02265; 25), nonsmoking adult (age 26-50 years) subjects were entered to the study and required instructions were provided by a registered dietitian. The factors that considered as exclusion criteria were included; pregnancy, lactating or postmenopausal women, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, psychological disorders, substance abuse, or regularly used medications except contraceptives. Subjects who had participated in an exercise class or took weight loss program, lipid or glucose lowering medications for 3 months before study, and whose activity for 3 months prior to the study was more than lightly (i.e., &#x0003e;3 h/week of light intensity exercise at 2.5-4.0 metabolic equivalents were also excluded.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-5-447-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Interventions</title><p>Selected subjects were randomly entered to one of the groups (CR or CSD) and reached determined diet (each group encompassed 37 subjects). Subjects were asked by food frequency questionnaire for 1 month and recall questionnaire for last 5 days to give information about their diet patterns and routine daily calorie intake during last month. The basal calorie intake for every subject was calculated as the mean of calorie intakes per day during last month and used as a start point to calculate their required calorie in accordance to the present study. The required calorie per day was calculated by subtracting 45% of baseline intake for CSD group and 55% of baseline value for CR subjects [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In all cases, if the value of calculated calorie was less than 1,100; it rounded as 1,100; then all subjects received at least 1,100 calorie per day during study. All subjects were instructed to consume their meals (containing determined calorie) in accordance to their group of study: CR subjects were trained to review determined amount of calorie per day and determined percent of carbohydrate, protein, or fats. CSD subjects were instructed to eat only at four set of meals per day and avoid any other intake at 4 h intervals between these meals. The time for each of these meals was optional and they let free to consume in any hour, but the time interval between meals should not been less than 4 h (e.g., 8-12-4-8). This diet was ordered for 11 consecutive days after which 3 days of self-selecting calorie and diet was started. The 11-3 days phases were repeated for three times (for 42 days) and finally 1 month follow-up period was started.

The main theory of CSD is to change intake from high to low calories (e.g., to 11 days) to decrease weight, and then change it from low to high calories (e.g., to 3 consecutive days) to keep the RMR at higher levels. In spite of different shifts in RMR through the study in CSD group, it remained approximately unchanged without significant difference between different time points of study, however in CR group a continuous and significant decrease in RMR was observed. The effect of CSD on RMR was reflected in sustained weight and fat loss and BMI reduction over the follow-up period, something which was not seen in CR treated subjects. Four weeks of CSD caused weight loss in obese subjects by limiting the energy intake to 1,365 calorie per day. CSD helped them approach a significant energy restriction (44.5%) and weight loss (5.4 kg in 6 weeks) with increased satisfaction rate in subjects during study [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>].</p><p>The routine calorie restriction regimens always induce a quick weight loss at beginning and reach the maximum effect after 6 months, from which moreover weight loss or establishing the current weight is difficult[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and approximately, 30-35% of lost weight is regained during the 1<sup>st</sup> year after treatment.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Calorie restriction diet in present study was successful in weight and fat decrease after 6 weeks of treatment; however, the weight regained after 4 weeks of follow-up period (&#x02212;2.18 kg compared to week 6 of CR). Weight maintenance after weight loss is always a difficult stage for obese subjects and clinicians to cope with and requires new strategies.</p><p>Alternate day modified fasting diet was one of these ways, in which all subjects had to consume 25% of their baseline energy needs on the fast day (24 h), and then they were let to eat freely on the next day.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Weight loss (5.6 kg) was resulted from 4 weeks of alternate day modified fasting; and adherence to the alternate day fasting protocol was similar between the controlled food intake phase and the self-selected food intake phase. CSD is similar to the alternate day modified fasting diet in applying the courses of high and low calorie intake, but the advantage of CSD to alternate day modified fasting is that subjects were not required to endure intervals of fasting days.</p><p>Calorie restriction diets decreased energy intake (44.5% in CSD subjects and 51.2% in CR group) which tended to decrease RMR at both groups. However, the 3 days interval of higher calorie intake in CSD group reversed the effect of energy restriction on RMR reduction (weeks 4 and 6) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. While the trend of reduction in RMR of CR treated subjects increased to week 6 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The effect of energy restriction on RMR reduction has been demonstrated in previous studies, which showed that slight or moderate energy restriction for 4 days could decrease basal metabolic rate.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] From week 6 of study (beginning of follow-up), RMR tended to increase, but the higher RMR of CSD compared to CR group existed through the follow-up period in which there was no significant difference in energy intake of two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Weight regain during 4 weeks of follow-up period for CSD subjects (+0.87 kg) was significantly less than CR group (+2.18 kg), which suggested the key role of RMR in maintenance of weight during follow-up period.</p><p>Total cholesterol concentrations decreased by 17.39% after 6 weeks of CSD diet and 16.86% after follow-up period with self-selected diet. Triacylglycerol concentration was also decreased by 32.44% after 42 days of CSD regimen and 20.22% at the end of follow-up period [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. These modulations in total-cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations have been shown previously in a study by Johnson <italic>et al</italic>., in which they studied the effects of alternate day calorie restriction on clinical findings in overweight adults.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Weight loss due to CSD regimen after 6 weeks were correlated to decreased levels of serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol which suggested that the degree of weight loss achieved by this CSD regimen may have contributed to the extent to which these plasma lipids were altered.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Although the mean level of HDL-cholesterol concentrations increased after 6 weeks of CSD regimen, however the difference was not significant. This result is in accordance with the findings from the calorie restriction trials which had no effect on HDL cholesterol concentrations after short durations of treatment.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The subjects of two groups showed similar responses to VAS questions by decreased hunger and increased satisfaction during study [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. Although the feeling of hunger increased at first 2 weeks of treatment with CSD regimen like the CR group, but it tended to decrease through the study and showed that subjects could habituate within short time of treatment. Concomitant decrease of hunger and increase of satisfaction with diet within the short period of study (6 weeks) suggested that treatment was well-tolerated and obese subjects could effectively follow such diet for longer periods.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The percent of subjects who discontinued the study was high in CR group (36.8%) compared to CSD group (15.7%) that confirmed the tolerability of treatment and adherence of subjects to shifting diet. It might be resulted from the slight reduction in calorie intake of CSD subjects (1,365 kcal/day) instead of low calorie intake in CR subjects (1186 kcal/day). However, the results obtained from each of treatments might also be another factor to continue or reject it. The certain results about the adherence of subjects to each treatment may require another study with large number of patients and monitoring for long time period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>All features of CSD on decreasing weight and FM during treatment were similar to the effects of CR, except RMR which remained unchanged during study in CSD subjects. The effect of CSD on weight loss was more persistent than CR diet, while both group had a 1 month follow-up period with approximately same amounts of calorie intake. Further analysis suggested the involvement of reduced RMR in weight regain of CR subjects during follow-up period, which remained in levels near to the baseline for CSD subjects. Finally, increased satisfaction and low percent of subjects who rejected the study, demonstrated CSD's clinical potentials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source
