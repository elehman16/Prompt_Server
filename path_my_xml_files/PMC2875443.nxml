The first randomized head-to-head comparison of two GLP-1 receptor agonists added to oral antidiabetes agents (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes [LEAD]-6) showed that 1.8 mg once-daily liraglutide provided greater improvements in A1C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with lower hypoglycemia and less persistent nausea than 10 &#x003bc;g twice-daily exenatide after 26 weeks; similar decreases in weight (&#x0223c;3 kg) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (2.0&#x02013;2.5 mmHg) occurred with both drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

Adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (A1C 7&#x02013;11%) with maximally tolerated stable doses of metformin, sulfonylurea, or both for &#x02265;3 months were randomized (1:1) to 1.8 mg liraglutide once daily or 10 &#x003bc;g exenatide twice daily. After 26 weeks, patients continued into a nonrandomized 14-week extension: all exenatide patients were switched to 0.6 mg liraglutide once daily for 1 week, then escalated to 1.2 mg for another week, and then given a final maintenance dose of 1.8 mg. Patients originally randomized to 1.8 mg liraglutide continued. Background oral antidiabetes drugs remained unchanged, although sulfonylurea doses could be decreased by 50% if unacceptable hypoglycemia occurred.</p><p>Visits occurred at weeks &#x02212;2 (screening), 0 (randomization), 4, 8, 12, 20, 26, 34, and 40 for both groups. Efficacy and safety assessments during the extension phase (weeks 26&#x02013;40) were identical to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Extension intention-to-treat (ITT) (all randomized patients exposed to trial product who entered the extension) and extension safety (all patients exposed to trial product who entered the extension) populations were used for efficacy and safety analyses, respectively. Changes from baseline (last available observation up to 26 weeks) to week 40 within each treatment group were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic> tests. Treatment groups were not compared.

Five patients continuing liraglutide had eight severe adverse events (cerebral infarction, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery occlusion, portal vein thrombosis, rectal cancer, and depression). Two deaths occurred (exenatide<inline-graphic xlink:href="zdc0061083010002.jpg"/>liraglutide: myocardial infarction after 198 days of treatment; liraglutide: cerebral infarction [patient completed the study but died shortly after]).

Conversion to liraglutide from exenatide was well tolerated and further improved glycemic control. Additional reductions in body weight and SBP occurred in both groups. Over 40 weeks, liraglutide reduced A1C by 1.3%.</p><p>The magnitude of these changes and differences between liraglutide and exenatide are consistent with results reported in phase 3 LEAD (liraglutide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and exenatide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) trials. The greater efficacy of liraglutide may be due to sustained levels achieved over 24 h by once-daily dosing compared with biphasic levels achieved during the 2.4-h half-life of exenatide after dosing within 1 h of breakfast and dinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Further studies are required to investigate the durability of these responses. Given the likely preference for once-daily meal-independent dosing, liraglutide appears to be a useful addition to the diabetes treatment armamentarium.</p></sec>
