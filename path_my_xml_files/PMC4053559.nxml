Increasing evidence suggests that the presence of inflammation is a key factor in the development and progression of insulin resistance, as well as other cardiovascular disease co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker commonly used as an index of systemic inflammation and has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Excess adiposity, particularly visceral adipose tissue (VAT), is central to increased levels of circulating CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while CRP is known to accelerate age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], highlighting CRP&#x02019;s dual association with body composition. PRT is a unique mode of exercise that can reduce adiposity whilst concomitantly increasing SMM, thus potentially addressing the two body composition parameters associated with increased CRP. The aim of this investigation was therefore to determine the effect of 12&#x000a0;months of high intensity PRT on circulating CRP in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and whether improvements in body composition (increases in SMM and reductions in adiposity) were related to reductions in CRP. Our hypotheses were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>CRP would be significantly associated with indices of adiposity and SMM at baseline.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PRT would significantly reduce CRP compared to the sham-exercise control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reductions in CRP would be associated with favorable changes in body composition variables, namely increased SMM and mid-thigh muscle area, and decreased FM and VAT.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The GREAT2DO study is an ongoing clinical trial investigating the efficacy of 6&#x000a0;years of PRT on insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis in older adults with type 2 diabetes. The first year was a randomized, double-blind, sham-exercise controlled trial. After the initial year, participants were asked to continue training, with participants in the sham-exercise control group crossed over to high intensity PRT. The data presented in this report are from the RCT phase. Between July 2006 and November 2009, 103 participants were randomized to receive 12&#x000a0;months of high intensity, high velocity, PRT, or sham-exercise (low intensity, non-progressive exercise), in addition to usual care. Inclusion criteria were &#x02265;60&#x000a0;years, sedentary (no progressive resistance training; structured exercise &#x02264;1/week; less than 150&#x000a0;min/week low or moderate intensity walking or other unstructured exercise) and type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Participants could be treated with diet alone, oral medications, insulin, or combination at the time of enrolment, without recent changes in medication (&#x0003c;3&#x000a0;months). Randomization was performed using a investigator not involved in the study and was stratified by sex and insulin usage in blocks of 4. Exclusion criteria for the study were the presence of unstable chronic diseases or any contraindications to PRT, or being unwilling to commit to a 12-month exercise training program, 3 times per week. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the Sydney South West Area Health Service and the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committees (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry number 12606000436572).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Training Protocol</title><p>The PRT group trained 3&#x000a0;days per week under supervision using pneumatic resistance equipment (Keiser Sports Health Ltd., Fresno, CA), at two sites. A version of PRT known as power training was employed, in which the concentric contraction (lifting) was completed as quickly as possible, whilst the eccentric contraction (lowering) was completed over 4&#x000a0;s. The exercises targeted large symmetrical muscle groups of the arms, legs, and trunk: seated row, chest press, leg press, knee extension, hip flexion, hip extension, and hip abduction. For each exercise, participants performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions (2 sets of 8 on each leg for hip flexion, hip extension, and hip abduction). The intensity was set at 80&#x000a0;% of the most recently determined 1 repetition maximum (1RM), which was re-assessed every 4&#x000a0;weeks. When 1RM testing was not feasible, resistances were increased by targeting a Borg scale rating of perceived exertion between 15 and 18.</p><p>The sham-exercise group trained on the same equipment, 3 times a week, under supervision from the same trainers at different times of the day so as to remain blinded to the investigators&#x02019; hypotheses, with both interventions offered as potentially beneficial. The resistance was set as low as possible and not progressed, and participants were instructed to perform concentric and eccentric contractions slowly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>Blinded outcome assessments were conducted at 0 and 12&#x000a0;months at the University of Sydney. Participants were required to withhold food, liquids, and medication for 12&#x000a0;h prior to metabolic testing. A 24-h food recall was performed on the day of the baseline assessment, and participants were asked to follow the same diet prior to subsequent assessments at 12&#x000a0;months. Assessments at 12&#x000a0;months were performed 72&#x000a0;h after each participant&#x02019;s final training session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Demographics and health status</title><p>Participants were asked routine questions to obtain demographic information, as well as their current health status relating to prescribed medications, smoking status (current or past), and the presence of other chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measure of systemic inflammation</title><p>High-sensitivity CRP was measured in duplicate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; eBIOSCIENCE, Camarillo, CA), with the average value used in statistical analyses.

The program calculated this measure by summing the area within the selected perimeter occupied by pixels with optical density in the range of 140 to 240. Thigh muscle density was calculated according to a specific optical density range (10&#x02013;113) chosen to best discriminate muscle from fat and bone.

Linear regressions were performed to determine the relationship between continuous variables at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model with repeated measures was used to determine changes over time as this method allows for all available data to be used without imputation for missing values.

To determine if there was any association between group assignment and changes in measures of body composition on reductions in CRP, sequential linear mixed models were constructed with CRP as the dependent variable and full factorial interaction between group, time and the change in the body composition variable of interest. Any variables found to be associated with CRP using mixed-effects models (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10) were then explored using linear regression models stratified by group allocation.

There is conflicting evidence from previous literature regarding the ability of PRT to reduce systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], including recent trials in individuals with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, for the first time, we have shown that reductions in CRP were mediated, in part, by increases in skeletal muscle following high intensity PRT. Similarly, reductions in FM tended to mediate the reduction in CRP in the PRT group. These results were further confirmed by our linear regression models stratified by group allocation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>), with significant associations only seen in the PRT group and not the sham group. Previously, we showed similar associations between increases in SMM and reductions in FM with insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis within the same cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and so the present study provides further evidence that PRT should be incorporated into treatment strategies for individuals with type 2 diabetes in order to improve their body composition, systemic inflammation, and their metabolic health.</p><p>The data in this study highlight the association between body composition and systemic inflammation in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and suggest that both increases in SMM and reductions in adiposity be targeted with lifestyle interventions within this cohort. This concept is further supported by findings that changes in CRP were not associated with changes in either body weight or BMI. This is in agreement with Balducci et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] who reported that 12&#x000a0;months of either aerobic training, or a combination of aerobic and PRT resulted in reductions in CRP independent of weight loss within individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concomitant increases in SMM and reductions in adiposity may result in minimal changes in body weight; however, given their dual positive effects on reducing CRP, reductions in systemic inflammation may be observed that are not associated with overall weight loss. This is also true for other metabolic outcomes within individuals with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Association between skeletal muscle and CRP</title><p>The direct association between SMM and CRP at baseline within our cohort is in agreement with previous investigations reporting the cross-sectional relationship between systemic inflammation and SMM or lean body mass in other cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The authors in prior studies concluded that lean tissue might in fact contribute to systemic inflammation. However, our analyses show that after adjusting for BMI, SMM is no longer associated with CRP. This is likely due to the direct relationship between SMM and BMI; with over nutrition and excess adiposity resulting in a higher quantity of SMM. Furthermore, our longitudinal data, in agreement with some but not all previous investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] indicate that anabolic exercise such as PRT can reduce systemic inflammation. Furthermore, our linear mixed-effects models and linear regression models indicate that increases in SMM following PRT were associated with reductions in CRP, indicating that increasing lean tissue with anabolic exercise may potentially mediate reductions in systemic inflammation.</p><p>Given that CRP has been shown to predict the loss of SMM in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the observed association between reductions in CRP with increases in SMM is of great significance. Previous data within a similar cohort showed no relationship between changes in lean body mass and changes in CRP following 4&#x000a0;months of PRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To our knowledge, ours is the only other study to investigate the relationship between changes in markers of systemic inflammation, and changes in lean tissue in a cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, our results provide a significant and novel advance in knowledge in this field. A notable difference between our study and that of Brooks et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] is that in the latter, this relationship was explored between changes in CRP and changes in quadriceps muscle type I fiber cross-sectional area only, as opposed to whole body SMM within our investigation. It is possible that changes in whole body SMM are more reflective of changes in systemic inflammation. In agreement with this, increases in regional indices of SMM (CT scan) within our cohort showed no relationship with reductions in CRP. Further studies utilizing more precise whole body composition techniques such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or multi-slice MRI scanning are required to further explore this relationship.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Association between adiposity and CRP</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> illustrates that reductions in CRP following PRT were related to reductions in fat mass. This is important, given the predictive value of CRP in CVD. Until recently, CRP was believed to be produced exclusively by hepatocytes, namely in response to circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, production of CRP within subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, reductions in circulating CRP can be influenced both directly, and indirectly, by reductions in adipose tissue. The finding that CRP is produced by both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue supports our finding that reductions in FM (inclusive of both depots) predicted reductions in CRP, rather than VAT in isolation. In addition to adipose tissue, macrophages and smooth muscle cells from atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and inflamed renal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] have been shown to contribute to circulating levels of CRP. Adipose tissue is a major contributor to circulating cytokines, which could initiate or mediate local inflammatory responses (including CRP production) within these tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, reduced adiposity after PRT could have both <italic>directly</italic> and <italic>indirectly</italic> reduced circulating CRP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>The role of inflammation in adaptations to PRT</title><p>Given the known catabolic effects of systemic inflammation, and its role in anabolic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], our data suggest that reductions in CRP may allow more robust increases in SMM in response to PRT. However, our study does not prove that reductions in inflammation secondary to reduced adiposity preceded the skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and thus further investigations are needed to delineate the time course of these adaptations to PRT. An alternative pathway to CRP reduction after PRT is also possible. Skeletal muscle is known to secrete IL-6 in response to muscle contraction, which can bring about an anti-inflammatory environment by inducing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Importantly, the magnitude of IL-6 production is dependent on the amount of skeletal muscle recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which would be optimized by training with high speeds/volumes/intensities/numbers of muscle groups (such as our power training group). These circulating anti-inflammatory myokines may also potentially mediate the effects of PRT by suppressing CRP production within adipose and non-adipose tissues, thus contributing to reduced inflammation. These pathways to lower CRP (reduced fat mass and increased muscle contractile activity) may operate simultaneously and require further study to determine their relevance and importance in type 2 diabetes and other cohorts characterized by chronic systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Anti-inflammatory efficacy of body composition changes may depend on how they are achieved</title><p>Reductions in FM following PRT were significantly associated with reductions in CRP, while reductions in FM following sham-exercise were not (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), despite similar reductions in FM between groups, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This suggests that not only is reduction in adipose tissue necessary for reduction in systemic inflammation, but the intervention chosen to mediate this body composition shift may play an important role. Other strategies to reduce adipose tissue, such as dietary changes, would not incorporate any potential therapeutic effect of skeletal muscle contraction. In addition, dietary restriction by itself may cause losses of muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] as well as adipose tissue. Thus, the benefits of fat loss could be attenuated or eliminated by the adverse effects of muscle loss and reduced contractile activity on overall inflammatory milieu.</p><p>It is also possible that combined strategies to reduce inflammation may be even more beneficial than any single intervention such as anabolic exercise. While our data suggest that reductions in CRP can be achieved through PRT-mediated reductions in adiposity, other interventions to reduce systemic inflammation, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], poly-unsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], or antioxidants could potentially enhance the anabolic response to PRT in older adults with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Future directions, limitations, and conclusions</title><p>Most importantly, further prospective studies are needed to determine the nature of the relationship between CRP and SMM, which is potentially bi-directional. Elevated CRP may attenuate a robust response to anabolic stimuli, thus both leading to sarcopenia <italic>and</italic> impeding recovery from it. Alternatively, sarcopenia/dynapenia and the reduced contractile activity accompanying this condition could reduce anti-inflammatory myokine release into the circulation and thus contribute to an overall enhancement of systemic inflammatory profile. Understanding of these relationships may improve targeting of individuals likely to require augmentation of standard PRT regimens to enhance body composition and metabolic outcomes in clinical cohorts.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that 12&#x000a0;months of PRT reduced systemic inflammation in older adults with type 2 diabetes, mediated through improvements in body composition, relationships which were not seen with sham exercise. The significant associations between changes in CRP and changes in FM and SMM after PRT indicate that <italic>both</italic> body composition compartments should be targeted in evidence-based lifestyle interventions aimed at maximally reducing systemic inflammation in older adults with type 2 diabetes. It is time that the insufficient goal of &#x0201c;weight loss&#x0201d; be replaced with &#x0201c;muscle gain and fat loss&#x0201d; in overweight/obese cohorts if optimal metabolic health is to be achieved.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>SMM</term><def><p>Skeletal muscle mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FM</term><def><p>Total fat mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAT</term><def><p>Visceral adipose tissue area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSA</term><def><p>Cross-sectional area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRT</term><def><p>Progressive resistance training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SHAM</term><def><p>Sham-exercise training group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIA</term><def><p>Bioelectrical impedance assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p>Glycated hemoglobin</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number</bold></p><p>ANZCTRN 12606000436572 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/">www.anzctr.org.au</ext-link>
