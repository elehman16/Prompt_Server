<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive, and thus complex, interventions in community-based healthcare systems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> However, evidence is still lacking regarding the effectiveness of such interventions on patient outcomes and quality of care as perceived by older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
</p><p>A promising approach to delivering age-specific long-term care and support lies in integrated care services. The Chronic Care Model (CCM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> is a well-known framework that can be used to develop such services. The CCM integrates community social care and healthcare services, and has four interdependent key elements: self-management support, delivery system design, decision support, and clinical information systems. An example of a CCM-based integrated care service is the &#x0201c;Guided Care" model for multimorbid older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> Within Guided Care, a physician&#x02013;nurse primary care team provides care for the most complex patients, with the aim of increasing both quality of care and quality of life while lowering costs. Studies on this service have shown encouraging effects on perceptions of quality of care among older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> However, as is typical of such initiatives, this service targets only those already in need of care. It is well known that the health status of older adults can change quickly, taking a sudden turn for the worse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> Moreover, preventive and proactive care may help to delay declining health status among older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
</p><p>Therefore, integrated care models could be even more effective if they targeted the general population of older adults. On the other hand, delivering the same care intensity to all older adults is neither needed nor sustainable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> Thus a more practical solution may be in combining integrated care models with population health management models. These models can help stratify a population of community-living older adults into risk profiles with corresponding levels of care and support that are non-disease- and non-service-specific.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
</p><p>Embrace (in Dutch: &#x0201c;SamenOud&#x0201d;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> is an integrated care service designed for all community-living older adults, which combines the CCM with risk profiles based on a population health management model, the Kaiser Permanente Triangle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref> In the Embrace model, participating older adults are stratified into the risk profiles based on self-reported levels of &#x0201c;case complexity&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> and level of &#x0201c;frailty,&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> and care and support are then offered by a multidisciplinary Elderly Care Team, with intensity determined by individual risk profiles. Embrace aims to integrate health and social services with preventive care and support, and was developed to improve patient health outcomes as well as quality of care, service use, and cost.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of Embrace on the quality of care as perceived by community-living older adults and participating professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>We performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) from January 2012 through March 2013, in which older adult participants were stratified into risk profiles and equally allocated to intervention and control groups, as reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> Alongside the RCT, the perceived &#x0201c;level of implementation of integrated elderly care&#x0201d; of participating professionals was evaluated within the intervention arm. The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen assessed our study proposal and concluded that their approval was not required (Reference METc2011.108). The study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample Size</title><p>We calculated the sample size for participants based on a clinically relevant change in the self-reported health status visual analogue scale as measured with the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-VAS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> We needed 1062 older adults to detect a six-point difference on the EQ-5D-VAS with a standard deviation of 14 points, power of 80 %, and two-sided <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 in the smallest risk profile (&#x0201c;Frail&#x0201d;). With an estimated loss to follow-up of 30 % and 30 % non-response, 2178 older adults needed to be invited. With an average of 200 enlisted older adults per general practitioner (GP) practice (also referred to as family physicians or primary care physicians), 11 GP practices were required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and Procedure</title><p>First, we invited all 24 GPs in three municipalities in the province of Groningen, the Netherlands, to participate. After 15 GPs consented to participate, we stopped recruitment. Participating GPs were evenly distributed over the three municipalities. This included six GPs who were working as solo GPs and nine GPs who were part of a partnership or group practice. This distribution of practice types is comparable to that in the rest of the Netherlands.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> Next, we invited all adults aged 75 years and over from these 15 GP practices. Exclusion criteria were long-term admission to a nursing home (the equivalent of a US skilled nursing facility), involvement in a comparable integrated care service, or participation in another scientific study.</p><p>Eligible older adults received a letter from their GP with general information about the study. Once their written consent was provided, these adults completed self-report questionnaires and answered questions regarding demographic and health-related characteristics, both at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up. Participating professionals were asked to complete a questionnaire both at baseline and 12-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Stratified Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Participating older adults were stratified into three risk profiles based on their responses on the questionnaires regarding case complexity (INTERMED for the Elderly, self-assessment, INTERMED-E-SA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> and frailty (Groningen Frailty Indicator, GFI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> The risk profiles were as follows: &#x0201c;Robust&#x0201d; (INTERMED-E-SA score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;16 and GFI score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5), &#x0201c;Frail&#x0201d; (INTERMED-E-SA score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;16 and GFI score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5), and &#x0201c;Complex care needs&#x0201d; (INTERMED-E-SA score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16, irrespective of GFI score). After stratification, we performed a concealed and computerized balanced allocation procedure to achieve equal distribution between the intervention and control groups with regard to participants&#x02019; demographic and health-related characteristics.</p><p>Due to the study design, Elderly Care Team members knew which participants were assigned to Embrace. The participating older adults were informed in writing as to whether they were assigned to an intervention or a control group. For practical reasons, the data manager was not blinded; researchers, however, were masked until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p>For Embrace, a GP-led Elderly Care Team was assembled within each participating GP practice, in which the GP remained responsible for writing prescriptions and implementing the interventions. The Elderly Care Team additionally consisted of an elderly care physician (i.e., a nursing home physician), a community nurse, and a social worker. All Elderly Care Team members completed a training program. The initial training for the GPs (3 days in total) focused on team and population management and on essential themes such as multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Social workers and district nurses received specific training in areas such as case management and shared decision making during an 8-day initial training program. All members of the Elderly Care Teams received monthly on-the-job coaching during their team meetings.</p><p>The Elderly Care Team provided older adults with comprehensive, patient-centered, proactive, and preventive care and support. Members met monthly for consultation at the participating GP practice. The intensity and focus of care and support at the patient level differed by risk profile in terms of number of contacts, main focus, health-related vs. social problems, and individual vs. group approach. Older adults within the &#x0201c;Frail&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Complex care needs&#x0201d; profiles received individual care and support from a case manager, a social worker, and community nurse, respectively. They visited these older adults at home once or twice a month, and focused specifically on problems experienced by older adults, i.e., emotional and exercise tolerance functions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
</p><p>Elderly Care Team monitoring of older adults within the &#x0201c;Robust&#x0201d; profile consisted in reviewing their medical files, medications, and self-reported levels of frailty and case complexity once a year. Participating &#x0201c;Robust&#x0201d; older adults were encouraged to contact the Elderly Care Team if their health or life situation changed. They received a questionnaire on changes in their health or life situation and directions for follow-up. The Elderly Care Team acted proactively in cases of suspected deterioration in health status (e.g., increased forgetfulness, sudden loss of weight) or an imminent loss of support from the informal network (e.g., an overburdened caregiver) for older adults who received case management.</p><p>Finally, all participating older adults were offered a self-management support and prevention program that included, for example, community meetings and newsletters emphasizing the need for prevention and healthy lifestyles while maintaining self-management abilities. See Online Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for additional details on intensity, duration, and cost per risk profile.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Care as Usual</title><p>The control group received usual care as provided by their GP and the local health and social care organizations. In the Netherlands, municipalities are responsible for social care and health promotion, which is government (tax)-funded. Basic healthcare insurance is obligatory, and covers almost all primary and secondary healthcare. The GP acts as gatekeeper for specialized medical care. GP visit rates increases with age, from four visits per year at ages 45&#x02013;64, to ten visits annually at ages 75 years and older.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>

Next, we calculated index scores by subtracting the minimum scale score from the raw scale score, dividing this by the scale score range, and then multiplying by 100, resulting in scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better perceived quality of care. We then normalized the skewed PAIEC distribution by a power (square root) transformation (&#x0221a;[PAIEC index scores +1]).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>

</p><p>Some (potential) limitations need to be addressed as well. First, given the differences between participants and non-participants at a 49 % participation rate, generalization of our findings requires further investigation. Second, we randomized participating older adults within the GP practices. This may have led to some contamination of the control group via the members of the Elderly Care Team, who received extensive training and were unblinded, causing some underestimation of the effects of Embrace. Third, older adults in the control groups were not blinded, which might have led to response bias. Finally, we had no control group for the professionals. Participating professionals may have responded in socially desirable ways, leading to some overestimation of the effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Embrace is one of the first services with the aim of providing person-centered and integrated care to all community-living older adults. It was built on previous research regarding preventive and proactive care, and combines the well-known Chronic Care Model and the Kaiser Permanente Triangle. Our study showed that such a service can have positive effects on perceived quality of care. The effects we found were small to medium, and were most evident for older adults receiving case management. These results may have implications for policy, practice, and research.</p><p>First, our findings could support further development, integration, and funding of integrated care services for all older adults. Given the pivotal role of the Elderly Care Team, Embrace will be of particular value in healthcare systems that aim to strengthen primary care. Moreover, our findings can aid the further development of models such as patient-centered medical homes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> Second, our findings need to be confirmed in other settings to assess their generalizability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref> Third, such evaluation could comprise other, more technical aspects of quality of care, including whether specific care processes were performed (e.g., vaccinations, management of specific disorders).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref> Finally, the effects of Embrace on participating older adults&#x02019; health outcomes, their use of services, and costs must be assessed as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11606_2016_3742_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 26 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
