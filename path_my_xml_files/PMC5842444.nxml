This study was registered in Clinical Trial. Government with registration identifier IRCT2015092916532N3.</p><p>All patients who had undergone PCI and were referred by their cardiologist to the Cardiac Rehabilitation Department of Al-Zahra Heart Charity Hospital in Shiraz from October 2015 to November 2016, 1 month after angioplasty, were evaluated for inclusion in this study. The inclusion criteria were age 40&#x02013;70 years, left ventricular ejection fraction &#x02264;40%, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class I, II, or III. Patients were excluded from the study if the following criteria were met: severe exercise intolerance; uncontrolled arrhythmia; uncontrolled angina pectoris; severe kidney or lung diseases; musculoskeletal or neuromuscular conditions preventing exercise testing or training; and signs or symptoms of ischemia. All participants signed a written informed consent before participating in this study. Ethics approval was obtained from the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Local Ethics Committee (reference number: IR.SUMS.REC.1394113).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>After the baseline assessment and before the start of treatment protocols, the 75 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to one of three groups: ET, CT, and control. A biostatistician generated the random allocation sequence using permuted block randomization method with 25 blocks and block size of three. The random allocation sequence was implemented by a nurse who was blind to the study hypothesis and intervention. All participants, referring physicians, research assistants, outcome assessors, and analyst were blinded to group assignment. To ensure allocation concealment, participants in each group were seen at a specific, prescheduled time, and appointments for each group did not coincide with appointments for any patients in either of the other two groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Exercise testing</title><p>A supervised graded exercise test to record volitional fatigue or symptoms was performed on a treadmill with the Bruce protocol before and after the 7-week intervention period. The test was done in nonfasting conditions and under medication. A 12-lead electrocardiography was recorded continuously, and blood pressure was measured with an arm cuff every 3 min. Functional capacity in metabolic equivalent value (METs) and rate pressure product in the second stage of the exercise test was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Biomarkers</title><p>Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and the end of the study. Blood samples were drawn on the same day as exercise testing but were collected before exercise. All final blood samples were obtained 24 h after completion of the last exercise session. Serum NT-pro BNP level was determined with an enzyme immunoassay kit from Biomedica (Vienna, Austria). Hs-CRP was measured with a commercial ELISA kit (Monobind Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA). Biomarkers were assayed according to the manufacturers&#x02019; recommended protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Both exercise groups received training three times per week for 7 weeks. Training sessions were supervised by an experienced physiotherapist and a nurse. Electrocardiogram and heart rate were observed with telemetric monitoring, and blood pressure was measured at the commencement and the end of each session. Each training session was initiated with a 5 min warm-up and ended with 5 min of cool-down. Patients in all three groups received a pamphlet for daily exercising at home. To sum up, the exercises included ten types of active exercises. The patients were asked to do each exercise for 10 repetitions. Each exercise session at home lasted 15&#x02013;20 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Endurance training protocol</title><p>The patients performed ET for a total of 45 min at 40%&#x02013;70% peak VO<sub>2</sub> predicted with a supervised graded exercise test on a treadmill with the Bruce protocol. ET comprised of exercising on a cycle ergometer for 20 min, an arm ergometer for 10 min, and a treadmill for 15 min. The first few sessions, training intensity was set at 40% peak VO<sub>2</sub> and then increased progressively to 70% peak VO<sub>2</sub>. As training intensity increased, the patients&#x02019; heart rate, rate of perceived exertion (Borg scale), and cardiac symptoms were also taken into consideration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Combined endurance-resistance training protocol</title><p>The patients performed ET as the described protocol for 30 min (10 min for each workstation) followed by the resistance exercise protocol.</p><p>The resistance exercise protocol included four exercise regimens: knee extension, knee flexion, elbow flexion, and shoulder abduction. Initial intensity was set as 40% one repetition maximum (1RM) and then increased gradually to 60% 1RM (1RM is the maximum weight that can be lifted once with correct technique through a full range of motion). Patients performed these exercises in two sets of 10 repetitions per se ssion. They were instructed to perform the exercises slowly with correct lifting technique to avoid the Valsalva maneuver. The lower limb muscle groups (knee extensor and flexors) were trained with a weight machine, and upper limb muscle groups (elbow flexors and shoulder abductors) were trained using dumbbells. The total duration of the resistance exercise protocol was approximately 15 min.</p><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Control protocol</title><p>Patients in the control group only received a pamphlet for daily exercising at home as explained above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>According to the previous studies,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the sample size was determined based on NT-pro BNP level outcome to be 25 patients in each groupwhen &#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; = 0.2 and effect size = 0.61 by the NCSS (PASS) 2007 software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA). All analyses were done with SPSS software, version 16 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) on an intention-to-treat principle. Normality of the data distribution was checked with the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test, and nonparametric tests were used for nonnormal variables. We used descriptive statistics including mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for quantitative variables and frequency (percentage) for qualitative variables to summarize the participants&#x02019; baseline characteristics. Baseline comparisons between groups were performed with one-way ANOVA. Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables amongst our three groups. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for within-group comparisons for variables with normal and nonnormal (NT-proBNP and hs-CRP) distribution, respectively. For each participant, change in values from baseline was calculated at the end of 7<sup>th</sup> week (postintervention). Between-group comparisons were tested with one-way ANOVA and the <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant for all tests. In addition, the magnitude of changes was evaluated by calculating Cohen's effect size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the screening process out of 311 patients, 232 were excluded, since they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and four other patients declined to participate. Finally, 75 patients were randomly allocated in each group. Five participants withdrew from the study due to loss of interest and other reasons that were not related to exercise training [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Participants completed the study without any serious adverse events. Premature ventricular contractions were recorded in six patients. Two patients in CT group had an episode of angina pectoris during treadmill exercise that was relieved after taking sublingual nitroglycerin. One patient in ET group experienced severe hypotension during two consecutive training sessions that was normalized after discontinuing exercise. Another patient in ET group had a respiratory problem, which was not related to exercise training and had to be hospitalized for 3 days. The last two patients resumed training after 1 week. At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for demographic and clinical characteristics [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

All participants completed the study without any serious adverse events, suggesting that both exercise protocols were safe and well tolerated. Both ET and CT were effective in reducing NT-proBNP levels, and no significant change in this biomarker was seen in the control group. Our findings are in line with previous studies on the effectiveness of ET in diminishing NT-proBNP level.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The important aspect, with which we can differentiate our work from other studies, is the duration of exercise program. Significant reduction in NT-proBNP level in a short-term exercise training program (7 weeks) is noteworthy. Studies that investigated changes in NT-proBNP and BNP concentrations after CT reported varying results. Conraads <italic>et al</italic>. found a decrease in NT-proBNP level after a 4-month CT program,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Whereas J&#x000f3;nsd&#x000f3;ttir <italic>et al</italic>. found no significant change in BNP with a 5-month CT program.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Differences in exercise program parameters, as well as differences in pharmacological treatments among studies, may be factors in determining the amount of change in NT-proBNP level.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Low mean weekly exercise energy expenditures in some exercise program may be the reason for the absence of significant changes in BNP in these studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>High levels of NT-proBNP are related to poor prognosis that probably mirrors a degree of hemodynamic compromise and increased ventricular wall stress. The reduction in NT-proBNP with exercise training can be an expression of reduced ventricular wall tension and improved hemodynamics.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, it may be indicative of improved systolic cardiac function and tissue oxygenation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Since cardiac function plays an important role in patients&#x02019; functional capacity and quality of life, a reduction in NT-proBNP concentration is a beneficial impact of the exercise training. Furthermore, NT-proBNP is a prognostic marker of cardiovascular events in patients with left ventricular dysfunction;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] therefore, decrease in NT-proBNP is associated with reduction in cardiac events.</p><p>The exact mechanism for the reduction in NT-proBNP level by exercise training is unclear. It was hypothesized that the decrease in NT-proBNP levels in training groups is probably due to improved endothelial function leading to a decrease in left ventricular afterload, after exercise training.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Hs-CRP was significantly reduced only in the ET group, but the change in the CT and control groups were not significant. These findings are in agreement with the results of previous studies showing that ET can diminish hs-CRP levels.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] One mechanism proposed to explain the training-induced reduction in CRP is a decrease in cytokine production by adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, blood mononuclear cells, and endothelial cells.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Exercise is known to attenuate inflammatory markers associated with endothelial dysfunction and to improve endothelial function by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide formation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The anti-inflammatory effects of exercise training may improve symptoms in patients with heart failure[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and reduce mortality.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>We did not find any significant changes in hs-CRP in the CT group after the intervention. A similar study investigated the effects of CT program on markers of inflammation in patients with stable angina after PCI, and the authors reported that exercise had no significant effect on hs-CRP.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] It is likely that more intense resistance training is required to significantly modify markers of inflammation. It should be noted, that a higher training load may be unsafe and difficult to comply with in patients with heart failure. In terms of magnitude, Cohen's effect sizes were 0.18 for the ET group and 0.22 for the CT group. Given that the patients in our sample study received statins for 1 month before they began exercise training, baseline levels of hs-CRP were mostly within the normal range, and this may explain the small training effect.</p><p>We found no significant differences between training groups in postintervention changes in NT-proBNP and hs-CRP. We, therefore, cannot claim the superiority of one training protocol over another. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the effects of ET and CT on NT-proBNP and hs-CRP in heart failure patients, hence, our results should be compared to other studies with caution.</p><p>Our results showed significant improvement in functional capacity after ET and CT compared to our control group, but there were no significant differences between the ET and CT groups. In terms of magnitude of the differences between changes in the CT and ET groups, Cohen's effect sizes were 0.20 for functional capacity. These findings are consistent with the results of previous studies.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] A meta-analysis reported that an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness of 1.5 METs after cardiac rehabilitation is associated with a 16%&#x02013;54% reduction in cardiac mortality.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study has several limitations. At first, we did not collect follow-up data due to time constraints. Second, this study only included heart failure patients with NYHA functional class I-III, thus our results may not be applicable to individuals with NYHA functional class IV nor those with severe comorbid conditions. Another limitation of our study was that women accounted for only 25.3% of the participants, so whether our findings can be generalized to both genders should be studied further. Furthermore, although the use of gas analyzer is the gold standard for peak VO<sub>2</sub> determination, due to unavailability of this device, we predicted the peak VO<sub>2</sub> indirectly using Bruce protocol. We suggest further studies with larger sample sizes and follow-up assessment to conclude whether the positive effects of exercise training will still remain with time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study showed that patients with heart failure after PCI can achieve a significant reduction in NT-proBNP and hs-CRP levels, and improve functional capacity from a short-term ET program. Besides, CT in these patients was feasible, safe, and effective in reducing the level of NT-proBNP and improving the functional capacity. There was no significant superiority of one modality over another in terms of NT-proBNP and functional capacity. Further research is required to compare the effectiveness of the two training protocols on hs-CRP level.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, for scientific and financial support for this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the personnel at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Department of Al-Zahra Heart Charity Hospital for their cooperation, and K.
