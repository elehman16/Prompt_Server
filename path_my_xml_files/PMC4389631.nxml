The aging of baby boomers is expected to lead to a 2-fold increase in the number of white person 65 years of age or older by 2031.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Correspondingly, a doubling in the number of North Americans with AMD is expected. The exudative (wet or neovascular) form of AMD is associated most widely with central vision impairment and legal blindness.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The 15-year cumulative incidence of wet AMD in Americans 75 years of age or older is 4.4%.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> By 2020, in the United States alone, it is estimated that nearly 3 million individuals will be affected by wet AMD.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The progressive nature of wet AMD, its substantial societal and personal impact, and its high prevalence make it essential to develop clinical strategies to reduce its impact. It represents an important cause of morbidity and presents direct financial burdens of more than $10 billion in direct annual medical costs in the United States and accounts for significant loss of productivity.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Designing efficient and cost-effective treatment methods therefore is highly desirable.</p><p id="P7">The management of wet AMD was revolutionized by the introduction of anti&#x02013;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Regrettably, 5% to 10% of patients proceed to lose 3 lines or more of visual acuity (VA), and most exudative lesions show some sign of activity by the end of follow-up. In addition, increased numbers of thromboembolic events, possible neuronal toxicity, and higher incidence of geographic atrophy in patients with more frequent anti-VEGF injections also may be of concern.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, developing alternative or adjunct therapies to currently available anti-VEGF drugs may increase treatment success, slow AMD progression, and improve VA outcomes.</p><p id="P8">The abnormal and disproportionate growth of choroidal vessels associated with wet AMD likely stems from a compensatory angiogenic response to overcome an earlier phase of microvessel degeneration and reinstate metabolic equilibrium to the hypoxic macula. A potential strategy to influence and reduce the progression of wet AMD comes from directly modulating the cellular make-up of the retina. In this respect, the outer retina is highly concentrated in diet-derived long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) of the omega-3 family and arachidonic acid of the omega-6 family.

Dietary intake of omega-3 LCPUFAs and its influence on processes implicated in pathologic retinal angiogenesis has been proposed.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We previously reported on the pronounced anti-angiogenic effects of certain omega-3 LCPUFA metabolites such as 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (a metabolite produced via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and acting through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor). We also demonstrated that increased omega-3 LCPUFA dietary intake reduces pathologic angiogenesis in experimental animal models of neovascular retinopathies.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Our previous genetic work in humans extended these findings to support the influence of omega-3 activated pathway on angiogenesis in wet AMD patients via complement and VEGF signaling systems.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In the time frame of the current human study, the effects of omega-3 supplementation were exclusive to modulating vitreous levels of VEGF-A in proximity of the site of neovascularization, but not on systemic levels as determined by analysis of plasma.</p><p id="P31">Interestingly, despite the significantly lower levels of VEGF-A in the vitreous of group 1, CFT values were similar to those of group 2 (after an average of 7 prior anti-VEGF injections) and of group 3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). In accordance with recent work in diabetic macular edema by Sonoda and associates, our findings also demonstrated a lack of correlation between CFT values and vitreous levels of VEGF in patients with active wet AMD (data not shown).<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These data agree with the notion that other factors besides VEGF-A may contribute to disease activity in wet AMD and that combination therapy with other agents is likely necessary in many patients to completely stall CNV activity and promote regression. In addition, the bevacizumab pro re nata treatment protocol used for groups 1 and 2 may have contributed to the absence of significant variations in plasma levels of VEGF-A when compared with group 3 (treatment na&#x000ef;ve). Lesser influence of bevacizumab treatment on systemic levels of VEGF also has been found in patients in the discontinuous treatment arm of the Inhibit VEGF in Age-related choroidal Neovascularization (IVAN) trial.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P32">The biopsy technique applied was performed specifically to collect vitreous samples as close as possible to the macula, under microscope visualization, to obtain a representative vitreal sample in close proximity to neovascular membranes.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This accurate sampling by vitreous biopsy directly adjacent to the macula also may explain in part the higher levels of VEGF-A detected in our patients with wet AMD when compared with previous reports.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Despite high levels of LCPUFA metabolites in retinal tissue,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> lipidomic analysis of the undiluted vitreous in wet AMD did not yield consistent results, and we were not able to detect consistent levels of omega-3 and omega-6 metabolites (data not shown).</p><p id="P33">Epidemiologic studies consistently have shown protective relationships of increased omega-3 LCPUFA-rich food intake with advanced AMD.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 did not report a protective effect of 350 mg/day of DHA plus 650 mg/day of EPA supplementation for progression to wet AMD in their phase 3 clinical trial.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The lack of positive results in this trial could be because it was performed on a very well-nourished study population, in which 11% of the placebo group were taking omega-3 LCPUFAs outside the study regimen, or that a higher supplemental dose or higher composition of DHA plus EPA was needed for efficacy.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P34">The Nutritional AMD Treatment 2 study research team randomly assigned high-risk AMD patients to 840 mg/day DHA plus 270 mg/day EPA or a placebo for 3 years.

Anti-VEGF&#x02013;na&#x000ef;ve eyes without any nutrient supplement and an omega-3 LCPUFA poor diet (group 3) also were associated with higher VEGF-A levels than those detected in the omega-3 supplemented group (group 1). Furthermore, we showed that omega-3 supplementation specifically lowers vitreous levels of VEGF-A without influencing plasma levels of VEGF-A in patients with wet AMD who were receiving a bevacizumab pro re nata regimen. This is likely because AMD provokes a local rise in VEGF-A, and hence only vitreous, but not systemic, levels increase. The average time from last injection in both groups being treated with bevacizumab was 8 weeks, without any significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). Although recent studies have demonstrated decreased systemic VEGF levels up to 4 weeks after intravitreal bevacizumab injection, our study did not show any significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (treated with bevacizumab) and group 3 (treatment na&#x000ef;ve) at 8 weeks after their last anti-VEGF injection.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Therefore, our data suggest that omega-3 supplementation selectively lowers pathologic ocular VEGF-A in the retina, but not physiologic systemic VEGF-A. Long-term studies will be required to determine if the observed reduction in VEGF-A by omega-3- supplementation combined with anti-VEGF translates into lesser CNV progression or activity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><p>Supported by the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Montreal; Department of Ophthalmology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital; Fond de Recherche en Ophtalmologie, University of Montreal; Foundation Fighting Blindness Canada; Grant 324573 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Retina Foundation of Canada; Insight Instruments, Stuart, Florida, USA; Synergetics, Inc., O&#x02019;Fallon, Missouri, USA; Novartis Canada, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Grants EY022275, EY017017, and P01 HD18655 from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; a Senior Investigator Award from Research to Prevent Blindness, New York, New York, USA; the Lowy Medical Foundation; and FP7 project 305485 of the European Commission (LEHS).
