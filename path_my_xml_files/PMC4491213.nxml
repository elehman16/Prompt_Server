In China, it is the second leading cancer cause of death ranking after lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is commonly detected at advanced stages for its initial stage often lack of specific symptom. Liver metastasis is one of the prognostic factors predicting poor survival in gastric cancer. Nearly 5&#x02013;10 % of gastric cancer patients have involvement of synchronous liver metastasis when get diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy is the key treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Multiple trails of various chemotherapeutic regimens have been conducted to prolong the survival of patients with AGC. Classical chemotherapy regimens for AGC include CF and ECF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Paclitaxel is an anti-mitotic drug which had been widely used in the treatment of a variety of tumors including gastric cancer. Clinical trials have confirmed the safety and efficiency of paclitaxel and capecitabine (PX) combination chemotherapy in AGC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although great progress has been achieved in chemotherapy, the outcome of patients with AGC is still poor. Tumor progression is common in patients with temporary regression after chemotherapy due to drug resistance. Surgery is another way to get a long-time survival in the patient with advanced cancer. The significance of surgery for AGC, especially for the liver metastasis from gastric cancer, is still elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, Suzuki et al. reported that adjuvant surgery was effective following the response of chemotherapy in AGC patients with liver metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In some cases, the adjuvant surgery resulted in further long-term survival. Nevertheless, solid evidence from prospective study is lacking.</p><p>This study therefore aimed to investigate whether adjuvant surgery followed by chemotherapy was more beneficial than chemotherapy alone in gastric cancer patients with synchronous liver metastasis following preoperative chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study scheme</title><p>This study included 49 patients with AGC treated between June 2008 and December 2011 in Beijing Cancer Hospital. All patients were diagnosed with synchronous liver metastases and placed on a chemotherapy regimen, paclitaxel plus capecitabine (PX). Then, patients were divided into two groups based on their preference after multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion. The surgery group underwent adjuvant gastrectomy (D2) followed by postoperative chemotherapy (PX). The control group received the same chemotherapy as described above without any operation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was diluted in 0.9 % saline and administered as a 2-h infusion in the morning of day 1 and day 8 of each cycle (i.e., every 3 weeks). The paclitaxel infusion was started simultaneously with the capecitabine administration. Responses were classified according to the RECIST guidelines. Patients in the surgery group were placed on postoperative chemotherapy within 4 to 6 weeks after gastrectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Definition of adjuvant gastrectomy</title><p>Patients with progressive disease are considered not suitable for resection. Adjuvant gastric resection included the absence of primary tumor, both macroscopically and microscopically, by D2 lymphadenectomy. Resection margin was not less than 5 cm for partial gastrectomy. In total gastrectomy, proximal resection margin was not less than 2 cm while distal resection margin was not less than 5 cm. Simultaneous hepatic resection was conducted when the liver metastasis could be curative resected through the evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Patients were assessed every month to detect any adverse events with verbal interview, physical examination, and blood tests, including a complete blood cell count and measurements of liver and renal function, until disease progression. Abdominal CT/MRI and measurements of CEA and CA19-9 were carried out every 3 months. Overall survival was defined as the time from diagnosis of AGC with synchronous liver metastases to death from any cause or last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the length of time after treatment during which the disease did not get worse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data related to patient characteristics were compared between the two groups by using the chi-square test. Data on patients who were alive or lost to follow-up were censored. The primary end point was survival. Cumulative survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method (SPSS version 19 software), and comparisons between the groups were done with a log-rank test. A multivariate analysis of the Cox proportional hazards regression model (backward, stepwise) was created to assess the influence of each variable on survival.

Outcome for patients with AGC is extremely poor. The treatment strategy for AGC with synchronous liver metastasis is still not well established. Combined chemotherapy is a way to improve survival and quality of life for patients with AGC. Kang et al. conducted a phase II study of PX to evaluate this combination in AGC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Results were promising which included high response rate (44.5 % PRs) and prolonged patient survival (median OS: 11.3 months). In our current, single-center trial of AGC with synchronous liver metastasis, consistent with previous studies, pretreatment with PX resulted in an overall response rate of 42.8 % (PR).</p><p>Referring the efficacy of surgery for AGC, gastrectomy is indicated to provide palliation of the active symptoms such as bleeding and obstruction; nevertheless, the role of gastric resection in the treatment of patients with minimal symptoms and non-curative factors including liver metastasis remains controversial. Studies have reported improved survival in AGC patients who underwent palliative gastrectomy when compared to those who had not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lin et al. reported that both survival time and palliative duration were significantly longer in patients with stage IV gastric cancer after palliative gastrectomy than non-resection operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; however, others implied that no patients or only a selected subsets of patients with AGC might benefit from non-curative gastrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Li et al. demonstrated that only patients with single peritoneal dissemination had survival benefit from palliative resection while others with single liver, distant lymph nodes, or multiple sites metastasis had none [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One possible reason for the persistent controversy is that heterogeneous patients with different clinical parameters were enrolled in different studies. For example, multiorgan metastasis could be a factor for predicting poor prognosis of AGC.</p><p>Recently, increasing studies have evaluated the combined efficacy of non-curative surgery with peri-operative systemic chemotherapy in AGCs. The preoperative chemotherapy aimed to downstage the primary tumor while postoperative chemotherapy was administered to treat the residual cancer and micrometastasis. Kokkola et al. reported that patients with metastatic gastric cancer underwent gastrectomy followed by postoperative chemotherapy had better median OS than patients who underwent gastrectomy without chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In another study, the median OS of AGC patients underwent gastrectomies after the response to chemotherapy reached 28.5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which was more prolonged than the range for median survival (5~24 months) in patients who underwent non-curative gastrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patients might benefit from the non-curative surgery when preoperative chemotherapy was effective. However, most of these studies were retrospective studies with limited number of patients enrolled, and prospective trials are warranted to determine the value of adjuvant gastrectomy following preoperative chemotherapy in AGCs.</p><p>In this study, we prospectively compared the efficacy of adjuvant surgery plus chemotherapy (PX) with chemotherapy alone following the response to neoadjuvant/preoperative chemotherapy for AGC with synchronous liver metastasis. Both median OS and PFS of patients in the surgery group were statistically more prolonged than chemotherapy-only group. However, in the multivariate analysis, response to chemotherapy was the only positive prognostic factor in AGCs, with no effect on the adjuvant surgery. In this trial, more patients who achieved PR and SD were enrolled in the surgery group than in the control group for a curative intention. Poor survival in the control group might be caused by high PD rate in this group. In the subgroup analyses, the survival of patients who achieved PR was prolonged if they received adjuvant surgery. For this reason, a subgroup of patient could benefit from adjuvant surgery following the response to chemotherapy.</p><p>Another important issue is about the surgical resection of hepatic metastasis from AGC. Liver metastases from gastric cancer are rarely recommended to surgery for they are often complicated with other distant metastasis. A number of studies have reported that the efficacy of hepatic resection for liver metastases from gastric cancer was doubtful, while others showed that the combined hepatic resection leads to long-term survival in some selected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Even though, indications for surgery could be considered relay on the analysis of prognostic factors for gastric cancer with liver metastasis. Patients with good prognostic capacity might benefit from hepatic resection. Kodera et al. concluded that both &#x0201c;number of metastatic nodules&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;solitary tumor&#x0201d; were common independent prognostic factors for the gastric cancer with hepatic metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Others indicated that patients with synchronous solitary liver metastasis and without serosal invasion could be the criteria for liver resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To enrich the evidence for combined hepatic resection in AGC with liver metastasis, we compared the survival of patients who underwent liver surgery or not. Results showed that patients who underwent gastrectomy plus hepatic resection suffered poor outcomes. No clinical benefit of hepatic resection was found when AGC patients with liver metastasis were treated. The possible reason is that most of the patients enrolled in our study were diagnosed with multiple metastasis nodules. Systemic therapy is still the main strategy for patients with multiple metastasis lesions.</p><p>In addition, treatment failure is common in AGC patients with liver metastasis. The optimal treatment strategy after treatment failure remains a clinical concern. In our study, most of the patients who have failed the initial treatment accepted a secondary anti-tumor therapy including systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or interventional treatment. The remaining four patients who received supportive care all died in 10 months. The anti-tumor treatment prolonged the survival to 16.3 months. Thus, patients who failed the initial treatment would benefit from secondary anti-tumor therapy. Interestingly, among patients with treatment failure, 16 of them reached PR after chemotherapy. Eleven of the 16 patients who underwent gastrectomy had better outcome than the rest who did not treat with surgery. Accordingly, patients with tumor progression following a temporary regression to chemotherapy could also benefit from the adjuvant surgery after the initial chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PX is a promising combined chemotherapy regimen for AGC with liver metastasis. Response to chemotherapy is the only independent prognostic factor for patient survival. Adjuvant gastrectomy is reasonable in patients response to preoperative chemotherapy.
