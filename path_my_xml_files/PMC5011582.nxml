rehabilitation protocols: bilateral and unilateral movement training. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-five patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to two training
protocols for four weeks of training. Each training session consisted of three tasks. The
tasks were performed with either the impaired and unimpaired arms moving synchronously
(bilateral training) or with the impaired arm alone (unilateral training). To compare the
changes associated with each rehabilitation protocol, functional and kinematic assessments
were performed before and after the interventions. The functional state of each patient
was measured by the Box and Block Test, and the kinematic variables were assessed by
three-dimensional motion analysis. The Box and Block Test was used to assess the
functional abilities of the affected upper limb. Kinematic measurements of upper limb
movement were measured with a 3-dimensional motion analysis system. [Results] Results
showed that the bilateral movement group had significantly improved motion of the shoulder
compared to the unilateral movement group. [Conclusion] Bilateral movement training should
be used to improve upper limb function in patients with chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bilateral movement training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Upper limb function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>For motor recovery in patients with stroke, repetitive and intensive practice of voluntary
motor control is essential. Utilizing this concept, diverse treatment methods, such as
constraint-induced movement therapy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>,
electromyographic biofeedback<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, virtual
reality<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and task-oriented
training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> have been attempted for
recovery of upper-limb control in patients with stroke. However, such treatment methods have
focused on unilateral movement of the paretic upper extremity.</p><p>Bilateral exercise is a training method that utilizes the non-paretic limb in order to
promote functional recovery of the damaged limb through the interlimb coupling effect. To
achieve this effect, both hands are drawn into coordinated positions by the muscle groups of
identical structures, and combined into one coordinated unit. In order to obtain the
interlimb coupling effect in the upper limbs, both the paretic side and the non-paretic side
should be repetitively and intensively trained in a simultaneous manner. In this way, the
paretic arm will couple with the movement pattern of the non-paretic arm and, accordingly,
the function of the paretic arm will improve<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. When movement occurs in only one of the upper limbs, inhibition of
activation in the same-sided hemisphere takes place; however, while performing symmetric
bilateral movement tasks, both the left and the right cerebral hemispheres are activated,
reducing inhibition between the hemispheres and thereby promoting recovery of the paretic
limb<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Extensive research has been done to clarify the effects of bilateral exercise, but the
results have been controversial. Some research has asserted that the interlimb coupling
effect does not improve the performance of the paretic arm in patients with hemiplegia
resulting from stroke<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, other
studies have shown that bilateral movement increases the function of the paretic arm in
patients with chronic stroke, suggesting the potential role of bilateral movement in
recovering upper limb function after stroke<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, in order to help clarify the effect of bilateral movement through diverse tasks,
the subjects of this study were asked to perform tasks that did not force mirror-symmetric
movement but required coordination between both hands. The results derived from this study
will provide information that is useful for clarifying the effects of bilateral movement and
for systemizing efficient rehabilitation treatment methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-five inpatients and outpatients with stroke at a nursing facility located in N City
were divided into a bilateral movement group (n=13) and a unilateral movement group (n=12).
The bilateral group had five males and eight females, while the unilateral group had three
males and nine females. The bilateral group and unilateral group each had six subjects with
a paralyzed right side, while seven and six subjects, respectively, had a paralyzed left
side. The average age and average disease duration of the bilateral group were 78.8&#x02005;years
old and 83.0 months, respectively, and 72.9&#x02005;years old and 77.8 months in the unilateral
group, respectively. All subjects understood the purpose of the study and provided written
informed consent prior to participation, in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The selection criteria for the participants were as follows: (1) hemiplegia resulting from
cerebrovascular disease, (2) no pain in either arm, (3) no cognitive or perceptive disorders
limiting the ability to follow therapist directions, (4) onset of stroke six or more months
before the study, and (5) flexion and extension of the wrists and fingers of &#x02265;15&#x000b0;.</p><p>The subjects performed each exercise in the physical therapy room of the nursing facility
five times per week for six weeks. The exercise tasks were composed of hanging a ring,
cleaning a desk with a towel, and imitating the action of drinking water.</p><p>The ring-hanging task involved raising two rings (total diameter, 16&#x02005;cm; handle diameter,
2.5&#x02005;cm) at the same time and hanging them on a pole fixed to a desk (height: 35&#x02005;cm). Twenty
repetitions were counted as one set, and subjects performed a total of three sets. A
30-second rest was given between each set. Subjects who found it difficult to perform the
task with the paretic hand held one ring with both hands to perform the task.</p><p>In order to clean the desk with a towel, subjects unfolded their palms and placed both
hands side by side on the towel. They were then asked to clean the desk where a drawing had
been made with chalk. Subjects who found it difficult to perform the task completed it with
the paretic hand placed on top of the non-paretic hand. This task was conducted repetitively
for five minutes.</p><p>For the water-drinking task, the subjects were asked to imitate drinking water by raising a
cup with one hand and bringing it to the mouth. Ten repetitions were counted as one set, and
subjects performed three sets of this exercise. A 30-second rest was given between each set.
Subjects who found it difficult to perform the task with the paretic hand held the cup with
both hands.</p><p>Before and after the six-week exercise intervention, a Box and Block Test and
three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis were conducted. The Box and Block Test is a
standardized evaluation tool used to measure hand manipulation ability and upper limb
dexterity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>; the score is based on the
number of blocks moved by the subject in one minute. A real-time 3D motion analyzer (CMS-20,
Zebris Medizintechnik GmbH, Germany) was used to compare kinetic changes in the upper
limbs<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Using this equipment, dynamic
changes during repetitive exercises of the shoulders and elbows were measured. In order to
compare changes in upper-limb motion, the amplitude and variability of each repeated
exercise were measured.</p><p>The collected data were encoded for each subject and recorded on a computer. The values of
the amplitude and variability measured by the Box and Block Test and the 3D motion analyzer
differed between the two groups before the training exercises were performed. Therefore, an
analysis of covariance was conducted with the before-exercise values as covariates, to
examine the differences between the two groups after six weeks of exercise. For all
analyses, SPSS for Windows version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used, and the
significance level was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference between the bilateral-exercise group and the
unilateral-exercise group according to the analysis of covariance for the Box and Block Test

bilateral-exercise group compared to the unilateral-exercise group six weeks after the
intervention. However, there was no significant difference in the amplitude of the elbows
between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the
variability of the shoulders and elbows (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

upper limbs usually takes more time and is less effective than rehabilitation of the lower
limbs. Accordingly, this study intended to verify a more efficient treatment method by
comparing the effects of applying bilateral-task and unilateral-task exercises on upper-limb
function recovery in patients with chronic stroke with hemiplegia.</p><p>For the Box and Block Test, there was no difference between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05).
This contrasts with the results of some previous research that asserted that bilateral
exercise is more effective than unilateral exercise. Mudie and Matyas<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the effects of unilateral and bilateral exercise
in 12 stroke patients. The subjects converted from unilateral exercise to bilateral exercise
according to a training schedule, and there was an immediate effect from the performance of
bilateral exercises. Cauraugh and Kim<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that the group undergoing electromyographic electrical stimulation and bilateral
exercises together demonstrated significantly greater increases in motor function compared
to the group undergoing electromyographic electrical stimulation combined with unilateral
exercises. These results are similar to those of the present study, which found no
differences in functional improvement between bilateral exercise and unilateral exercise. In
addition, since electromyographic electrical stimulation and bilateral exercises were
performed together, it is therefore inappropriate to argue that the effect stemmed only from
the bilateral exercises<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When motor control and the mechanics of the exercises were examined with the 3D motion
analyzer, the results differed. Shoulder movement amplitude was significantly increased
after six weeks in the bilateral-exercise group compared to the unilateral-exercise group.
The amplitude of the elbows was not significantly different between the two groups. This
indicates that shoulder movement amplitude was improved in the bilateral-exercise group
compared to the unilateral-exercise group, but there was no difference in the amplitude of
elbow movement between the two groups. The training tasks used in the present study included
ring-hanging, cleaning a desk with a towel, and water-drinking motions, which should utilize
the entire upper limb in independent and cooperative ways; however, some subjects performed
these tasks by relying compensatory motion of the shoulders because of an associated
response. This explains why shoulder movement increased in the bilateral-exercise group,
while the two groups showed no differences in elbow movement.</p><p>In patients with stroke, the neurological mechanisms of the synchronization phenomenon that
occurs with bilateral exercises may be verified through functional MRI (fMRI) or
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). According to recent research, the mechanisms
related to functional recovery using bilateral exercise include mobilization of the
ipsilateral corticospinal pathways and normalization of the inhibition mechanism of the
non-paretic hemisphere. It is known that 10&#x02013;20% of ipsilateral corticospinal pathways are
non-crossing. Such non-crossing ipsilateral pathways are included in the recovery mechanism
after a stroke, which supports the use of bilateral exercise<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In bilateral exercise, in particular when speed increases, there
is a tendency for timing to correspond with spatial parameters. Researchers have proposed
that bilateral symmetric exercises after a stroke increase the use of the ipsilateral
pathways and promote the restriction of symmetry. In research using TMS and fMRI on patients
with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, the ipsilateral pathways were used when the lesion in the
damaged hemisphere was larger<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
effects of bilateral exercise may be explained by such results.</p><p>An increase in movement efficiency or degree of softness may be inferred by examining
movement deviations. The variability observed on 3D motion analysis represents the degree of
consistency of the repetitive movements, and decreased variability means that the movement
has become smoother. In the present study, the variability representing movement deviations
did not differ between the two groups in the shoulders and elbows (p&#x0003e;0.05). In contrast,
research by Kim et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
smoothness of movement improved in the bilateral-exercise group compared to the
unilateral-exercise group. They employed an assistive exercise device that was manufactured
to make mirror-symmetric movement possible. However, in the present study, the subjects
performed tasks that required coordination of both hands but that did not force
mirror-symmetric movement. The present study also selected bilateral-exercise tasks that are
actually performed in daily life. The reason the two research results are different may be
found in the differences between the exercise tasks.</p><p>In conclusion, this study was useful in showing that bilateral-task exercises may increase
movement compared to unilateral-task exercises. Therefore, the results of this study can be
utilized to elucidate the effects of bilateral exercises and to systemize more efficient
rehabilitation methods. Nonetheless, this study failed to consider effects stemming from the
form, location, and degree of brain damage. Such aspects should be addressed in future
research through diverse types of bilateral tasks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided by Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Liepert</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamzei</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiller</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Lesion-induced and training-induced brain
