Physical activity (PA) can produce beneficial effects on sleep. <italic>Study design.</italic> We designed a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of 3 months of physical activity on sleep and circadian rhythm activity level evaluated by actigraphy. <italic>Methods.</italic> 40 BC women, aged 35-70 years, were randomized into an intervention (IG) and a control group (CG). IG performed a 3 month of aerobic exercise. At baseline and after 3 months, the following parameters were evaluated both for IG and CG: anthropometric and body composition measurements, energy expenditure and motion level; sleep parameters (Actual Sleep Time-AST, Actual Wake Time-AWT, Sleep Efficiency-SE, Sleep Latency-SL, Mean Activity Score-MAS, Movement and Fragmentation Index-MFI and Immobility Time-IT) and activity level circadian rhythm using the Actigraph Actiwatch. <italic>Results.</italic> The CG showed a deterioration of sleep, whereas the IG showed a stable pattern. In the CG the SE, AST and IT decreased and the AWT, SL, MAS and MFI increased. In the IG, the SE, IT, AWT, SL, and MAS showed no changes and AST and MFI showed a less pronounced change in the IG than in the CG. The rhythmometric analysis revealed a significant circadian rhythm in two groups. After 3 months of PA, IG showed reduced fat mass %, while CG had improved weight and BMI. <italic>Conclusion.</italic> Physical activity may be beneficial against sleep disruption. Indeed, PA prevented sleep worsening in IG.

In order to test the null hypothesis for no difference between the pretest scores of the control and intervention groups, SL and IT were subjected to the nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank test, whereas AST, AWT, SE, MAS, and MFI were subjected to the unpaired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. SL and IT were then subjected to the Wilcoxon paired-sample test to test the null hypothesis for no difference between the pretest and posttest scores, whereas the 5 sleep parameters displaying normal distribution (AST, AWT, SE, MAS, and MFI) were subjected to repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA) to test whether there was an overall change of sleep behavior over time between the intervention and control groups. Before running RM-MANOVA, a correlation-matrix analysis was carried out to ascertain the degree of correlation between each pair of dependent variables. We found that AWT and SE were highly and negatively correlated (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.82 in both the pretest and posttest conditions) and AWT and MAS were highly and positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.81 and r = 0.85 in the pretest and posttest conditions, respectively). In order to avoid multicollinearity, the offending variable AWT was removed from RM-MANOVA and was subjected to a mixed ANOVA characterized by one within-subjects factor (time, with 2 levels: pretest and posttest) and one between-subjects factor (group, with 2 levels: intervention and control). The purpose of the 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA was to establish whether AWT differed between the 2 groups over time and whether there was an interaction between group and time. The set of the other 4 dependent variables (AST, SE, MAS, and MFI) was subjected to RM-MANOVA (within-subjects factor: time; between-subjects factor: group). RM-MANOVA provided both a multivariate effect and a set of univariate effects. The multivariate effect quantified the overall impact that group, time, and their interaction had on sleep behavior (described by that linear combination of the dependent variables providing the best separation between the groups and the time points). The univariate effects quantified how much the mean value of each dependent variable differed across groups and time points. Within each univariate effect, the interaction between group and time was also evaluated. The presence of a significant interaction indicated that the modality of change of the sleep parameter over time (from the pretest to the posttest) depended on the group. When the univariate analysis showed a significant interaction, the mean of the dependent variable was compared across time points by performing 2 paired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests, one for the control group and one for the intervention group. In each case, cutoff levels for statistical significance were adjusted according to Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction to account for multiple comparisons (cutoff = 0.05/2 = 0.025).</p></sec><sec id="section19-1534735416651719"><title>Rhythmometric Analysis of Activity</title><p>To evaluate the activity-level circadian rhythm, we analyzed the activity data using single cosinor method.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Hinging on the least-squares method, the single cosinor method identifies and evaluates the cosine mathematical function that best fits the data as a function of time.

MESOR (Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm) is a rhythm-adjusted mean that approximates the arithmetical mean of the data for a 24-hour period, and amplitude is the measure of one half of extent of the rhythmic variation in a cycle. Acrophase indicates, with its 95% confidence limits (CL), the time interval within which the highest values of activity are expected. The 3 parameters are usually indicated with the relevant 95% confidence intervals. Each parameter was evaluated twice (pretest and posttest) in both groups (intervention and control). The rhythmometric parameters of activity levels (MESOR, Amplitude, and Acrophase) were then processed with the average of population mean cosinor. This method, applied to the rhythmometric parameters of each subject&#x02019;s circadian variables, evaluates the rhythmometric characteristics of the activity levels of the population and provides a significant <italic>P</italic> value (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) when a circadian rhythm is present.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The rhythmometric analysis was carried out with <italic>Time Series Analysis-Seriel Cosinor 6.0</italic> by Expert Soft Technologie.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the rhythmometric parameters (MESOR, Amplitude, and Acrophase) followed the same rationale outlined above for the sleep parameters.

In order to avoid multicollinearity, MESOR was removed from RM-MANOVA and was subjected to a mixed ANOVA.

While in most of the previous studies sleep disturbances in women with BC were measured by using questionnaires, in the present study we have used actigraphic monitoring to evaluate sleep patterns at baseline and at the end of 3 months of PA program. The actigraph-based monitoring is certainly a more objective method in order to evaluate the effect of the exercise intervention on sleep scores.</p><p>Under baseline conditions, IG and CG patients showed virtually superimposable sleep behaviors with comparable actigraphy-based sleep parameters. After 3 months, IG and CG patients showed differential changes in sleep behavior, as documented by the results of the RM-MANOVA (applied to parameters AST, SE, MAS, MFI) and by the results of the parametric univariate analysis (applied to parameter AWT) and nonparametric univariate analysis (applied to parameters SL and IT). While CG patients showed a generalized deterioration of sleep behavior, IG patients showed a more stable pattern. In the CG group, all of the 7 sleep parameters displayed significant changes from PRE to POST that could be interpreted as a deterioration of sleep quality, since it was seen that the 3 Restful Sleep Parameters (SE, AST, IT) decreased and the 4 Sleep Fragmentation Parameters (AWT, SL, MAS, MFI) increased. In contrast, in the IG group, 5 out of 7 sleep parameters (SE, IT, AWT, SL, MAS) measured at the end of the PA program showed no changes with respect to the baseline assessment. Of note is that the 2 parameters (AST and MFI) whose patterns of change were not significantly different in the 2 groups across the 2 time points showed a less pronounced change in the IG than in the CG (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534735416651719">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735416651719">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Payne et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> who evaluated the efficacy of a prescribed home-based walking intervention on sleep disturbances by actigraphy, found significant differences between an exercise group and usual care group in Actual Wake Time and Actual Sleep Time. Less movement during sleep also was noted in the exercise group, suggesting that a walking exercise intervention improves sleep in women receiving hormonal treatment for BC, although the authors did not find significant modification of SE, perhaps due to the small sample size and subsequent limited power. Instead, in our study the sample is twice as big compared to the study of Payne and colleagues.</p><p>In this study we decided not to include subjective sleep evaluations because the questionnaires usually refer to a longer period of nocturnal rest (eg, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a 19-item self-report scale that measures sleep quality over the past month),<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and we preferred to analyze only 1 week with the actigraphs to be more accurate and objective, especially when evaluating the effects of the aerobic PA in the IG. The marked worsening in sleep parameters of CG patients was unexpected and the reasons for this outcome are unclear. It stands to reason that this may be due to seasonal environmental modifications, possibly interacting with the underlying disease of these women. However, since a healthy control group of the same sex and age was not included in our study, the individual contribution of the above-mentioned factors cannot be elucidated from our data.</p><p>No clinical or pathological modification occurred in CG that could justify the sleep worsening during the trial, since all CG women maintained good health without pathological BC complications. In the following, we will limit ourselves to speculate about the likely environmental factors that, based on the existing literature, might have affected the sleep of the 2 groups. Sleep modifications could be related to the day length, seasonal adaptation, and the Daylight Saving Time (DST) transition. It is well known that seasonal changes in morning light and especially sunrise times<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> can affect sleep behavior. Specifically, in a study carried out in the European population, Kantermann et al<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> found seasonal fluctuations in sleep duration, with about 20 minutes less sleep in summer than in winter. In our study, we carried out the first sleep monitoring (the baseline condition) in the last week of February and the second monitoring (the final condition) in the first week of June, that is, close to the transition from spring to summer. Interestingly, from February to June, the AST in the CG decreased of about 28 minutes, a figure consistent with the findings of Kantermann and coworkers.</p><p>It is also well documented that seasonal variations in ambient temperature can influence the circadian rhythm and sleep quality. For instance, Haskell et al<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> suggested that the wakefulness and the worsening of sleep are typical effects of heat exposure conditions. Some other studies<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="bibr44-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr45-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> have pointed out that poor sleep and fatigue are associated with the increase of ambient temperature in hot seasons. In our study, the mean ambient temperature in Milan changed from 7.1&#x000b0;C in February to 22.6&#x000b0;C in June 2014 (source: Meteorological Weather Forecast, Italian Military Aviation). Such a marked increase in ambient temperature might have contributed to the sleep deterioration observed in the CG.</p><p>The seasonal and DST transition are additional factors that might have played a role in the sleep deterioration observed in the CG. The DST transition occurred on the last Sunday of March and produced an abrupt increase in the available daylight in the evening. Disrupted night-sleep is one of the main DST consequences. Several studies<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> have shown that the spring transition can compromise sleep by reducing both sleep duration and sleep efficiency. For instance, Kantermann et al<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> reported that the spring transition induces, in healthy subjects, a reduction of sleep duration for 8 consecutive weeks following the transition. In our study, the second sleep monitoring was carried out in the first week of June, and thus slightly beyond the interval investigated by Kantermann and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Although it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that the second sleep monitoring was influenced by the seasonal change and the DST transition, this only remains a matter of speculation. Another consideration is that sleep behavior<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and DST adaptation<sup><xref rid="bibr48-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> are chronotype specific. Allebrandt et al<sup><xref rid="bibr48-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> showed that the evening-types have a shorter sleep during the DST transition. It would have been interesting to evaluate the CG sleep worsening also in relation to the chronotypes, but we did not assess the circadian typology of the subjects.</p><p>All in all, we purport that the CG group experienced a difficult adjustment to the above-mentioned environmental changes, leading to a deterioration of sleep parameters. Since the IG patients were exposed to the same disruption as the CG patients, one reasonable explanation for the substantial stability of their sleep behavior is that the PA program counteracted the worsening effect of the environmental and seasonal factors.</p><p>It is worth making some specific comments about the changes of parameter SE since it is probably the most widely used parameter to summarize the sleep quality of an individual. In CG patients, SE decreased from 84.6% to 80.7%. In contrast, in IG patients SE moved from 84.4% to 86.4%. Since SE = 85% is considered the clinical cutoff for clinically significant sleep disruption,<sup><xref rid="bibr49-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> these results seem to suggest that IG patients were able to maintain their SE just above the cutoff, whereas CG patients exhibited almost a 5% drop of SE below the cutoff. It is worth emphasizing that BC women having SE &#x0003e; 85% have been shown to have lower mortality<sup><xref rid="bibr50-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and that sleep quality is positively related to quality of life in cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> If, however, we make a comparison with sleep parameters proposed by Natale and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bibr51-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> who fixed the cutoff value for sleep efficiency (low sensitivity) at 87%, neither the IG nor the CG achieve a good sleep quality.</p><p>Thus, the ability of PA to preserve SE warrants further investigation because this ability may have some potential in prolonging life and improving well-being of BC survivors.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Referring to activity-level circadian rhythm, we could observe a substantially stability in the circadian rhythm parameters; MESOR and Acrophase were the same in the 2 groups and remained unchanged across time.</p><p>Taking into consideration the anthropometric and body composition parameters, we observed changes in both the CG and IG. At baseline, all women had similar parameters, so they started to join the project with the same physical characteristics. After 3 months IG decreased significantly the percentage of fat mass and tended to increase the lean mass but not significantly. Therefore, the improvement of these parameters confirms, as reported in the literature,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1534735416651719" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> that PA program is able to modify risk factors related to BC prognosis.</p><p>These results in the IG are due to the PA program, and we hypothesized that the improvements for the CG in BMI and body weight is partly due to the diet that the women are following. In fact, women included in this study were extracted from the group of a dietary intervention trial (DIANA-5), so some positive changes could be influenced by the effect of diet and by the baseline recommendation to be physically active; this clearly appears in CG for the positive changes of anthropometric parameters. After 3 months neither IG nor CG modified any motion-level parameter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section27-1534735416651719"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study suggest that aerobic PA has a protective effect against factors promoting sleep disruption.
