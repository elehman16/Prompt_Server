Infiltration of the surgical site was done prior to closure. Primary outcome measure was the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-SF) assessed prior to surgery and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 54, 60 and 72&#x000a0;h following surgery by trained individuals.

Clinical evidence in dogs indicates that multimodal analgesia provides the most effective relief from postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One of the most effective means of preventing the transduction and transmission of nociceptive signals is through the use of local anesthetics. Indeed, it is the authors&#x02019; opinion that the only currently available analgesics that can completely block perioperative pain are the local anesthetics. Despite their potential efficacy, the relief provided by currently available local anesthetics is of limited duration, and this may be one factor contributing to the currently relatively low use of local anesthetics in small animal practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bupivacaine has the longest reported activity, potentially providing analgesia for as long as 6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, currently the only method in veterinary medicine to extend the action of bupivacaine beyond this involves using a wound catheter, and instilling bupivacaine approximately every 6&#x000a0;h into the wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In 2011 the FDA approved an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine, DepoFoam&#x000ae; bupivacaine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> for use as a single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to effect postsurgical analgesia in human surgical patients. The DepoFoam technology used in this product consists of multivesicular liposomes encapsulating aqueous bupivacaine. The liposomes are microscopic structures made of nonconcentric lipid bilayers designed such that bupivacaine is gradually released from vesicles over 96&#x000a0;h as the lipid bilayers break down. The lipids making up the bilayer structures consist of phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, and importantly do not contain lecithin which has been associated with tissue necrosis and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension (Depofoam bupivacaine) has been extensively studied in dogs as part of the development for human use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, known as AT-003<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> is currently being investigated for use in veterinary patients. In a preliminary laboratory study to assess the analgesic properties of AT-003 following tissue infiltration around the site of stifle arthrotomy in beagle dogs, a dose of 5.3&#x000a0;mg/kg was determined to provide adequate analgesia for at least 24&#x000a0;h post-surgery (unpublished data). The current report describes a pilot field study evaluating the post-operative analgesia provided by AT-003 at a dose of up to 5.3&#x000a0;mg/kg administered by tissue infiltration just prior to closure following cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) surgery in client-owned dogs, using subjective, in-clinic assessments of pain.</p><p>We hypothesized that 5.3&#x000a0;mg/kg of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension would provide clinically effective analgesia, as measured using subjective clinical assessment, over a 72-h period following stifle surgery in dogs, when compared to a saline placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p>Three (3) investigative sites screened and enrolled cases.

The odds of success (in terms of not needing rescue) were dramatically greater in the AT-003 group than the placebo group. It is possible that some dogs may have been inappropriately designated as comfortable when in fact pain was present, potentially due to the carry-over effects of the acepromazine sedation in the early postoperative period, or due to a lack of sensitivity of the pain assessment tool. However, in these respects, both groups should have been equally affected, making the comparison valid.</p><p>Pain is difficult to measure, and although the assessment tool used in the present study has been widely used, it has never undergone criterion validation. However, one measure of the success in measuring pain in placebo-controlled studies is the rescue rate in the placebo group. In the current study, it was 77&#x000a0;% within 24&#x000a0;h, and 91&#x000a0;% over the 72&#x000a0;h of the study, suggesting inadequate pain relief was being detected, and giving one further confidence that AT-003 provided clinically measurable pain relief. If one assumes surgery is associated with pain, then the lack of rescue of 2/22 dogs in the placebo group would be considered a failure of the assessment system. However, the approach to assessment and rescue in our study appears to have been comparatively successful when looked at other published studies. In a study of dogs undergoing cruciate surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], only 11&#x000a0;% (1 of 9 dogs) was rescued in the 24&#x000a0;h following surgery. In a study of dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], only 9 of 16 dogs were rescued over a 72-h period postoperatively. The lack of intra-operative analgesia provision (beyond preoperative hydromorphone, which all dogs received) was very deliberate due to how difficult pain is to measure. Given how insensitive our current assessment tools are, the more background treatments that are administered, the more difficult it becomes to assess whether a novel analgesic provides any benefit. Future work, hopefully with more sensitive, and ideally objective, outcome assessments, could evaluate the effect size of this product versus other treatments.</p><p>There are few data as to how long post-surgical pain persists in animals, and this time period will vary with the type of surgical procedure performed. The recommended time period for administration of analgesics post-operatively varies from days to weeks, depending on the surgery performed, but expert opinion emphasizes the first 72&#x000a0;h following surgery as a critical time period when analgesics should be administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Post-surgical pain can generally be well controlled while an animal is hospitalized using injectable opioids, ketamine, cyclooxygenase inhibiting NSAIDs and local anesthetics. However, with most veterinary patients being discharged from the veterinary hospital the same day, or within 24&#x000a0;h following surgery, there is a need to bridge between analgesics provided in the hospital and effective pain relief in the home environment. Currently in the United States, only oral cyclooxygenase inhibiting NSAIDs and transdermal fentanyl liquid<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> have been approved for post-surgical analgesia in dogs. Beyond these options, there are unapproved fentanyl patches manufactured for human use, which have been suggested to be efficacious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and tramadol is widely used, despite little evidence of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Overall, there is a clear unmet need for effective analgesic products that can be administered in the clinic, and provide pain relief for the crucial first few days following surgery in the home environment. This pilot study suggests that bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension may directly address this unmet need, providing up to 72&#x000a0;h of analgesia. Though statistically greater than placebo, not all of the AT-003 dogs were successes out to 72&#x000a0;h. In this study, surgeons were not instructed to infiltrate around the anchor points of the suture material. In future studies, infiltration into all the tissue layers as well as around the anchor points for suture or around implants will be performed. Bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension will need to be administered as part of a multimodal approach as the anesthetic wears off, and indeed, this is consistent with the current recommendations for the treatment of postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The prolonged duration of continuous action may also prevent episodes of breakthrough pain.</p><p>The current study was a pilot study, performed in dogs undergoing a single type of surgery, lateral retinacular suture placement for cruciate insufficiency. As such, the generalizability of these results to the larger population of dogs undergoing a variety of orthopedic surgeries and other surgical procedures is unknown. However, given the demonstrated efficacy in human clinical studies in both orthopedic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and soft tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] surgery, it is highly likely that AT-003 will prove efficacious in dogs undergoing a wide variety of surgical procedures.</p><p>The current study employed direct injection of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension into the surgical wound, and this may raise concerns about wound healing and wound infection. While there is some evidence that local anesthetics alter the cellular events of early tissue healing, there does not appear to be a clinically significant impact on wound healing or mechanical wound strength in preclinical animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or humans. Infection rates following continuous local anesthetic installation into wounds found that reported wound infection rates were similar between active (0.7&#x000a0;%) and control groups (1.2&#x000a0;%) in humans undergoing surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the present study, no wound related adverse effects were seen, which mirrors the extensive pre-clinical work in dogs that has been performed with this product. In a dog model of inguinal hernia repair, bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension was infiltrated into the surgical site at doses ranging from 9 to 25&#x000a0;mg/kg and a mild granulomatous inflammatory response was seen histologically, that had not resolved by 2&#x000a0;weeks following infiltration, but was not considered indicative of any adverse effect on wound healing and the wound healing findings were similar to control (saline or bupivacaine HCL) treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the present study, one dog was found to have bradycardia 4&#x000a0;h following administration of AT-003. In previous work, repeated doses of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension were administered to dogs and the dogs evaluated for cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Doses of 9, 18 and 30&#x000a0;mg/kg bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, 9&#x000a0;mg/kg bupivacaine HCl, or a volume-equivalent dose of saline, were administered into the subcutaneous tissue over the scapulae twice weekly for 4&#x000a0;weeks. No clinical signs consistent with central nervous system toxicity were seen and no electrocardiogram abnormalities were detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Dilution in this study was allowed based on the human experience and volumes used in previous canine knee surgery studies. Dilution does not impact efficacy in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and that appeared to be the case in this study as well. Most surgeons administered the drug in the undiluted state. The one surgeon who did dilute did so such that the total volume was divisible by four, facilitating a 25, 50 and 25&#x000a0;% tissue infiltration distribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Further work is indicated to develop this product for clinical use.

Both AT-003 and saline were injected directly into tissues, using a moving needle technique.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study Protocol Outline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12917_2016_798_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>All dogs underwent the lateral retinacular suture procedure, including stifle arthrotomy. The primary outcome measure was the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-SF). Assessments were performed prior to premedication/surgery following a 2-h acclimation period, and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 54, 60 and 72&#x000a0;h following surgery by veterinarians and veterinary technicians trained on the use of the CMPS-SF. After the CMPS-SF assessment was completed, a Surgical Site Manipulation Score (secondary outcome measure) was assessed by standardized manipulation of the stifle joint that had undergone surgery (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Dogs were administered rescue analgesia (choice of rescue was at the discretion of the veterinarian) if the CMPS-SF score was greater than 8 or if the assessors felt additional analgesia was needed. Following either of these, dogs were removed from the study. Everyone involved in the assessments was trained in the use of the assessment tools through explanation and discussion of the tools during a single &#x02018;classroom&#x02019; style training session run by the Contract Research Organization, and the document describing the definitions of expressions used in the CMPS-SF. All assessors had prior experience of using the CMPS-SF in clinical studies. No more than 3 assessors were permitted to do the assessments on any one dog. Different sites were not calibrated on the use of the CMPS-SF, and nor were any measures put in place to confirm consistency of scoring.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Surgical Site Manipulation scoring system.

No specific guidance on what to look for in the clinical observations was given; the physical examination was a standard physical examination covering evaluation of all body systems. Owners were also called within 4&#x02013;7 days following surgery to capture any adverse events that occurred following discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Anesthetic protocol</title><p>Acepromazine (0.05&#x000a0;mg/kg) was administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) with a maximum total dose of 3.0&#x000a0;mg regardless of body weight. The doses of acepromazine used in the study were based on our experience with the drug. At least 15&#x000a0;min after acepromazine administration, hydromorphone (0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg) was administered IV. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, and maintained on isoflurane carried in oxygen, delivered via an endotracheal tube and a rebreathing circuit. Additional local/regional anesthesia (epidural, nerve block, intra-articular etc.) was not permitted, nor were any other analgesics. Fluids were administered intravenously during anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomization to treatment groups</title><p>Dogs were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups and treated post-CCL surgery with AT-003 (5.3&#x000a0;mg/kg, equivalent to 0.4&#x000a0;mL/kg) or saline (1.0&#x000a0;mL/kg). Surgeons were allowed to dilute AT-003 up to 15 times, if needed, in order to cover the surgical area, with a recommended volume of 0.4&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mL/kg based on previous studies. Randomization was performed using the Prelude Dynamics VISION&#x02122; electronic data capture (EDC) system. The VISION randomization framework generated each random treatment from a pre-computed table of treatments for each site. The randomization calculation maintained equal size groups per site and was calculated based on the current patient population. Subjects were randomized in blocks of two, stratified by site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Masking procedures</title><p>One individual at each site was designated the Dispenser, and they documented the assignment of dogs to treatment group and kept the related documentation in a secure site, away from all other personnel. The Dispenser and the veterinarian performing the surgery had knowledge of which treatment group each dog was assigned. Blinded personnel were not given access to the treatment or randomization forms. The veterinarian or trained technician performing the assessments, sponsor, statistician and any other personnel involved in clinical evaluations and observations remained blinded to treatment during the study and until data base lock. The Owners were also blinded to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Tissue infiltration procedure</title><p>AT-003 or saline was injected slowly into the tissues using a 1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;in. long needle, using a &#x02018;moving needle technique&#x02019;, in which the needle is inserted to near the hub and the material is injected as the needle is pulled out. The needle is inserted at varying angles depending on how the tissue is best approached in order to deposit the injectate within the tissues. In general, this means inserting the needle approximately parallel to the surface of the skin. The injections are repeated to create an area of infiltrated tissue around the whole wound, and at all levels of the wound. Approximately 25, 50 and 25&#x000a0;% of the AT-003 or saline was injected into the tissues around the joint capsule, the fascial tissue, and the sub-cuticular tissue, respectfully. The injections were performed such that the whole wound, at all levels, was infiltrated with AT-003 or saline. Dilution of AT-003 with normal saline was permitted and was utilized for 12 of the AT-003 treated dogs, all at one site, with a maximal dilution of 1:1 AT-003 to saline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (Short Form) (CMPS-SF), and secondary outcome measures were a Surgical Site Manipulation Score and an evaluation of adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>CMPS-SF</title><p>The Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale-Short Form (CMPS-SF), (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.newmetrica.com/acute-pain-measurement/download-short-form-painquestionnaire-for-dogs/">http://www.newmetrica.com/acute-pain-measurement/download-short-form-painquestionnaire-for-dogs/</ext-link>) is a subjective clinical metrology instrument used by animal caretakers to evaluate perioperative pain in a practice setting that was developed at the University of Glasgow, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
