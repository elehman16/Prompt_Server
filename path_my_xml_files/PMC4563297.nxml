pain and stability of patients with plantar fasciitis. [Subjects] The subjects were 30
patients with plantar fasciitis who were divided into two groups: a Low-Dye taping group
(LTG, n=15) and a conservative treatment group (CTG, n=15). [Methods] The treatments were
performed three times a week for six weeks in both groups. A visual analog scale (VAS) was
used to evaluate the pain and stability of patients with plantar fasciitis, and the
transfer area of the center of gravity (TAOCOG) was measured to evaluate stability using a
BioRescue device. [Results] In the within-group comparison of the VAS, the LTG and CTG
values significantly decreased. In the post-test between-group comparison, the VAS pain
decreased more significantly in LTG than in CTG. In the within-group comparison of the
TAOCOG, the LTG value significantly increased. In the post-test between-group comparison,
the TAOCOG value increased more significantly than in LTG than in CTG. [Conclusion]
Utilizing Low-Dye taping for patients with plantar fasciitis appears to be an effective
intervention method for reducing pain and enhancing stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Plantar fasciitis</kwd><kwd>Low-Dye taping</kwd><kwd>Stability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The number of patients with plantar fasciitis has increased by approximately three times
over the last five years, due to the hard roads found in urban areas, the use of high-heeled
shoes, occupational environments, and increasing numbers of obese individuals. Plantar
fasciitis, which is also called heel pain syndrome, widely covers painful diseases of the
feet and is mainly observed among middle-aged patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the causes of plantar fasciitis, repetitive excessive tensile stress on the
plantar fascia causes fibrosis, inflammatory change, and degenerative changes, which can
subsequently develop into plantar fasciitis. It can also occur with the sudden initiation of
intensive exercise. Known factors that cause plantar fascia injuries include flatfoot,
talipes cavus, taut Achilles tendons, and factors that decrease the impact force of the
foot<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Conservative treatment methods for plantar fasciitis include frames, heel cushions, Botox
injections, plantar heel cushions, inner sole treatments, topical steroid injections, and
non-steroid anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these treatment methods have
limitations: they cannot correct the posture of the feet or modify plantar pressure
according to patients&#x02019; conditions. Low-Dye (LD) taping is a conservative treatment method
for patients with plantar fasciitis. It was first developed by Dr. Ralph Dye and is now
being used for treating patients with plantar fasciitis who have excessive pronation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The principle behind LD taping is to fix
the subtalar joint axis, which consequently reduces excessive pronation correcting patients&#x02019;
foot disorders.</p><p>Radford et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients
with plantar fasciitis experienced decreased pain in the first step taken after LD taping.
Most previous studies have either investigated the instant effects of semi-pronation taping,
such as 10&#x02013;20 minutes after the application, or measured the effects of the tape-applied to
the foot in comparison with bare foot<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast to these studies assessing the
immediate effects, the present study examined the long-term effects of LD taping on the pain
and stability of patients with plantar fasciitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Among those who visited the foot clinic of Hospital B located in Daegu, Korea, patients who
were diagnosed by an orthopedist with plantar fasciitis in one foot were selected as
research subjects for this study. Those with inflammatory arthritis, preceding trauma,
neurological anomalies, surgical history of the lower limbs, hyper-sensitive reactions to
taping therapy, or a disease that causes gait disturbances were excluded from the
sample.</p><p>The research subjects were divided into two groups: a Low-Dye taping group (LTG, n=15) with
an average age of 35.4&#x000b1;5.03&#x02005;years, height of 169.1&#x000b1;5.7&#x02005;cm, and weight of 64.8&#x000b1;6.0&#x02005;kg, and a
conservative treatment group (CTG, n=15) with an average age of 35.9&#x000b1;4.0&#x02005;years, height of
170.3&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;cm, and weight of 64.2&#x000b1;5.4&#x02005;kg. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the
Institutional Review Board of Youngdong University. All subjects read and voluntarily signed
consent forms in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>LTG received conservative treatment using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS, 15 minutes) and infra-red (5 minutes) in 30-minute sessions, after which modified
Low-Dye (LD) tape was applied. To reduce pain that occurred during the first step out of bed
in the morning or to decrease the impact felt by the heel during the stance phase of
walking, regular LD taping was modified so that the tape could replace the fat pad covering
the heel and fat tissue. To support the internal medial arch, LD taping was applied inward
from the outside 3&#x02013;5 times depending on the foot size by slightly overlapping the tape each
time. The head part of the metatarsus was wrapped with tape that crossed the sole once. Tape
was applied from the external part of the foot toward the internal side along the sidelines.
To support the internal longitudinal arch, tape was applied 3&#x02013;5 times starting inward from
the outside sole with a slight overlap. Then, centered at the plantar heel, the tape covered
the foot from the external lateral side and then returned to the center of the sole. The
tape wrapped the foot again starting from the inner center of the sole toward the outside
and then returning back to the center of the sole. This was repeated four times. To prevent
the central tape from detaching, the tape was used to cross the sole twice. Wearing time was
a minimum of 12 hours. The CTG received TENS (15 minutes) and infra-red (5 minutes) in
30-minute sessions. Alternative stimulation with low frequency (3 pps) and high intensity
(100 pps) using TENS was applied. Infra-red was 700&#x02013;2,000&#x02005;nm, 10&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>; it was
applied to the area of the feet where the patient complained of pain. Both groups received
these treatments three times per week for six weeks.</p><p>To evaluate the intensity of the pain, a visual analog scale (VAS) was used. To examine
stability, the transfer area of the center of gravity (TAOCOG) was measured using a
BioRescue device (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, France). The BioRescue device has 1,600 pressure sensors
attached to a baropodometric platform. It can assess weight loading, body movement, and
left-right balance of the lower limbs using the pressure sensors under both feet. Instead of
assessing the extent of the movement by moving the trunk of the body, the TAOCOG measures
the maximum weight capable of being moved in a maximal range when an individual moves the
body using the ankles and without losing balance.</p><p>For the statistical analysis of the results, the pain and stability of patients with
plantar fasciitis were examined using the paired and independent sample t-tests within-group
comparisons and between-group comparisons, respectively. SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used for
statistical analyses in this study with a significance level, &#x003b1;, of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The within-group comparison of the VAS showed the LTG and CTG values significantly

six weeks affected their pain and stability.</p><p>Smith et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that inelastic
anti-pronation taping positively affects the midfoot and hindfoot because it buttresses the
interior. O&#x02019;Sullivan et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> measured
changes in ankle pronation and ankle supination in the stance phase of gait after applying
LD taping and observed significant differences. Franettovich et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> examined changes in leg joint ankles and reported
significant increases in the flexion angle and the adduction of the ankle joints after
applying LD taping.</p><p>In the present study, the within-group comparison of the VAS showed the LTG and CTG values
significantly decreased, and the LTG value showed a more significant decrease than the CTG
value according to the post-test between-group comparison. Considering that the research
subjects were patients who experienced severe pain from plantar fasciitis, the results
indicate that modified LD taping can be an effective treatment for those who complain of
pain due to plantar fasciitis. Radford et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the short-term application of both LD taping and
ultrasonic waves for patients with plantar fasciitis was effective at reducing pain. These
results are consistent with those of the present study. However, since LD taping was only
applied for a short period of time in that previous study, no differences in foot correction
or function were observed after its application. Moreover, it can be speculated that the
application of modified LD taping heightened the fat pad of the plantar heel, which is a
major site of complaint in plantar fasciitis. This was effective at reducing pain in the
heel, similar to our present study. Hence, the present study&#x02019;s results indicate that
conducting conservative physiotherapy and modified LD taping for patients with plantar
fasciitis elicits greater amelioration of plantar fasciitis pain than performing
conservative physiotherapy alone.</p><p>Moreover, the within-group comparison of the TAOCOG showed the LTG value significantly
increased, and the post-test between-group comparison showed the LTG value increased more
significantly than the CTG value. Before the application of the modified LD taping, weight
support and the stability of the affected side of the foot were measured as being low due to
pain and foot instability. It appears that the stability of the feet increased due to pain
reduction, foot correction, and desirable weight distribution after applying the modified LD
taping. Radford et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
height of the navicular tuberosity immediately increased after the application of LD taping.
Kim et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that feet with
excessive pronation, which can cause plantar fasciitis, showed more weight distribution
toward the interior side. The application of LD taping over six weeks resulted in a greater
spread of weight distribution on the inner sole along with an increase in navicular height.
Moreover, Won<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that an
inelastic taping aid during basketball play was effective at enhancing the range of motion,
proprioceptive sense, and functional performance of a basketball player who had functional
ankle instability. Hence, this present study&#x02019;s results imply that applying modified LD
taping is more effective for reducing foot pain, correcting weight distribution, and
improving stability due to foot correction than performing conservative physiotherapy only.
Treatment by applying modified LD taping can cause long-term effects as well as temporary
relief from symptoms before using a foot frame for foot correction and pain reduction.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group>: The comparison of the kinetic variables between the normal people and
