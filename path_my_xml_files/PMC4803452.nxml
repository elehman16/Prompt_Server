Here, we present results from quality-of-life (QoL) and performance status (PS) analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of 0/1 were randomized to receive ramucirumab (8 mg/kg i.v.) or placebo on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle, with both arms receiving paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed with the QoL/health status questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D at baseline and 6-week intervals. PS was assessed at baseline and day 1 of every cycle. Time to deterioration (TtD) in each QLQ-C30 scale was defined as randomization to first worsening of &#x02265;10 points (on 100-point scale) and TtD in PS was defined as first worsening to &#x02265;2. Hazard ratios (HRs) for treatment effect were estimated using stratified Cox proportional hazards models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 665 patients randomized, 650 (98%) provided baseline QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D data, and 560 (84%) also provided data from &#x02265;1 postbaseline time point. Baseline scores for both instruments were similar between arms. Of the 15 QLQ-C30 scales, 14 had HR &#x0003c; 1, indicating similar or longer TtD in QoL for ramucirumab + paclitaxel. Treatment with ramucirumab + paclitaxel was also associated with a delay in TtD in PS to &#x02265;2 (HR = 0.798, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0941). Alternate definitions of PS deterioration yielded similar results: PS &#x02265; 3 (HR = 0.656, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0508), deterioration by &#x02265;1 PS level (HR = 0.802, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0444), and deterioration by &#x02265;2 PS levels (HR = 0.608, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0063).

The associated 2012 mortality rate of 1.1 million [<xref rid="MDV625C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reflects the frequent late-stage detection and incurability of metastatic disease. While the majority of patients progress within 6 months following first-line therapy [<xref rid="MDV625C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], many remain candidates for second-line treatment. Recent open-label phase III studies comparing single-agent, second-line taxanes or irinotecan versus best supportive care (BSC) have demonstrated incremental improvement in survival for patients with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer [<xref rid="MDV625C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV625C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Single-agent ramucirumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), improved median survival for patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer versus BSC in the REGARD trial [<xref rid="MDV625C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ramucirumab prevents VEGF ligand binding to the VEGFR-2 and subsequent receptor-mediated pathway activation in endothelial cells, thus interfering with tumor-required angiogenesis, slowing its growth [<xref rid="MDV625C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The RAINBOW trial [<xref rid="MDV625C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed the addition of ramucirumab to second-line paclitaxel therapy extended median survival of advanced gastric/GEJ cancer patients by 2.3 months [<xref rid="MDV625C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged by 1.5 months, and tumor response rate and disease control rate were likewise improved.</p><p>Since advanced gastric/GEJ cancer is an incurable condition, treatments aim to not just prolong survival, but to maintain patients' quality of life (QoL). Hence, the survival benefit observed in RAINBOW should also be considered along with the QoL of these patients treated with ramucirumab + paclitaxel.</p><p>While some data exist on QoL in the first-line setting [<xref rid="MDV625C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="MDV625C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], QoL data associated with the second-line treatment are sparse. Docetaxel second-line therapy versus BSC was shown to maintain global QoL and to reduce some symptoms [<xref rid="MDV625C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previously reported results for the RAINBOW study indicated QoL was maintained during ramucirumab + paclitaxel treatment [<xref rid="MDV625C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additional RAINBOW analyses are presented here, detailing the impact of second-line ramucirumab + paclitaxel treatment on the QoL of advanced gastric/GEJ cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdv625_s2"><title>methods</title><sec id="mdv625_s2a"><title>study design</title><p>The design of the global, randomized, double-blind phase III RAINBOW trial has been previously published [<xref rid="MDV625C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is summarized in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv625/-/DC1">supplement, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="mdv625_s2b"><title>patient-reported outcomes and performance status assessment</title><p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0) [<xref rid="MDV625C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the EuroQol five dimensions health status questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) [<xref rid="MDV625C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-administered, cancer-specific QoL instrument that assesses global health status, functioning, symptoms, and toxicities. The EQ-5D is a nonspecific and standardized instrument for self-reported health status. PROs were evaluated at baseline, every 6 weeks (&#x000b1;3 days) following the first dose of study therapy until radiographic documentation of progressive disease, and at the end-of-therapy visit. The PRO instruments were to be completed at the beginning of the clinic visit, before any extensive contact with investigative staff occurred.</p><p>Before every cycle, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) [<xref rid="MDV625C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="mdv625_s2c"><title>statistical considerations</title><p>All analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population. For both PRO instruments, compliance at each assessment time point was defined as the number of patients who completed the PRO instrument divided by the expected number of patients at that time point; the expected number of patients at any postbaseline visit was equal to the number of patients who were alive and without disease progression.</p><p>The EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument was scored according to EORTC guidelines [<xref rid="MDV625C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], such that all scales reported from 0 to 100, with higher functioning and global scores representing better QoL and higher symptom scores representing greater symptom burden. Prespecified analyses of response and time to deterioration (TtD) were carried out on the QLQ-C30 data. In these analyses, a change of at least 10 points in each of the scales was considered clinically meaningful [<xref rid="MDV625C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, the QLQ-C30 TtD was defined as the time from randomization to the first deterioration of &#x02265;10 points from baseline. If no deterioration was observed, censoring occurred at the date of the last QLQ-C30 assessment. QLQ-C30 TtD was compared between the treatment arms using a log-rank test. The TtD hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model [<xref rid="MDV625C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with assigned treatment and baseline score as covariates. The impact of adjusting for independent baseline factors was also examined, considering those factors previously identified as significant for PFS in the RAINBOW population (gender, weight loss in prior 3 months, number of metastatic sites, and liver metastases) [<xref rid="MDV625C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses using deteriorations of &#x02265;5, 15, and 20 points were also carried out.</p><p>The QLQ-C30 response analysis characterized each postbaseline assessment as Improved or Deteriorated if change was &#x02265;10 points, and Stable if change was &#x0003c;10 points for each of the scales. The proportion of patients in each treatment arm with Improved/Stable scores versus Deteriorated/Off-Study/No Data at each time point was compared using the Fisher's exact test.</p><p>The EQ-5D index scores (calculated based on UK weights) [<xref rid="MDV625C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the visual analog scale (VAS) scores were examined using summary statistics for each assessment time by treatment arm, including change from baseline.</p><p>ECOG PS TtD was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date when ECOG PS score of &#x02265;2 was observed for the first time; censoring occurred at the date of the last ECOG PS assessment if no deterioration was observed. ECOG PS TtD was compared between the treatment arms using a log-rank test and presented using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier graphs. The HR was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Additional analyses were carried out by using different definitions of deterioration and included a change in ECOG PS to &#x02265;3, a change of &#x02265;1 level from baseline, and a change of &#x02265;2 levels from baseline.</p><p>Adjustments for multiplicity were not made in these analyses; however, a level of 0.05 was used as the threshold for presenting results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="mdv625_s3"><title>results</title><p>The global, double-blind, phase III RAINBOW trial enrolled 665 patients: 330 randomized to ramucirumab + paclitaxel and 335 to the placebo + paclitaxel.

While baseline scores for these scales were comparable between the two treatment arms, the patients treated with ramucirumab + paclitaxel demonstrated a similar or longer TtD in the functioning and worsening of symptoms compared with the patients treated with placebo + paclitaxel. The symptoms of constipation and dyspnea, as well as financial difficulties, had an HR close to 1 consistent with their limited relevance in the context of gastric/GEJ cancer, the interventions, and a clinical trial setting. Diarrhea, an adverse event reported with the ramucirumab + paclitaxel combination, was the only QoL symptom with a nonfavorable HR, an observation noted in other clinical trials. Since even low-grade diarrhea may have a negative impact on QoL [<xref rid="MDV625C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], clinicians might well proactively inform patients of symptom management options.</p><p>At all on-therapy assessment time points, a higher percentage of patients in the ramucirumab + paclitaxel arm were classified as Improved/Stable compared with those in the placebo + paclitaxel arm for all QLQ-C30 parameters. Although the ramucirumab + paclitaxel arm generally had a greater percentage of patients classified as &#x02018;Deteriorated&#x02019;, the placebo + paclitaxel arm had a higher percentage of patients in the combined &#x02018;Deteriorated/No data&#x02019; groups. The higher percentage of patients on the placebo arm in this combined grouping is due to the earlier discontinuation of treatment among placebo + paclitaxel arm patients compared with the ramucirumab + paclitaxel arm patients, in most cases due to disease progression. One can argue that those patients who discontinued likely had deteriorated QoL; hence, these discontinued patients without data at a given assessment time point could be considered more like those classified as &#x02018;Deteriorated.&#x02019; Since such assumptions remain debatable in QoL research, and since patient attrition translates into a steady decline in available data, especially in the less-effective arm, QoL response analyses in rapidly progressing cancer patients should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The analysis of TtD in PS corroborates that ramucirumab treatment maintains the health of patients for a longer period. Patients treated with ramucirumab + paclitaxel experienced a delay in TtD of PS over those treated with placebo + paclitaxel. The preservation of patients' functional status is a key goal and may allow for them to receive further treatment and additional benefit.</p><p>The EQ-5D results were consistent with other results in that they indicate that progressive disease has the greatest impact on QoL. However, as expected, this generic tool did not differentiate between treatment arms. Despite the limited usefulness of these data in clinical practice, health state utility data are worthwhile to collect and report for economic evaluations.</p><p>Patients with metastatic gastric/GEJ cancer seek to preserve their QoL during second-line treatment. The QLQ-C30 results presented here demonstrate that the combination of ramucirumab + paclitaxel prolongs survival while maintaining patient QoL, lengthening the TtD of symptoms and functions, and slowing PS deterioration. These robust and detailed QoL data could inform clinical decision making and provide patients with more detailed information about the functional and symptomatic impact of treatment. These results support the recommendation of paclitaxel + ramucirumab for previously treated gastric/GEJ cancer if a taxane is indicated and if there are no ramucirumab contraindications.</p></sec><sec id="mdv625_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Eli Lilly and Company</funding-source> (there is no grant number).
