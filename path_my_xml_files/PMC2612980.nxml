Patwardhan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> has shown

with patching therapy of two to six hours daily doubled the
treatment responder rate to 53%. Compared to this, Brar <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
in their study in older children (&#x0003e; six years) have reported a
substantial improvement in visual outcome in nearly 90% of
the children with full-time occlusion.</p><p>Hence whether part-time occlusion is equally efficacious
as full-time occlusion in older children is still not clear. The
aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of part-time
occlusion vis-&#x000e0;-vis full time occlusion in children 7-12 years
of age with amblyopia.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective study was started in January 2004 and
enrolled 100 unilateral amblyopic (strabismic, anisometropic
or combined type) children in the age group of 7-12 years. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of the institute.
An informed written consent was obtained from the parents
of the participating children. The sample size was calculated
by assuming an acceptable standard error of 0.05 at 95%
confidence level. Baseline testing included measurement of
visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction using atropine, and a
complete orthoptic and ocular examination of both eyes. The
children were corrected for refractive error, if any, for at least
six weeks prior to inclusion in the study.</p><p>Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the amblyopic eye
of 20/30 or less subsequent to the refractive correction for six
weeks was used as a diagnostic criterion for amblyopia. Only
unilateral cases were selected with BCVA of 20/20 in the normal
eye. A difference between the spherical equivalents of the two
eyes exceeding 1.00 diopter (D) or astigmatism exceeding 1.5
D was considered anisometropia while amblyopes who had
constant esotropia or exotropia were classified as strabismic
type. They were randomized into four groups of 25 children
each using simple randomization (computer-generated random
numbers) to receive two hours, four hours, six hours or full-
time occlusion therapy.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the study included unilateral amblyopia
associated with strabismus, anisometropia, or both in children
ranging from 7-12 years of age, having ability to record visual
acuity accurately on Carl Zeiss chart projector (SZP 350). The
above model of Carl Zeiss chart projector projects a single
letter for 20/400 line, two letters each for the 20/200 and 20/160
lines, three letters for the 20/125 line and four letters for each
subsequent line. Children were deemed to have read the line
if they read all letters of 20/400, 20/200, 20/160 and 20/125 lines
and at least three out of four letters for all subsequent lines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
The chart has a regular doubling of the visual angle between
different lines, so a logMAR conversion was done to facilitate
calculation of mean visual acuity and its comparison between
different groups.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included presence of a known cause of
reduced visual acuity, myopia more than a spherical equivalent
of -6.00 D, history of previous amblyopia treatment within one
year of enrolment, prior intraocular surgery and known skin
reaction to patch or bandage adhesive. Dropouts and non-
compliant patients were excluded from final analysis.</p><p>Patients were prescribed patching as per the following
regimes:</p><p>Non-amblyopic eye was patched for limited number of
hours each day; two hours in Group 1, four hours in Group
2 and six hours in Group 3. Patch was applied continuously
during waking hours. In addition to occlusion, the parents
were instructed to have the child spend at least one of the hours
of patching time each day performing near visual activities.
The near visual activity advised was performing their routine
homework. Non-amblyopic eye was patched for all waking
hours or all but one hour in group 4 children for all seven days
a week. Patch could be removed during the night but it was to
be applied first thing in the morning.</p><p>Six-weekly follow-up was done for a minimum period
of 18 weeks. During each follow-up visit, visual acuity was
recorded on the same visual acuity chart projector (Carl
Zeiss SZP 350) by an independent observer who did not have
access to the patient&#x02032;s treatment protocol. Parents were told to
maintain a diary in which the treatment (hours of occlusion and
performance of near activities) received each day was noted.
The diary was reviewed at each follow-up visit.</p><p>The primary outcome was the BCVA in the amblyopic eye at
18 weeks. Amblyopia responders, defined as those who gained
at least two lines of vision between the first and the final visit,
were calculated for each of the four groups. The children were
further subdivided into two subsets of mild-moderate and
severe amblyopia to study the independent effect of occlusion
therapy in each subset. Mild-moderate amblyopia was defined
as a BCVA between 20/30 to 20/80 in the amblyopic eye while
severe amblyopia was defined as BCVA of 20/100 or less in the
amblyopic eye.</p><p>Statistical analysis between pre-treatment and post-
treatment change in acuity was done by paired t-test. The
difference between the two groups in the variance of the change
in amblyopic eye visual acuity produced was analyzed using
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test and unpaired t-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Out of 100 cases, there were 57 cases of anisometropic
amblyopia, 25 cases of strabismic amblyopia and 18 cases of
mixed amblyopia. The group-wise distribution of the three
types of amblyopes is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was
8.9 &#x000b1; 1.7 years in Group 1, 9.5 &#x000b1; 2.1 years in Group 2, 10.0 &#x000b1; 1.8
years in Group 3 and 9.3 &#x000b1; 2.1 years in Group 4. The baseline
BCVA was 0.67 logMAR units (range 20/40 - 20/400) in Group
1, 0.80 logMAR units (range 20/40 - 20/400) in Group 2, 0.68
logMAR units (range 20/30 - 20/400) in Group 3 and 0.76
logMAR units (range 20/30 - 20/400) in Group 4. The four
groups were matched for age (<italic>P</italic>=0.355), distribution of the three
types of amblyopes (<italic>P</italic>=0.3) and pre-treatment BCVA (<italic>P</italic>=0.183).
Post-treatment visual acuity was measured at completion of
18 weeks and was compared with pre-treatment visual acuity
using paired t-test [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The results showed significant
visual improvement in all four groups at the end of the study
period (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Seventy-three (73%) of the total 100 eyes responded to
amblyopia therapy with 11 eyes (44%), 17 eyes (68%), 22 eyes
(88%) and 23 eyes (92%) being amblyopia responders in each
group respectively, with least number of responders in the two
hours group. ANOVA test revealed a statistically significant
difference (<italic>P</italic>=0.002) in visual improvement among the four
groups. On further analysis with unpaired t-test, a significantly
better outcome was seen when visual improvement in Group 2
(four hours occlusion) was compared with Group 1 (two hours
occlusion) (<italic>P</italic>=0.026). Similarly Group 3 (six hours occlusion)
had a better visual outcome compared to Group 1 (two hours
occlusion) (<italic>P</italic>=0.002). Full-time occlusion Group 4 also fared
significantly better compared to the two hours occlusion Group
1 (<italic>P</italic>=0.001). However, the difference was non-significant when
visual outcome in six hours occlusion Group 3 (<italic>P</italic>=0.486) and
full-time occlusion Group 4 (<italic>P</italic>=0.103) was compared with four
hours occlusion Group 2 or when six hours occlusion Group 3
was compared with full-time occlusion Group 4 (<italic>P</italic>=0.274).</p><p>Subset A (mild-moderate amblyopia) included 47 children

the age of the patient at which the treatment was initiated had
a direct bearing on the visual outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Epelbaum
<italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
reported in strabismic amblyopia that the recovery of acuity
of the amblyopic eye was maximum when the occlusion was
initiated before three years of age, the improvement further
decreased as a function of age and was about null by the
time the patient was 12 years of age. Similarly Rutstein <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
reported that the visual acuity improvement is somewhat lesser
in patients older than seven years than in younger patients.</p><p>However, in recent years a large number of studies have
shown a comparable beneficial effect of occlusion therapy in
older children too.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Brar <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> have reported a substantial
improvement in visual acuity with full-time occlusion in
nearly 90% of the children. They showed that visual acuity
could be improved uniformly for strabismic, anisometropic
or a combination of strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia
in older children. The authors observed improvement in
visual acuity in 98.7% of children younger than 12 years and
in 46.2% children older than 12 years at the time of initiation
of occlusion therapy. Patwardhan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> has recently shown that
there is no statistically significant change in the success
rate of treatment of anisometropic amblyopia, even beyond
12 years of age. The present study also included patients
of strabismic and mixed amblyopia in addition to children
with anisometropic amblyopia, who after randomization,
were uniformly distributed in the four groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].
The distribution of amblyopes is important as it can have a
bearing on the final outcome. Most studies report best-to-
worst ranking of anisometropic, strabismic, and combined
amblyopia for visual acuity at initial visit and outcome at the
end of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>A very important factor determining the outcome of
occlusion therapy in these older children could be the patching
compliance. It is obvious that lesser the hours of patching in
a day better the compliance with the treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> Hence the
concept of part-time occlusion holds stronger ground in the
case of older children. Two studies have recently looked into
the role of part-time occlusion in older children. One of these
is a multicentric study by PEDIG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> The study found that
augmenting the optical correction with part-time patching
therapy and atropine penalization doubled the responder
rate (53% vs. 25%) and the response to treatment was seen
regardless of the severity of amblyopia. Hence this study
established the role of part-time occlusion in older children.
A significant difference from our study is that none of the
children in the present study were prescribed atropine in the
dominant eye in addition to the occlusion therapy. The PEDIG
study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> did not compare the effectiveness of varying hours of
part-time occlusion among themselves.</p><p>Recently Lee <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> have also studied the effect of part-time
occlusion in older children (29 eyes) aged 8-12 years. They
reported a beneficial effect of part-time occlusion therapy in
nearly 96% of the eyes. Visual improvement and occlusion
time showed a significantly positive correlation. However, only
two children received less than three hours of daily occlusion
therapy for a limited period of one month. Hence this study
was also limited by the lack of a proper comparative analysis
between full-time occlusion and varying hours of part-time
occlusion in addition to involving a very limited number of
patients.</p><p>We planned and conducted this prospective randomized
study comparing the effect of varying hours (two hours, four
hours and six hours) of part-time occlusion therapy with full-
time occlusion therapy in children aged 7-12 years. We observed
that both full-time patching and part-time patching, even as
little as two hours a day, led to significant improvement in
visual outcome at 18 weeks of treatment. We observed a much
higher responder rate (73%) compared to the PEDIG study
(54%); this could be because in their study a large majority
of patients received either two hours patching (50%) or four
hours patching (41%) while very few (9%) received six hours
patching and none received full-time patching. However, we
distributed the patients equally in four groups of 25 each.
Among children who received two or four hours of patching,
28 of the 50 children (56%) responded to the treatment, a
figure comparative to the PEDIG study. However, in children
who received six hours or full-time occlusion, 45 of the 50
children were treatment responders (90%). The difference was
predominantly due to the fact that, in children with severe
amblyopia, full-time patching and six hours/day patching was
found to have a significantly better outcome when compared
to two hours of patching therapy. While in patients with mild
to moderate amblyopia all treatment protocols produced
comparatively similar outcome. This is similar to observations
of PEDIG in younger children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>The limitations of the study include its smaller sample
size and shorter follow-up. Moreover, it does not address the
issue of maintenance therapy and the recurrence of treated
amblyopia in this age group. Still, the present study suggests
a beneficial effect of part-time occlusion therapy in older
children. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to
address issues of recidivism and extent of improvement with
part-time occlusion in older children.</p><p>Hence it can be concluded that for treatment of mild to
moderate amblyopia, as little as two hours/day of patching
may be adequate in the 7-12 years age group while in severe
amblyopia, six hours and full-time occlusion are more effective
than two hours occlusion therapy in this age group.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attebo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cumming</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Jolly</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Sparkes</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and causes of amblyopia in an adult population</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1998</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>154</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9442792</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flynn</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Cassady</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current trends in amblyopia therapy</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1978</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>428</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">353619</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Von Noorden</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Von Noorden</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Principles of nonsurgical treatment</article-title><source>Binocular vision and ocular motility</source><year>1996</year><edition>5th ed</edition><publisher-loc>St. Louis, Mo</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>503</fpage><lpage>25</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Amblyopia</article-title><source>Surv Ophthalmol</source><year>1995</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>23</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8545799</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hiscox</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Strong</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Minshull</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodruff</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Occlusion for amblyopia: A comprehensive survey of outcome</article-title><source>Eye</source><year>1992</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>300</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1446765</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hug</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Full time occlusion compared to part time occlusion for the
