As a class, compared with VKAs, these agents are at least as efficacious, are associated with a lower risk of major bleeding, have more predictable pharmacodynamics and require less frequent laboratory monitoring in individuals with VTE.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>The individual response to VKAs, such as warfarin, is influenced by demographics, clinical characteristics and genetic factors.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 6&#x02013;9</xref> Genetic factors influencing the response to VKAs include polymorphisms in the vitamin K epoxide reductase (<italic>VKORC1</italic>) and cytochrome P450 2C9 (<italic>CYP2C9</italic>) genes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8&#x02013;10</xref> The <italic>CYP2C9</italic> alleles that are the most associated with increased warfarin sensitivity are more common in individuals of European descent compared with African or Asian descent.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Conversely, the prevalence of the <italic>VKORC1</italic> allele that is associated with greatest increase in warfarin sensitivity is the highest in individuals of Asian descent.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Together, the polymorphisms in these two genes account for up to 50% of the variability in warfarin dose in patients of European descent.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p><p>In a recent subanalysis of the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation&#x02013;Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48&#x000a0;(ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) study, a large double-blind, double-dummy, randomised study comparing edoxaban to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), patients randomised to receive warfarin and classified as sensitive or highly sensitive warfarin responders, based on <italic>CYP2C9</italic> and <italic>VKORC1</italic> genotypes, experienced more warfarin-associated bleeding and spent more time overanticoagulated relative to normal responders.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This effect was observed during the first 90 days of warfarin therapy, but was not present afterwards, suggesting that the effect of genetics on warfarin-induced bleeding risk is strongest during the initiation of therapy when the warfarin dose is still being optimised. These results confirmed that for stroke prevention in patients with AF, compared with warfarin, edoxaban was associated with a greater reduction in bleeding risk in sensitive and highly sensitive responders than in normal responders in the first 90 days. However, it is not known whether similar genetically&#x000a0;based elevated bleeding risks associated with warfarin also exist for patients with VTE when transitioning from heparin to oral anticoagulants.</p><p>Similar to the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, DNA samples were collected in the Hokusai-venous thromboembolism&#x000a0;(Hokusai VTE) trial, allowing for a comparison of clinical outcomes by genotype. The Hokusai VTE trial was a randomised, multinational, double-blind, non-inferiority study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of edoxaban versus warfarin (dosed to an international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0) in patients with VTE initially treated with heparin. The trial demonstrated that, following initial parenteral anticoagulant therapy, edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for the treatment of VTE and the prevention of recurrent VTE and was also associated with significantly fewer bleeding events in patients with VTE.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The present analysis was designed to replicate the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 findings and examine whether the previous results could be extended to patients with VTE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>A detailed description of the study design and patient population of Hokusai VTE (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00986154) has been previously published.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Briefly, Hokusai VTE was a randomised, double-blind trial comparing edoxaban with warfarin in patients with acute, symptomatic VTE (DVT, PE or both). All patients received open-label heparin treatment for at least 5 days. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either edoxaban 60&#x02009;mg once daily or warfarin. The edoxaban dose was halved to 30&#x02009;mg once daily in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 to 50&#x02009;mL/min, a body weight of 60&#x02009;kg or less or who were receiving concurrent treatment with the P-glycoprotein (inhibitors verapamil or quinidine. Warfarin was started concurrently with heparin and the warfarin dose was adjusted to maintain an INR between 2.0 and 3.0. To maintain blinding, sham INR measures were provided to patients randomised to edoxaban. The institutional review board at each participating centre approved the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The Hokusai VTE trial enrolled 8292 patients from 439 centres worldwide. Eligible patients were&#x000a0;&#x02265;18 years of age with diagnosed acute, symptomatic DVT that involved the popliteal, femoral or iliac veins or with acute, symptomatic PE with or without DVT. Patients were excluded from the study if they presented contraindications to heparin or warfarin, had been treated for more than 48&#x02009;hours with heparin at therapeutic doses, had taken more than 1 dose of a VKA, had cancer for which long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was anticipated, had another indication for warfarin therapy, had received treatment with aspirin (at more than 100&#x02009;mg daily) or dual antiplatelet therapy or had a creatinine&#x000a0;clearance of less than 30&#x02009;mL/min.</p><p>Major bleeding was defined as overt bleeding that was associated with a reduction in haemoglobin of 2&#x02009;g/dL or greater, required a transfusion of two or more units of blood, occurred at a critical site or contributed to death. Clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding was defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but that required medical intervention, unscheduled contact with a clinician, interruption of study drug or discomfort or impairment of daily activities. Total bleeding was the composite of major bleeding, CRNM bleeding and nuisance bleeding (ie, all bleeding events not classified as major or CRNM). All bleeding events were adjudicated by an independent, central, blinded committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genotypes</title><p>Genotypes were determined for <italic>CYP2C9 *2</italic> and <italic>CYP2C9 *3</italic> (rs1799853 and rs1057910, respectively) and <italic>VKORC1</italic> -&#x02013;1639 G&#x02192;A alleles (rs9923231) in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice guidelines by ILS Genomics (Morrisville, North Carolina, USA) with an analytically validated assay using Sequenom (San Diego, California,&#x000a0;USA) technology.

</p><p>This pharamcogenetic subanalysis of Hokusai VTE has a number of limitations which could constrain the generalisability of the results. Hokusai VTE did not stratify patients by warfarin sensitivity genotypes prior to randomisation. There were not enough major bleeding events to determine the interaction between treatment regimen and warfarin sensitivity. In addition, the study was underpowered for the three-bin analysis and the results of the exploratory two-bin analysis should only be considered hypothesis generating. There was also a low number of black patients included in this subanalysis, and therefore additional analyses will be needed to confirm the results in different racial groups. It should also be noted that genotyping was not used in guiding the starting dose of warfarin and that the high TTR observed in this study is not what is typically seen in clinics.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Finally, the results of this subanalysis could differ in other disease states besides VTE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this analysis extend the results of the previous ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 pharmacogenetic analysis to demonstrate that patients with VTE who have a sensitive or highly sensitive warfarin genotype spend more time overanticoagulated, require a lower warfarin dose and have higher bleeding rates with warfarin therapy. In addition, this subanalysis suggests that compared with normal warfarin responders sensitive warfarin responders may have a higher risk of bleeding on warfarin relative to edoxaban.</p><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known on this subject?</title><p>In a recent subanalysis of the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation&#x02013;Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48, a study comparing edoxaban with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, patients randomised to receive warfarin and classified as sensitive or highly sensitive warfarin responders&#x02014;based on <italic>CYP2C9</italic> and <italic>VKORC1</italic> genotypes&#x02014;experienced more warfarin-associated bleeding and spent more time overanticoagulated relative to normal responders.</p></sec><sec><title>What might this study add?</title><p>The present pharmacogenetic subanalysis of the Hokusai-venous thromboembolism&#x000a0;(Hokusai VTE) trial, a trial evaluating edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with VTE initially treated with heparin, demonstrates that patients with VTE who have a sensitive or highly sensitive warfarin genotype spend more time overanticoagulated (p&#x0003c;0.001), require a lower warfarin dose (p&#x0003c;0.001) and have higher bleeding rates with warfarin therapy (sensitive responders HR 1.38 [95% CI 1.11 to 1.71], p=0.0035; highly sensitive responders 1.79 [1.09&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;2.99]; p=0.0252).</p></sec><sec><title>How might this impact on clinical practice?</title><p>The results presented here may influence the practical management of warfarin therapy for the treatment of VTE in patients who are sensitive or highly sensitive responders to warfarin.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>Medical writing and editorial support was provided by Stefan Kolata, PhD, of AlphaBioCom, LLC (King of Prussia, Pennsylvania,&#x000a0;USA) and funded by Daiichi Sankyo&#x000a0;(Parsippany, New Jersey, USA).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AV, JW, KSB, GZ, ML, MAG and MFM made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work and analysis or interpretation of data, drafted or critically revised the manuscript, and had final approval of the version to be published.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was funded by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc (Parsippany, New Jersey, USA).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> AV, GZ, ML, MAG and MFM are employees of Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.
