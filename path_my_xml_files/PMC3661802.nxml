In addition to contributing to calorie overconsumption, the unique metabolism of fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and its marked effect on systemic oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) could give it a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance (IR) and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The &#x0201c;French Paradox,&#x0201d; defined as a low incidence of coronary heart disease despite consumption of a diet rich in saturated fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), has stimulated interest in investigating whether grape polyphenols (PPs) may offer antioxidant-consequential health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) including improved insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), although this effect remains debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). If this outcome were to be confirmed in humans, then supplementation of highly processed foods with grape PPs may prove to be a promising strategy to stem the tide of chronic metabolic diseases, which, furthermore, would be quite easy to implement, since PPs are currently marketed in the form of dyes and tannins that can be used safely in relatively large amounts in sugary foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>We thus designed a randomized double-blinded controlled study to assess the clinical efficacy of nutritional amounts of grape PPs in counteracting the metabolic effects of high-fructose diet (HFrD) to substantiate the hypothesis that by neutralizing oxidative stress, grape PPs can prevent fructose-induced IR.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Forty-three first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients were recruited by advertisement in the diabetes departments of Montpellier and Lyon university hospitals and allocated to supplementations with grape PPs or placebo (PCB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1652/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).

Evaluation of compliance (&#x02265;80% of the capsules taken) was done before starting the tests by counting the number of returned capsules after 4, 8, and 9 weeks from baseline. Volunteers were instructed to avoid polyphenol-rich foods and to follow a balanced, isoenergetic diet, which was controlled by a food diary during the 3-day period preceding each test and assessed with GENI software (Micro 6, Villers-les-Nancy, France). Intake of dietary polyphenols was further evaluated using phenol explorer (version 1.5.7; INRA, Clermont-Ferrand).

Microarray analysis demonstrated that expression of many oxidative and mitochondrial genes, including <italic>OXPHOS</italic> genes and <italic>CPT1</italic>, was reduced in response to HFrD in skeletal muscle. A potential contribution to this observation in IR may be inferred from other studies reporting that expression of <italic>OXPHOS</italic> genes is decreased and multiple energy metabolism genes&#x02019; expression is altered in the context of type 2 diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and that a decrease in CPT activity, which transports long-chain acyl-CoA into the mitochondria, may lead to intracellular lipid accumulation triggering IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). We further demonstrated that fructose has detrimental effects on mitochondrial respiration when either pyruvate or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine was used as a substrate. This effect appears to be related both to variations in mitochondrial density as reflected by the lack of reduction in mitochondrial basal respiration by fructose when data were corrected for mitochondrial content (citrate synthase activity) and to altered function as exemplified by the decreased <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> rate corrected for mitochondrial density in response to fructose. Fructose impairment of mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial function could result from altered expression of PGC-1&#x003b1;, a critical transcriptional regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes whose reduced expression and activity has been related to IR and was suggested to be a primary feature of prediabetes pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>As oxidative stress participates in skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction, including altered biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that fructose-induced mitochondrial alterations were related to oxidative stress. Our data demonstrating that grape PP supplementation prevents both oxidative stress in the presence of fructose and the downfall of mitochondrial function with maintenance of mitochondrial gene expression at normal levels in skeletal muscle support this hypothesis.</p><p>The protective effect of grape PPs on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondria was associated with maintenance of insulin sensitivity in the face of fructose overload. We found a negative correlation between fructose-induced changes of urinary F2-isoprostanes and GIR during the clamp, suggesting a link between oxidative stress and fructose-induced IR. Similarly, there was a strong negative correlation between the decrease in GIR and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine variations during fructose overload (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.97), powerfully supporting a direct association between fructose-induced decreased skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and IR. Therefore, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing oxidative stress, and facilitating the uncoupling of oxidative metabolism, grape PPs may help maintain high levels of substrate oxidation while limiting free radical production, explaining their protective effect with respect to fructose-induced IR.</p><p>Major adipokines and hormones were not affected by grape PP supplementation, which is somewhat different from what is seen in animal models with grape seed procyanidin modulating CRP and adiponectin plasma levels in rats fed a hyperlipidic diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This may suggest that, in the current study, grape PPs acted directly on metabolic tissues (skeletal muscle and liver) without systemic changes in regulating factors.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism, the protective effect of grape PPs on IR and oxidative stress was not associated with a reduction of fasting plasma triglycerides, indicating that it failed to impact the metabolic steps involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Surprisingly, HFrD was associated with a decrease in LDL cholesterol in the PCB group only. Nevertheless, LDL particles in this group were more atherogenic as testified by a decrease in small-dense LDL size that was counteracted by grape PPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Even though resveratrol accounts for a very small portion of the grape PPs used in the present work, our results present similarities with the metabolic effects of this compound. Indeed, as for the latter, grape PPs were able to prevent diet-induced IR and potentially weight gain&#x02014;effects that could be mediated by a control of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration secondary to PGC-1&#x003b1; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We also obtained results similar to those of the clinical study of Timmers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) using resveratrol, including the upregulation of mitochondrial genes with an improved function and increased PGC-1&#x003b1; level favoring mitochondrial biogenesis; using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we further complement the results of these authors showing an 11% improvement in homeostasis model assessment index after resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Grape in itself is a panoply of polyphenols consisting mostly of anthocyanins and flavonols, including quercetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), much of which has also demonstrated multiple metabolic health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Even though the dose of 2 g/day polyphenols used in the current study can be regarded as a high dose, it remains nevertheless compatible with the supply of a diet rich in red grapes, other fruits and vegetables, and eventually red wine.</p><p>By nature, the use of a polyphenol mixture does not enable us to identify clearly what components of the grape extract are causing any of the observed effects.</p><p>We would further like to recall that grape PPs are already used by the food industry in the form of dyes and tannins, notably in sugary foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our results constitute a basis for considering further work studying the effects of direct addition of PPs to foods containing fructose.</p><p>In conclusion, 9 weeks of grape PP supplementation secures an unwavering metabolic state in healthy overweight/obese first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects faced with a 6-day fructose overload, preventing liver and muscle IR while bearing no adverse effects. Future studies should investigate the effects of grape PP coadministration with processed food rich in fructose and their potential role in counteracting the metabolic syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
