The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients achieving the Axial SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) 20 response criteria at week 12. Secondary endpoints included ASAS40 response, ASAS partial remission, AS Disease Activity Score, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) value, and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the 301 patients enrolled were similar across treatment groups. At week 12, there was no statistically significant difference in ASAS20 response rate between placebo (ASAS20 = 24.0%) and any sarilumab dose group. A significantly greater reduction in hs-CRP value was achieved with the higher sarilumab doses versus placebo. No other statistically significant differences were evident for secondary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>The most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported for sarilumab included infections (non-serious), neutropenia, and increase in alanine aminotransferase. No cases of tuberculosis, opportunistic, or fungal infections, or bowel perforations were reported. Seven patients experienced a treatment-emergent serious adverse event (all in sarilumab treatment groups). No deaths occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ALIGN study shows that IL-6R&#x003b1; blockade with sarilumab was not an effective treatment for AS. Sarilumab was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ankylosing Spondylitis</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (biologic)</kwd><kwd>Autoimmune Diseases</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically develops in the third decade of life,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> affecting men about twice as frequently as women.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A close relationship exists between the prevalence of the HLA-B27 gene and the development of AS, with 80&#x02013;95% of patients with AS being HLA-B27 positive.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Traditional therapies, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have limited efficacy in many patients. Although biologic agents have significantly improved outcomes, 30&#x02013;40% of patients experience substantial disease activity despite anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; therapy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> For some patients, the initial response to anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents diminishes over time and they are switched to another anti-TNF agent.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, if TNF-blockade fails to control AS disease activity, no other treatment options are currently available. Because high levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin (IL)-6 have been found in biopsy specimens from sacroiliac joints of patients with AS, these cytokines were thought to at least partially mediate the inflammation in AS.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref> Circulating levels of IL-6 also correlate with spinal inflammation,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the clinical and radiological efficacy of TNF-blockade in AS is associated with significant reduction of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Thus, blockade of IL-6 is an appealing potential therapeutic option.</p><p>Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanised monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor-&#x003b1; (IL-6R&#x003b1;), and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> When the current study was designed and initiated, case reports suggested benefit with TCZ in AS patients who had been refractory to two or more anti-TNF agents.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> After the study had been completed, negative results of a placebo-controlled trial of tocilizumab in patients with active AS were reported.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> No anti-IL-6 agent is currently approved for the treatment of AS.</p><p>Sarilumab, the first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6R&#x003b1;, is currently in development for RA.

Patients were randomised with balanced allocation to receive either SC placebo or sarilumab (100, 150 or 200&#x02005;mg every other week (q2w), or 100 or 150&#x02005;mg every week (qw), with q2w dosing alternating with placebo) for 12&#x02005;weeks. Patients were stratified according to levels of high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP (&#x02264;1.5&#x02005;mg/dL or &#x0003e;1.5&#x02005;mg/dL) at screening and region (Western countries vs non-Western countries). Patients who completed the 12-week treatment period were offered enrolment in a long-term extension study, NCT01118728. Patients who chose not to enrol in the extension study had a post-treatment safety follow-up visit 6&#x02005;weeks after the end-of-treatment visit.

All reported events occurred in the sarilumab groups; of these, five events (one per patient) resulted in treatment discontinuation (neutropenia, ALT increase, helicobacter gastritis, false positive tuberculosis test and epileptic seizure) (further details are provided in the online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204963/-/DC1">supplemental table</ext-link>&#x000a0;2). No severe or serious infections were associated with grade 3 (&#x02265;500&#x02013;1000/mm<sup>3</sup>) or grade 4 (&#x0003c;500/mm<sup>3</sup>) neutropenia, and no deaths were reported.</p><p>Sarilumab was associated with neutropenia and elevations in ALT (&#x0003e;3&#x000d7;upper limit of normal), total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Generally, changes in other laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG parameters were not considered clinically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ALIGN study showed that SC-administered sarilumab was generally well tolerated but did not demonstrate a statistically or clinically significant effect compared to placebo in patients with active AS who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, NSAIDs. A statistically significant reduction in hs-CRP following SC sarilumab treatment demonstrated that a biological effect of IL-6 blockade was achieved. However, lack of associated clinical or imaging improvement that is, similar reductions in functional and clinical parameters as measured by MRI, BASDAI, BASMI and BASFI scores in placebo-treated and sarilumab-treated patients, further suggests that IL-6 may not play a major role in the inflammatory process underlying AS. The significant reduction observed in the ASDAS score with sarilumab likely reflects inclusion of hs-CRP in this composite measure, suggesting that ASDAS may not be a robust outcome parameter when changes in CRP values could be dissociated from changes in disease activity, as with anti-IL-6 therapies. Variability in the observed efficacy of sarilumab among individual treatment groups in the ALIGN study most likely reflects the inclusion of only 49&#x02013;52 subjects in each individual treatment group, since no sarilumab dose group yielded a statistically significantly greater proportion of ASAS20 responders when compared to the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204963F2">figure 2</xref>A, p&#x0003e;0.05 for all groups). Variability of ASAS20 response at week 12 by hs-CRP stratification among sarilumab groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013204963F2">figure 2</xref>B) potentially supports this assertion.</p><p>There was no relationship between changes in hs-CRP and changes in the MRI scores, suggesting that the drug did not have an effect on AS disease-specific inflammation.</p><p>Although case reports of treatment with TCZ have suggested benefit of IL-6R&#x003b1; blockade in AS,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> a recent 12-week phase II multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TCZ in AS patients did not confirm this. That study used the same primary efficacy end point as the ALIGN study to compare intravenous TCZ 8&#x02005;mg/kg versus placebo in 102 AS patients (TCZ, n=51; placebo, n=51). Similar to sarilumab, TCZ also failed to reach its primary efficacy end point despite reducing hs-CRP and ASDAS scores.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These results caution that positive case reports or evidence for a certain pharmacological intervention based on preclinical data, may not always predict the clinical efficacy of a targeted drug in complex diseases of unknown aetiology such as AS.
