Studied population were patients who were hospitalized for having elective orthopedic surgeries on their upper and lower extremities. Written informed consent was obtained from patients. Sampling was done the convenience way and after the first patient was randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the rest of the patients were alternately and in order of their admission to the hospital allocated to either the group of Propofol induced anesthesia or Etomidate induced anesthesia. Inclusion criteria were being aged from 18 to 45 years old, having no underlying diseases, being of ASA 1 classification, being an applicant for elective orthopedic surgery on upper and lower extremities, not being allergic to anesthetic drugs, not having any expected problems of the airway, receiving no narcotics or sedative drugs before the anesthesia, and not being hemodynamically unstable before the anesthesia. Patients who were a 4 grade after the induction of anesthesia and laryngoscopy or their laryngoscopy were lasted longer than 30 s, or were not anesthetized using the mentioned dose of drugs and received higher doses, were excluded from the study. Sample size was estimated by the special formula for comparison of mean between two groups 50 patients who had the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups of 25 patients. The first group underwent general anesthesia by Propofol and the second group were anesthetized by Etomidate. All patients received the same amount of liquids from the night before surgery and none of them received any premedication. Induction of anesthesia was performed after 3 min of oxygenation (pre-oxygenation with a simple mask). For the Propofol group, the drug dosage was 2.5 mg/kg body weight and it was 0.3 mg/kg body weight for the Etomidate group. The drug was injected in 30 s until the patient stopped talking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Both drugs were injected using the peripheral vessels canola connected to the infusion of Ringer's lactate serum. Patients who were not anesthetized using the mentioned doses were injected with higher doses of drugs, but excluded from the study. The dose of muscle relaxant in both groups was the same and patients were randomized using a random number generator to one of two study groups to take the following in a double-blind manner. An anesthesiologist intubated all patients. The person who filled the forms and the anesthesiologist who injected the drugs were different and the induction arrangement was directed using the two pre-prepared syringes with different codes.</p><p>For all the patients after performing all the necessary proceedings, a questionnaire including the patient's demographic information and medical history was filled and also all the received information during and after the anesthesia were recorded too.</p><p>Hemodynamic and cardiovascular indicators such as: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), and O<sub>2</sub> saturation (O<sub>2</sub> sat) of patients were measured and recorded before the induction of anesthesia, before intubation, and 1, 3, 5, and 10 min afterward. Blood pressure of all patients was measured by one person using the same sphygmomanometer. The laryngoscopic grading was defined and recorded by the anesthesiologist who intubated all the patients. Measurement of the blood oxygen saturation was carried out with pulse oxymeter and HR measured using an electrocardiogram monitor. Furthermore, the person who was gathering the information did not know about the drug that was used for the patient. Finally, all the gathered information was recorded in a computer and was analyzed using the SPSS version 20. The Chi-square, T-student, and repeated measures ANOVA test were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 50 patients were selected that 25 of them received Propofol and the other, received Etomidate. 2 patients were excluded that were both from the Propofol group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows demographic data of the patients, which reveals that there were no statistical differences between both groups regarding gender, age, body mass index, and laryngoscopic grade of patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of studied population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-18-870-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of demographic date between two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-18-870-g002"/></table-wrap><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation of the changes in systolic and DBP, the mean of arterial blood pressure, HR and O<sub>2</sub> sat, which would reveal that changes of SBP in the Propofol group was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.019).

Results showed that patients had no significant differences regarding their underlying variables such as gender, age, and laryngoscopic grade; hence, the confounding effect of these variables has probably been neutralized and the results are all about the drugs. Results showed that there was a significant difference between two groups regarding SBP, DBP, and the mean of arterial blood pressure and patients of the Propofol group showed more hypotension and patients of the Etomidate group had a more stable blood pressure. Studies have shown that inducing anesthesia with Propofol that would be administered at the dose of 2-2.5 mg/kg of body weight could lower blood pressure as much as 25-40%; this hypotension would occur in all the patients regardless of any underlying conditions and has been reported in every studied patient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] The study of Hug <italic>et al</italic>. that was conducted on 25000 patients showed that Propofol would lead to bradycardia in 4.2% of patients and hypotension in 15.7% of patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Furthermore, the studies of Hiller and Reves showed that inducing anesthesia with Propofol that would be administered at the dose of 2-2.5 mg/kg of body weight could lower blood pressure as much as 25-40%; this hypotension would occur in all the patients regardless of any underlying conditions and has been reported in every studied patient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Propofol caused hypotension is due to the reduction of heart's preload and after load, which are not synchronized with heart's compensatory responses such as increased cardiac output and increased HR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] This hemodynamic drop would be intensified by high doses of the drug and high speed injection of the drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Brohon <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of Propofol or Etomidate in combination with Alfentanil or Sulfentanil on lumbar spinal surgeries and showed that SBP decreased in Etomidate in combination with Sulfentanil or Alfentanil, but not changed in Propofol group in combination with each of them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The study of Boisson-Bertrand <italic>et al</italic>. showed Propofol is suggested for patients who need good post-operative cooperation and Etomidate for those who are hemodynamically compromised.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] The present study was carried out because of the wide range of consequences and controversies in other studies and it was exclusively about elective orthopedic surgeries that didn&#x02019;t mentioned in previous studies. In the present study, we also achieved some of these results and patients&#x02019; HR 1 min after the injection of the drug were dropped by the same rate. Tachycardia and bradycardia happened in both group without no significant differences.</p><p>On the other hand, there was no significant difference between both groups regarding the percentage of blood's oxygen saturation. Other conducted studies also have shown that Etomidate can also lead to hemodynamic disorders, but comparing to other drugs, these disorders are fewer when using Etomidate. Etomidate's effect on the hemodynamic condition of the patient is more controllable than Propofol's effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Therefore, since patients receiving Etomidate experience more stable hemodynamic condition, if there would be no contraindications, it could be preferred over Propofol for general anesthesia. Especially in patients that suppression of cardiac function and vasodilatation are risky, using Etomidate is way much safer than Propofol. Of course, like other anesthetic drugs, Etomidate can cause nausea and vomiting after anesthesia that could be somehow controlled by using proper premedication. Also injection of Etomidate can cause a burning sensation, which a transient effect and would not cause any serious harm to the patient. According to type of patients and kind of surgery, this study was encountered to any limitation, but because of limitation in measuring the plasma level of drugs we can&#x02019;t say if any of these consequences obtained in the same level of drug and it was better if we could know the plasma level of Etomidate and Propofol.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> All authors state that they have no conflicts of interest (none declared).
