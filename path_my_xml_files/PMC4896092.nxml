In many cases, this is done using a clinical metrology instrument (CMI), also referred to as a questionnaire. The use of a proxy to determine the effect of an intervention (be it a drug or surgical method) is complicated by many factors that can introduce bias, and also the inherent variability from one pet owner to another.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Therefore, using valid questionnaires and administering them in an appropriate manner is essential in decreasing variability<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and confounding factors,<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> and providing accurate results.</p><p>A large body of work has been performed evaluating the psychology behind how a respondent answers a questionnaire.

Once on the study, respondents often then revert to a &#x0201c;more true&#x0201d; representation of their pet's impairment. Additionally, dogs may tend to be recruited to a clinical study when the clinical signs are obvious, and natural variation in the disease causes them to become less affected as the study starts. These 2 phenomena are likely partly responsible for the placebo effect. However, most studies have shown good repeatability (test&#x02010;retest) for the validated CMIs used to assess pain and mobility.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p><p>Another form of bias seen specifically in independent interviewing is called the seam bias.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Seam bias is defined as an overrepresentation of change, when measured across a &#x0201c;seam&#x0201d; between 2 successive survey administrations and is a unique bias seen in independent interviewing (InD) during longitudinal panel surveys.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Subsequent work showed that dependent interviewing (DI), allowing respondents to review their previous answers, was more effective in controlling seam bias and therefore resulted in a more accurate collection of data.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>

However, by showing respondents their original answers during the retest phase, or using &#x0201c;dependent interviewing,&#x0201d; one might receive a more accurate representation in the linear progression<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> of change in a animal's status.</p><p>For our study, we hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in CMI responses at the screening visit versus the start of study visit for CMIs designed to assess pain and mobility in dogs with osteoarthritis.

Thirteen dogs were administered NV&#x02010;01 at a dose of 200 &#x003bc;g/kg of a 2 mg/mL solution IV over a 1&#x02010;min period through an intravenous 20&#x02010;gage catheter.</p><p>Thirteen dogs were administered a placebo (normal saline), administered IV at a volume equivalent to the dose of NV&#x02010;01. The dispensing of drug or placebo was performed by NCSU pharmacy, with all other personnel involved in the collection of data masked to the administration until completion of the statistical analysis. Pharmacy personnel prepared unmarked syringes for each dog with the barrel covered in opaque tape. Testing before starting the study indicated there was no appreciable difference between the feel of injecting saline versus NV&#x02010;01 through a 20&#x02010;gage catheter, to ensure complete masking.</p><p>At Day 14 and Day 28 owners also completed all CMIs (independent interviewing). Once completed, owners were represented with the CSOM and the CBPI CMIs, in sequence, and for each one, they were shown the answers from the previous visit and asked to complete these CMIs again (dependent interviewing).</p><p>Study B had a very similar initial design, with screening being performed 7 days before study entry. In this study, baseline CMI data for the CSOM, CBPI, LOAD and HCPI were collected at Day &#x02212;7 and Day 0. The owners completed these 4 CMI's using only independent interviewing techniques. Treatments were again administered on Day 0, using the same drug and placebo, but they were administered subcutaneously.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13923-sec-0012"><title>Clinical Metrology Instruments</title><p>All CMI's were completed by the same owner at all visits, and owners were directed to base their answers on their observations of the preceding 7 days.

The direction of shift in baseline scores was not consistent across all the CMIs, with the best agreement in baseline scores being found for the LOAD CMI. Overall, we found good agreement between dependent interviewing and independent interviewing, and no statistically significant difference between scores collected under the 2 interviewing conditions, leading us to again reject our hypothesis. These data suggest that overall, neither interviewing technique will provide statistically different answers and both appear to be appropriate to use in the clinical setting. Finally, our data supported our final hypothesis as we found that the use of dependent interviewing provided, on average, lower CMI scores, a higher treatment effect, and a higher effect size. By using dependent interviewing techniques, it could be possible to increase the treatment effect and effect size, therefore increasing the power of the study through minimal change to study design.</p><p>Our first aim was to evaluate baseline variability in CMI scores collected during a 7&#x02010;day interval, with no treatment having been administered. We had expected that screening CMI scores would decrease between the first (Day &#x02212;7) and second (Day 0) visit because of the faking bad bias, previously reported by Choi and Aday.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> This appeared to occur for CBPI interference and CSOM Total, with scores indicating significantly less impairment on Day 0 compared to the earlier Day &#x02212;7, but the opposite was seen for the CBPI pain, LOAD and the HCPI, with the respondent's CMI scores increasing (greater pain and impairment) between Day &#x02212;7 and Day 0.</p><p>A decrease in severity (disability) was expected because of several possible reasons. As discussed previously, the Faking Bad bias may be part of the respondents' discrepancies in the baseline CMI scores; owners may alter their CMI scores (reporting increased pain and impairment) to be enrolled in a study at Day &#x02212;7. Additionally, the concept of regression to the mean has been discussed<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> where dogs are recruited to a clinical study when the clinical signs are obvious, and natural variation in the disease causes them to become better as the study starts. These 2 phenomena are likely responsible for the generally expected lower scores at a second baseline measurement.</p><p>The CBPI interference and CSOM Total CMI results were consistent with our hypothesis and previously reported data. Between Day &#x02212;7 and Day 0, the CSOM scores significantly decreased in severity. As well as the possible explanations of faking bad and regression to the mean, the CSOM may suffer from another bias. The CSOM uses 3 items tailored to each animal, that the owners are asked to follow and assess. At Day &#x02212;7, owners decide on the activity, and rate the difficulty the pet has performing the activity. They then return home, and evaluate the activity. This increased attention to the activity may lead them to realize the pet is not actually as impaired performing the activity as they initially thought, whereas all other CMIs are standardized questionnaires collected using a numeric scale at the time of presentation.</p><p>Baseline variability (test&#x02010;retest reliability) for LOAD, CBPI pain, and HCPI have been previously described,<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> and all have shown a decrease in CMI scores between the screening (Day &#x02212;7) and the start of a clinical trial (Day 0), indicating a systemic bias within the baseline screening. However, unlike previous work<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> our findings showed only the CBPI interference and CSOM CMI's displayed this trend. All other CMI's (CBPI pain, LOAD, and the HCPI) showed an increase in CMI scores when comparing Day &#x02212;7 to Day 0 (an increased impairment). This may be caused by a bias called the recall bias or rumination. Recall bias<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> or rumination could cause owners to increase importance of major events or experiences during the clinical trial leading to an alteration of their retest answers. Owners could overinterpret their pet's behavior, causing an increased bias and overrepresentation of their pet's pain and disability.</p><p>When evaluating baseline agreement between each CMI, it was noted that the LOAD questionnaire had the best agreement and most consistent results, when comparing Day &#x02212;7 to Day 0, and may indicate the LOAD is inherently the most stable CMI. The ICC for LOAD found in the current study was identical to the ICC reported by Hercock et al.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> evaluating dogs with osteoarthritis, confirming its inherent baseline stability.</p><p>Although statistically not different, the variability in baseline scores in all the CMIs suggests that researchers using these instruments should take this into consideration when deciding which baseline time point to use when using &#x0201c;change from baseline&#x0201d; as the primary outcome measure.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>
</p><p>Although there was no statistical difference between the 2 survey techniques (independent and dependent interviewing), an interesting pattern was found with a consistent decrease in CMI scores across both the placebo and treatment groups, most pronounced in the treatment group, when using the dependent interviewing technique versus the independent interviewing technique. This phenomenon was also shown within the US Census Bureau's Survey Income and Program Participation (SIPP), where using independent interviewing resulted in increased variability in answers between 2 time points (seam bias) during the longitudinal study, compared to dependent interviewing techniques.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> As a result of this research and the inherent forms of bias presumed to be associated with independent interviewing, the US Census Bureau adapted the dependent interviewing techniques in 2004.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>
</p><p>We also found that the answers from the dependent interviewing technique showed a greater treatment effect and effect sizes, compared to the independent interviewing technique. These are very interesting findings, and the implications for clinical study design and power are significant. Previous reported methods to increase treatment effects include increasing sample size, reducing measurement error, and raising the alpha level.<xref rid="jvim13923-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> However, increasing sample size has proven to be costly, and raising the alpha level is not recommended. Using dependent interviewing techniques could increase the treatment effect and effect size, therefore increasing the power of the study through minimal change to study design and no extra cost. However, our results need to be replicated before this approach can be strongly recommended.</p><p>We are not aware of any work in veterinary medicine that compares the 2 interviewing approaches. From our data, we cannot conclude whether the independent or dependent interviewing technique provided more accurate results, but given that the difference between the 2 sets of data were more pronounced for the treatment group, it is tempting to think that dependent interviewing may give a more accurate representation of pain and mobility. Further studies should evaluate the 2 techniques against objective measures of mobility and lameness.</p></sec><sec id="jvim13923-sec-0020"><title>Summary</title><p>We identified some baseline variability in CSOM, CBPI, LOAD, and HCPI scores when measured 7 days apart with no intervening treatment, and the direction of shift in baseline scores was inconsistent across all the CMIs, with the best agreement in baseline scores being found for the LOAD CMI, and the least good for the CSOM CMI.
