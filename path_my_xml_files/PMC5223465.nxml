However, postoperative knee swelling is a common problem due to intra-articular bleeding and inflammation of periarticular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This results in decreased functional performance as a result of quadriceps weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and arthrogenic reflex inhibition due to pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] which can delay rehabilitation, increase hospital length of stay and decrease patient-reported outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, excessive knee swelling is associated with increased rates of wound dehiscence and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Intraoperative techniques to reduce intra-articular bleeding, such as surgical technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], tourniquets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are features in enhanced recovery programmes. However, postoperative methods, including the use of a cold compress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], cryotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], elastic bandaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and compression bandages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have had limited success.</p><p>Compression bandage therapy is the established treatment of venous ulcers and lymphoedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is hypothesised that the application of this external compression aids venous return and reduces hydrostatic pressure in the leg by (1) improving the efficacy of the calf-muscle pump and (2) moving blood from the superficial to the deep venous system, subsequently allowing movement of fluid from the interstitial space. The use of inelastic bandages are preferred in arthroplasty as they have a low, tolerable resting pressure but a more effective activation of the deep venous system and calf-muscle pump with ambulation compared to their elastic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy in total knee arthroplasty is still unclear due to conflicting results in the medical literature and heterogeneous methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We hypothesised that the use of a compression bandage in total knee replacement would improve postoperative pain, swelling and functional outcomes. The aim of this study was (1) to test study feasibility in the form of eligibility, recruitment rate, attrition rates and bandage complications, (2) to derive preliminary subjective and objective data and (3) to derive a power calculation for the Oxford Knee Score using preliminary data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a prospectively enrolled, randomised controlled feasibility study conducted at two hospital sites within Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Control group</title><p>Patients underwent primary total knee arthroplasty under the care of one of two consultant orthopaedic surgeons (SM, MR). Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia and sedation. Intra-venously administered (IV) antibiotics (gentamicin 3&#x000a0;mg/kg and teicoplanin 400&#x000a0;mg IV) and tranexamic acid (30&#x000a0;mg/kg IV up to 2.5&#x000a0;g) were administered and a tourniquet used. A Nexgen cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty was used (Zimmer, Swindon, United Kingdom) with Palacos R&#x02009;+&#x02009;G bone cement (Heraeus Medical, Newbury, United Kingdom). Intra-operative periarticular injections of 80&#x000a0;ml 0.125% bupivacaine were infiltrated and a further 20-ml 0.125% bupivacaine bolus given via intra-articular wound catheter after wound closure. The skin was closed using surgical skin clips, which were removed at 10 to 14&#x000a0;days post-operatively. A hydrocolloid dressing (Aquacel Surgical, Convatec Ltd., Flintfield, UK) was used for the wound. Standard bandaging consists of a soft inner layer (Soffban, BSN Medical Ltd., Brierfield, UK) applied from 10&#x000a0;cm below to 10&#x000a0;cm above the patella with a 50% overlap of bandage, followed by a similar outer layer of crepe bandage (BSN Medical Ltd., Brierfield, UK) prior to deflation of the tourniquet.</p><p>The bandage and wound catheter were removed at 24&#x000a0;h leaving the hydrocolloid wound dressing in situ. This dressing stayed on until the clips were removed at 10&#x02013;14 days. A cryocuff was used after 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Compression bandage group</title><p>Patients received a compression bandage over the hydrocolloid surgical wound dressing instead of the routine wool and crepe bandage. Following tourniquet removal a soft inner layer (Soffban, BSN Medical Ltd., Brierfield, UK) was applied from the toes to the groin on the affected leg with a 50% overlap of bandage. Following this the outer compressive layer bandage (Actico bandage, Activa Healthcare Ltd., UK) was applied firmly over the top, again with a 50% overlap of bandage. The bandage was pulled to full stretch before it was wrapped around the leg to ensure adequate compression in the application. It was applied after release of the tourniquet by necessity due to its length up the thigh. To ensure homogeneity in bandage application, the operating surgeons were shown a training video on correct application of the bandage and were given a tutorial on bandage application with real-life bandage application and feedback. The bandage was removed at 24&#x000a0;h post surgery leaving the hydrocolloid wound dressing in situ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study feasibility</title><p>Recruitment, retention and refusal rates were calculated. The proportion of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty who did not meet the eligibility criteria was also calculated to ensure this was not too restrictive. Ease of application and tolerance of the compression bandage was determined qualitatively by the operating surgeons and patients, respectively. Potential adverse risks associated with the use of the compression bandage, such as pain, wound dehiscence and blistering, were recorded and rates calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The Oxford Knee Score was measured preoperatively and at 6&#x000a0;months in line with UK Health and Social Care Programme Patient Reported Outcome Measures.

Secondly, interobserver variation is a known limitation of objective knee measurements including range of motion and circumference. It is possible that this may account for some of the variation between subjects and consequently, in combination with the large sample size required for the definitive trial, will not be used. Thirdly, there was a large proportion of patients who were eligible for the trial but not enrolled (32%). This was due to the logistics of research nurse availability and not patient demographics or comorbidities. All patients who were approached regarding the trial agreed to participate. Finally, whilst the primary aim was to ascertain feasibility of the study, the study measurements were underpowered and at risk of type II error. Using this preliminary data for Oxford Knee Score, incorporating attrition rate and standard deviation with 90% power, we would need the following number of participants to determine statistical significance: 354; 790; 3088 for a 3-, 2- and 1-point difference, respectively. These figures will form the basis of the future multicentre study.</p><p>In a randomised controlled trial of 60 patients undergoing unicondylar knee arthroplasty, Pinsornsak et al. found no difference in swelling, blood loss or pain at 24&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h postoperatively between a modified Robert-Jones bandage and a standard wool and crepe bandage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Whilst the bandaging technique was different, the findings are similar to our study.</p><p>In contrast, Charalambides et al. found that patients had improved range of motion (knee flexion) and decreased length of stay when a compression bandage was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the study of 150 patients was not randomised and relied on retrospective data in the cohort that received the standard wool and crepe bandages. It was also not performed in an enhanced recovery programme setting. A study by Cheung et al. found similar findings regarding improved knee flexion in the compression bandage group, with associated lower incidence of walking aids at discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Anderson et al. found that the use of a compression bandage and local anaesthetic infiltration was associated with significant improvement in pain scores at 8&#x000a0;h but not 24&#x000a0;h postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our present study, no significant difference in pain scores were seen 24&#x000a0;h postoperatively. The local anaesthetic infiltration in both our groups may have influenced this. There was a small, non-significant increase in pain scores in the compression bandage group during day 1 and day 2 post-operatively, but this did not tally with qualitative information on the bandage provided by the patients.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to utilise patient-reported outcome measures with the use of compression bandages after total knee arthroplasty. Whilst not statistically significant, the mean improvement in Oxford Knee Score of 2.1 in the compression bandage group is near the minimal clinically significant difference for the Oxford Knee Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The greater mean improvement in the EQ-5D-3L index score (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057; point estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.147; 95% CI &#x02212;0.328 to 0.005) in the compression group also follows this trend. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. As the compression bandage was easy to apply and well-tolerated by patients, without any documented complications, further investigation of its use in a larger, multicentre trial is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Feasibility data suggests that the compression bandage is easy to use and well-tolerated. No statistically significant differences were seen for post-operative scores between groups. However, there was a marginal trend to an improvement in patient-reported outcome measures at 6&#x000a0;months in the compression bandage group. Future work should be directed at further investigation of these patient-reported outcome measures in a larger, multicentre trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>A. P.
