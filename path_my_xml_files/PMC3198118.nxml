                    trials, there is little published information on the development of the
                    comparison group intervention. This article describes the comparison group
                    intervention, termed Diabetes Support and Education Intervention and its
                    development for the Action for HEAlth in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial. Look
                    AHEAD, a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, was designed to determine
                    whether an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention to reduce weight and increase
                    physical activity reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in overweight
                    volunteers with type 2 diabetes compared to the Diabetes Support and Education
                    Intervention. The Diabetes Support and Education Committee was charged with
                    developing the Diabetes Support and Education Intervention with the primary aim
                    of participant retention.</p><p><bold><italic>Purpose</italic></bold> The objectives were to design the Diabetes
                    Support and Education Intervention sessions, standardize delivery across the 16
                    clinics, review quality and protocol adherence and advise on staffing and
                    funding.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold> Following a mandatory session on basic diabetes education,
                    three optional sessions were offered on nutrition, physical activity, and
                    support yearly for 4 years. For each session, guidelines, objectives,
                    activities, and a resource list were created.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> Participant evaluations were very
                    positive with hands on experiences being the most valuable. Retention so far at
                    years 1 and 4 has been excellent and only slightly lower in the Diabetes Support
                    and Education Intervention arm. The comparison group plays an important role in
                    the success of a clinical trial. Understanding the effort needed to develop and
                    implement the comparison group intervention will facilitate its implementation
                    in future lifestyle intervention trials, particularly multicenter trials.
                    Retention rates may improve by developing the comparison intervention
                    simultaneously with the lifestyle intervention.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1740774511405858"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is little information available about the development of the comparison group
                intervention or its ultimate format and content for large trials of lifestyle
                interventions despite the recent increase in such trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774511405858">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774511405858">2</xref>]. The scientific value of a randomized
                trial design and the value of the comparison group are well known and retention of
                the comparison group is clearly important, as a higher attrition rate in this group
                jeopardizes the entire study. Investigators are challenged with offering an
                intervention which produces optimal retention in the comparison group without
                inducing an intervention effect, and maintaining equipoise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774511405858">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511405858">4</xref>]. For lifestyle intervention trials, the
                decisions about the comparison group can be even more complex when the trial is
                multicenter and multi-cultural.</p><p>The design of the comparison group intervention for the Look AHEAD (Action for HEAlth
                and Diabetes) trial, termed the Diabetes Support and Education Intervention (DSEI),
                was a learning opportunity which has yielded valuable information for investigators.
                Knowledge and implementation of the strategies used in this trial may benefit
                investigators in the critical areas of participant retention as well as staff and
                investigator effort. A brief description of the DSEI in the Look AHEAD study was
                included as part of the overall design paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511405858">5</xref>] and a complete description of the Look
                AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774511405858">6</xref>]. The objectives of this article are to
                describe the: (1) development of the Look AHEAD DSEI, (2) content and delivery of
                DSEI sessions, (3) methods used to standardize the DSEI across sites, and (4)
                challenges, retention, and lessons learned.</p><sec id="sec2-1740774511405858"><title>Description of Look AHEAD</title><p>Look AHEAD is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded prospective randomized
                    controlled trial of 5145 people, designed to test the primary hypothesis that an
                    Intensive Lifestyle Intervention to reduce weight and increase physical activity
                    will attenuate the rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in an
                    overweight and obese population with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511405858">5</xref>]. The trial will compare the long-term
                    effects of an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention to that of the DSEI. Within a U01
                    funding mechanism, the protocol was developed over 16 months by the Look AHEAD
                    Steering Committee and approved by the Look AHEAD Executive Committee, and the
                    National Institutes of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Recruitment began
                    in mid-2001 and was completed in April 2004. Study completion is anticipated in
                    2014.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-1740774511405858"><title>Diabetes Support and Education Committee</title><p>The Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) Committee was formed after the protocol was
                approved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774511405858">Figure 1</xref>,
                Timeline). The committee was given the charge of designing a realistic, achievable,
                and acceptable intervention for the DSE study participants and monitoring clinics to
                assure standardized delivery. The main goal of the DSE Committee was to maintain a
                high retention rate for the DSEI participants given the planned follow-up of up to
                13.5 years. Thus, the committee specified the following objectives: (1) design and
                develop interactive DSEI sessions, (2) write and revise the DSEI section of the
                Manual of Procedures, (3) standardize delivery of the DSEI, (4) review attendance
                reports and clinic performance, (5) advise the Steering Committee on DSEI matters
                such as staffing and funding, (6) write the DSEI sections of newsletters, and (7)
                select and purchase retention items for DSEI participant sessions and annual
                retention items for all participants. <fig id="fig1-1740774511405858" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Look AHEAD Trial

                diabetes educators, exercise physiologists, and behavioral psychologists from
                several different Look AHEAD sites, who represented the roles of Principal
                Investigator, Co-Investigator, Project Coordinator, Lifestyle Interventionist, DSEI
                Facilitator, and DSEI Coordinator. The committee met monthly either by conference
                call or in-person.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-1740774511405858"><title>DSEI session development</title><sec id="sec5-1740774511405858"><title>Focus groups</title><p>During the planning phase of the study, a public relations firm, contracted by
                    the Look AHEAD study, convened focus groups of individuals who were interviewed
                    as if they were participants randomized to the DSEI. These potential
                    participants were eager to participate in such a trial, and interested in
                    receiving weight loss information and support, but expressed disappointment,
                    anger, and frustration at the concept of being randomized to the DSEI. Based on
                    these results, the DSE Committee was charged with incorporating weight loss
                    information and support into the DSEI curriculum without providing behavioral
                    feedback. This approach was judged to be consistent with providing a beneficial
                    and relevant, yet minimal, intervention unlikely to produce substantial
                    improvements in weight or fitness.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-1740774511405858"><title>Curriculum development</title><p>The primary goal of the sessions was retention of the DSEI participants by: (1)
                    providing an enjoyable and valuable learning experience; (2) creating a bond
                    with their group leader and other participants; and (3) offering group support.
                    Committee members rotated the lead in developing the curriculum for the sessions
                    based on their areas of expertise: Nutrition, Physical Activity, or Social
                    Support. &#x02018;Guidelines and Teaching Objectives&#x02019; and a &#x02018;Resource List&#x02019; was created
                    for each session. These two documents listed the course content, session
                    materials, reference materials, patient education materials and resources, and
                    suggestions for retention items.</p><p>Since Look AHEAD clinics are located across the USA, and included 2575
                    individuals randomized to the DSEI, the DSE Committee wanted to ensure that
                    materials were written at an appropriate literacy level and were culturally
                    sensitive. Thus, the DSE Committee reviewed all the DSEI materials for content,
                    adherence to a 7th grade literacy level[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511405858">7</xref>], and cultural sensitivity. A
                    &#x02018;Literacy Tip Sheet&#x02019; was developed to assist committee membersin developing
                    materials at the appropriate reading level using the SMOG Tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511405858">7</xref>] for assessing
                    readability. Several members of the DSE Committee attended cultural diversity
                    training at the beginning of the study. By utilizing the knowledge gained by
                    these members&#x02019; and the diversity of the committee members, an effort was made to
                    consider attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs important to the various minorities
                    represented in the study. For example, Native American participants who were
                    shepherds and walked all day needed a different approach to understanding the
                    need for physical activity compared to urban dwelling participants. Recipes and
                    cooking demonstrations were flexible to allow inclusion of cultural food
                    preferences or alternative preparation styles. Materials were made available to
                    all clinics via an intranet website. The usual timeframe for developing and
                    finalizing teaching materials for a session was 4&#x02013;6 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec7-1740774511405858"><title>DSEI staffing</title><p>Each Look AHEAD clinic identified one DSEI Coordinator and 1&#x02013;3 DSEI Group Leaders
                    for their site. DSEI Coordinators and Group Leaders included nurses, dietitians,
                    exercise specialists, and diabetes educators. Each clinic was permitted to
                    select the most qualified professionals to facilitate the sessions. The DSEI
                    Coordinator oversaw certification of staff and conduct of the DSEI and was
                    responsible for DSEI participant tracking and retention. Since Look AHEAD
                    participants were randomized in groups or cohorts, a DSEI Group Leader was
                    assigned to each group and expected to attend all of that group&#x02019;s sessions and
                    serve as the contact person for participants to enhance bonding and, ultimately,
                    participant retention. Both DSEI Group Leaders and DSEI Coordinators could serve
                    as Facilitators of DSEI sessions at different times.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-1740774511405858"><title>Session delivery and content</title><p>The DSEI was designed to be delivered in small group settings of up to 20
                    participants. Around the time of randomization, all subjects received a session
                    on the key aspects of diabetes self-care and safety. Subsequently, the DSEI
                    participants were offered three sessions, 60&#x02013;90&#x02009;min in length, annually for the
                    first 4 years of follow-up; thereafter, one session was provided annually.</p><p>In year 1, the Nutrition and Physical Activity sessions were delivered in a
                    didactic classroom setting and provided basic information on nutrition and
                    physical activity essential to all people with type 2 diabetes. The year 1
                    Social Support session provided a forum for participants to discuss and share
                    feelings, concerns, attitudes, and beliefs about living with diabetes as well as
                    their randomization to the DSEI. Subsequent sessions in years 2&#x02013;4 had a central
                    topic, but clinics were provided a menu of educational activities from which
                    DSEI Facilitators could select. They were designed to be interactive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774511405858">Table 1</xref>). Each clinic
                    could adapt the session to their clinic setting and the culture of their
                    participants, but individualized behavioral feedback and follow-up were
                        <italic>not</italic> permitted. When participants raised questions about
                    their individual care, Coordinators and Group leaders were trained to respond in
                    general terms and/or encourage participants to follow-up with their own doctor
                    or other care provider. (Clinical and laboratory data from annual study visits
                    were sent to each participant&#x02019;s doctor.) Handouts of the information covered
                    were provided at each session. <table-wrap id="table1-1740774511405858" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>DSEI<sup>a</sup>

                    these items to participants who did not attend. The Coordinating Center
                    purchased all the incentives (generally less than $5 per item) to take advantage
                    of large discounts, and shipped them to each clinic. Suggestions for additional

                    was used to evaluate adherence to the protocol, review the global experience of
                    DSEI participants, develop future sessions and identify problematic issues at
                    the clinic level. Suggestions, especially when seen on multiple evaluations,
                    were incorporated into future sessions whenever consistent with the protocol.
                    Issues thought to be site specific were discussed with the responsible DSEI
                    Coordinator at that site. Overall, the evaluations were extremely positive, with
                    the vast majority of ratings being &#x02018;very good&#x02019; and &#x02018;excellent.&#x02019; In particular,

                the USA, the DSE Committee took several steps to standardize content delivery and to
                establish internal validity. First, use of the Look AHEAD intranet site provided
                easy access to all materials by DSEI Coordinators and Facilitators and allowed them
                to be updated quickly. Any changes or new session postings were announced in the

                    Coordinators was developed to foster consistent delivery of session content and
                    ensure DSEI Facilitators had thorough knowledge of the goals and purpose of the
                    DSEI. The certification process consisted of reading the documents noted in
                        <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774511405858">Table 3</xref> in
                    addition to the materials specific to each session. Completion of certification
                    could take 2&#x02013;4 hours and once completed, was entered on the website. Each time a
                    new session was posted, all DSEI Facilitators were required to complete
                    certification for that session. The DSE Committee and Coordinating Center
                    staffmonitored the certification status of all Facilitators.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-1740774511405858"><title>DSE resource core groups</title><p>As the clinics began to deliver the DSEI sessions, it was apparent that more
                    training and support for the DSEI Facilitators and Coordinators would improve
                    communication across the sites and address questions and problems in a more
                    proactive manner. A survey of 17 questions was sent to each clinic to clarify
                    exactly how each clinic organized their DSE team and delivered the DSEI. The
                    survey of DSEI Coordinators revealed two important points: (1) many clinics did
                    not appoint a DSEI leader to each DSEI group and (2) many clinics did not have a
                    procedure for follow-up of missed sessions.</p><p>Following the survey, a training conference callwas held for groups of 4&#x02013;5
                    clinics. The call was mandatory for all DSEI Coordinators and followed an agenda
                    set by the DSE Committee. Results of the survey were discussed and DSEI
                    Coordinators brainstormed on how to implement changes. Subsequently, the DSE
                    Committee established four DSE Resource Core (DSERC) groups, modeled after the
                    previously established Look AHEAD Lifestyle Resource Core groups. The DSERC
                    groups, led by 1&#x02013;2 DSE Committee members, were designed to enhance
                    standardization, address questions proactively, review problems at the sites and
                    provide a forum for the Coordinators to share experiences. Once initiated, DSERC
                    conference calls led by one of the DSE Committee members were held every 6
                    months. These conference calls were discussed ahead of time by the DSE Committee
                    and attended by the Coordinating Center representative on the committee. If
                    important information emerged from any group call,theinformation was shared with
                    all DSERC groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec15-1740774511405858"><title>Challenges and lessons learned</title><sec id="sec16-1740774511405858"><title>Disappointment and anger</title><p>One of the main challenges for clinics was the disappointment and anger that some
                    participants expressed when randomized to the DSEI. This reaction is common to
                    lifestyle intervention trials where participants are attracted by the goals of
                    the intervention but are unblinded to their assignment, in contrast to placebo
                    controlled drug trials. Even as time passed, a few participants occasionally
                    expressed disappointment and anger at not being randomized to the Intensive
                    Lifestyle Intervention, despite a group information session and multiple
                    discussions about the meaning of consent to accept random assignment. DSEI
                    Facilitators needed mentoring and support to address these issues with
                    participants. Therefore, the DSE Committee developed several documents to assist
                    the clinic staff (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774511405858">Table
                        3</xref>). For example, one document, &#x02018;Talking Points,&#x02019; recommended
                    validating participant feelings, reviewing the purpose of the study, and
                    reminding DSEI participants that they could attempt weight loss on their
                    own.</p><p>Designers of future lifestyle intervention trials should consider that, given
                    their unblinded nature, some participants may be more disappointed than
                    anticipated, as the information gathered from pre-study focus groups revealed.
                    Furthermore, these feelings may linger several years into the study.
                    Consideration of preventive actions before or at the time of randomization, and
                    earlier development of guidelines could assist staff to deal with this potential
                    problem. Both of these actions could prevent or limit some of the persistent
                    disappointment among participants which could negatively affect retention.</p></sec><sec id="sec17-1740774511405858"><title>Collapsing cohorts</title><p>Originally, all participants were divided into groups or cohorts, similar to the
                    Intensive Lifestyle Intervention participants. Not surprisingly, over time,

                    developed general guidelines for leading and collapsing groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774511405858">Table 3</xref>). When
                    attendance was low, DSEI Facilitators were encouraged to &#x02018;collapse&#x02019; two or more
                    groups into one larger group, provided the sessions did not include more than 20
                    people. Collapsing cohorts also reduced the staff burden and made for more
                    efficient use of staff time, which was reduced gradually over time. Combining
                    groups allowed participants to attend sessions at different times and on
                    different days. In future trials, when interventions are delivered in group
                    settings, studies should consider proactively collapsing groups as class sizes
                    decrease, in order to maintain quality interaction, enhance retention, and
                    increase staffing efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec18-1740774511405858"><title>Timely session development</title><p>The Look AHEAD Trial Timeline is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774511405858">Figure 1</xref> and details the difference in
                    study activities by study arm. The development of the DSEI began about the time
                    the protocol was completed when recruitment was starting. In contrast, the
                    development of the initial Intensive Lifestyle Intervention sessions was
                    completed before study recruitment began. Thus, the amount of time available to
                    complete the year 1 DSEI sessions (including the processes for literacy and
                    cultural review, guidelines and procedures for dissemination of materials,
                    certification of Facilitators, evaluation of sessions, and attendance tracking)
                    was far less than the time used to develop the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention
                    sessions. This proved to be a difficult task for the DSE Committee. Once the
                    infrastructure and processes were in place, and with a better understanding of
                    the time needed, the DSE Committee started developing sessions earlier,
                    resulting in more timely availability to clinic staff.</p><p>While a great deal of time and effort is needed to develop lifestyle
                    interventions, future trials should also begin the design of the comparison
                    group intervention early, ideally in the planning phases of the study. In
                    long-term studies, perhaps greater attention is needed for the comparison group
                    intervention for retention purposes, especially weight loss studies, which
                    typically have had low retention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774511405858">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774511405858">12</xref>]. An early start allows for greater
                    opportunity to design a program with a &#x02018;perceived benefit.&#x02019; Without any valuable
                    feature to the comparison group intervention, lifestyle intervention trials risk
                    the loss of comparison group participants, which can jeopardize the validity of
                    the study. Finally, a clear understanding of the comparison group intervention,
                    including the time and resources needed for development and implementation, is
                    needed among the entire study group. The appropriate oversight committees of
                    multi-center trials need to assure sufficient staffing and resources both
                    centrally and at the local clinics to develop and deliver the comparison group
                    intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec19-1740774511405858"><title>Maintaining communication</title><p>Communication with the administrative structure of a large trial is extremely
                    important. Formation of the DSERC groups, albeit belated compared to the
                    Lifestyle Resource Core groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774511405858">Figure 1</xref>), enhanced communication with and support for the DSEI

                    needed. The Lifestyle Intervention Committee often was concerned about providing
                    the DSEI participants too much information, and potentially reducing the
                    difference in intervention variables and outcomes. The DSE Committee was
                    concerned with giving participants a valuable and positive learning experience,
                    while the Retention Committee was concerned with the long-term retention of all
                    participants over the 13.5 years of the study. Finally, the Project Coordinator
                    Committee was concerned with proper staffing of the clinics within budgetary
                    constraints. Communication via conference calls, e-mails, phone calls, and
                    discussions at Executive Committee and Steering Committee meetings was critical
                    in addressing these issues. Ultimately, a Cross-Study Retention Committee was
                    formed, which included members from each of these committees.</p><p>Early development of formats for communication among committees, clinics and the
                    study administration can proactively address consistency with study goals and
                    improve staff training, support, and morale. Additionally, these structures can
                    assist clinics with the staff orientation needed due to the inevitable staff
                    turnover that occurs during long-term studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774511405858">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec20-1740774511405858"><title>Retention of participants</title><p>The main aim of the DSEI was participant retention throughout the 13.5 years of
                    planned follow-up. We planned for a more intensive comparison group intervention
                    than many prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774511405858">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774511405858">15</xref>]
                    because many weight loss trials have less than 1 year of follow-up (typically 6
                    months). Even placebo controlled weight loss trials (in which participants are
                    blinded to their treatment assignment) have had retention rates below 90% at 1
                    year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774511405858">16</xref>] and many
                    achieve less than 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774511405858">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774511405858">12</xref>].
                    The DSE Committee worked under the premise that if DSEI participants had a
                    &#x02018;perceived benefit&#x02019; from these sessions and formed a closer bond with the study
                    staff, their commitment would be strengthened and retention in annual outcome
                    assessments would be enhanced. However, from the study perspective, a key aim
                    was to produce a difference in weight and fitness between the participants in
                    the two study arms; a goal which was achieved after 1 year (mean weight loss in
                    the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention arm 8.6% versus 0.7% in the DSEI arm, mean
                    increase in fitness 20.9% in the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention arm versus
                    5.8% in the DSEI arm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774511405858">17</xref>].</p><p>In terms of retention, early numbers suggest success. The 1-year exam was
                    attended by 96.4% of participants, which was only slightly, but statistically
                    significant between the two study arms (Intensive Lifestyle Intervention 97.1%
                    versus DSEI 95.7%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774511405858">17</xref>]. The 4-year exam was attended by
                    93.6% of participants. There was no significant difference between the two study
                    arms (Intensive Lifestyle Intervention 94.1% versus DSEI 93.0%;
                        <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774511405858">18</xref>]. Such high 1-year and 4-year
                    retention rates in a weight loss trial are remarkable. Furthermore, there was a
                    significant stepwise trend between attending a greater number of DSEI sessions
                    and higher retention at the 1-year visit, with only 85% of those participants
                    who attended no DSEI sessions the first year completing data collection,
                    compared to 99% of those attending all three DSEI classes
                    (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). While this does not prove causality, it
                    provides face validity that the DSEI sessions were valuable in enhancing
                    retention in the comparison group.</p><p>The years 1 and 4 retention data in Look AHEAD equal or exceed those of other
                    large multi-center lifestyle intervention trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1740774511405858">Table 4</xref>). The Weight Loss Maintenance
                    trial retained 94.7% of its Self-Directed control group after 30 months;
                    however, this study randomized only patients who had lost 4&#x02009;kg during a 6-month

                    participants at the end of the study (2.8 years); however, the control group in
                    that study was a placebo control group designed in comparison to the metformin
                    and troglitazone arms of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774511405858">19</xref>]. Perhaps most similarly, the
                    Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study had an overall retention rate of 97.1% at 1

                    by study arm were not reported clearly. Prior to Look AHEAD, the longest
                    lifestyle intervention trial was the Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative which reported an
                    overall retention rate of 90.8% (90.4% for lifestyle and 91.1% for the

                    useful for individual clinics as well as the DSE Committee. Furthermore, making
                    a schedule of planned and optional contacts for the DSEI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774511405858">Table 2</xref>), similar to what was done in
                    the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention, allowed the clinics to monitor the
                    retention rate and be proactive at their sites. The high retention rate so far
                    suggests that the DSEI was successful. Future studies should consider what
                    intensity of efforts will be needed to retain participants in the study, but
                    minimize the effects of such efforts on study outcomes. The potential effects of
                    these efforts on study power should also be considered during the planning

                from a multi-disciplinary committee in order to develop it in a timely manner,
                assure appropriate training of staff, monitor delivery at the clinics, address the
                issues of participant disappointment, and finally, enhance attendance and ultimately
                retention. Without a &#x02018;perceived benefit,&#x02019; studies risk the loss of comparison group
                participants, particularly in long-term studies, that may jeopardize the entire
                study. During the first 4 years of follow-up, retention of DSEI participants was
                very high, but notquite as high as for the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention group.
                It is not known whether a greater investment in the DSEI early on would have
                produced equal retention rates for the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention and DSEI
                groups and the effect on longer-term retention rates remains to be seen. In
                retrospect, the amount of time and effort needed to develop and implement the Look
                AHEAD DSEI was underestimated initially. Furthermore, communication strategies
                across multiple clinic sites and committees were needed to insure consistent efforts
                toward the overall study goals. Other clinical trials may replicate this process by
                developing the comparison intervention sessions at the same time as the lifestyle
                intervention sessions, monitoring delivery, obtaining participant feedback, and
                providing support for the staff. If these steps are taken earlier, the comparison
                group retention rate could be even higher than in Look AHEAD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00017953.</p><p><bold><underline>Writing Group</underline></bold> Jacqueline Wesche-Thobaben, RN,
