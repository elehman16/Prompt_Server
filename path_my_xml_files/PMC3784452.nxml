Antibiotic overuse promotes the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Equally deleterious is antibiotic misuse, which may consist in failure to complete the prescribed course; skipped doses; or use of antibiotics left over from a previous illness, resulting in the intake of an inadequate dose without prior evaluation by a physician [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Such behaviors have been reported to increase antibiotic resistance rates, treatment failure rates, and costs [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common reasons for antibiotic prescription [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The number of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for ARTIs was estimated at 22.6 million in 1998 in the US, corresponding to a cost of about $726 million [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 2010 in France, 10.4 million antibiotic prescriptions were given to children, mainly for ARTIs [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In children, several studies in Europe and the US established that ARTIs were the main reason for antibiotic prescription in both private offices and pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2006 in the US, these infections were the reason for 78% of antibiotic prescriptions in children younger than 5 years [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Decreasing antibiotic overuse and misuse is a crucial objective in the fight against antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. International guidelines recommend multiple interventions including education for healthcare professionals and the public about the rational use of antibiotics [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. National campaigns to educate the public may improve antibiotic use [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but individually customized interventions delivered to patients and to the parents of pediatric patients may be required also [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The expectations and behaviors of parents can heavily influence physicians&#x02019; attitudes concerning antibiotic prescription [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], leading to antibiotic overuse in private practice and PEDs, whereas poor physician-patient rapport in primary care is associated with failure to fill prescriptions [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Good understanding of the treatment by the parents may significantly improve treatment adherence [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Greater parent satisfaction with pediatric care correlated with improved quality of care in the child via better comprehension of medical information and increased treatment adherence [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, in addition to being a major healthcare objective, satisfaction is associated with significant improvements in several important outcomes [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Visits to the PED provide an opportunity for health-promotion and family-education interventions [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To our knowledge, no studies on active therapeutic education about appropriate antibiotic use delivered to parents in PEDs have been published to date. Therapeutic education is used chiefly for patients with chronic diseases [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but interactive educational interventions delivered to patients by healthcare professionals may improve the knowledge and skills needed to optimize antibiotic use [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We evaluated a therapeutic education intervention designed to improve skills useful for a better adherence to prescribed antibiotics and delivered by clinical pharmacists to parents and children seen in a PED in Paris, France. We then conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of this intervention on parent satisfaction and attitudes about antibiotic use in children prescribed antibiotics for an ARTI or urinary tract infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075590.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075590.s001">Protocol S1</xref>. This randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups was conducted in the PED of the Robert Debr&#x000e9; Hospital (Assistance Publique-H&#x000f4;pitaux de Paris), Paris, France, a mother-child teaching hospital serving a culturally and linguistically diverse population.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by the appropriate biomedical research ethics committee in February 2009 (Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France; #IRB0006477; n&#x000b0; 08-071). No incentives to participation were offered. Oral informed consent was obtained from at least one of the parents or legal guardian; hereafter, the term &#x0201c;parents&#x0201d; is used for both. The study was registered on Clinicaltrial.gov (NCT00948779) on July 28, 2009. The education sessions were delivered to the parents accompanying the children.</p></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>Patients meeting study criteria were enrolled from Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., from February 2, 2009 to September 26, 2011.</p><p>Children between 1 month and 6 years of age were eligible if they were discharged from the PED with a prescription for 5 to 10 days of an oral liquid antibiotic to treat an ARTI (mainly tonsillitis, acute otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, or adenitis) or an urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis or cystitis). The criteria regarding diagnoses and treatment duration were chosen to produce a homogeneous population. No specific instructions were given to the physicians, who delivered the usual information about fever control and antibiotic treatment to the parents. Exclusion criteria were chronic conditions affecting drug dosing, suspected or known allergy to the prescribed antibiotics, and no telephone number for contacting the parents. No patient could be included more than once. Parents having poor knowledge of French were excluded because we did not have the resources needed to deliver education sessions in other languages. The parents of eligible patients were informed about the study orally and via a printed information sheet. To ensure blinding of the parents, the existence of two groups was not disclosed. Once informed consent was obtained, patients were enrolled by the PED physicians and referred to a clinical pharmacist on site. The children were allocated at random in a 1:1 ratio to therapeutic education on antibiotic use (the intervention group) or on fever control (the control group). A block randomization scheme with variable block length was previously generated using a computer. To ensure concealment, the clinical pharmacist used an Intranet connection to obtain the group assignment of each included patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention and control sessions were designed by a clinical pharmacist trained in therapeutic education, in compliance with 1998 World Health Organization (WHO) and 2007 French National Authority for Health (HAS) recommendations [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Five clinical pharmacists trained in therapeutic education delivered the sessions. The 30-minute face-to-face sessions with the parents of each patient were held in a private room. When both the mother and the father accompanied the child, both attended the educational session.</p><p>The contents of the intervention and control sessions were similar in terms of the teaching tools and methods but differed regarding the topic discussed, which was antibiotic use or fever control. The teaching goals for the families in the intervention group were as follows: good understanding of antibiotic therapy effects on the diagnosed disease, good understanding of treatment modalities, correct preparation and administration of the antibiotic (preventing spitting, masking the flavor&#x02026;), awareness of potential undesirable effects and ability to manage these effects, ability to explain the importance of the antibiotic treatment to all the child&#x02019;s caregivers, familiarity with the concept of generic antibiotics, and ability to specify to the pharmacist filling the prescription which flavor is desirable. The control session had the following teaching goals: good understanding of the pharmacological and physical means available for controlling fever, ability to use these means appropriately, ability to administer antipyretic medications to the child, and ability to explain the importance and modalities of pharmacological and physical fever-control measures to all the child&#x02019;s caregivers.</p><p>The pharmacists delivering the education used an interview grid to ensure standardization of the sessions. As the intention-to-treat approach was used, they could answer all the parents&#x02019; questions, even those on fever control in the intervention group and those on antibiotics in the control group. Sessions were organized according to the four stages recommended by the WHO: educational diagnosis, educational contract, education, and evaluation [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The educator acted as a resource and guide for the discussion: interactivity was encouraged. Drawing tools such as Barrows cards were created to support the sessions [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and illustrated information sheets were given to the parents at the end of the session. Each session covered five topics: (1) identification of knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors concerning prescribed treatments and comprehension of their effects; (2) mutual determination of objectives to be achieved by the session; (3) education about oral liquid preparation, administration, storage, and possible side effects; (4) maximizing adherence in everyday situations (Barrows cards exercise) and identifying the best dosing time during the day to minimize the risk of skipped doses; and (5) brief assessment of comprehension by the parents via an open question on what should be done to ensure effectiveness of the prescribed treatment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075590-t001">Table <bold>1</bold>

Pharmacists blinded to group allocation and trained to administer the questionnaire conducted the assessments. For the first assessment, at least three attempts to contact each family were made between day 14 and day 17 inclusive. The questionnaire consisted of 11 standardized structured questions on satisfaction and attitudes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075590-t002">Table <bold>2</bold>
</xref>). The items on attitudes consisted chiefly in questions about judicious antibiotic use that were derived from the questionnaire developed by Pechere et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and evaluated a combination of knowledge and practice. Replies were given using a 1-to-5 Likert scale. The response options for the satisfaction scale were 1, very dissatisfied; 2, mostly dissatisfied; 3, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 4, mostly satisfied; and 5, very satisfied. For the agreement scale, response options were 1, strongly disagree; 2, mostly disagree; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, mostly agree; and 5, strongly agree. Finally, options for the difficulty scale were 1, very difficult; 2, rather difficult; 3, rather easy; and 4, very easy. The second assessment was performed 5 to 7 months after the PED visit and served only to evaluate attitudes concerning antibiotic use [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The two groups were compared using the intent-to-treat approach and either parametric or nonparametric tests depending on the nature and distribution of the variables. Qualitative measures were compared using the chi-square test or exact Fisher test depending on variable distribution. For between-group comparisons of the number of correct answers to attitude questions on day 14 and at month 6, we used the Mann Whitney U test. A Poisson Generalized Estimating Equations model was used to estimate changes in the number of correct answers between the first and second assessments in both groups, to take the non-independence of the data into account. To look for potential bias, we performed an additional analysis comparing day-14 data in the two groups depending on whether a single parent or both parents attended the educational session. Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.

The effect of the session on antibiotic use might increase the likelihood of children receiving antibiotic therapy at home as prescribed by the physician.</p><p>The improved satisfaction about information on antibiotics received in the PED is encouraging, since dissatisfaction with explanations of medical problems or with treatment instructions given by the healthcare staff has a major influence on prescription filling by parents of children seen in PEDs [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, parent satisfaction with care is considered a good surrogate for several important aspects of quality of care, such as appropriateness of the therapeutic regimen [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both groups in our study received 30-minute face-to-face sessions, and satisfaction with information about fever control was better in the control group than in the intervention group, indicating that the operative factor was the content of the session and not the increased attention given to the family.</p><p>Failure to fill prescriptions given in the PED remains a major challenge [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. According to the International Forum on Antibiotic Resistance colloquium held in 2002, educational interventions about antibiotics are more likely to be effective if they aim to change behaviors rather than only to provide information [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A household survey done in Great Britain in 2003 showed that better knowledge of antibiotics was independently associated with finishing a course of antibiotic as prescribed [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our therapeutic education session on antibiotics was followed by improved attitudes about antibiotic use on day 14, compared to the control session, and the question &#x0201c;If my child does not take all the antibiotic prescribed, some of the germs may survive&#x0201d; was one of the two questions that showed the greatest improvements; the other was: &#x0201c;<italic>Leftover antibiotics can be saved for later use</italic>&#x0201d;. In a global survey of treatment non-adherence, awareness of the need to complete antibiotic courses and to discard any leftover antibiotics was associated with better adherence [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a key factor for minimizing the emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><p>Antibiotic treatments for acute infectious diseases are brief. Decreasing their misuse requires an improvement in behavior at the time of prescription, during the acute illness of the child, which is likely to induce anxiety in the parents. The interview performed 6 months later gave us an indication of parent attitudes at a distance from the acute episode, when they may have recovered from any initial anxiety. Therefore, the second interview consisted only in the 6 questions on attitudes of antibiotic use.</p><p>The improved attitudes about antibiotic use in the control group at the second assessment after 6 months compared to the first assessment after 14 days may suggest that the anxiety associated with the acute illness in the child adversely affected performance on the attitudes questionnaire. This possibility would support the provision of education at the time of the acute illness. A study involving a third assessment at the time of a subsequent ARTI or urinary tract infection would further support this hypothesis if attitudes was again found to differ between the two groups.</p><p>Another hypothesis is that during the 6-month interval the families may have received further information on the proper use of antibiotics. However, no educational intervention targeting the public was conducted in France during the period extending from inclusion of the first patient to study completion (February 2009 to September 2011). However, we did not investigate the effect of the first assessment, which may have increased parent awareness about proper antibiotic use.</p><p>Interestingly, the overall proportion of correct answers to questions on attitudes about antibiotic use was high in both groups compared to that in the adherent group studied by Pechere et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (e.g., 77.5% in our intervention group, 66.2% in our control group, and 52.9% in the adherent group of the earlier study for the question &#x0201c;<italic>Leftover antibiotics can be saved for later use</italic>&#x0201d;). One possible explanation may be the nationwide public education campaign on antibiotic use conducted in France shortly before our study [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Although the study intervention was associated with improved attitudes about antibiotic use, there was no difference in the outcome of the infections after 14 days. The most common diagnosis in the study patients was acute otitis media, as expected since this disease is the leading reason for antibiotic prescription in PEDs [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, for this disease, as well as for other upper respiratory tract infections, the systematic use of antibiotics is debatable, as clinical improvements seem related to antibiotic therapy in only a limited number of cases [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, we did not expect that our intervention could affect the clinical course. However, poor adherence to antibiotic treatment can increase the risk of carriage of non-penicillin-susceptible <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We nevertheless collected information on outcomes, because poorer outcomes might bias parent satisfaction with the antibiotic treatment.</p><p>At the time of the study, French guidelines recommended amoxicillin+clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In a randomized controlled study, parents of children seen at a PED for acute otitis media were told to wait 2 or 3 days without giving antibiotic treatment; one group was given a prescription of antibiotic therapy to be filled if the symptoms persisted and the other was instructed to seek follow-up care if needed [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. High levels of satisfaction were noted in both groups. However, this study did not involve education about antibiotic use [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In another randomized controlled trial, parents in a PED received education about antibiotics via either an animated video or the American Academy of Pediatrics pamphlet [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In neither group did the educational method involve interaction with healthcare professionals. Attitudes scores improved significantly in the education groups compared to the control group given no education, and the improvement lasted longer in the video group than in the pamphlet group [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Eight other educational interventions performed outside the PED have shown promising results that did not seem to occur at the expense of parent satisfaction [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One of them involved interaction between the parents and an educator [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Educational interventions to improve medication adherence for ARTIs can be categorized as educational, behavioral, organizational, or a mix of these components [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some studies obtained improvements with interventions consisting of a single component. However, interventions that combine several components, as used in our study, seem more effective [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, the intervention conducted by a pharmacist was well accepted by the parents, although it extended their stay in the PED. Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacist interventions in the emergency department can decrease treatment duration, healthcare costs, and medication errors, while at the same time improving antimicrobial stewardship [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of our study include the single-center design. The total numbers of patients with ARTIs and urinary tract infections seen in the PED during the study period were not available. A pharmacist was not available every day of the week or around the clock. We did not assess patient adherence to the prescribed treatment, and neither did we collect parameters known to affect adherence such as treatment regimen and antibiotic palatability [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Importantly, education was provided by a clinical pharmacist during a 30-minute face-to-face session. This facts limits the general applicability of the intervention, as the financial and human resources needed are unlikely to be available everywhere. However, the intervention could be either split into segments and delivered by nurses specialized in therapeutic education or conducted at the pharmacy during antibiotic dispensation.</p><p>That we were unable to obtain day-14 data for 21 (14%) intervention-group and 18 (12%) control-group patients may have affected our results. However, the intent-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome, in which missing data were replaced by unfavorable results, still showed better results in the intervention group. Although the trial was randomized, important predictors of attitude about antibiotic use were not measured such as parent educational level, previous exposure to antibiotic use, parent age, and socioeconomic status [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The efficacy of the randomization process in balancing these potential confounders is therefore uncertain, particularly among patients lost to follow-up. We cannot rule out a social desirability bias. However, the randomization process ensured that any differences between the groups were not systematic and then any difference between treatment groups was related to the intervention.</p><p>We included only children discharged with an antibiotic prescription. The objective of our intervention was not to decrease antibiotic use but, instead, to prevent the misuse of antibiotics by families, which can have a profound negative impact not only on the community, but also on individuals [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, we did not include parents who did not speak French. Beliefs and attitudes toward antibiotics may vary across cultures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, educational interventions delivered by clinical pharmacists in the PED were well accepted by families. An education session on antibiotic use was associated with high parent satisfaction and improved attitudes about judicious antibiotics use on day 14. However, no difference was found between the groups after 6 months. Our data suggest that educational interventions in PEDs may hold promise for decreasing the misuse of antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0075590.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
