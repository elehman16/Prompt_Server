Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic profile and its pattern of side effects may hinder a rapid dose escalation, a therapeutic strategy that might be utterly desirable in patients with OCD. In preclinical studies, the maximum plasma concentration and bioavailability of an extended-release (CR) formulation of fluvoxamine were, respectively, 38% and 16% lower than those of the standard (ie, non-CR) formulation. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the fluvoxamine CR formulation for the treatment of OCD in adults. This approval was based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 253 OCD patients in which fluvoxamine CR showed a consistently earlier onset of therapeutic effects than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as reported in previous studies. The use of the CR formulation of fluvoxamine allowed a particularly aggressive dosing strategy at the beginning of the titration phase, ie, treatment could be started with a single dose of fluvoxamine CR 100 mg at bedtime, while keeping the occurrence of side effects and the rate of compliance at levels comparable to those reported for the use of immediate-release fluvoxamine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>obsessive-compulsive disorder</kwd><kwd>fluvoxamine</kwd><kwd>fluvoxamine extended release</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluvoxamine maleate is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) that belongs to a distinct chemical series: the 2-aminoethyl oxime ethers of aralkylketones.<xref rid="b1-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Fluvoxamine maleate is structurally unrelated to other selective SRIs and to clomipramine.

Fluvoxamine was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the serotonin reuptake transporter in preclinical studies, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although there is some variability across studies, fluvoxamine appears to be a more potent inhibitor of <italic>in vitro</italic> serotonin reuptake than fluoxetine, but less powerful than paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram.<xref rid="b1-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Among the SRIs, fluvoxamine is one of the weakest inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake.<xref rid="b1-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, fluvoxamine maleate had no significant affinity for histaminergic, adrenergic, or muscarinic receptors, which are responsible for the various sedative, cardiovascular, and anticholinergic side effects commonly observed during treatment with many psychotropic drugs. We will now discuss the putative pathways through which fluvoxamine leads to symptom improvement of patients with OCD, including the modulation of serotonergic, dopaminergic, and sigma transporters or receptors.</p><sec><title>Serotonergic receptors</title><p>Only high doses of potent SRIs, such as clomipramine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram, are consistently effective in the treatment of OCD, particularly when administered for at least 12 weeks.<xref rid="b5-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, when patients with OCD who were successfully treated with clomipramine were switched in a double-blind fashion to desipramine, a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, they frequently relapsed.<xref rid="b6-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the same vein, the adding of desipramine to the therapeutic scheme of OCD patients did not lead to any additional improvement.<xref rid="b7-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It has thus been argued that the anti-OCD effect of the SRIs results largely from the inhibition of the serotonin reuptake process, rather than from a non-specific antidepressant mechanism.<xref rid="b8-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Indeed, several drug trials and meta-analytic studies have shown that the anti-OCD effect of SRIs is independent from the presence of depression.<xref rid="b10-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Recently, El Mansari and Blier<xref rid="b12-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> argued that the delayed therapeutic response to high doses of SRI in OCD is congruent with the time course of the desensitization of terminal 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors and of the increase in serotonin release in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). They further hypothesized that enhanced serotonin release in the OFC results both in a decrease of the sensitivity of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and in an activation of normosensitive postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-like receptors, a biological cascade that could underlie the therapeutic actions of SRIs in OCD. This model is further supported by the serendipitous beneficial effect in OCD of some hallucinogens with 5-HT<sub>2</sub> agonistic properties. Further, while low doses of the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonist risperidone has been shown to exert a positive therapeutic effect in SRI-resistant OCD patients, high doses of clozapine or risperidone cause an exacerbation of OCD symptoms, probably due to the antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors in OFC.<xref rid="b12-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Accordingly, Moresco et al<xref rid="b13-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found that fluvoxamine increased the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of fluoro-ethyl-spiperone, a high affinity 5-HT<sub>2</sub> serotonin receptor antagonist, in the frontal and occipital cortex of nine patients with major depressive disorder.</p><p>Molecular neuroimaging studies suggest that even small doses of fluvoxamine may exert significant serotonergic effects. For example, Suhara et al <xref rid="b14-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> observed that a dosage as low as 50 mg/day of fluvoxamine maleate, either administered as a single dose or over a 6-month period, was associated with approximately 80% of occupancy of the serotonin transporters. In a prospective study, Takano et al<xref rid="b15-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> performed positron emission tomography scans before and 5 hours, 26 hours, and 53 hours after the administration of 50 mg of fluvoxamine to 6 healthy male volunteers. Mean serotonin transporter occupancies were 72.9% &#x000b1; 4.9% at 5 hours, 50.3% &#x000b1; 11.0% at 26 hours, and 24.7% &#x000b1; 15.3% at 53 hours. Taken together, these findings suggest that while in low doses fluvoxamine occupies a significant percentage of serotonin transporters, in doses higher than 50 mg/day, like the ones that are usually required for the treatment of OCD, it likely recruits also other neurotransmitter systems or receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Dopaminergic receptors</title><p>It is likely that different SRIs (including fluvoxamine) and dopaminergic antagonists have similar effects on certain neurobiological systems. In a pharmacological fMRI study conducted by Takahashi et al<xref rid="b16-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> both fluvoxamine and sulto-pride, a D2 receptor antagonist, attenuated the activity in the amygdala of healthy volunteers during exposure to unpleasant pictures, although the two treatments had slightly different modulatory effects on other components of the neural circuit of emotional processing. Unlike suto-pride, fluvoxamine reduced activation in the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC), basal ganglia, and insula and induced greater activation in the temporal and parietal cortex.</p><p>Indeed, some authors have debated whether fluvoxamine and other SRIs exert their antiobsessional effects solely through an increase in the levels of serotonin or by an ultimate regulation of dopaminergic receptors.<xref rid="b17-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Accordingly, in a PET study, Moresco et al <xref rid="b18-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found that fluvoxamine treatment increased the availability of dopaminergic type 2 (D2) receptors in the dorsal and ventral striatum of patients with OCD who responded to treatment. Of note, after a 12-week treatment, responders had mean binding potential values closer to those of normal volunteers, while the non-responder patients did not show increases in binding potential values in the dorsal part of the basal ganglia. Therefore, there is some evidence suggesting that fluvoxamine is able to modify the dopaminergic system, in general, and the availability of striatal dopamine D2 receptors, in particular, in patients with OCD. In light of these results, the increase in the availability of receptors may be consequent to the reduction of dopamine concentration induced by fluvoxamine and other SRIs.<xref rid="b19-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sigma receptors</title><p>Sigma receptors are a unique set of proteins (&#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub>) located in different neurons throughout the brain, particularly within their endoplasmic reticulum (ER).<xref rid="b20-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While the functions of &#x003c3;<sub>2</sub> receptors are not well understood, the occupancy of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors by its agonists causes translocation of this receptor from the ER to peripheral areas (membranes) of neurons, where &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> regulates ion channels and the release of glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetyl-coline, among other neurotransmitters.<xref rid="b21-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In animal studies, fluvoxamine, best known for its serotonin-reuptake inhibition, exhibits the strongest affinity and highest level of occupancy of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors among all anti-OCD agents.<xref rid="b22-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Indeed, in a study by Ishikawa et al <xref rid="b23-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> 15 healthy individuals were submitted to two PET scans using the selective &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptor ligand [(11) C] SA4503 before and after a single dose of either fluvoxamine (50, 100, 150, or 200 mg) or paroxetine (20 mg). While fluvoxamine bound to &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors in all brain regions in a dose-dependent manner, paroxetine did not, thus suggesting that, at therapeutic doses, &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors may be specifically involved in the mechanisms of action of fluvoxamine.</p><p>Further, Egashira et al <xref rid="b24-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> found that fluvoxamine inhibits OCD-like behaviors in animal models (&#x0201c;marble-burying behavior&#x0201d;). In this experimental paradigm, burying begins as an appropriate, investigative activity but, after frustrated investigation of a non-reactive stimulus object (ie, the marble), it persists as a compulsive stereotypy. This observation is in line with the view that compulsive behaviors result from one&#x02019;s inability to achieve a sense of task completion.<xref rid="b25-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the study by Egashira et al<xref rid="b24-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> fluvoxamine inhibited burying behavior not only through the inhibition of the serotonin transporter, but also by means of the activation of &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors, while paroxetine, another SRI, inhibited this behavior mainly through the inhibition of the serotonin transporter. In fact, other selective &#x003c3;<sub>1</sub> receptors agonists, like the neurosteroids, were already found to inhibit other animal models of OCD.<xref rid="b20-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine</title><p>Fluvoxamine exhibits significant particularities in its pharmacokinetics, including the lack of pharmacological activity of its metabolites, a low degree of binding to plasma proteins, and a high affinity for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.<xref rid="b26-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>After oral administration, fluvoxamine is nearly completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the extent of the absorption is unaffected by the presence of food.<xref rid="b2-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In a single-dose crossover study involving 28 healthy subjects, fluvoxamine CR maximum plasma concentration and bioavailability were, respectively, 38% and 16% lower than those of the standard (ie, non-CR) formulation.<xref rid="b28-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>In a multiple-dose proportionality study, fluvoxamine CR capsules were administered to 20 healthy volunteers with doses ranging from 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day.

In this study, a particularly aggressive dosing strategy was adopted at the beginning of the titration phase: subjects who were randomly assigned to receive fluvoxamine CR began with a bedtime dose of 100 mg and were progressively titrated, in weekly increments of 50 mg (if tolerated), to a final bedtime dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/day over the first 6 weeks of treatment; thereafter, the dose remained constant for the duration of the double-blind period. The starting dose was twice the dose usually employed in earlier comparable studies of fluvoxamine IR in OCD. Hollander et al<xref rid="b53-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> demonstrated that fluvoxamine CR was significantly superior to placebo in all efficacy measures, including the change from baseline to endpoint in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity scores, as well as CGI-improvement scores and responder rate at endpoint. Unfortunately, this study did not report any attempt to establish the therapeutic plasma concentration range of fluvoxamine.</p><p>The magnitude of the decreases from baseline to endpoint in the Y-BOCS total score (fluvoxamine CR 8.5 &#x000b1; 0.7 [31.7% change] vs placebo 5.6 &#x000b1; 0.7 [21.2% change]) and CGI severity score (fluvoxamine CR 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.1 vs placebo 3.2 &#x000b1; 0.1) for subjects treated with fluvoxamine CR in this study were similar to those observed in previous studies with fluvoxamine IR,<xref rid="b37-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> fluoxetine,<xref rid="b56-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> paroxetine,<xref rid="b57-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and sertra-line.<xref rid="b58-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Also, the rates of remission were significantly higher in the fluvoxamine CR-treated patients than in the placebo group (44 versus 31% and 18 versus 8%, given Y-BOCS threshold values &#x0003c; 16 and &#x0003c;8, respectively). Of interest, while the differences between fluvoxamine IR and placebo emerged from the 4th to the 10th week of treatment in early studies of patients with primary OCD,<xref rid="b35-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the differences between fluvoxamine CR and placebo in Hollander et al<xref rid="b37-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> study achieved statistical significance at the second week of treatment both in the primary efficacy variable (ie, the Y-BOCS total score) and in the secondary efficacy variables (ie, CGI-score and responder rate). In other words, fluvoxamine CR showed a consistent earlier onset of therapeutic effects across different efficacy parameters when compared with the findings of previous studies involving other selective SRI. Unfortunately, however, no discontinuation study of fluvoxamine CR in OCD was conducted so far. Therefore, no information regarding the percentage and speed of relapse is available.</p><p>Hollander et al<xref rid="b53-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> proposed several possible explanations for the earlier onset of action of fluvoxamine CR. First, because fluvoxamine CR exhibits less circadian fluctuation in plasma levels (peak to trough concentration), patients may benefit from having drug concentrations that are above the minimally therapeutically effective one during most of the day. Second, because fluvoxamine CR has a lower maximal concentration compared with fluvoxamine after the same dosing, subjects could be started at a higher dosage of fluvoxamine CR but still enjoyed a similar tolerability profile, akin to a pulse loading strategy with clomipramine.<xref rid="b59-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Third, the more rapid dose escalation of fluvoxamine CR compared with conventional fluvoxamine may allow for earlier effects on gene expression, as has been suggested in pulse-loading intravenous treatment studies in OCD.<xref rid="b59-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p><p>The earlier response to fluvoxamine CR observed in patients with OCD must be viewed with caution. For example, in the study by Westenberg et al <xref rid="b60-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> who investigated the effectiveness of this formulation in patients with SAD, fluvoxamine CR was titrated in a similar fashion to that adopted in the OCD study<xref rid="b53-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> but differed from placebo only after the fourth week of treatment.</p><p>In fact, since both disorders were previously found to exhibit similar patterns of response to selective SRIs, we can only speculate about the reasons underlying this apparently inconsistent finding. First, the mean endpoint dose of fluvoxamine CR was 271 mg/day in the OCD study and 209 mg/day in the SAD study. Second, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, which was the primary efficacy variable in Westenberg et al<xref rid="b59-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> study, may be less sensitive to early changes exhibited by patients with SAD than Y-BOCS is to changes shown by patients with OCD. Finally, there may be some unidentified differences other than the diagnoses between the samples recruited for these studies. One way or another, further controlled studies are needed to elucidate whether the earlier onset of action of fluvoxamine CR in OCD patients is also found in patients with other anxiety or mood disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability of fluvoxamine CR</title><p>Fluvoxamine IR exhibits antiobsessional properties similar to those of other selective SRIs and clomipramine, but has a somewhat superior tolerability profile than clomipramine, particularly with respect to a lower incidence of anticholinergic effects and reduced cardiotoxic potential.<xref rid="b37-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, gastrointestinal adverse effects are seen more frequently with fluvoxamine IR than with tricyclic antidepressants.<xref rid="b2-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Indeed, in controlled trials in OCD and depression, the most commonly reported side effects likely to be related to fluvoxamine IR (ie, whose incidence is 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) were nausea (40% in active drug vs 14% in placebo), somnolence (22% in active drug vs 8% in placebo) and insomnia (21% in active drug vs 10% in placebo).<xref rid="b61-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p><p>Reduced fluctuations in plasma concentration observed during treatment with fluvoxamine CR may be associated with fewer side effects. The tolerability of fluvoxamine CR has been studied in two controlled trials of social anxiety disorder (N = 579)<xref rid="b60-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="b62-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and one trial of OCD (N = 124).<xref rid="b53-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In general, adverse event rates were similar in the two data sets. As for fluvoxamine IR, the most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of fluvoxamine CR for patients in social anxiety disorder were nausea (315%&#x02013;47% vs 6%&#x02013;15%), somnolence (22%&#x02013;31% vs 7%&#x02013;10%), insomnia (31%&#x02013;32% vs 11%&#x02013;15%), and asthenia (28% vs 13%).<xref rid="b60-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="b62-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> In both studies, no weight gain was observed for either treatment group, and at end point there were no differences between treatments on overall sexual function, as measured by the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale.<xref rid="b60-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="b62-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> By the same token, the most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of fluvoxamine CR and likely to be drug-related (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) for patients with OCD were insomnia (35% vs 20%), nausea (34% vs 13%), somnolence (27% vs 11%), asthenia (25% vs 8%), diarrhea (18% vs 8%), and anorexia (13% vs 5%).<xref rid="b53-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>As seen in the above-mentioned studies, even though the fluvoxamine CR starting dose was higher (100 mg/day) and taken once daily, the profile of side effects associated with fluvoxamine CR remained roughly the same of those seen in early fluvoxamine IR studies, in which lower, divided doses were employed.<xref rid="b37-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In the fluvoxamine CR study in OCD patients, while a higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment group (19%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events (as compared to 6% of the placebo treatment group), the discontinuation rate was comparable to that observed in previous studies with other selective SRIs (including fluvoxamine IR studies). Of note, there was no significant weight gain with fluvoxamine CR. Finally, as is true for other selective SRIs, the therapeutic index (ratio of lethal to therapeutic dose) of fluvoxamine is high and, consequently, the risk of death with intentional overdosage appears to be relatively low.<xref rid="b1-ndt-5-301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The pharmacokinetics of different SRIs, including fluvoxamine IR, and the associated pattern of side effects hinder a rapid dose escalation, a strategy that may be desirable in the treatment of patients with OCD. The CR formulation of fluvoxamine allows a more aggressive dosing strategy at the beginning of the titration phase and results in a pattern of side effects and compliance that is roughly the same of those seen in fluvoxamine IR. Nevertheless, since there is no head-to-head study comparing the efficacy of fluvoxamine CR to that of its IR formulation, it is not possible, at this point, to estimate differences in terms of treatment response between the two formulations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The authors declare no conflicts of
