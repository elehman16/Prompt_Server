We therefore designed a randomised clinical study to evaluate the effects of surgeon-performed US on patients admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>The study was conducted in the emergency department of Stockholm South General Hospital between February 2004 and June 2005. Stockholm South General Hospital is a public general hospital with 505 beds and a catchment area of about 600&#x02009;000 inhabitants. The ED of Stockholm South General Hospital has an average of 100&#x02009;000 visits per year by patients aged 15 years and older.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Training of surgeons participating in the study</title><p>Nine surgeons, all with at least 2 years&#x02019; experience of surgery after completing an internship, attended a 1-week course led by a radiologist specialist in US. After attending the course they received 3 weeks of training in the radiological department in abdominal US under the guidance of a specialist in US. The surgeons were trained in detecting gallbladder stones, wide bile ducts, hydronephrosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms, ovarian cysts, free abdominal fluid, pleura fluid collections and large abdominal masses. They also had good knowledge about&#x02014;and, in selected cases, were able to identify&#x02014;an inflamed appendix, diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction, liver disease and large kidney stones. After completing the US training, the study surgeon worked in the emergency department for 4 weeks managing the study patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>All patients aged 18 years or older admitted to the emergency ward for abdominal pain were considered eligible to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, previously diagnosed abdominal condition, acute conditions needing immediate care, inability to communicate with the investigator, drug or alcohol addiction and dementia.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Baseline management</title><p>A total of 800 patients were enrolled for the study. After inclusion, the patients were examined by the study surgeon. Medical history was taken and clinical examination and routine laboratory testing were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After receiving the laboratory results, the study surgeon set a first preliminary diagnosis on a form containing 36 different predefined diagnoses. The form was then put in a sealed envelope. The sealed randomisation envelope was then opened and the patient was randomised to surgeon-performed US or no surgeon-performed US.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><p>US examination was performed with one of two handheld 2.5&#x02013;5 MHz or 4.3&#x02013;6 MHz curved array transducers (Hawk 2102, transducers type 8801 and 8802, B-K Medical, Denmark) screening the entire abdomen. After US had been performed, the study surgeon completed a form with the results of the examination and gave a second preliminary diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Further management</title><p>The two groups were subsequently managed according to clinical routine as decided by the study surgeon. In both groups it was possible to request abdominal US from the radiological department, as well as complementary radiological examinations and blood tests if necessary, to provide secure medical care.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Follow-up and collection of data</title><p>All information on the patients collected in the emergency department was entered by the study surgeon on a case report form. Additional data about patients admitted to the hospital for inpatient care were collected from the patient records and entered on a complementary case report form designed for the admission period.</p><p>After discharge from the emergency department or hospital ward, all patients were contacted by telephone by a study nurse 4&#x02013;6 weeks after their first visit. The study nurse performed a structured interview including questions on state of health, performed and planned examinations, admission to other healthcare units and the patient&#x02019;s evaluation of the visit to the emergency department.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Outcomes, definition and measurement</title><sec id="s2i1"><title>Correct diagnosis</title><p>The correct diagnosis was defined as the final diagnosis given by a senior surgeon 6&#x02013;8 weeks after the patient had entered the study, based on information in the patient records. When determining the final diagnosis, the senior surgeon was not aware of the preliminary diagnosis set by the surgeon in the emergency department.</p><p>The final diagnosis was compared with the preliminary diagnosis given in the emergency department, with or without US examination. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the proportion of correct diagnoses given in the emergency department.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Contribution of US to the diagnosis</title><p>The diagnoses of the patients in the US group were further analysed to elucidate the way in which US had contributed. Five groups with different contributions were defined:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>US had contributed to the diagnosis either by changing an earlier incorrect diagnosis to a correct diagnosis or by confirming an earlier correct diagnosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>US was misleading, either by confirming an earlier incorrect diagnosis or by changing an earlier diagnosis (correct or other incorrect) to another incorrect diagnosis. All cases where the surgeon had missed or incorrectly set the diagnosis of any of the conditions that he or she was supposed to diagnose according to the goal of education was defined as misleading. If the surgeon had changed to or confirmed an incorrect diagnosis by US, it was defined as misleading even if the final diagnosis was not included in the education goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>US had no influence on making the diagnosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-specific abdominal pain (NSAP) was confirmed after US was performed. In this group US contributed to securing the diagnosis by a US examination that did not show any pathological findings leading to another diagnosis. In this group, NSAP was a correct diagnosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No correct diagnosis was made in the emergency department but US contributed to a correct diagnosis that was made later.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated using SamplePower 2.0 based on the results from a previous prospective study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and was set to detect a difference of nine percentage points in the proportion of correct diagnoses between the control and US groups (specifically 70% vs 79%). To detect this difference with 80% power at the 5% significance level (two-tailed), 400 patients were needed in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare the proportion of correct diagnoses between the intervention group and the control group (ie, the primary outcome measure); two-tailed p values of &#x0003c;0.05 were regarded as significant. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the difference between the proportions are based on the normal approximation. All analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol. SPSS V.14.0 was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 800 patients randomised in the study, data on one patient were missing due to loss of the case report form and eight patients in each group failed to meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 392 patients in the US group and 391 patients in the control group eligible for statistical analysis. Data for evaluating the primary hypothesis (relation between primary diagnosis and final diagnosis) were missing in 10 of the 392 in the US group and 11 of the 391 in the control group, leaving 382/380 for this specific analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bou-25-08-0486-f01">fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="bou-25-08-0486-f01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of randomisation and follow-up.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="BOU-25-08-0486-f01"/></fig><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>The groups were similar for all background factors except for referral pattern.

id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this large randomised study which assessed the use of US for diagnosing abdominal pain, a small but significant increase was seen in the frequency of correct diagnoses in patients undergoing surgeon-performed US.</p><p>The number of patients seeking medical care in the emergency department for abdominal pain is high. There is often a need for complementary radiological examinations in this group of patients, and waiting times for these examinations are often long. As more acute radiological examinations are performed, the waiting time for an elective radiological examination is increasing. If it was possible for the surgeon or emergency physician to perform bedside US, this might decrease the need for complementary radiological examinations and thereby give the radiologists more time for performing elective and specialised examinations.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is the large number of patients, with very few refusals and complete follow-up for the preliminary outcome. One possible weakness of the study design is that the examinations were not validated by a US examination performed by a radiologist. However, it was our intention that the study design should reflect possible real situations.</p><p>The final diagnoses differed to some extent, with a diagnosis of diverticulitis being twice as frequent in the patients who did not undergo US examination. The reported diagnostic accuracy for diverticulitis on a clinical basis varies, but it is not in the lowest range of diagnostic accuracy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> This difference would therefore probably not influence the results of our study.</p><p>Apart from the US examination itself, the reason for the higher number of correct diagnoses in the US group could be the fact that these patients had one additional examination since it is natural to palpate the patient&#x02019;s abdomen and speak to the patient when performing US. Nevertheless, in this study we wanted to examine the real situation in the emergency department, and this additional time with the patient would, of course, also be the situation in clinical practice.</p><p>An earlier study has shown that bedside US has a significant impact on diagnostic certainty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> Our study has shown that US examination contributes, not only by leading to a correct diagnosis but also by confirming an already correct diagnosis and thereby increasing diagnostic certainty. The number of patients in whom US was misleading was quite high but substantially smaller than the proportion in whom US was helpful. These numbers were similar&#x02014;although in the higher range&#x02014;to the results from other studies evaluating the contribution of early US performed by a radiologist, where the proportion of examinations leading to an incorrect diagnosis ranged between 2% and 11%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Of the 10.2% misleading cases, only in three cases was a correct specific diagnosis changed to an incorrect diagnosis and&#x000a0;in eight cases a correct diagnosis of NSAP was changed to an incorrect diagnosis. This&#x000a0;is a small group but should be considered in the&#x000a0;overall picture if&#x000a0;US is&#x000a0;implemented. However, we believe that the&#x000a0;higher number of correct diagnoses with US&#x000a0;could justify this&#x000a0;group of misclassified patients.</p><p>Education of the surgeon or emergency physician performing US is of great importance and has been widely debated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> Guidelines produced by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) in 1994 called for a minimum of 150 total US examinations and 40 h of didactic instruction, including gynaecological and cardiovascular US training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> The US training in our department includes 40 h of didactic training and 120 h of abdominal US scanning on patients referred for US, all evaluated by a specialist in US. We think that this training is comparable to that recommended in the SAEM guidelines and consider that the knowledge in basic US achieved by the surgeons is reliable, even though there was no regular examination at the end of the training period. It is important to realise that, when surgeons and emergency physicians perform US in the emergency department, it is used as a complement to patient history, physical examination and laboratory tests for making a diagnosis and deciding about further management. Education and training for this purpose will differ from that of the radiologist, whose role as a specialist performing US with specific aims will still be of great importance for diagnosing patients as well as for intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study shows that surgeon-performed US significantly increases diagnostic accuracy in patients with abdominal pain attending the emergency department.
