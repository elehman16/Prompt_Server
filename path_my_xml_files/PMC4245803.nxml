Research indicates that maintaining contact either via letter or postcard with at-risk adults following discharge from care services can reduce reattempt risk. Feasibility trials demonstrated that intervention through text message was also effective in preventing suicide repetition amongst suicide attempters. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of text message intervention versus traditional treatment on reducing the risk of suicide attempt repetition among adults after self-harm.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study will be a 2-year multicentric randomized controlled trial conducted by the Brest University Hospital, France. Participants will be adults discharged after self&#x02013;harm, from emergency services or after a short hospitalization. Participants will be recruited over a 12-month period. The intervention is comprised of an SMS that will be sent at h48, D7, D15 and monthly. The text message enquires about the patients&#x02019; well-being and includes information regarding individual sources of help and evidence-based self help strategies. Participants will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. As primary endpoint, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide in each group at 6&#x000a0;months. As secondary endpoints, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide at 13&#x000a0;month, the number of suicide attempts in the intervention and control groups at 6 and 13&#x000a0;month, the number of death by suicide in the intervention and control groups at month 6 and 13. In both groups, suicidal ideations, will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. Medical costs and satisfaction will be assessed at month 13.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the design and deployment of a trial SIAM; an easily reproducible intervention that aims to reduce suicide risk in adults after self-harm.

Post-crisis management of suicidal patients varies from hospital discharge to forced hospitalization. Hospitalization rate after suicide attempt varies from 25 to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Fourteen to 25% of SAs treated at an emergency department (ED) reattempt suicide within the 1&#x02013;2 years following discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Outreach monitoring interventions via mail or phone facilitate access to care in case of recurrence in post-acute crisis patients discharged from the ED. Several studies on outreach interventions for suicidal patients have been published since 2001. The pioneer intervention was proposed by Motto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and was based on postal contact. They proposed a follow-up in fifteen years after having started the inclusions in 1969. The objective of the postal contact was to show the patient that someone was concerned about his or her situation and maintain positive feelings towards him or her. After 5&#x000a0;years, a significant decrease in suicide related deaths was observed in the contacted group (versus no-contact group) of high-risk patients who refused on-going treatment. Carter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] programmed automated sent postcards. In the year following the suicide attempt, the authors reported a lower number of relapse in the contacted group, especially among women.</p><p>These positive results led to other studies exploring the effectiveness of telephone outreach (Vaiva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). The telephone contact at one month proved, in per protocol analysis, to reduce the number of suicidal reattempts by about half over the course of one year (12% versus 21.6% in the control group). The post-hoc analysis showed no effect of the contact in first-attempters. The proposal of telephone contact was very well accepted and positively perceived by the population of this study.</p><p>In the EDGE project, a hotline was available to participants 24&#x000a0;hours a day, 7&#x000a0;days a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the intervention group, suicide attempters repeaters rate did not differ significantly from that in the control group (15.1% vs. 17.3% at one year, 21.2% vs. 22.8% at two years). However, there was a lower number of reattempts in intervention group among suicide attempters repeaters (incidence risk ratio 0.55 at one year, and 0.49 at two years).</p><p>Vaiva and Walter proposed to construct a case management algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This &#x000ab;ALGOS&#x000bb; monitoring algorithm is based on the two interventions that showed a significant reduction in the number of SA repeaters: systematic telephone contact (ineffective in first-attempters) and &#x000ab;crisis card&#x000bb; (information card providing a 24/7 reachable phone number, effective only in first-attempters). Participants that were not contacted during phone call periods and participants that refused proposed healthcare can benefit from the &#x000ab;short letters&#x000bb; of Motto or the &#x000ab;postcards&#x000bb; of Carter.</p><p>A Chinese study published in 2010 proposed to use a different type of intervention that involved sending text messages to suicidal patients after discharge from the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. They sent 15 patients four text messages for four weeks following a suicide attempt. The text of the message varied for each transmission but the four text messages were the same for all patients. Although this type of intervention proved to be effective, management of large patient populations was not possible with the proposed device.</p><p>Taking into consideration the strengths and pitfalls of each of these strategies, we developed a software program that allows the transmittance of text messages to SAs. The SIAM (suicide intervention assisted by messages) software that we developed aims to simplify the inclusion of the patients and to have an optimized text sending. We assessed the technical feasibility and acceptability of this device in a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Text messages provide several characteristics of existing monitoring strategies for suicide attempt repeaters. Using our software, we personalized the messages as recommended by Motto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and reached patients earlier than with a letter. Our software program allows us to readily personalize each message according to the required level of care. We clearly identify care services as the senders of the messages, as would have been done in a letter. Call-back numbers proposed in our messages are available 24&#x000a0;h per day and 7&#x000a0;days per week, in line with the contact strategy proposed by Evans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In comparison to the contact strategies by letter, access to our service was made easier as the patient simply had to press the call button on his/her telephone to contact us upon receiving the text message. Furthermore, sending a message with our device is 10 times cheaper than sending a postcard or a letter. The utilization of this monitoring system does not require the action of a clinician. All messages are written and scheduled before discharge and automatically sent over the monitoring period. Despite the variation in suicidal behaviour across the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the worldwide dispersion of mobile phones could offer new perspectives in suicide reattempt prevention. As text messages utilize several characteristics of interventions that have significantly reduced the number of suicide reattempts, we propose to assess its efficacy on reducing suicide reattempt in SA population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to determine whether the receipt of a text message sent regularly over a six-month period can reduce suicidal and self-harming behaviour among SAs.</p><p>We hypothesize that the routine reception of a text message during a six-month period will:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Decrease the proportion of reattempters at 6 and 13&#x000a0;months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decrease the number of total reattempts at 6 and 13&#x000a0;months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decrease suicide deaths;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decrease suicidal ideations;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decrease intervention costs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improve satisfaction through care services.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a 2-year multicentric randomized controlled trial conducted by the Brest University Hospital, France.

It is a short, structured diagnostic interview developed for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. With an administration time of approximately 15&#x000a0;minutes, it is the structured psychiatric interview of choice for psychiatric evaluation and outcome tracking in clinical psychopharmacology trials and epidemiological studies.

Postal and phone interventions have shown efficacy in prevention of suicide reattempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This low-cost and transferable SMS intervention has the potential to reach a large number of people who are traditionally hard to reach and treat. Non-compliant patients, especially young people, could be an interesting target of such a monitoring device. The SMS allows the health care team to keep in touch with people that are not reachable by existing contact strategies. This intervention is not a substitute for treatment. It may be used as a useful additional or alternative to standard care when people refuse other forms of treatment. Even though we used a web system to deploy our text monitoring device, our main goal is to encourage human to human contact between SAs and health care providers. The absence of social relationship cannot be completely replaced by a text message care providing service. However, it is essential for ED and PU staff to maintain contact with patients after a suicide attempt. The beneficial effects of this therapeutic monitoring intervention can be utilized as a long-term follow-up for SAs by allowing them to feel continuously cared for by the PU and ED staff. We believe that this monitoring tool can be used shortly after discharge from medical care centers in prevention of high-risk post-acute suicide. The use of this type of suicide intervention tool also lends itself to the development of more complex programs such as a mobile app or intervention website. These additional resources may also offer effective opportunities to maintain contact with SAs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors (SB, AZ, PC, GV, EBC, PV, MG, MW) declare that they have no competing interests:</p><p>- In the past 5&#x000a0;years, they didn&#x02019;t receive reimbursements, fees, funding, or salary from an organization that may in any way gain or lose financially from the publication of this manuscript.</p><p>- They don&#x02019;t hold any stocks or shares in an organization that may in any way gain or lose financially from the publication of this manuscript, either now or in the future.</p><p>- They don&#x02019;t receive reimbursements, fees, funding, or salary from any organization that holds or has applied for patents relating to the content of the manuscript.</p><p>- They don&#x02019;t have any other financial or non-financial competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Authors SB, AZ and MW were all involved in the conception of the study and made substantial contributions to the study design.
