The most frequently used method for identifying learning problems in children is discrepancy between ability and achievement; this model has often been criticized.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The present system of education and the shortage of trained manpower have often resulted in the under-identification of learning difficulties in children. This problem, unattended to, can have serious fallouts in the mental health of the growing child. Clinic-based studies by Karande <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] have highlighted the need for early identification and intervention for children with learning problems.</p><p>There have been several studies on neuropsychological reasons for problems in school-related skills.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Attention[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and working memory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] are functions that have been extensively researched. Information processing deficits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] have been identified in children with adequate achievement. Remediation for children with academic difficulties has traditionally concentrated on strategies such as multi-sensory teaching, overlearning, auditory rehearsal and aids such as charts, maps and electronic notebooks. The use of computers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and video games[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] has been recent advancements in rehabilitation.</p><p>Scholastic problems in children are a significant source of stress for the child and the family and may thus be a good starting point for intervention.</p><p>This pilot study tries to assess the usefulness of a computer-based intervention program for children identified as being average in academic performance. The program targets the enhancement of neuropsychological functions, such as attention, visual recognition, working memory, and response inhibition, through training. The effect of this intervention was assessed on variables such as cognitive functioning and academic performance of the child. The results of the study will help in deciding the protocol for the final study.</p><p>This is also an exploratory attempt to find out whether training in one cognitive skill can affect performance in another. It is expected that strengthening the core neuropsychological functions through various tasks would provide the child with better organization, processing, and storage skills. This &#x0201c;functional readiness&#x0201d; would in turn help the child cope better at academic tasks with positive social and emotional fallouts.</p><p>The study was also planned to devise simple but effective ways of secondary prevention at the level of the school. Computers are increasingly available in schools and harnessing them for therapeutic purposes would help address some of the gaps in the delivery of services for children with difficulties in learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Research design</title><p>A before&#x02013;after experimental design with controls was adopted for the present study. This involved a pre assessment of the dependant variables in the two matched groups, an intervention for one of the groups and a post assessment of the same variables in both the groups. The dependant variables under study were cognitive functions of the children and marks obtained by them in the school exams.</p><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Objective</title><p>The major objective of the study was to assess the effect of a computer-based cognitive enrichment program on the intellectual and scholastic performance of children.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>It was hypothesized that there would be an improvement in the intellectual and scholastic performance of children who underwent the computer-based intervention, as compared to the group which did not undergo the training.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample</title><p>This study was carried out between June 2005 and March 2006.</p><p>The training was to take place in the hospital, and hence, 15 schools within a radius of 5&#x02013;6 km from the hospital were selected. The schools authorities were contacted by telephone, and a letter detailing the program was sent to the respective principals. Based on this information, parents of 34 children contacted the researcher; 18 matched the criteria for inclusion and these children were included after obtaining written informed consent from their parents. These children enrolled in the program at different points in time and six dropped out after the initial sessions. The reasons cited for non-continuance included difficulty of regularly bringing the children to the hospital, employment in parents and illnesses in the family. Twelve children (average age = 9.5 years), who completed 20 sessions of training over 4 months, formed the experimental group. For the control group, data from nine children (average age = 10 years), matched for age and class, were taken; this group did not undergo the intervention. Random allocation of children into the two groups was not possible due to the high drop-out rate. However, every attempt was made to match the groups in terms of age and socioeconomic status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

The program is aimed at multiple neuropsychological functions such as visual recognition (characters, words, and numbers), spatial comparison, response inhibition, continuous performance and sequencing (temporal and alphanumeric). The tasks are presented by the computer, which facilitates to increase the difficulty level of each task in a measured and preset manner. The program allows increasing the difficulty level by small quantities every day/session so that the subject gradually learns to perform more and more difficult cognitive tasks. Seven such tasks were chosen, each with duration of 5&#x02013;7 minutes. Each training session lasted for 35&#x02013;40 minutes. The seven tasks were word identification, alphabet presentation, working memory, continuous performance, visuo-spatial comparison, temporal sequencing and response inhibition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Record of marks obtained from the respective schools, based on which an average mark was calculated.</p></list-item></list>

When the groups were compared with each other, no significant differences emerged. A similar trend was noticed in academic performance, where the improvement within the experimental group was not found to be significant when the groups were compared. The absence of statistical significance between groups could have been due to heterogeneity (in terms of age and class) of the group and the small group size. The use of computers in the experimental group could be a potential placebo, as the motivation of the children and their active involvement in the intervention could have contributed to the difference. The use of computer games or computer-aided academic programs in the control group would have minimized this effect. However, this was not considered ethical and hence the use of passive controls was used.</p><p>The results of the study are promising because a brief computer-aided training appears to have resulted in some improvement in intellectual and academic performance within the group that was trained.</p><p>The results of this pilot study have helped in deciding the protocol for the main study &#x02013; procedure for selection, intervention tasks and sample. It has also helped establish the usefulness of computer-based intervention in children. Apart from the standardized administration, level of control, accuracy in recording of responses and cost-effectiveness, it is an intervention where children are active participants in the training process. If similar trends are replicated in the main study, it has the scope of being used at a more inclusive level, to minimize learning problems in young children. Such interventions will help to at least partially address the learning needs of children who struggle at school and are not readily identified as potentially at risk.</p><p>The study has several limitations &#x02013; small sample size, lack of active controls, assessment by the researcher rather than by a person who was blind to the purpose of the study and heterogeneity of schools the children studied in. However, it is a preliminary attempt to offer an innovative intervention program for children who perform at an average scholastic level in the younger classes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We acknowledge Prof. C.
