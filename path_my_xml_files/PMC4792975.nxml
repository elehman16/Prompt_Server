functions of community-dwelling elderly people in a rural area when combined with home
exercise with self-monitoring. [Subjects] The subjects were community-dwelling elderly
people in a rural area of Japan. [Methods] One group (n = 50) performed group exercise
combined with home exercise with self-monitoring. Another group (n = 37) performed group
exercise only. Low-frequency group exercise (warm-up, exercises for motor functions, and
cool-down) was performed in seven 40 to 70-minute sessions over 9 weeks by both groups.
Five items of motor functions were assessed before and after the intervention. [Results]
Significant interactions were observed between groups and assessment times for all motor
functions. Improvements in motor functions were significantly greater in the group that
performed group exercise combined with home exercise with self-monitoring than in the
group that performed group exercise only. Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant
differences in 3 items of motor functions. No significant improvements were observed in
motor functions in the group that performed group exercise only. [Conclusions] Group
exercise combined with home exercise with self-monitoring improved motor functions in the
setting of low-frequency group exercise for community-dwelling elderly people in a rural
area.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor functions</kwd><kwd>Rural area</kwd><kwd>Self-monitoring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interventions have been implemented to improve motor functions among community-dwelling
elderly people, and their effectiveness has been examined in North America since the 1990s.
Gillespie et al.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported in their
Cochrane systematic review that exercise programs were important factors for decreasing the
fall rates of community-dwelling elderly people. Reductions in motor functions (muscle
strength and balance) have previously been identified as risk factors of falls<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, the risk of which was decreased by an
intervention that improved motor functions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Buchner et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>
and Hornbrook et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that
high-strength muscle training (6 months, 3 times a week) for the lower limbs was also
effective. Most interventions to improve motor functions have consisted of 2&#x02013;3 sessions per
week or more, covered a period of 6 months to one year, and were provided by employed
service instructors. However, difficulties have been associated with securing sufficient
human resources to provide these services in rural areas, in which depopulation and aging
advance together. Even if service providers can be employed, the transportation network of
these communities is often insufficient, and travelling to the service center on a regular
basis to receive instructions represents a challenge for elderly people. Therefore, motor
functions of the elderly need to be improved using low-frequency interventions. This study
examined the effectiveness of low-frequency group exercise which was combined with home
exercise and self-monitoring, in a rural area.</p><p>Self-monitoring assists in the formation and maintenance of healthy behaviors by enabling
self-reinforcement through concrete and objective assessments of the self, including
observations or using devices that record behaviors and feelings<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Baker<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
previously reported that self-monitoring was effective as part of an exercise-based
weight-loss program for health enhancements. Braveta et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that self-monitoring using a pedometer improved
physical activity. Based on these findings, self-monitoring is expected to be a useful
technique for improving the psychological condition of subjects, especially under conditions
in which only minimal interventions are available by the service provider.</p><p>Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to examine whether low-frequency group
exercise combined with home exercise and self-monitoring improved the motor functions of the
community-dwelling elderly people of a rural area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects consisted of community-dwelling elderly people aged 65&#x02005;years or older who were
recruited with the cooperation of the Murakami City Senior Citizens Clubs (2,999 members).
The 130 subjects responded to announcements made by the clubs to all members, and the
secretariat of the clubs subsequently created a subject list. The subjects were recruited in
two different years. The group recruited in 2013 performed low-frequency group exercise and
home exercise, combined with self-monitoring for motor functions (GHE-SM group), while the
group recruited in 2012 performed low-frequency group exercise alone (GE group). The GE
group was recruited in March 2012 and the GHE-SM group was recruited in March 2013, to
prevent overlap of subjects in the two groups. At the time of the recruitment, subjects were
not informed as to whether they would be using self-monitoring.</p><p>One hundred thirty subjects participated in this study. Ten subjects were subsequently
excluded due to disabilities associated with ambulation and/or motor functions. In the
GHE-SM group, 68 subjects applied and 50 subjects completed the intervention including home
exercise, self-monitoring, and assessments: 5 subjects withdrew and the attendance of 13
subjects was poor. In the GE group, 52 subjects applied, 42 subjects completed the exercise,
and 37 subjects were analyzed because 5 subjects could not attend the assessment at the
endpoint. All subjects were independent in their daily life, and were able to go out from
their own houses. Applicants with disabilities and impaired ambulation were excluded,
including those who used a cane, had paralysis due to cerebrovascular disorders, and
arthralgia due to rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Selection of subjects</p><p>One hundred thirty people participated in this study.

functions were assessed before and after the 9-week intervention period, but not during it.
Group exercise was performed by all members who participated on that day, and consisted of a
warm-up, exercises for motor functions, and a cool-down. The same physical therapist
instructed the exercises throughout the study. The group exercise consisted of ten exercises
targeting the trunk and leg muscles, which are necessary for essential movements such as
walking or standing up, and were taken from the 19 exercises described previously by
Fiatarone et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> The effectiveness of the
ten exercises was previously demonstrated in the Japanese Onishi model<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intensity of the exercise was set at a moderate
strength (perceived as somewhat hard) according to the Rating of Perceived Exertion scale by
Borg<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise intensity was adjusted
using weights. The subjects started with eight different exercises, doing one set for each,
and then gradually increased the number of sets by session 3, adding two more exercises by
session 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>). In the final two sessions (6
and 7), subjects performed two sets of ten different exercises. The exercise time was
gradually increased because the content of the session was different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The subjects in the GHE-SM group were instructed to perform the group exercise menu at home
over a period of nine weeks and record the degree of compliance of the exercise on
self-monitoring forms. Self-monitoring forms were partially changed from the manual<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare of Japan. Subjects were instructed to take records every day. The number of sets
and kinds of exercises performed at home were set beforehand and subjects were instructed to
record the degree of compliance of the exercise using four levels (Self-monitoring score):
&#x0201c;4&#x0201d; performed the entire exercise, &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; performed more than half of the exercise, &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;
performed less than half of the exercise, and &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; did not perform any exercise.
Self-monitoring records were checked by the same staff before the group exercise. When
subjects were unable to perform the home exercise on a given day, subjects noted the reasons
why. Instructions on the methods of home exercise were provided individually.</p><p>Age and gender were recorded, activities of daily living were assessed using the Tokyo
Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and physical activity habits were collected by
questionnaire. Motor functions were assessed two times: before the intervention, as a
baseline, and within two weeks of the end of the intervention. Trained staff measured motor
functions, but were not blinded to the group allocation. In reference to the assessment
standard of the manual<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> issued by the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the following assessments of motor functions were
performed: knee extension muscle strength (Muscle), standing on one leg with eyes open
(Standing), functional reach (FR)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
timed &#x0201c;Up and Go&#x0201d; test (TUG)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 5-m
normal walk time (Walking)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. All five
items were measured twice in order to optimize the data. The upper limit of the Standing was
set as 120 seconds. Two measurements were performed on the same leg. The assessment of
Muscle was performed using an isometric method, as in the preliminary study<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Footedness (preferred leg) was determined
as the leg used for better ball-kicking. Higher values were used for Muscle, Standing, and
FR, and lower values for TUG and Walking.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the <italic>t</italic>-test for age, Wilcoxon&#x02019;s
signed-rank test for TMIG-IC, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for gender. Pre-intervention
assessments were compared between two groups using Student&#x02019;s t-test in order to identify
differences at baseline. Differences between the GHE-SM and GE groups were examined by
repeated analysis of variance with age and gender as covariates (ANCOVA). The primary
analysis was a per protocol analysis. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted
using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) technique. The Bonferroni method was
used for post-hoc tests. All statistical tests were computed using SPSS for Windows Version
22.</p><p>The study design conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethical
Review Board of the Niigata University of Rehabilitation (Approval number 36). Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences were observed in the attributes of the subjects or in the

with home exercise with self-monitoring. This result it beneficially improved the motor
functions of the community-dwelling elderly people of a rural area. The subjects of this
study were health conscious and comprised healthy elderly people who were still
participating actively in various exercises. The results of this study and their
implications are discussed below.</p><p>Since no significant differences were observed in age, gender, activities of daily living
(TMIG-IC), occurrence of falls, or motor functions at the baseline between the two groups,
the observed effects in the GHE-SM group were clear. The reliability of the assessment tool
for motor functions conducted before and after the intervention has been demonstrated by
previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. All subjects eagerly performed the exercise program. However, some
data were missing due to cancellations, dropouts, and accidental absences from the exercise
class. Regarding the imputation of missing data, the baseline data was considered to not
change at the endpoint because no or rare attendance was not expected to affect the motor
functions of the active elderly subjects during the 9-week intervention. Thus, the
intention-to-treat analysis was conducted using BOCF methods. The ITT analysis also showed
that significant improvements were achieved in each motor function item in the GHE-SM group.
These results reinforced self-monitoring enhancing the effectiveness of GE.</p><p>According to Guralnik et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>,
functional mobility, which includes walking ability or dynamic balance, is an essential
factor that determines the independence of elderly people. Supporting and moving the body is
easily evaluated by the TUG test, which is known to be highly reliable and its result is
related to muscular strength of the lower limbs, balance, and walking ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, TUG also improved
significantly in the GHE-SM group. This result indicates there were improvements in
functional mobility, which manifested as improved muscular strength, balance, and walking
ability.</p><p>Although both groups participated in group exercise at the facility at the same time with
the same low frequency, significant differences were detected in motor functions in the
GHE-SM group at the second assessment. These improvements in motor functions led to
increased exercise time in the GHE-SM group, which performed home exercise with
self-monitoring in addition to group exercise. Subjects in both groups were originally
healthy, and this is one of the reasons why improvements were not observed with once-a-week
group exercise alone. Additional home exercise with self-monitoring in the GHE-SM group may
have contributed to improvements in physical function.</p><p>Improvements in the motor functions of subjects in GHE-SM were markedly smaller than those
in previous studies, in which 10&#x02013;60% improvements were reported in muscular strength using
heavy loads and a high-frequency program<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The subjects exercised at home and recorded it regularly. Their frequency of stumbling
decreased, and standing became easier; therefore, the low-frequency intervention resulted in
improvements in activities of daily living. The intervention performed by the GHE-SM group
led to the formation of physical activity habits and improvements in activities of daily
living. In the present study, home exercise with self-monitoring enabled introspection,
self-assessment, and self-reinforcement, which allowed home exercise to become an automatic
behavior, thereby increasing the amount of exercise performed. This study may have clinical
significance in confirming the preventive effects of group exercise combined with home
exercise with self-monitoring even when performed at a low frequency by healthy elderly
subjects in rural areas with a limited number of specialists.</p><p>There were some limitations of the present study. The motor functions of subjects showed
relatively high scores at the baseline assessment, which suggests that the current sample of
elderly people was healthier than the average elderly population. This may have contributed
to acceptance by our subjects and led them to engage in self-monitoring without strong
objections. Due to the selection bias of the present study, the effects of these
interventions need to be examined with elderly people who have low exercise awareness as
well as with frail elderly people, for whom exercise may assist in preventing an increased
need for nursing care in the future. The lack of blinding at the assessment of motor
functions is another limitation of the study.</p><p>Rural areas facing the double burden of depopulation and aging often have difficulties in
securing specialized human resources to ensure the mobility of elderly people. Therefore,
the development of a useful strategy in this area is essential. The results of the present
study suggest that community-dwelling elderly people in a rural area benefit from
low-frequency group exercise combined with home exercise with self-monitoring. Furthermore,
these programs may improve motor functions in a relatively short period.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gillespie</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Gillespie</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Interventions for preventing falls in older people living
