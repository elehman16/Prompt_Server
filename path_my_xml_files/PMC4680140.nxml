Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferation-inducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75&#x02005;mg or atacicept 150&#x02005;mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4&#x02005;weeks, then weekly for 48&#x02005;weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Enrolment in the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75&#x02005;mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150&#x02005;mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There was no difference between atacicept 75&#x02005;mg and placebo for flare rate or time to first flare.

The authors suggested that these results indicate that the benefits of conventional therapies (meaning steroids and immunosuppressives) have been maximised. The need to identify novel therapies with improved risk/benefit ratios remains, particularly for those responding inadequately to this approach. The use of biological drugs targeting key molecules or cells has yet to revolutionise the treatment of patients with SLE.</p><p>Several strategies have targeted B-lymphocytes due to their important role in autoantibody production, autoantigen presentation and immune dysregulation through cytokine secretion.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The notion of directly attacking B-cells using rituximab (which binds the CD20 molecule on B-cell surfaces) seemed attractive, with numerous case series reporting success in &#x02018;hard-to-treat&#x02019; SLE patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, subsequent controlled trials of rituximab were disappointing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> An alternative approach to B-cell-directed therapy involves using a monoclonal antibody to a B-cell-activating factor known as B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), a cytokine that promotes B-cell proliferation and differentiation. In two randomised, controlled Phase III trials,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> anti-BLyS (belimumab) plus standard-of-care (SOC) therapy demonstrated statistically significant benefit compared with SOC alone in patients with primarily cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of SLE. Consequently, the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.</p><p>Atacicept is a fusion protein containing the extracellular, ligand-binding portion of the receptor TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin-ligand (CAML)-interactor) and the modified Fc portion of human IgG that blocks BLyS (like belimumab) and another B-cell activating factor, known as a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> BLyS and APRIL levels are increased in patients with SLE,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggesting that dual blockade by atacicept may be more potent than blockading BLyS alone and has the benefit of targeting long-lived plasma cells in addition to B cells.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Here, we report the results of a randomised Phase II/III trial of atacicept that sought to determine the efficacy and safety of atacicept in the prevention of flares in SLE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial (EudraCT: 2007-003698-13; NCT00624338) of atacicept in patients who originally had moderate-to-severe SLE exempting those with renal or central nervous system (CNS) disease. Informed consent, trial protocol and all substantial amendments were obtained from all patients in accordance with the relevant human patients&#x02019; Institutional Review Boards. The trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable local regulations as well as with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>In order to evaluate better the effect of atacicept on the development of new flares, patients were administered prednisone or equivalent corticosteroid starting at 60&#x02005;mg daily for 2&#x02005;weeks (for patients with one or more British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A scores) and starting at 20&#x02005;mg/day daily for patients with one or more BILAG B scores but no A scores. The steroid dosage was reduced from the start of week 3 in all patients (according to protocol) down to 7.5&#x02005;mg daily at week 10. Patients achieving BILAG C or D scores in all systems at week 10 without any new A or B scores by week 12 (n=461) while on 7.5&#x02005;mg of daily prednisone for weeks 11 and 12 were randomised to receive subcutaneous injection of atacicept 75 or 150&#x02005;mg or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Thus only patients with essentially inactive disease were eligible for randomisation.

headache (15.6%) and urinary tract infection (14.1%). In general, incidence rates for patients in the placebo group tended to be lower than those for the atacicept 75&#x02005;mg and atacicept 150&#x02005;mg groups, with the exception of diarrhoea, sinusitis, influenza, hypertension and hypotension, which occurred in similar frequency. Of the 455 patients in the Safety Analysis set, most TEAEs were mild or moderate. The most frequently reported SAEs were infections and infestations, including pneumonia (10 patients: 2 patients in the placebo group, 5 patients in the atacicept 75&#x02005;mg group and 3 patients in the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg group). Five subjects receiving atacicept (two subjects receiving 75&#x02005;mg, and three subjects receiving 150&#x02005;mg) reported SAEs of pneumonia for which the events were assessed by the investigators as related to trial treatment. Two patients randomised to the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg treatment group died. A 22-year-old male with SLE in the Philippines died from acute respiratory failure due to alveolar haemorrhage secondary to possible leptospirosis. This patient also suffered from an overlap syndrome with features of scleroderma, complicated by a history of recurrent infected digital ulcers. The second patient, a 30-year-old female in Argentina, died from pneumococcal pneumonia and alveolar haemorrhage secondary to lupus. These patients were treated with atacicept for 42 and 33&#x02005;weeks, respectively, and were receiving prednisone 20 and 7.5&#x02005;mg daily and hydroxychloroquine, respectively, for lupus at the time of the event. Both patients experienced reductions in their total IgG and IgM levels, but the IgG levels remained above 14.6&#x02005;g/L (normal range approximately 6&#x02013;18&#x02005;g/L), and the IgM levels remained above 0.34&#x02005;g/L. The trial's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended that the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg dose group be discontinued.</p><p>Protective immunity to common pathogens was investigated. Vaccine titres against tetanus toxoid, diphtheria and pneumococcus were assessed at baseline and week 52 (or early termination). With regards to pneumococcal and tetanus titres, 1 in 30 (3.3%) placebo-treated patients had loss of protective titre status, whereas 1 in 10 (10%) atacicept-treated patients lost protective titre status. Median percent titre changes from baseline at week 52 for atacicept 75&#x02005;mg, atacicept 150&#x02005;mg and placebo, respectively, were &#x02212;33.3%, &#x02212;34% and 0 for tetanus toxoid; &#x02212;21.1%, &#x02212;11% and 0 for diphtheria; &#x02212;29%, &#x02212;30% and +2% for pneumococcus.</p><p>Immunogenicity was assessed by analysis of samples predose and postdose. Three patients in the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg group showed measurable antibodies to atacicept at the week 24 follow-up visit.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to assess whether blockade of two B-cell activating factors, BLyS and APRIL, using atacicept could prevent flares in patients that had had lupus disease activity treated with (or that had responded to) a course of corticosteroids. Two fatal infections occurred in the 150&#x02005;mg atacicept arm. A contributing role of atacicept could not be excluded, resulting in a premature termination of this group. Consequently, only the 75&#x02005;mg and the placebo arm could be assessed for the primary endpoint analysis. There was no difference in the adjudicated flare rate between the placebo and the 75&#x02005;mg atacicept arm.</p><p>Post hoc analysis of the primary endpoint in the ITT analysis set suggested a beneficial effect from the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg regime since patients in this arm did show a statistically significant reduction the proportion of patients with BILAG flare A or B flare compared with placebo (36.6% vs 54.1%, OR 0.48 (0.30 to 0.77); p=0.002). The high-dose treatment was associated with a significantly delayed time to first flare (BILAG A or B) compared with placebo (HR 0.56, p=0.009). Among all patients who completed treatment prior to discontinuation of the 150&#x02005;mg arm (81&#x02013;84 patients per group), there was a distinct reduction in the flare rate and an increase in the time to flare for patients in the 150&#x02005;mg arm compared with that seen in either the placebo or the 75&#x02005;mg arm.</p><p>Atacicept may have steroid-sparing benefit. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of subjects who had at least one increase in corticosteroid dose to &#x02265;20&#x02005;mg/day. In spite of the early termination of the 150&#x02005;mg arm, there remains a strong suggestion that the higher dose of atacicept was effective.</p><p>Serological improvements were seen in both atacicept arms. Both doses of atacicept reduced anti-dsDNA antibodies to a similar extent, so this does not explain the apparent clinical responses to the 150 but not 75&#x02005;mg dose. The link between dsDNA antibodies and clinical activity is far from absolute.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The beneficial effect on C3 (and to a lesser extent) C4 is more clear-cut in those treated with 150&#x02005;mg atacicept, but why the beneficial clinical threshold appears at 150 vs 75&#x02005;mg of atacicept remains incompletely understood.</p><p>The indication of possible efficacy must be weighed against the two deaths due to infection in the 150&#x02005;mg arm. Thus, in the first belimumab trial<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in a similar range of non-renal clinical features patient population (Belimumab in Subjects with Systemic lupus erythematosus (BLISS)-52), there were nine deaths among 865 patients (1%), followed by three deaths among 819 patients (0.4%) in the BLISS-76 trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the phase IIb blisibimod trial in 547 patients with SLE, there were seven deaths, three in placebo and four among three active treatment arms.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>As both deaths in the current trial occurred in the 150&#x02005;mg arm, the IDMC recommended discontinuation of treatment in this study arm as a cautionary measure. The infections in these two patients were not associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia. Treatment with atacicept has previously been found to reduce B-cells and Ig levels without significant adverse events in a dose-escalating Phase Ib study in mild/moderate non-renal lupus.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A reduction in B-cells, plasma cells and the mean IgG concentration in the atacicept groups was observed in this study, with a 30% reduction in the 75&#x02005;mg arm and a 38% reduction in the 150&#x02005;mg arm, compared with a 3% increase in the placebo group. Median IgG levels in those receiving atacicept remained above the lower limit of normal over the 52-week treatment and only two patients reached the discontinuation threshold of 3&#x02005;g/L. No serious infections were reported in these patients. The incidence of infection was comparable regardless of the degree of decline in IgG or IgM levels. In contrast, a trial of atacicept in combination with MMF and corticosteroids in patients with lupus nephritis was terminated prematurely due to rapid falls in IgG levels after six patients were recruited.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This decrease in IgG started with the initiation of MMF and high-dose oral steroids 2&#x02005;weeks before atacicept (four patients) or placebo (two patients) was given. Two of these atacicept-treated patients developed pneumonia, one due to <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> and one due to <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> before the trial was terminated, although neither patient died.</p><p>The overall similarity in adverse events between the three arms of the study, including serious events, is reassuring and consistent with previous studies of atacicept in rheumatoid arthritis, although the rate of total infections and serious infections was slightly higher with atacicept 150&#x02005;mg, as observed in the rheumatoid arthritis<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and multiple sclerosis studies(unpublished data). The rate of serious infectious in the BLISS 76 study (7% and 7.3% in the 1 and 10&#x02005;mg/kg arms, respectively) is virtually identical to the 6.9% observed in the atacicept 150&#x02005;mg arm of the present study. In neither atacicept arm was the risk of serious infection statistically significantly increased compared with the placebo arm. In the Exploratory Phase II/III SLE Evaluation of Rituximab (EXPLORER) trial of rituximab in patients with non-renal SLE,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the rate of serious infections was even higher (17% in the placebo group and 9.5% in the rituximab group), perhaps reflecting the more intensive use of glucocorticoids. These results suggest that contributing factors to the deaths observed in our study may have included the underlying disease, steroid therapy and delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The primary and main secondary efficacy endpoints in this trial were assessed using the BILAG assessment index. The flare rates seen in this study were in line with those previously reported.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Distinct differences in flare rates and time to flare were seen between the treatment arms. Prevention of flares is an important clinically significant outcome as the frequency of flares is correlated with disease progression and organ damage.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Atacicept is one of several B cell-directed therapies that have been under investigation in SLE, which include anti-CD20 (rituximab), anti-BLyS (belimumab, blisibimod and tabalumab), anti-CD22 (epratuzumab) and atacicept, which blocks BLyS and APRIL. In the current trial, we examined whether atacicept could prevent flares in patients at high risk for a lupus flare. We selected patients who had recently had a lupus flare that was controlled by a relatively short course of glucocorticoids. In contrast, the other therapies have been subjected to trial designs intended to treat active disease. Given the different trial strategies for each agent, and in the absence of any head-to-head comparison, it is not known which of these approaches will prove to have the most advantageous benefit: risk ratio or, alternatively, whether different agents will be appropriate for different purposes (eg, induction vs maintenance).</p><p>In conclusion, the primary endpoint of reducing the numbers of SLE patients who had a new flare was not met in the atacicept 75&#x02005;mg arm compared with placebo. The results with the higher dose of 150&#x02005;mg were more encouraging, but there are concerns about the possible infection risk in the light of two deaths in that arm. Treating patients with active lupus remains a great challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205067-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1775" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Drs Michael Snaith and Asad Zoma who, with Prof Gordon, formed the Adjudication Committee; all investigators that participated in the trial and the atacicept study team; Stephen Wax, EMD Serono Inc, Rockland, ME, USA, for critical review of the manuscript; Gis&#x000e8;le von B&#x000fc;ren, EMD Serono Inc, Billerica, MA, USA for publication coordination; and Medicus International, UK, for writing and editorial assistance, which was funded by EMD Serono, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold>
