</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute ankle sprains, particularly those involving the lateral ligament complex, are frequently reported to be the most common musculoskeletal injury <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Without adequate care, acute ankle trauma can lead to chronic problems, such as pain, joint instability, restriction and loss of function <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>Topical diclofenac has been consistently demonstrated to be an effective agent in reducing pain and inflammation in acute ankle sprain and other musculoskeletal disorders <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, with improvements in patients' functional capacity, mobility and global assessment <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Topical diclofenac is usually better tolerated than oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, and is a useful benchmark for pharmacological intervention in musculoskeletal injuries.</p><p>Traumeel&#x000ae; (Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, Baden-Baden, Germany) is a fixed combination of plant and mineral extracts used for treating inflammation and pain caused by musculoskeletal injuries <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Effectiveness and tolerability of Traumeel for musculoskeletal injuries have been reported in randomised controlled trials, which demonstrate reductions in pain and swelling, and improvements in the mobility of joints such as ankle and knee <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Traumeel has also demonstrated efficacy equivalent to conventional management <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, NSAIDs <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and diclofenac <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> in pain relief and improving joint mobility. Traumeel is well tolerated, with very few adverse effects <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>The objective of this large multicentre, randomised and controlled study was to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of a homeopathic medication, Traumeel, with a conventional therapy, diclofenac, both administered topically in the reduction of pain and restoration of function in individuals with mild-to-moderate acute ankle sprain. Diclofenac was selected as the comparator because of its broad study database and because it is the most widely used NSAID <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Diclofenac sodium gel (D-G) at a concentration of 1% was selected because it is widely available. Topical preparations of Traumeel and D-G were chosen as they are convenient, easy to use, and are available on prescription and over the counter (OTC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participant selection</title><p>Participants were physically active adults including athletes, (physician's opinion from patient's case history) aged 18&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years, who had experienced an acute unilateral ankle sprain of the lateral ligaments within the past 24&#x000a0;h. They were also required to have moderate (100-point Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] score, 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mm) to severe (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;mm) pain on weight bearing according to the participant's assessment of ankle pain, and be unable to perform their usual training/sports activities. Grade of ankle sprain was evaluated at baseline by physician's assessment and x-ray to eliminate fracture, and on day 7 by using a stress-test [pronation stress of the ankle with predefined power].</p><p>Individuals were excluded if they had sustained a similar injury of the same joint within the last 6&#x000a0;months, bilateral ankle injury, complete rupture of the ankle ligaments in need of surgical intervention (i.e. Grade 3 ankle sprain), confirmed fracture or injury concurrent with knee injury, or required bed rest, hospitalisation, casting or surgery. They were also excluded if they had clinically important laboratory test abnormalities or debilitating acute/chronic illness, or had used corticosteroids in the previous 8&#x000a0;weeks; long-acting NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors or tramadol in the previous 24&#x000a0;h; any other analgesics in the previous 6&#x000a0;h; or were sensitive to any component of the study drugs; or were abusing medical substances or alcohol. Participants provided written informed consent to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The Traumeel Acute Ankle Sprain Study (TAASS) was a multicentre, prospective, randomised, blinded and active-controlled study comparing Traumeel ointment (T-O) and Traumeel gel (T-G) (Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH) with D-G 1% (Heumann Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co) in the treatment of acute unilateral ankle sprain. The study was conducted at 15 outpatient centres in Spain in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Seoul 2008, International Congress for Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and the appropriate regulatory policy of participating institutions, and approved by the Spanish Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee and the Research Ethics Committee of each investigator's site. Investigators were consultant musculoskeletal specialists.</p><p>This non-inferiority study was performed with a two-stage adaptive design <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, with a planned interim analysis after study completion by 240 evaluable subjects (Stage I). The intention was to either stop the study according to the predefined stopping rules (definite success or failure), or, with both T-O and T-G eligible for continuation, continue to Stage II with the option of including only two (i.e. T-O or T-G vs. D-G) or all three treatment arms.</p><p>After initial screening, eligible individuals entering Stage I were randomised 1:1:1 to receive T-O, T-G or D-G for 14&#x000a0;days, according to a randomisation schedule generated by IDV Data Analysis &#x00026; Study Planning (Krailling, Germany). Computerised randomisation to treatment was achieved centrally; investigators received random blocks of six treatment kits along with the envelopes, and assigned patients to treatment on the basis of the order of kit receipt. Randomisation was double blind for T-G and D-G, and single (investigator) blind for T-O (the consistency of gel and ointment was different), although participants did not know which drug was in which preparation (medication was packed in identical containers). For all study medication, 2&#x000a0;g (approximately 6&#x000a0;cm squeezed onto a measured dosing card) was applied topically, 3 times daily over the injured area. The treated skin was left uncovered by clothing for at least 15&#x000a0;min after application, and showering or bathing were not permitted for at least 1&#x000a0;h after application. Participants were assessed at baseline (day 0), on days 4, 7 and 14 of treatment, and at follow up on day 42.</p><p>All subjects received the same advice; the use of rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) was restricted to immediately after the event, and before starting study treatment. No patient reported using RICE after the start of study treatment. Systemic corticosteroids and analgesics were prohibited during the study. Rescue medication for pain control (paracetamol 500&#x000a0;mg tablets, up to four daily) was permitted but not in the 24&#x000a0;h before study visits.</p><p>Compliance with application of study drugs was ensured by study personnel administering the test drugs and by a patient diary. Patients also recorded use of RICE, rescue medications and concomitant medications in the patient diary.</p><p>Interim analysis of Stage I suggested that the study should continue to Stage II with all three treatment arms (i.e. no definite success or failure). Using the same procedures as for Stage I, additional participants were enrolled, assessed and treated in Stage II. Stage I was carried out from August 2009 (first participant enrolled) to January 2011 (last participant completed), inclusive; Stage II was carried out from March to September 2011, inclusive. Data from Stages I and II for the T-O and T-G groups were combined for analyses; the combined results are presented here.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary efficacy variables</title><p>The primary efficacy measures were the percentage change from baseline to day 7 for the participant's assessment of ankle pain (maximum), as measured by a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no pain; 100&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worst imaginable pain), and the change from baseline to day 7 of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Activity of Daily Living subscale (ADL). The FAAM is a validated self-reported questionnaire <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> that assesses physical function of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders of the leg, foot and ankle. The FAAM ADL subscale comprises 21 single items assessing activities of daily living such as standing, walking and going up and down stairs. The final score of the ADL subscale was standardised to a 0&#x02013;100 scale where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worst level of physical function, 100&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;highest level of physical function.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary efficacy variables</title><p>Secondary variables were measured on days 4, 7, 14 and 42. They included percentage change from baseline of ankle pain (maximum), self-assessed using a 100&#x000a0;mm VAS (as described above); change from baseline of the FAAM ADL subscale (as described above) <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; and change from baseline of the FAAM sports subscale <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> that comprises 8 single items assessing various sports activities such as running and jumping. As with the FAAM ADL subscale, the final score of the FAAM sports subscale was standardised to a 0&#x02013;100 scale where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worst level of physical function, 100&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;highest level of physical function. Swelling was measured by the &#x02018;figure-of-eight&#x02019; method <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> (mean of three repeated measurements) with the ankle in a neutral position for eversion and inversion while flexed to 90 degrees. Normal function/activity was measured on a 5-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal, 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severely restricted because of pain) and change from baseline was calculated. Time to normal function, that being during training and during sports activities, was self-reported by patients. A global assessment of treatment efficacy was assessed using a 5-point rating scale (1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very good, 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;worsening of symptoms) on day 14, and rescue medication use was determined by counting the number of tablets taken during the treatment and follow-up periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety variables and vital signs</title><p>Local tolerability of study treatments were evaluated by the physician after application and treatment-emergent adverse event data were collected at each visit. Adverse events (AEs) were categorised by primary system organ class and MedDRA preferred terms. Medical history and previous medications were detailed at screening. Physical examinations, vital signs, body weight and height were recorded at study visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Primary efficacy analyses</title><p>For the primary efficacy analysis, equality of effects of test and reference treatments was investigated using a test for non-inferiority. Effect size analyses were made by applying the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney (WMW) test that provides the Mann&#x02013;Whitney (MW) estimator <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The relevant benchmarks for the MW estimator were: 0.29&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;large inferiority, 0.36&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;medium-sized inferiority, 0.44&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;small inferiority, 0.50&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;equality, 0.56&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;small superiority, 0.64&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;medium-sized superiority and 0.71&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;large superiority <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Statistical significance was determined by the confidence interval approach, whereby non-inferiority was shown if the lower bound of the confidence interval (LB-CI) was lying above the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.4.</p><p>The study-wise alpha level was specified at 0.025 (one-sided) and both primary efficacy criteria could be tested with the full alpha if the first test was statistically significant <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. All patients who have had at least one dose of medication, at least one efficacy evaluation under medication, and are without severe protocol deviations were evaluated as the full analysis set <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Missing data were handled by the &#x02018;Last Observation Carried Forward&#x02019; method. Primary analyses were based on the Intent-To-Treat sample. For the primary efficacy criteria, the one-sided test for non-inferiority with alpha 2.5% and 97.5% CI was employed (WMW procedure).</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple testing in an adaptive design</title><p>Two treatment comparisons were made within the two-stage adaptive study design. The procedure is a combination of two principles of a multiple level alpha control: the closure principle (for multiple comparisons; intersection hypothesis) <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and the two-stage adaptive design. The operating characteristics of the two-stage Bauer&#x02013;Koehne procedure <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> were: P1&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0102 (one-sided), stop after Stage I because of success; P1&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.5, stop after Stage I because of futility; and 0.0102&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;P1&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.5, continue to Stage II with c-alpha for combined stages&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0038, for combined two stages P1* P2. If the intersection hypothesis <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> H<sub>0</sub> was not rejected at alpha<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0102, then Stage II was planned with both treatments; if p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;alpha<sub>0</sub>, then the study is stopped because of futility; if p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;alpha<sub>1</sub>, then the two single hypotheses can be tested. If one (or both) of the latter is significant, then the study can be stopped for that (or both) treatment. Likewise, if one (or both) test is not significant, then Stage II may be performed with that (or both) treatment.</p><p>The intersection hypothesis is tested using the Fligner&#x02013;Wolfe test, which is a generalised Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney test, based on a comparison of the two test treatments combined and the reference treatment <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. The two single comparisons are performed using the standard WMW test. As the comparator is an active reference treatment, the test is a (one-sided) test for non-inferiority with the null hypothesis: H<sub>0</sub>:MW&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.40, the one-sided bound of the CI should be &#x0003e;0.4 to reject the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>For sample size estimation, the following stipulations were made: alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.025 (one-sided), beta&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.1 (power&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.9, winning chance of sponsor 9:1), and MW&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.4, non-inferiority bound. Within the two-stage Bauer&#x02013;Koehne procedure (operating characteristics as above) <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, Stage I was based on a sample size of <italic>N&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;240 (80/group) after which an interim analysis was performed for the primary criteria. There was no definite success or failure so the study proceeded to Stage II in an adaptive manner, i.e. with all unblinded data results.</p></sec><sec><title>Other analyses</title><p>Secondary efficacy criteria were evaluated using the same statistical tests and confidence intervals as for the primary efficacy criteria (WMW procedure). Time to normal function was analysed using the log-rank test and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves. The safety population comprised all patients who had at least one dose of medication and one contact with the investigator after this first dose. AEs were presented by descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test.</p><p>Sample size calculation was performed using Nnpar 1.0, and data were entered with Report 6.4.19 or higher as database, and analysed with Report 6.4.19 or higher for descriptive statistics and TESTIMATE 6.1.03 or higher for inferential statistics (all software from IDV Data Analysis &#x00026; Study Planning, Krailling, Germany).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant disposition</title><p>Of the 449 individuals enrolled into the study (i.e. 299 participants in Stage I and 150 in Stage II), all were randomised to treatment (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).

Possibly or probably related AEs were reported by 5/152 participants (3.3%), 3/148 participants (2.0%) and 3/147 participants (2.0%) in the groups, respectively (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). The majority were mild or moderate in severity and none was serious. All AEs resolved by day 42 with the exception of &#x02018;ankle pain&#x02019; that was &#x02018;ongoing&#x02019; in one T-O-treated participant, and &#x02018;new ankle sprain&#x02019; that was &#x02018;improved, not resolved&#x02019; in one D-G-treated participant.</p><p>AEs included headache, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, back pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. Events were generally reported by one or two participants only and evenly distributed among the treatment groups, with no differences in frequency reaching statistical significance.</p><p>There were no notable changes from baseline in vital signs. All three treatments were well tolerated locally, as assessed by redness, swelling and itching at the site of injury, with over 97% of participants without symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomised, controlled and blinded study confirmed that T-O and T-G were non-inferior to the widely used NSAID, D-G 1%, in the reduction of pain and restoration of function in individuals with mild-to-moderate acute ankle sprain. This finding confirms the efficacy of Traumeel and might broaden the therapy options for patients and healthcare professionals who would prefer to avoid the use of topical NSAIDs in Grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains.</p><p>This study did not include a placebo-control arm, which may have had some relevance to the assessment of an injury that usually resolves without treatment. However, Traumeel has been shown to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders in previous randomised controlled trials <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Specifically in ankle injuries, treatment with T-O resulted in more rapid and more frequent improvement in upper ankle mobility and significant reductions in swelling and pain compared with placebo at 2&#x000a0;weeks <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Reviews of diclofenac, incorporating ankle sprain studies, also demonstrate its superiority in reducing pain and inflammation over placebo <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. With their known efficacy and the possibility of joint instability and decreased range of motion without treatment <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, it was considered unreasonable to withhold treatment in this study population that want to quickly return to normal function. In this study, Traumeel and diclofenac administered topically were both well tolerated, with few treatment-related AEs and high rates of treatment adherence.</p><p>Traumeel acts differently to NSAIDs, its anti-inflammatory effect results from the synergistic interaction between its components on the different phases of the inflammatory response <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Mechanistic studies suggest Traumeel stimulates production of the inhibitory cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta, thereby indirectly preventing pro-inflammatory lymphocytes from perpetuating the inflammatory reaction <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, and accelerates wound healing <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no previous randomised controlled trial of T-O and T-G vs. D-G in ankle sprain. One previous randomised controlled study compared T-O with diclofenac ointment in elite athletes with non-traumatic tendon pain <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Reductions in peri-tendinous diameter/oedema and pain, and time to return to activity were significantly better for Traumeel-treated participants <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. This improved efficacy of Traumeel vs. diclofenac may have been a result of the differing indication and participant population compared with those in our study. Additionally, in observational studies, Traumeel has demonstrated an efficacy (pain and mobility) equivalent to diclofenac with similar or better tolerability in individuals with tendinopathies (T-O and D-G) <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and epicondylitis (Traumeel and diclofenac injections) <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p>This study was not without limitations. Individuals enrolled into randomised controlled trials may not be representative of the broad range of individuals treated in clinical practice <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. These participants were physically active people rather than people incurring ankle sprains through general activities of daily living. However, as efficacy was self-evaluated, it could reasonably be assumed that this study population might have been more critical of a treatment that did not work than the general population.</p><p>A potential study limitation was single (investigator) blind randomisation of the T-O group. While the containers were identical, the consistency of gel and ointment differ and therefore it was difficult to have all treatments blinded from both investigators and patients. However, participants did not know which drug (Traumeel or diclofenac) was in which preparation.</p><p>T-O and T-G were as effective as D-G 1% for the symptomatic treatment of pain and restoration of function in individuals with mild-to-moderate ankle sprain. Traumeel and other complementary and alternative medicine interventions have the potential to increase achieved community effectiveness <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Specifically, musculoskeletal problems are reported to be areas of clinical practice in which conventional treatments are not fully effective <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Traumeel may therefore be considered a viable treatment option and an alternative to topical diclofenac.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, Baden-Baden, Germany.
