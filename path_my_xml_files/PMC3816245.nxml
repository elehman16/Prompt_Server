Cognitive models propose that biases in the processing of emotional information contribute to the onset, maintenance and recurrence of depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> These biases have traditionally been targeted through psychological therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which has established efficacy for depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> However, research has begun to demonstrate more recently that simple computerised procedures, known as cognitive bias modification (CBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) may be used to selectively target biases and lead to significant reductions in symptoms related to depressed mood and depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6&#x02013;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></p><p>In the CBM paradigm most commonly used for depression (an imagery focused form of interpretation bias training), participants listen to descriptions of everyday situations that start ambiguous as to their potential outcome, but which are consistently resolved positively. While listening to the descriptions, participants are required to <italic>imagine</italic> themselves in the situation described, through their own eyes (in a &#x02018;field perspective&#x02019;), as if actively involved in the situation. By repeatedly constraining participants to imagine positive (rather than negative) outcomes for the hundreds of ambiguous situations encountered in the training, this imagery CBM aims to train a bias to automatically imagine positive resolutions for novel ambiguous situations encountered in daily life. Depressed individuals may struggle to imagine positive future events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and tend to interpret ambiguous information negatively rather than positively&#x02014;a negative interpretation bias,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and thus the repeated practice of generating positive mental imagery in the context of ambiguity may be particularly helpful in reducing symptoms of depression through targeting these particular processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></p><p>The preliminary findings investigating imagery CBM in depression suggest that it may have therapeutic benefits when delivered as a standalone intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Alternatively, as experts in the field of CBM research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> have noted that since CBM procedures lend themselves to being delivered remotely, CBM procedures could potentially be combined with existing evidence-based internet programmes such as internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) to produce optimal therapeutic outcomes. However, combining two interventions targeting similar cognitive processes into a single treatment package may pose unique difficulties as they could potentially interact in a way that cancels out their individual therapeutic benefits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Whether it is possible to successfully combine the imagery CBM with iCBT into an efficacious treatment for depression is therefore an important question to evaluate.</p><p>In the first trial to evaluate this proposal we<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> randomised patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode to an 11-week intervention (CBM+iCBT) or a wait-list control (WLC). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress (Beck Depression Inventory&#x02014;second edition (BDI-II), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Kessler-10 (K10)), corresponding to large effect sizes (Cohen's d=1.85&#x02013;2.40) and in secondary measures of disability, anxiety and repetitive negative thinking (WHO disability assessment schedule-II (WHODAS-II), state trait anxiety inventory-trait version (STAI-T), repetitive thinking questionnaire (RTQ); Cohen's d=1.33&#x02013;2.00). Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures (Hedges&#x02019; <italic>g</italic>=0.74&#x02013;0.98). Sixty-five per cent of patients who completed the combined intervention evidenced clinically significant change (reaching high end-state functioning). Further, analyses demonstrated that the change on the imagery-based interpretation bias test (ambiguous scenarios test-depression (AST-D)) at least partially mediated the relationship between intervention condition and the reduction in depression symptoms following imagery CBM.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study objectives (rationale and choice of comparators)</title><p>Findings from this first trial provide encouraging results of the integration of internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of treatment delivery for major depression. However, this trial was limited in that the comparison group was a WLC. In the absence of an active control group, the design of the first trial does not allow us to solely attribute clinical change to the intervention. Effects could be attributed to placebo response or contact with the research team and clinician during the CBM phase, for example. A more rigorous test would be a comparison between the CBM training paradigm and an active control intervention (ie, exposed to identical intervention procedures minus one or more of the active treatment ingredients). Thus, there are clearly numerous possible control conditions which may control for a wide variety of aspects in the intervention from interpretation bias, to imagery, to repeated task effects, &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; of taking part in an academic trial and so forth. For example Lang <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> investigated a CBM only intervention (without an iCBT component) where individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder were assigned to one of two groups: a positive imagery CBM or control CBM condition. In the positive imagery CBM condition, all the ambiguous training stimuli were resolved positively. In the control CBM condition, participants received an identical schedule of CBM sessions with the same number of training stimuli. However, in this control condition half of the stimuli were resolved positively and half were resolved negatively (ie, a control for the interpretation bias aspect of the procedure). Individuals receiving the positive imagery CBM demonstrated significant improvements from pretreatment to post-treatment in depressive symptoms, cognitive bias and intrusive symptoms, compared with the active control condition. While providing further support for the clinical potential of imagery CBM in depression, this study also demonstrated that the effects of the programme were not simply due to non-specific effects such as repeatedly engaging in a task or distraction. Further, the study suggested that it was the consistently positive resolution of the imagined scenarios (for positive interpretation bias acquisition), rather than generation of imagery per se, that accounted for the effects of the intervention. To investigate the additive benefit of positive imagery CBM when delivered prior to iCBT, compared with iCBT alone, using an active control for the CBM component of the intervention would similarly allow us to demonstrate that any additional effects of the positive imagery CBM were not simply due to non-specific factors, or any potential &#x02018;active&#x02019; components shared with the control condition.</p><p>The current SPIRIT-compliant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> protocol outlines the methodology of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to establish the efficacy of our internet-delivered positive imagery CBM intervention for depression when compared with an active control condition (CBM control, see below).

Patient queries throughout the programme are primarily addressed by email contact from the clinician or the research support officer. If clinically indicated, or if patients&#x02019; K-10 and/or PHQ-9 scores deteriorate, the clinician would make telephone contact. Adherence to the CBM programme is monitored through the computer software that records all data. If a participant misses a session of the CBM programme, a member of the research team will send an email reminder through the Virtual Clinic system or make telephone contact to remind the participant to login to complete the session. Adherence is similarly monitored throughout the iCBT programme. Once enrolled, a participant can elect to discontinue at any time. The section for revocation of consent should be forwarded to Professor Gavin Andrews, head of CRUfAD. A participant may be withdrawn from the trial for the following reasons: lack of computer and internet access; change in medication prescribed to treat depression; change in medication status of exclusion medications; suicidality or clinical risk; failure to complete baseline questionnaires; failure to start the CBM programme; failure to complete a minimum of four CBM sessions; failure to complete post CBM programme questionnaires.

It will also attempt to replicate the initial successful application of imagery CBM delivered through the internet without face-to-face contact, and establish whether this is superior to a closely matched control version when delivered in this manner.</p><p>The choice of control condition is a challenge and raises questions. For example, whether to control for bias, imagery, activity such as engaging in repeated practice of a computer task, or some other aspect. The main aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of the combined imagery CBM and iCBT intervention, and the choice of control CBM is a pragmatic choice based on a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and experimental work,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> albeit in shorter time frames. However, we note that both the positive imagery and this control condition involve generating mental images. It may be that this mental imagery practice in itself (regardless of imagery valence) could enhance the subsequent effects of iCBT, for example, by facilitating access to alternative meanings, or facilitating the kind of (imagery-based) future simulation involved in planning,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> for example, activity scheduling. If this is the case and both conditions improve then it may be interesting to dismantle. Conversely, differential outcomes following the combined intervention would suggest that it is the consistently positive resolution of the imagined scenarios that leads to enhanced outcomes, either by additive or interactive effects of combining imagery CBM and iCBT. Results will therefore inform further clinical trials of the combined intervention and basic research investigating the range of potential treatment mechanisms.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Trial status</title><p>This article was submitted on 16 September 2013.
