The objective of this study was to assess the field efficacy and safety of an injectable formulation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug robenacoxib in cats undergoing surgery. The study was a multi-center, prospective, randomized, masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 349 cats were enrolled and underwent surgery comprising forelimb onychectomy, as an example of orthopedic surgery, plus either ovariohysterectomy or castration. All cats received butorphanol prior to anesthesia and forelimb four-point regional nerve blocks with bupivacaine after induction of general anesthesia. Cats were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of robenacoxib, at a target dosage of 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;174), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;175) once prior to surgery and for an additional two days post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037) fewer cats administered robenacoxib received additional analgesia rescue therapy (34 of 173, 19.7&#x000a0;%) compared to cats given placebo (73 of 175, 41.7&#x000a0;%). The percentage of treatment success was therefore 80.3&#x000a0;% with robenacoxib and 58.3&#x000a0;% with placebo. Behavior, posture, pain on palpation of the paw and soft tissue surgery sites, and overall pain were significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) improved versus placebo at various time points within the first 8&#x000a0;h in cats receiving robenacoxib. The most frequently reported adverse events were incision site infection/dehiscence, bleeding, vomiting, decreased appetite and lethargy. Frequencies of reported adverse clinical signs, hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis variables, and body weight changes were similar between groups. There were no significant changes from baseline with robenacoxib in hepatic, hematological or renal clinical pathology variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Robenacoxib by s.c. injection was effective and well tolerated in the control of post-operative pain associated with orthopedic, ovariohysterectomy and castration surgery in cats.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cat</kwd><kwd>Injectable</kwd><kwd>Post-operative</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>NSAID</kwd><kwd>Randomized</kwd><kwd>Robenacoxib</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Elanco Animal Health</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Pain management has been used increasingly as the standard of practice in cats undergoing surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to improving animal welfare, control of post-operative pain and inflammation facilitates the healing process and helps avoid the development of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the classes of drugs used most frequently for controlling pain and inflammation in the immediate post-operative period. However, only few NSAIDs are licensed for use in cats, probably due to the relatively poor safety profile of several NSAIDs in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Robenacoxib is a coxib class NSAID that demonstrates high selectivity for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Robenacoxib injection (2&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route) and tablets (1&#x000a0;mg/kg with a range 1-2.4&#x000a0;mg/kg) are registered in cats for up to three days use for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic or soft tissue surgery in the EU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/">www.ema.europa.eu</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and for the control of post-operative pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic surgery, ovariohysterectomy and castration in the US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">www.fda.gov/Drugs</ext-link>). Randomized, masked, non-inferiority clinical studies demonstrated superior efficacy of injectable robenacoxib in reducing post-operative pain compared to meloxicam in a Japanese study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and non-inferior efficacy in an EU study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Superior efficacy of oral robenacoxib in reducing post-operative pain compared to placebo was reported in a previous US field study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The objective of the present US study was to demonstrate the field effectiveness and safety of injectable robenacoxib at a dose of 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg for the control of post-operative pain associated with onychectomy, ovariohysterectomy and castration surgery in cats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a multi-center, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial at 13 companion animal veterinary clinics located at various geographic locations within the US.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (VICH GL9), Adequate and Well-controlled Studies (21 CFR 514.117) and New Animal Drugs for Investigational Use (21 CFR 511.1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/">www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/</ext-link>).

Cats were administered either the injectable form of robenacoxib s.c. at a dosage of 2&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight (Onsior&#x000ae;, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, US) or 0.1&#x000a0;mL/kg placebo (0.9&#x000a0;% sodium chloride injection, USP) once daily for 3&#x000a0;days. The dosage of 2&#x000a0;mg/kg was determined from a laboratory kaolin model study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and was confirmed in field studies in Japan and the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The dose administered to each cat was calculated from the pre-anesthetic body weight determined on Day 0. The first treatment was given approximately 30&#x000a0;min prior to surgery or at the same time the pre-anesthetic agents were administered. Subsequent once daily injections were given at approximately the same time each day.</p><p>The randomization list was computer-generated by the statistician. Masking was maintained as robenacoxib for injection was similar in appearance to the placebo. In addition, a treatment administrator (i.e. dispenser) at each clinic was responsible for dispensation and reconciliation of used and unused products. All study site personnel were masked to treatment assignment except the dispenser.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Clinical examinations and follow-up</title><p>Clinical examinations were performed prior to enrollment and on Day 0 (prior to surgery) and Day 2 (study exit), in cases of early withdrawal, and for any animal which experienced a serious adverse event (SAE).

Cats receiving rescue intervention were observed in the clinic for a minimum of 24&#x000a0;h post-intervention and any potential adverse events (AEs) were documented. The owners of study cats received a follow-up phone call approximately 3 to 7&#x000a0;days after normal or premature completion to assess the animal&#x02019;s general well-being.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Rescue therapy and prohibited concomitant medications</title><p>If at any time the veterinarian determined a cat to be uncomfortable or in pain, the cat received additional butorphanol tartrate or any other product selected by the investigator (except other NSAIDs) to control pain as rescue analgesic therapy.</p><p>The following treatments were not allowed during the study: additional analgesic drugs or NSAIDs, synthetic feline facial pheromone (i.e., FELIWAY&#x000ae; Pheromone Spray), corticosteroids, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists (e.g., medetomidine or xylazine) or alternative forms of pain relief (e.g., acupressure, dry or wet acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, clinical therapy).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Cats underwent onychectomy in addition to either castration or ovariohysterectomy. Onychectomy (declaw) was performed on the cats&#x02019; forelimbs (only) using one of the following procedures: guillotine nail trimmer, laser or surgical scalpel. Ovariohysterectomy was performed through a standard ventral midline incision. A flank approach, which was associated with higher wound pain in one study, was not allowed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Addition of robenacoxib by s.c. injection, approximately 30&#x000a0;min prior to surgery and then once daily for two subsequent days, was well tolerated and provided better control of post-operative pain compared to placebo. The superior efficacy of robenacoxib compared to placebo was evidenced from the significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037) lower frequency of rescue therapy (19.7&#x000a0;% versus 41.7&#x000a0;%, the primary endpoint), which is consistent with a treatment success rate of 80.3&#x000a0;% versus 58.3&#x000a0;%. In addition, robenacoxib demonstrated superior efficacy to the placebo for the secondary endpoints of posture, behavior assessed from a distance and during social interaction, as well as pain assessed at the paw, soft tissue incision site and overall. Similar results were obtained previously with robenacoxib tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and in both studies once daily dosing with robenacoxib by injection or tablets provided effective analgesia over the 24&#x000a0;h dosing interval. These results support previous findings that robenacoxib has a longer duration of action than would be predicted from its short blood half-life, explained by concentration and persistence at sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The endpoints included in this study did not include specific measures of inflammation. Inhibition of inflammation, pain and fever by robenacoxib was demonstrated previously in an experimental kaolin model in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Onychectomy is a model of orthopedic surgery and has been used in several studies for testing analgesics and NSAIDs in cats, either alone or in combination with neutering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, therefore, cats underwent both orthopedic (onychectomy) and soft tissue (ovariohysterectomy or castration) surgeries. The frequency of rescue analgesia was 19.7&#x000a0;% with robenacoxib and 41.7&#x000a0;% with placebo, used in addition to pre-surgery butorphanol and bupivacaine nerve blocks. A previous study using an identical methodology reported similar results with robenacoxib tablets (16.5&#x000a0;%) compared to placebo (46.3&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other historical studies in cats undergoing onychectomy with or without neutering reported the following frequencies of rescue therapy: 95&#x000a0;% (negative control) and 17&#x000a0;% (pre and post-surgery butorphanol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; 67 and 71&#x000a0;% with single pre-surgery meloxicam and butorphanol, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; and 27&#x000a0;% (transdermal fentanyl patch) and 9&#x000a0;% (butorphanol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In none of these studies did cats receive pre-surgery local anesthesia, although one study did not show any additional analgesic benefit of a four-point regional nerve block with bupivacaine, when added to buprenorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In a fourth study, no rescue therapy was administered to cats undergoing only onychectomy after receiving butorphanol or transdermal fentanyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>This study was a comparison of injectable robenacoxib to a placebo. Administration of placebo to animals in pain studies raises ethical and welfare issues; however, these were overcome by providing both butorphanol and regional bupivacaine nerve blocks to all cats prior to surgery. The efficacy of butorphanol has been demonstrated compared to a negative control in cats undergoing onychectomy, with or without neutering, at an intramuscular dosage of 0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg, lower than the 0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg dosage used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Local nerve block with bupivacaine has also been tested in cats undergoing onychectomy; however, no significant benefit when added to buprenorphine was reported in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A 185&#x000a0;min duration of action was reported for intramuscular administration of 0.4&#x000a0;mg/kg butorphanol using the thermal threshold method in healthy cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The results from this study suggest that butorphanol and bupivacaine did not have strong efficacy, however, since rescue therapy was administered in most cases at early time points. Of the 107 cats which received rescue analgesia, 56 (52)%, 77 (72&#x000a0;%) and 91 (85&#x000a0;%) were rescued on or before 3, 5 or 8&#x000a0;h, respectively. In order to minimize suffering, any cat could be withdrawn from the study and administered rescue analgesia at any time at the discretion of the veterinarian.</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs were incision site infection/dehiscence, increased incision site bleeding, vomiting, decreased appetite and lethargy. Other studies have reported that 50&#x000a0;% of onychectomy surgeries have complications including pain, bleeding and lameness, regardless of onychectomy technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The frequency of incision site infection/dehiscence and vomiting was higher in the robenacoxib than the placebo group. Similar findings were reported previously with robenacoxib tablets in cats undergoing the same surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is not known if these results are reliable, however, as vomiting was not observed in safety studies with robenacoxib, even with repeated administration of high doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the impact of NSAIDs on wound healing in humans was concluded not be clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>There was no evidence from this study of any toxicity of robenacoxib to target organs that are most sensitive to NSAID toxicity (gastrointestinal tract, kidney and liver), consistent with previous studies in cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. At daily dosages up to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg for 42&#x000a0;days, oral robenacoxib was well tolerated and had no detectable effect on clinical chemistry, coagulation or hematology variables in healthy young cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a field study in cats with osteoarthritis, robenacoxib tablets at a dose of 1&#x02013;2.4&#x000a0;mg/kg once daily for one month were well tolerated with no evidence of gastrointestinal, kidney or liver toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The main limitations of this study are discussed below. First, no specific criteria were pre-defined for the use of rescue analgesia therapy; the veterinarians could rescue cats at any time they thought additional analgesics were necessary. The stated reasons for administering rescue therapy were in all cases consistent with pain (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), however, and were most frequently reported as tenderness of surgical sites, agitation, aggressive or defensive/guarding behavior, hunched posture and vocalization.</p><p>Second, analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints was challenging due to the unequal frequency of withdrawal of cases after administration of rescue therapy between the two groups with the placebo group having more rescues than those cats treated with robenacoxib. The secondary efficacy data for the first 8&#x000a0;h were therefore analyzed using the LOCF method. The LOCF method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] has limitations, but was justified in this study since it was used only for cases proactively withdrawn due to lack of efficacy and for a limited period (up to 8&#x000a0;h post-extubation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Robenacoxib by s.c. injection at a target dose of 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg once daily for three days was effective and well tolerated in the control of post-operative pain in cats undergoing orthopedic plus ovariohysterectomy or castration surgeries.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Appendix</title><p>Summary of secondary efficacy variables<table-wrap id="Tab7"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Secondary efficacy variable</th><th>Description</th><th>Scale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Posture</td><td>Cat&#x02019;s overall mobility within the cage (standing or resting position), any preferential or unequal weight distribution of the limbs, hunched or retracted posture, position of head and any forelimb shifting behavior.</td><td>&#x02022;Normal<break/>&#x02022;Mildly abnormal<break/>&#x02022;Moderately abnormal<break/>&#x02022;Severely abnormal</td></tr><tr><td>Behavior</td><td>Cat&#x02019;s overall comfort, response to social interaction with examiner and / or hospital staff, level of aggression, level of vocalization, and ease of handling as viewed from a distance and following social interaction.</td><td>Behavior as viewed from a distance<break/>&#x02022;Appears comfortable<break/>&#x02022;Questionable comfort<break/>&#x02022;Distressed animal<break/>Behavior following social interaction<break/>&#x02022;Normal<break/>&#x02022;Mildly abnormal<break/>&#x02022;Moderately abnormal<break/>&#x02022;Severely abnormal</td></tr><tr><td>Pain on palpation</td><td>Cat&#x02019;s level of response to a gradual increase in pressure applied to areas adjacent to the surgical sites.
