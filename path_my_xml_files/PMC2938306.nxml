The half-life of olanzapine pamoate is 30 days, and its steady state is reached approximately at 12 weeks. Oral supplementation of olanzapine is not required during OLAI initiation, according to Eli Lilly recommendations, although a study indicated that &#x02265;60% of D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy was reached only by the fifth injection cycle. To date, a short-term, placebo-controlled study of 8 weeks in acutely ill patients and a long-term, controlled trial of 24 weeks in stabilized patients have been conducted. In both the studies, efficacy and safety were similar to those of oral olanzapine, with the exception of an acute adverse effect, the so-called inadvertent intravascular injection event, which occurred 1&#x02013;3 hours after the injection with an incidence rate of 0.07% per injection. It consisted of symptoms that are similar to those reported in cases of oral olanzapine overdose. The most significant studies published to date, on the use of olanzapine pamoate in schizophrenia, are reviewed in this article. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and related side effects of OLAI are reported.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>olanzapine pamoate long-acting injection</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is characterized by disorganized behavior and thought, positive (delusions and hallucinations) and negative symptoms (eg, anhedonia, affective flattening, alogia, avolition) that induce dysfunction in many areas, such as interpersonal relations, work, and self-care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-6-573">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ndt-6-573">2</xref> and, in most cases, progressive deterioration of personality and social skills.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ndt-6-573">3</xref> It is a chronic disorder with frequent exacerbations that often require hospitalization.

OLAI is composed of olanzapine and pamoic acid in the form of micron-sized crystals suspended in water, which permits a depot intramuscular formulation of olanzapine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-6-573">30</xref> When injected into the muscle, the salt slowly dissolves and dissociates into separate molecules of olanzapine and pamoic acid at the site of injection; both these components enter into systemic circulation. The rate of dissolution of the crystalline salt is slow and regular, resulting in the absorption of olanzapine over a period of 4 weeks (steady state is approximately reached at 12 weeks). The oral supplementation of olanzapine is not required during OLAI initiation, according to Eli Lilly recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-6-573">30</xref> The half-life of olanzapine pamoate is 30 days (vs oral olanzapine 33 hours). The absorption and distribution of olanzapine pamoate are rapid and completed 6&#x02013;8 months after the last injection. Ninety-three percent of olanzapine pamoate is bound to albumin and &#x003b1;1-acid-glycoprotein. In impaired renal functioning, a significant reduction of clearance and halflife of oral olanzapine (57% of metabolized olanzapine is excreted into urine) is not observed, whereas in mild impaired hepatic functioning, both clearance (18 L/h) and half-life (39.3 hours) of oral olanzapine increased. OLAI has not been studied in these pathological situations, likewise in the elderly or in the pediatric and adolescent population, and it is not indicated for these conditions. Olanzapine is principally metabolized by CYP1A2, so that carbamazepine and cigarette smoke could induce its metabolism, but the reduction of olanzapine concentration when combined with these agents is clinically mild. Fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin have shown a relevant inhibitor action on CYP1A2 olanzapine metabolism, increasing its hematic concentration.

In order to minimize the risk for exacerbation of psychosis, the authors recommended to start with the equivalent dose of olanzapine pamoate and then, 2 months later, to evaluate the maintenance dose, which would remain at 300 mg/2 wk for patients who had previously been stabilized with 20 mg/d of oral olanzapine.</p><p>Oral olanzapine has shown a dose-dependent striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy of 60%&#x02013;80% at usual clinical doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ndt-6-573">46</xref> With the aim of determining whether the long-acting olanzapine pamoate depot provided sustained D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy, an open-label PET study was conducted in 14 patients (9 males, 5 females) with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder treated with an intramuscular injection of olanzapine pamoate 300 mg every 4 weeks for 6 months (6 injection cycles).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ndt-6-573">47</xref> During the first 4 injection cycles, 7 patients needed a supplementation with oral olanzapine due to the worsening of psychotic symptoms, as shown by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).

The need for oral olanzapine supplementation decreased when occupancy with OLAI reached &#x02265;60%, which represents a sufficient percentage for antipsychotic efficacy of most antipsychotic drugs.

Patients in both OLAI and oral olanzapine groups had significantly higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol relative to the comparative group (OLAI 45 mg/4 wk). The metabolic parameters (fasting glucose and lipid levels) of all OLAI groups overlapped those of oral olanzapine groups. Only the higher dose OLAI induced an increase of prolactin and a significantly higher level of triglycerides relative to the other doses of olanzapine pamoate. In this study, extrapyramidal and cardiovascular effects were not observed. Two patients experienced sedation and delirium consistent with inadvertent intravascular (IAIV) injection event.</p><p>These studies did not show any statistically significant difference in adverse events between oral olanzapine and the depot formulation, with the exception of a new potential safety risk that emerged in clinical trials, known as IAIV injection event, or postinjection delirium sedation syndrome (PDSS) as it was formerly defined, which initially led the FDA not to approve this preparation. This came to light when an unanticipated degree of sedation was observed in a small number of patients after an injection. Although sedation is a common adverse effect in olanzapine treatments, the extent of sedation appeared relevant. As of September 30, 2007, 25 excessive sedation events were reported in 24 patients (1.2% of patients, 0.07% of injections).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ndt-6-573">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-ndt-6-573">55</xref> As of May 31, 2008, the incidence of PDSS with olanzapine pamoate was 29 events in 28 patients, per &#x0003e;40,000 injections, for an incidence rate of 0.07% of injections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ndt-6-573">56</xref></p><p>This adverse event consists of sedation, confusion, dizziness, altered speech/dysarthria, and somnolence, symptoms that are consistent with those reported in case of oral olanzapine overdose. The severity of sedation ranged from drowsiness to deep coma (2 cases of coma, 2 patients intubated, 2 cases of delirium, and 2 cases of tonic-clonic convulsions were reported). In all the cases but one, who presented high blood pressure, the cardiovascular function remained unaltered. These effects usually occur within 1 hour of injection, but the median time ranged from 20 minutes to 3 hours postinjection. PDSS typically begins with milder symptoms (feeling of weakness, dizziness, irritability, or general malaise), which can then progressively worsen (delirium, heavy sedation). Seventy-nine percent of patients who presented this adverse event needed to be hospitalized in order to observe and give them supportive medical care. To date, all patients have recovered fully from this adverse event, usually within 3&#x02013;72 hours, without permanent damage, and approximately 70% of these continued to receive the depot injections.</p><p>Since an unpredictable pattern of IAIV injection events occurrence was observed, without any relationship with concomitant medications, substances, organic diseases or repeated OLAI injections, it has been hypothesized that a rapid release of free olanzapine into the bloodstream could have occurred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ndt-6-573">57</xref> Data on elevated plasma concentration of olanzapine measured during the event can confirm this hypothesis. The solubility of olanzapine pamoate monohydrate in plasma is ~167 times higher (0.5 mg/mL in plasma, 0.003 mg/mL in aqueous buffer) than that in an aqueous medium. If the salt comes into contact with a considerable amount of blood or plasma, as occurs if the needle punctures a vessel or enters a rich capillary bed during administration, it dissolves more quickly, releasing free olanzapine. This dissolution can occur over a period of minutes to hours in the bloodstream, whereas when it takes place in muscle tissue, it requires a period of days to weeks. Other factors are believed to affect the dissolution rate of the pamoate salt, such as the amount of olanzapine pamoate suspension, the volume and rate of blood flow, and the degree of vascular injury secondary to injection. In order to decrease the risk of accessing a major nerve or blood vessel, the injection recommendations of OLAI should ensure that no blood is visible in the syringe after the aspiration for approximately 5 seconds and to place it deeply only into the gluteal muscle at a ventrogluteal site. Until now, data on OLAI injection in other parts of body, like deltoid muscle, are not available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ndt-6-573">56</xref></p><p>Eli Lilly recommend a postinjection observation period of at least 1 hour up to 3 hours in a healthcare facility and require advising patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery and to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of potential IAIV injection events in the 24 hours after OLAI injection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As highlighted by Citrome,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ndt-6-573">57</xref> olanzapine pamoate demonstrated efficacy both in acutely ill and stabilized patients affected by schizophrenia, with low risk for extrapyramidal or vascular effects but high risk for metabolic syndrome. OLAI showed a pharmacological profile overlapping that of oral olanzapine, with the exception of a new acute adverse effect represented by an IAIV injection event, which has worried physicians and pharmacologists, delaying registration and clinical use of this new preparation. Although it has been interpreted as a type of acute overdose of olanzapine due to a relatively high hematic solubility of olanzapine pamoate salt, it could represent an unbalanced effect of this atypical antipsychotic agent due to its complex action on different central receptors. This effect has not yet been completely clarified. It could resemble the paradoxical worsening of psychotic symptoms which commonly occurs in some patients when optimal titration of an atypical antipsychotic drug has not been completely reached. We need to take account that evidence from clinical experience shows that a paradoxical excitement reaction with worsening of psychotic symptoms occurs during the first 24 hours postinjection of a typical antipsychotic depot, according to the information referred to in the sheet of drugs, which could be interpreted as a sulpiride-like action of antipsychotic drugs that act as an antidepressant agent when their hematic concentration is very low. Nevertheless, this acute adverse effect has not been observed in such a severe clinical form during other long-acting antipsychotic treatments probably for pharmacokinetic reasons: other typical antipsychotic depot are fat-soluble compounds with a slow dissolution rate and risperidone RP is a polymer compound that needs a long period of absorption. Only postmarketing data will indicate the real incidence and risk of OLAI IAIV injection event.</p><p>According to the pharmacokinetic profile (the absorption of OLAI occurs over a period of 4 weeks and steady state is approximately reached at 12 weeks)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-6-573">30</xref> and the D<sub>2</sub> receptors occupancy data (only by the fifth injection cycle of 300 mg/4 wk of OLAI, the D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy resembled the baseline occupancy level of oral olanzapine),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ndt-6-573">47</xref> a supplementation of oral olanzapine during the first injection cycle could be indicated in order to maintain a sufficient and stable hematic concentration, especially for patients who have previously required high doses of oral olanzapine. The prudent recommendation by the manufacturer, which does not advise any oral olanzapine supplementation, needs to be confirmed by real-world clinical use since the most severely affected patients are often excluded from controlled clinical trials because of ethical issues.</p><p>As cited above, nonadherence to treatment represents one of the most important reasons for relapse in schizophrenia, which progressively favors the worsening of disease course and the deterioration of patient skills. Unmedicated schizophrenia patients relapse at a rate of approximately 10% per month, whereas maintenance treatment with antipsychotic medications can reduce this rate dramatically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ndt-6-573">41</xref> Consistent treatment can improve the patient&#x02019;s quality of life and lead to an overall reduction in the cost of care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ndt-6-573">58</xref> by preventing or delaying relapse, which, if repeated, could induce neuronal apoptosis, so favoring progressive clinical deterioration, according to some authors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ndt-6-573">59</xref></p><p>As indicated by many authors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ndt-6-573">60</xref> one of the best strategies to overcome poor compliance may be long-acting injection therapy, although to date it has not yet been well accepted by physicians probably due to the availability of only few typical antipsychotic drug depots and also because of personal resistance that leads the physician to consider depot as a type of invasive instrument for a patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ndt-6-573">61</xref> If the physician identifies poor compliance as a symptom of psychosis, they use depot as a necessary therapeutic instrument to overcome it so that they can foster their relationship with the patient in order to support the patient in therapeutic and rehabilitation care.</p><p>The general safety profile of olanzapine pamoate, which is similar to that of oral olanzapine with a comparable low rate of neurological side effects, can further improve compliance and adherence to treatment. The positive effect of olanzapine on neurotrophic factors and its nonrelevant action on the seizure threshold can support the use of this drug as an option for some clinical situations. Otherwise, in OLAI treatment, the risk for metabolic syndrome, which appeared related to the higher doses of olanzapine pamoate also in short-term treatment, can represent a severe side effect because it could predispose patients to a premature death, especially in chronic treatment, according to most studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ndt-6-573">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ndt-6-573">64</xref></p><p>The availability of atypical antipsychotic depot, like olanzapine pamoate, permits maintenance treatment in nonadherent therapy patients who have previously shown a good response only to these oral drugs, as in cases characterized by negative, cognitive, or depressive symptoms, which are not ameliorated by typical antipsychotic drugs. Because olanzapine has demonstrated a good efficacy on affective symptoms the oral preparation has been approved for the treatment of bipolar mania, and, in combination with fluoxetine, for the treatment of bipolar depression. In future, if clinical studies confirm this indication, olanzapine pamoate might represent an important therapeutic option for bipolar disease, which is characterized by very low compliance.</p><p>Finally, many other postmarketing clinical trials supported by clinical experience are necessary to better identify the antipsychotic effectiveness of &#x0201c;an old drug in a new look&#x0201d;, such as olanzapine pamoate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ndt-6-573"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cannon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuroepidemiology: schizophrenia</article-title><source>J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry</source><year>1996</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>604</fpage><lpage>613</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8648325</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ndt-6-573"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>American Psychiatric Association</collab><source>DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</source><edition>4th ed, Text Revision</edition><publisher-loc>Washington DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Psychiatric Association</publisher-name><year>2000</year></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ndt-6-573"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McGlashan</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A Selective Review of Recent North American Long- Term Follow up Studies of Schizophrenia</article-title><source>Schizophr Bull</source><year>1988</year><volume>14</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>515</fpage><lpage>542</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3064280</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ndt-6-573"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The economic burden of mental illness</article-title><source>Hosp Community Psychiatry</source><year>1992</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>1227</fpage><lpage>1232</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1459546</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ndt-6-573"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Johnstone</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Schizophrenia: problems in clinical practice</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1993</year><volume>341</volume><fpage>536</fpage><lpage>538</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8094782</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b6-ndt-6-573"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dolder</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacro</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Antipsychotic medication adherence: is there a difference between typical and atypical agents?
