Therefore, we investigated whether ATM therapy induces a long-term alteration of intestinal microbiota in patients with UC. Patients with UC were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Biopsy samples at the beginning of the trial and again at 3 months after treatment completion were randomly obtained from 20 patients. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) in mucosa-associated bacterial components was examined to assess the alteration of the intestinal microbiota. Profile changes of T-RFLP in mucosa-associated bacterial components were found in 10 of 12 patients in the treatment group and in none of 8 in the placebo group. Dice similarity coefficients using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (Dice-UPGMA) confirmed that the similarity of mucosal microbiota from the descending colon was significantly decreased after the ATM therapy, and this change was maintained for at least 3 months. Moreover, at 3 months after treatment completion, the <italic>F. varium</italic>/&#x003b2;-actin ratio, examined by real-time PCR using nested PCR products from biopsy samples, was reduced less than 40% in 8 of 12 treated patients, which was higher, but not significantly, than in 4 of 8 patients in the placebo group. Together, these results suggest that ATM therapy induces long-term alterations in the intestinal microbiota of patients with UC, which may be associated, at least in part, with clinical effects of the therapy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

Although the immune cells in the intestinal lamina propria balance the requirements for immune tolerance of microbiota with defense against microbial pathogens <xref rid="pone.0086702-Neuman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, IBD is described as a state of excessive inflammation in response to bacterial microbiota antigens leading to impaired function of the intestinal barrier <xref rid="pone.0086702-OlivaHemker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086702-Feillet1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota profile varies considerably between active UC patients and healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, appropriate antibiotic therapy against microbial pathogens could alter the intestinal microbiota in patients with UC, resulting in the improvement and remission of active UC.</p><p>Previously, we have reported that <italic>Fusobacterium varium</italic> (<italic>F. varium</italic>) was present in the colonic mucosa of a high proportion (84%) of UC patients <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and that butyric acid, a product of <italic>F. varium</italic> culture supernatants, caused UC-like lesions in mice <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we recently conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial to determine whether an antibiotic combination regimen (amoxicillin, tetracycline, and metronidazole (ATM) for 2 weeks) against the microbial pathogens of UC, including <italic>F. varium</italic>, induces and/or maintains remission of active UC <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The ATM therapy produced an improvement of endoscopic and Mayo scores, remission, and steroid withdrawal in active UC more effectively than a placebo. Moreover, among the patients positive for <italic>F. varium</italic> antibodies, the clinical response rate was significantly higher in the ATM group than in the placebo group vs. the placebo group <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. That study indicated that <italic>F. varium</italic>, at least in part, is associated with the UC condition. In this study to assess the alteration of intestinal microbiota by the ATM therapy, biopsy samples that were randomly obtained from the clinical trial were analyzed.</p><p>We show that the profile of the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) in the mucosa-associated bacterial components is significantly changed at 3 months after the ATM therapy. Dice similarity coefficients using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (Dice-UPGMA) cluster analysis confirms the alteration of the intestinal microbiota after the ATM treatment. While the <italic>F. varium</italic>/&#x003b2;-actin ratio in the intestinal microbiota, as analyzed by real-time PCR from nested PCR products, is reduced after the ATM treatment, the reduction is not significant compared with the placebo group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study subjects</title><p>A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between January 2004 and July 2006 at 11 hospitals in Japan <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

All eligible patients had an established diagnosis of UC. Study subjects were selected from among patients with chronic relapsing UC (at least one relapse per year) with more than 1 year of follow-up and regular visits to outpatient clinics. The eligibility criteria for study entry were mild-to-severe disease with a colonoscopy score of at least 1 (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, and mild friability) based on a scale of 0 (normal or inactive) to 3 (spontaneous bleeding and ulceration), and/or watery diarrhea at least 5 times/day, with visible blood in stools.

The ATM treatment group (oral amoxicillin 1500 mg/day, tetracycline 1500 mg/day, and metronidazole 750 mg/day) and the placebo group each had 105 subjects. Each group was treated for 2 weeks and were then followed up. Twenty subjects in these clinical trials were randomly selected for this study. The study used central randomization with a treatment allocation produced by a computer-generated randomization list. Among the 20 patients, 12 patients were in the antibiotic treatment group and 8 were in the placebo group. Therapy was started after initial endoscopy at entry. The follow-up endoscopy was carried out 3 months after treatment to determine whether the antibiotic combination therapy induces and/or maintains the remission of active UC. Biopsy samples were taken from the cecum, ascending colon, and descending colon at the beginning of the trial and again at 3 months after treatment completion. The biopsy samples were immediately placed in formalin for histopathological assessment or in liquid nitrogen for storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the subsequent isolation of DNA. All histopathology, clinical evaluations, and endoscopies were carried out by physicians who were blinded to the patients' therapy. Clinical assessments were evaluated by the symptom score of Lichtiger et al. <xref rid="pone.0086702-Lichtiger1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Endoscopic-and histological scores were graded according to the Matts score <xref rid="pone.0086702-Matts1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Histological scores were the sum of the scores of the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Juntendo institutional review board, Juntendo University School of Medicine, as well as the clinical study committee of the Juntendo University Hospital (No. 2003-016).

</title><p>To analyze <italic>F. varium</italic> quantitatively in the mucosal flora after ATM treatment, real-time PCR from nested-PCR products was used, as clinically obtained biopsy sample amounts were usually extremely small. In the clinically obtained biopsy samples, there are the variations in biopsy size, and DNA extracts of the biopsies have a preponderance of human nucleic acid relative to bacterial nucleic acid. The human &#x003b2;-actin gene has frequently been used as an internal control gene to normalize the expression of the target mRNA levels between different samples measured by real-time PCR. Therefore, we standardized comparison of the numbers of bacteria associated with biopsies by determining the ratio of <italic>F. varium</italic> equivalents to the number of human &#x003b2;-actin equivalents. In this study, the numbers of <italic>F. varium</italic> in each sample (the cecum, ascending colon, and descending colon) per 10<sup>6</sup> copies of the human &#x003b2;-actin gene were examined. Based on this method, the total number of the <italic>F. varium</italic>/&#x003b2;-actin ratio in each sample (the cecum, ascending colon, and descending colon) was 40% reduced after treatment in 8 of 12 patients (66.7%) in the ATM group, which was higher, but not significantly, than 4 out of 8 patients (50.0%) in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0086702.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented here show that the 2-week triple-antibiotic therapy produced a long-term alternation of the intestinal microbiota that persisted at least 3 months compared to a placebo in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.</p><p>To analyze the alteration of mucosa-associated bacteria after the ATM therapy, we first used T-RFLP analysis. In this study, significant profile changes of the T-RFLP in the mucosa-associated bacterial components were found in 10 of 12 patients in the ATM treatment group, compared with none of 8 patients in the placebo group; therefore, ATM therapy is strongly associated with the alteration of mucosa-associated bacteria in patients with UC. UPGMA analysis also confirmed the significant alteration of mucosal microbiota at least 3 months after the ATM therapy. Importantly, an alteration of the intestinal microbiota may cause a breakdown of the barrier function, such as an abnormal immune response to normal flora, and result in UC <xref rid="pone.0086702-Sartor1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086702-Szebeni1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, long-term alterations in the intestinal microbiota produced by ATM therapy may be associated with improvements in UC. However, among the 20 patients with UC analyzed in this study, there were no differences in the symptom, endoscopic and histological scores or in the inflammatory markers at 3 months after treatment completion between ATM and placebo groups. The small sample size used in this study may be associated with this contradiction. Indeed, our 20 subjects were from a randomized clinical trial that demonstrated significant clinical effects of the ATM therapy (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;105) compared with a placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;105) <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Our previous research demonstrated that <italic>F. varium</italic> was one of the causative agents in UC <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086702-Ohkusa3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we also analyzed <italic>F. varium</italic> quantitatively in the mucosal flora of UC patients treated with ATM. In this study, samples were taken from the cecum, ascending colon, and descending colon at the beginning of the trial and again at 3 months after treatment completion. Because extremely small amounts were obtained in the clinical trial; we tried to quantify <italic>F. varium</italic> by real-time PCR from nested-PCR products in the mucosal flora. We demonstrated that the <italic>F. varium</italic>/&#x003b2;-actin ratio in the ATM treatment group tended to decrease, but not significantly, compared with the placebo group. In contrast, a decreased number of <italic>F. varium</italic> in UC patients treated by the ATM therapy was reported in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0086702-Nomura1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, the decreased number of <italic>F. varium</italic> in that study was analyzed by real-time PCR using samples taken from the appendix, caecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. Therefore, analysis using the nested PCR products from small amounts of biopsy specimens may not be suitable for quantifying <italic>F. varium</italic> in UC patients. Other pathogens besides <italic>F. varium</italic> may also be associated with the pathogenesis of UC. As these three antibiotics used for the ATM therapy are lethal to many bacterial species, unidentified pathogens could be more significantly decreased by the ATM therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, the mucosa-associated bacterial components analyzed by T-RFLP are useful to assess the alteration of the intestinal microbiota in UC after ATM therapy. The ATM antibiotic combination regimen significantly altered intestinal microbiota in UC patients compared to the placebo group. Our study supports the association of microbial agents with the pathogenesis of UC. A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of long-term alteration of intestinal microbiota in UC patients treated with ATM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0086702.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0086702.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0086702-Bell1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
