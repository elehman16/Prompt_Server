carbohydrates, may influence the stress-induced physiological and psychological
response. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of consumption
of a high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate meal on the physiological cortisol
response and psychological mood response. Subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38,
19m/19f, age&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25&#x000b1;9 yrs,
BMI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.0&#x000b1;3.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) came to the
university four times, fasted, for either condition: rest-protein,
stress-protein, rest-carbohydrate, stress-carbohydrate (randomized cross-over
design). Stress was induced by means of a psychological computer-test. The
test-meal was either a high-protein meal (En&#x00025; P/C/F 65/5/30) or a
high-carbohydrate meal (En&#x00025; P/C/F 6/64/30), both meals were matched for
energy density (4 kJ/g) and daily energy requirements (30&#x00025;). Per
test-session salivary cortisol levels, appetite profile, mood state and level of
anxiety were measured. High hunger, low satiety (81&#x000b1;16, 12&#x000b1;15
mmVAS) confirmed the fasted state. The stress condition was confirmed by
increased feelings of depression, tension, anger, anxiety (AUC stress vs. rest
p&#x0003c;0.02). Consumption of the high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate meal did not
affect feelings of depression, tension, anger, anxiety. Cortisol levels did not
differ between the four test-sessions in men and women (AUC nmol&#x000b7;min/L
p&#x0003e;0.1). Consumption of the test-meals increased cortisol levels in men in all
conditions (p&#x0003c;0.01), and in women in the rest-protein and stress-protein
condition (p&#x0003c;0.03). Men showed higher cortisol levels than women (AUC
nmol&#x000b7;min/L p&#x0003c;0.0001). Consumption of meals with different
macronutrient contents, i.e. high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate, does not
influence the physiological and psychological response differentially. Men show
a higher meal-induced salivary cortisol response compared with women.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent human studies have shown a possible relationship between stress and the
increased prevalence of obesity <xref rid="pone.0016826-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Nieuwenhuizen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kyrou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The stress response involves the hypothalamus pituitary
adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the secretion of its end-product cortisol <xref rid="pone.0016826-Nieuwenhuizen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Chronic
stress is associated with hyperactivity of the HPA axis and consequently increased
cortisol levels, which have been associated with visceral fat accumulation and
obesity <xref rid="pone.0016826-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Bjorntorp1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Bjorntorp2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. During
stress, food choice is often shifted towards sweet and fat foods, possibly because
they are perceived as highly rewarding <xref rid="pone.0016826-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Zellner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Rutters1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, consumption of some
of these preferred or highly rewarding foods, namely carbohydrates, may not reduce
stress but even increase stress, i.e. increased HPA-axis activity, represented by
cortisol concentrations. A study by Vicennati et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Vicennati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> showed that, in contrast to
a high-protein/fat meal, a high-carbohydrate meal significantly increased the plasma
cortisol levels in visceral obese subjects. Lacroix et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lacroix1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> showed that
high-protein/high-fat foods reduce cortisol concentrations remarkably in rats.
Moreover, a study by Martens et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> investigating the effects of
single macronutrients on serum cortisol concentrations in normal weight men showed
that the cortisol response to consumption of carbohydrates was higher than the
cortisol response to consumption of fats or proteins. Carbohydrates increased serum
cortisol concentrations while fat as well as protein did not relative to water <xref rid="pone.0016826-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, Gibson et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and Slag et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Slag1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> showed increased cortisol levels
induced by a protein-rich meal. A study by Gonzalez-Bono et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-GonzalezBono1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> showed
neither a difference between the effects of macronutrients on salivary cortisol
levels, nor a cortisol response to meal consumption. Lovallo et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lovallo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> showed no
meal-induced salivary cortisol response in the case of a mental stressor followed by
a meal but did show a meal-induced cortisol response in the case of a physical
stressor followed by a meal.</p><p>These studies show that the effects of macronutrients on the response of the HPA axis
are still controversial. Little is known about the response of a physiological
challenge such as food intake following a psychological stress challenge. This study
was, therefore, carried out to investigate possible effects of consumption of
comparable meals with different macronutrient contents (high-protein vs.
high-carbohydrate) on the physiological cortisol response under stress. Moreover, we
wanted to investigate the possible effects of high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate
meals on the psychological mood response. Increases in negative mood in response to
stressors can lead to greater food intake <xref rid="pone.0016826-Rutters1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Epel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Consumption of foods that
improve the stress-induced mood state may prevent further intake of energy-dense
foods. Studies by Markus et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Markus2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> showed that carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor foods improve
mood and stress coping following acute stress-inducing tasks, only in
stress-vulnerable subjects, possibly due to increased levels of brain tryptophan and
serotonin. Firk et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Firk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> showed that intake of tryptophan-rich hydrolyzed protein
increased positive mood and dampened the cortisol response to acute stress.</p><p>We hypothesized that high-protein foods, in contrast to comparable high-carbohydrate
foods, would not increase salivary cortisol concentrations more under stress and
consequently would improve mood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures were carried out with the adequate understanding and written

newspapers and on notice boards at the university. They underwent an initial
screening including measurement of body weight, height, waist circumference and
hip circumference, and completion of a questionnaire related to health, use of
medication, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, physical activity and eating
behavior. Eating behavior was analyzed using a validated Dutch translation of
the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) which measures three components:
&#x02018;cognitive restraint of eating&#x02019; (factor 1), &#x02018;disinhibition of
restraint&#x02019; (factor 2), and &#x02018;subjective feeling of hunger&#x02019;

the university four times in a fasted state between 08:00 and 9:00 AM, once for
a stress test session receiving a high-protein meal, once for a rest test
session receiving a high-protein meal, once for a stress test session receiving
a high-carbohydrate meal, and once for a rest test session receiving a
high-carbohydrate meal. The order of the four conditions was randomized across
the subjects to prevent any order effects.</p><p>

two hours later, to overcome the high cortisol morning peak and consequently to
prevent the more difficult detection in salivary cortisol changes. Moreover, the

Subjects were given the computer test before consumption of the test meal. This
test meal (lunch) was either a high-protein meal or a high-carbohydrate meal,
which had to be consumed entirely within 30 min. After the meal subjects rinsed
their mouth thoroughly with cold water, prior to salivary sample collection.</p><p>The stress response was determined by means of salivary cortisol concentrations,
Profile Of Mood State (POMS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
questionnaires. One hundred unit visual analogue scales (VAS; in mm) were used
to assess the appetite profile. Salivary samples and questionnaires were
collected six times per test session.</p><p>All women were tested in the follicular phase, as it has been shown that women

consumption of meals with different macronutrient contents (high-protein vs.
high-carbohydrate) on the physiological cortisol response and on the psychological
mood response under stress. Based upon studies of Vicennati et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Vicennati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, Lacroix et
al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lacroix1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and
Martens et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, we hypothesized that high-protein foods, in contrast to
high-carbohydrate foods, would not increase salivary cortisol concentrations more
under stress and consequently would improve mood.</p><p>In our study the acute psychological stress condition was confirmed by means of POMS
and STAI questionnaires, but not endocrinologically by increased salivary cortisol
levels. The type of stressor used in the laboratory context might have been too
light to elicit a physiological cortisol response <xref rid="pone.0016826-Michaud1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Our study showed a clear meal-induced salivary cortisol response, though no
difference in response was detected between consumption of a high-protein lunch and
a high-carbohydrate lunch. Some studies have shown that food intake, particularly at
lunch, increases cortisol secretion <xref rid="pone.0016826-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Peeters1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-VanCauter1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Svec1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In contrast, a study by Bray et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Bray1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> assessing the
hormonal responses to a fast-food meal compared with nutritionally comparable meals
of different composition, showed no significant salivary cortisol response to meal
ingestion. Lovallo et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lovallo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> showed no meal-induced salivary cortisol response in the
case of a mental stressor followed by a meal but did show a meal-induced cortisol
response in the case of a physical stressor followed by a meal. This response was
higher in women compared with men <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lovallo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The cortisol response to mental stress was smaller in
women compared with men <xref rid="pone.0016826-Lovallo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, some studies indicated that the macronutrient
composition of a meal may influence the magnitude of the cortisol response. Studies
by Vicennati et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Vicennati1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and Martens et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> showed higher cortisol levels
following a high-carbohydrate meal compared with a high-protein/fat meal. Studies by
Gibson et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>
and Slag et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Slag1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
showed increased cortisol levels induced by a protein-rich meal. On the other hand,
the study by Bourrilhon et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Bourrilhon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, investigating the influence of protein- vs.
carbohydrate-enriched feedings on physiological responses during an ultra endurance
climbing race, showed no effect of diet on serum cortisol levels. It is not clear
yet whether the macronutrient composition of a meal can indeed influence cortisol
levels. The use of mixed meals instead of single macronutrients, as used in the
study by Martens et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, might limit the detection of possible effects of
macronutrients on cortisol levels.</p><p>Men compared with women participating in our study, showed higher meal-induced
salivary cortisol levels and higher overall salivary cortisol levels. According to
the review by Kudielka et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kudielka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, it seems that adult men show higher cortisol responses
to psychological stress tasks compared with women, though there are still
inconsistencies in literature. Kirschbaum et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> showed sex differences for
free salivary cortisol but not for total cortisol stress responses: women taking
oral contraceptives and women in the follicular phase had significantly lower free
cortisol stress responses than men. In our study there were no differences in
salivary cortisol levels between women taking oral contraceptives
(n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11) and women taking no oral contraceptives
(n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8), which is in accordance with studies of e.g. Kirschbaum
et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>
and Liening et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Liening1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Based on the study of Kirschbaum et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> we
hypothesize that the lower salivary cortisol levels in women compared with men might
be explained by the fact that women in our study participated during the follicular
phase, though the effect seen in the study of Kirschbaum et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> was induced
by the psychological stressor, which was not the case in our study. Literature on
gender differences concerning meal-induced cortisol increases is scarce.</p><p>Men in our study had a larger waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio compared
with women. The meta-regression analysis by de Koning et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-deKoning1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> indicated that waist
circumference and waist-to-hip ratio are associated with the risk of cardiovascular
diseases. It can be hypothesized that the greater cortisol response observed in men
may be associated with visceral fat accumulation and an elevated risk for
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and may help explain the higher prevalence for
these diseases in men <xref rid="pone.0016826-Torres1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kyrou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Kudielka1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016826-Rutters2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to significant gender differences concerning physiological cortisol
levels, the psychological mood state did not differ between men and women in our
study and physiological cortisol levels were not related to the psychological mood
state scores. Moreover, the mood state was not affected by macronutrient composition
of the diets. This might be explained by the fact that the high-protein meal and the
high-carbohydrate meal were highly comparable, as shown by the VAS scores for the
appetite profile parameters. Liking of the test meals and feelings of hunger,
thirst, desire to eat, satiety and fullness did not differ between the high-protein
and high-carbohydrate condition. It is known from literature that protein is the
most satiating macronutrient, and that high-protein meals are more satiating than
high-carbohydrate meals <xref rid="pone.0016826-WesterterpPlantenga1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, our
results showed no greater feelings of satiety in the high-protein vs.
high-carbohydrate condition. A possible explanation might be that the morning
consumption of 50 g of yoghurt was relatively high in protein, and due to this high
protein content the lower protein intake and higher carbohydrate intake two hours
later might not have resulted in a difference in feelings of satiety at that
moment.</p><p>In summary, consumption of comparable meals with different macronutrient contents,
i.e. high-protein vs. high-carbohydrate, does not influence the physiological
cortisol response and the psychological mood response differentially. In our
everyday life where stress is a pervasive factor, the development of functional
foods, able to regulate the stress response, would be helpful to improve or maintain
quality of life, as suggested in the review by Takeda et al. <xref rid="pone.0016826-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Foods with the macronutrient
contents used in our study seem ineffective in regulating the physiological and
psychological stress response. Men in our study showed a higher waist-to-hip ratio
and elevated salivary cortisol levels compared with women, which may be associated
with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><p>To conclude, consuming a high-protein vs. a high-carbohydrate meal does not influence
the physiological cortisol response and the psychological mood response
differentially. Men show a higher meal-induced salivary cortisol response compared
with women.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0016826-Torres1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
