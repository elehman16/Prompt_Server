evaluated the immunogenicity of yellow fever (YF) vaccines prepared with substrains
17DD and 17D-213/77. YF antibodies were tittered before and 30 or more days after
vaccination. Seropositivity and seroconversion were analysed according to the
maternal serological status and the collaborating centre. A total of 1,966 children
were randomised in the municipalities of the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas
Gerais and S&#x000e3;o Paulo and blood samples were collected from 1,714 mothers.
Seropositivity was observed in 78.6% of mothers and 8.9% of children before
vaccination. After vaccination, seropositivity rates of 81.9% and 83.2%,
seroconversion rates of 84.8% and 85.8% and rates of a four-fold increase over the
pre-vaccination titre of 77.6% and 81.8% were observed in the 17D-213/77 and 17DD
subgroups, respectively. There was no association with maternal immunity. Among
children aged 12 months or older, the seroconversion rates of 69% were associated
with concomitant vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. The data were not
conclusive regarding the interference of maternal immunity in the immune response to
the YF vaccine, but they suggest interference from other vaccines. The
<italic>failures</italic> in seroconversion after vaccination support the
recommendation of a booster dose in children within 10 years of the first dose.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>yellow fever vaccine</kwd><kwd>randomised clinical trial</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and
subtropical areas in South America and sub-Saharan Africa, with mortality rates ranging
from 20-50% for the severe forms of the disease (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Vasconcelos 2003</xref>). YF is one of the target diseases of the International Health
Regulations that is subject to international notification with the requirement or
recommendation of vaccination for travellers (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">WHO
2005</xref>). The vaccines available in recent decades are live attenuated viral
vaccines prepared with the 17D strain, with different substrains used by manufacturers
(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Monath et al. 2013</xref>). The seroconversion rate of
the vaccine is greater than 95% (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al.
2004</xref>), but a serological correlate of protection has not been established in humans.
The best evidence of vaccine efficacy is based on epidemiological studies showing a
dramatic reduction in the incidence of infection after vaccine introduction (WHO
2013a).</p><p>Immunisation of residents of endemic or threatened areas, along with tourists and visitors
of these areas, is a recommendation of the National Immunisation Programme (PNI) of the
Brazilian Ministry of Health (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">MS/SVS 2014</xref>) and the
World Health Organization (WHO 2013a).</p><p>YF vaccines have demonstrated strong immunogenicity in adults, but studies have
demonstrated lower seroconversion rates in infants (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Grupo
Colaborativo do Programa Nacional de Imuniza&#x000e7;&#x000f5;es para o Estudo da Soroconvers&#x000e3;o pela
Vacina contra Febre Amarela 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Gotuzzo et al.
2013</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Monath et al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, lower
antibody titres observed in younger children compared to adults can result in a shorter
duration of immunity. The accumulation of susceptible or partially protected individuals
may undermine the control of the endemic. Therefore, the recommendation of the WHO and Pan
American Health Organization that the YF vaccine is valid for life (WHO 2013a) may not be
suitable for endemic regions with routine immunisation of infants.</p><p>This study aimed to estimate and compare the seroconversion rates and antibody titres
against YF 30 or more days after vaccination with substrains 17DD and WHO 17D-213/77 in
children aged nine-23 months. There are few studies comparing the immunogenicity of
vaccines from different substrains and those studies included only adults (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al. 2004</xref>). Because the 17DD substrain is only
used by the Brazilian producer, a vaccine with a 17D substrain was included in the study,
considering the implications for vaccine production and immunisation programmes.
Comparative studies demonstrating the performance of the 17DD substrain are important for
international organisations that authorise the producers of YF vaccines (WHO) or
organisations that obtain vaccine for use in other countries (United Nations Children&#x02019;s
Fund).</p><p>The immunogenicity of the vaccines against YF was also compared in subgroups of children
whose mothers were either seropositive (and did not receive the vaccine after delivery) or
seronegative for YF and in subgroups of children who were vaccinated against measles,
rubella and mumps up to 15 or more days apart from the YF vaccine. The frequency of adverse
events in the first 30 days after vaccination was estimated and compared between
vaccines.</p><sec><title>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>
<italic>General study design</italic> - The methods were described in detail in a
previous study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Collaborative Group for Studies with
Yellow Fever 2007</xref>) and they will be briefly presented here. This Phase IV
randomised, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial aimed to compare the immunogenicity
and reactogenicity of two different vaccines against YF prepared with substrains 17DD
(licensed commercial product) and WHO 17D-203/77 (experimental product manufactured from
the WHO seed-lot), both produced by Institute of Immunobiology (Bio-Manguinhos), Oswaldo
Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). The study was conducted in the Brazilian states of Minas
Gerais (MG), Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) and S&#x000e3;o Paulo (SP) where YF vaccinations were
scheduled in the basic immunisation calendar of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Health
care facilities were selected based on the large volume of immunisations performed and
the availability of staff to participate in the study. The Coordinating Study Centre was
headquartered in the Clinical Advisory of the Bio-Manguinhos.</p><p>Children whose serological tests showed no antibodies against YF 30 days after
vaccination (seronegative) were revaccinated. Mothers of children aged less than one
year who agreed to participate in the study were invited to provide blood samples for
measuring antibodies against YF.</p><p>The study was funded by the Brazilian PNI (covenant SVS/MS 514918), Fiocruz and the
National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - (479663/2004-1 and
307868/2003-6). The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">OPS
2005</xref>). The protocol (CAAE - 0038.1.011.000-03) and informed consent form were
approved by the Fiocruz Research Ethical Committee (CEP-Fiocruz document of approval
236A/03) and State Health Departments [CEP-SES-DF document of approval 069/2005;
CEP-UFMS (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul)] letter of approval 738/2006). The
protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration ISRCTN72367932).</p><p>
<italic>Eligibility criteria</italic> - Mothers and caretakers of children eligible for
YF vaccination were invited to participate in the study when they spontaneously attended
the selected public health care facilities. Children aged nine-23 months without a
history of YF vaccination available for blood sample collection 30 days after
vaccination and with an informed consent form signed by parents or guardians were
included in the study. Enrolment considered the contraindications to the vaccine: severe
malnutrition, transient or permanent immunosuppression induced by diseases,
immunosuppressive drugs, radiotherapy (topical or inhaled corticosteroids for less than
two weeks did not lead to exclusion from the study, but these factors were recorded in
the questionnaire), therapy with immunoglobulin or other blood products, administration
of experimental vaccine 60 days before the study or an administration scheduled within
60 days after the study, history of hypersensitivity to chicken eggs (and their
derivatives) or gelatin, chronic or acute severe diseases (mothers&#x02019; report or report
available in the health care service) and fever (axillary temperature of 37.5&#x000ba;C or
higher) on the day of vaccination.</p><p>The following amendments were incorporated into the protocol: the maximum age for
participation was changed from 10 years to 23 months because the number of unvaccinated
children above two years was minimal; the minimum interval for post-vaccination
serological testing was reduced from 45 to 30 days based on the available kinetics data
for post-vaccination antibodies.</p><p>
<italic>Vaccination</italic> - The YF vaccines produced by Bio-Manguinhos were: (i) the
17DD substrain that was being used across the country and (ii) a vaccine manufactured
from the WHO17D-213/77 seed-lot, successfully used in a randomised, placebo-controlled
study (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al. 2004</xref>). The distribution,
handling and administration of vaccines followed the recommendations of the manufacturer
(Bio-Manguinhos) and the PNI (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">MS/FNS/PNI 2001</xref>).
Vaccines were prepared from attenuated virus grown in specific pathogen-free chicken
embryos according to the WHO standards (WHO 1998). The 17DD vaccine that is routinely
used in Brazil was produced from secondary seed-lot 102 (passage # 287) of the 17DD
substrain. The 17D-213/77 substrain vaccine was produced from the WHO seed-lot in an
experimental batch to be used only in this study. The vaccines were produced with good
manufacturing practices (GMP) and have the following composition per dose (0.5 mL): YF
virus (&#x0003e; 1,000 LD<sub>50</sub>), sucrose (0.8 mg), sodium glutamate (4.05 mg),
sorbitol (8.5 mg), hydrolysed bovine gelatin (5.0 mg), erythromycin (3.0 mcg) and
kanamycin (10.0 mcg). The diluent (water for injection) was the same used in routine YF
vaccination: lot 04UDFA161Z, expiration date 04/2009. The lots and expiration dates of
the vaccines used were as follows: (i) 17DD vaccine, seed-lot 993FB013Z, lot 055VFA054P,
expiration date 05/2007 and (ii) 17D vaccine, WHO (17D: 213/77) seed-lot, lot
04UVFAEX34, expiration date 12/2006.</p><p>Cold chain was used for the transport and storage of vaccines and the temperature was
carefully monitored at all stages of the study. In the collaborating centres and health
care facilities where the vaccines were administered, the vaccines were kept in
refrigerators only for vaccine storage (2-8&#x000ba;C) in properly identified containers.</p><p>The vaccine application procedures, which are described in detail in the Operations
Handbook of the study, included reconstituting the lyophilised vaccine (vials of 5
doses) with diluent in 2.5-mL vials immediately before application. The vaccine and
diluent were kept at temperatures between 2-8&#x000ba;C and were protected from light. After the
application of one dose from each vial, the vials were discarded. Following the
subcutaneous administration of a single dose (0.5 mL) in the deltoid region, children
were observed for approximately 30 min at the health care centre with equipment and a
team prepared for any acute reaction.</p><p>The vaccinators were selected according to their experience in vaccine rooms; they were
trained for the specific study procedures and were supervised during the field work by
nurses from the vaccination unit. Daily storage conditions (maximum and minimum
refrigerator temperatures) and preparation of the vaccine for use were recorded.</p><p>
<italic>Outcomes</italic> - The primary outcome of the study was based on the levels of
antibodies against YF. The antibody titre in the serum was measured using the plaque
reduction neutralisation test (PRNT), which is considered the most sensitive and
specific test for YF (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">WHO 1998</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Niedrig et al. 1999</xref>). Serum aliquots from blood
samples collected immediately before and 30 days or more after vaccination were labelled
with numeric codes and submitted to the PRNT in the Viral Technology Laboratory (LATEV)
of Bio-Manguinhos which has extensive experience with this procedure. Seropositivity was
defined as an antibody titre &#x02265; 2.8 log<sub>10</sub>mIU/mL obtained by the reference
serum calibrated with the international standard (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">NIBSC
2011</xref>). Seroconversion was defined as (i) seropositivity after vaccination in
individuals who were seronegative (titres &#x0003c; 2.70 mIU/mL) in the pre-vaccination
serological tests and (ii) a ratio of post-vaccination/pre-vaccination titres &#x02265; 4
(intention-to-treat analysis). Criterion (i) above disregarded borderline titres (2.70 &#x02264;
titre &#x0003c; 2.80) to avoid false negative results. These complementary forms of analysing
the outcomes enabled better use of the serological data.</p><p>All vaccinated volunteers were included in the safety analysis, which evaluated events
that occurred up to 30 days after vaccination. During the second visit, when
post-vaccination blood was collected, the investigators asked the parents about the
occurrence of signs and symptoms after vaccination. Moreover, the events that occurred
during the first 10 days after vaccination were recorded on a standardised form
completed by the parents. Severe adverse events (resulting in hospitalisation, death or
risk of death and disability, even when temporary) were reported immediately throughout
the study period.</p><p>
<italic>Randomisation and blinding</italic> - The participants were randomised in
comparison groups (vaccines from the 17D-213/77 and 17DD substrains) at an 1:1 ratio in
permuted blocks of six that were generated by computer and stratified by centre (state).
The vaccine vials were labelled with numbers assigned in a randomisation list. The
participants received the vaccine from the vials labelled with the sequence of natural
numbers as they presented for vaccination. Therefore, the participants were allocated
randomly and blindly to one of the groups. Only one of five doses of vaccine from each
vial was used and the study participant was identified with the number of the vial. The
participant, the research team and the data analyst did not know what type of vaccine
was used. Both types of vaccines and their vials looked identical. The statistician who
generated and maintained the randomisation list was not involved in the data analysis.
Opening the codes and breaking the blind before the conclusion of the study could be
allowed by the steering committee if deemed necessary to manage severe adverse
events.</p><p>
<italic>Sample size and data analysis</italic> - The number of participants in each
group was calculated based on the following parameters: 80% statistical power, 95%
significance level, two-tailed test, seroconversion rate of 90% in one group (p1),
relevant minimum difference in seroconversion between the groups (p1-p2) of 5% and 20%
correction for losses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Fleiss 1986</xref>). With 650
children in each group, differences of up to 0.3 log<sub>10</sub> in the mean titres of
antibodies against YF between groups could be detected with 80% power. For adverse
events with frequencies of up to 5%, the size of the proposed sample had 82% power to
detect a 5% difference between the groups. For more rare events, the sample would have
the power to detect larger differences.</p><p>The vaccines were designated by codes in the database, so the analyst did not know the
type of vaccine administered. The analysis of the adverse events considered the entire
cohort, including participants that did not adhere to the protocol (&#x0201c;intention-to-treat&#x0201d;
analysis in the full cohort). For the immunogenicity analysis, the full cohort consisted
of all randomised subjects who had post-vaccination serological tests. A secondary
analysis of the subset that adhered to the protocol excluded individuals who received
other vaccines, hyperimmune sera or drugs categorised in the exclusion and elimination
criteria, seropositive individuals on pre-vaccination serology, individuals outside the
age range of the study, individuals who had blood collected for serology outside the
time window specified in the protocol and individuals who had clinical complications
that could affect the immune response to vaccination or who had broken the blind for any
reason.</p><p>The rates of seroconversion (ratio of post-vaccination/pre-vaccination titres &#x02265; 4), the
geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the frequency of adverse events were estimated at 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). To determine the GMTs, individuals with antibody titres
below the serological test threshold received a value corresponding to half the
threshold value.</p><p>Reverse cumulative distribution curves and histograms of the logarithms of antibody
titres were built to compare the immunogenicity of the two vaccines over the entire
range of titre values. The seroconversion rate was compared between the vaccinated
groups and the statistical significance was assessed using the chi-square test. The mean
logarithms (base 10) of the post-vaccination antibody titres were compared using
Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test.</p><p>The effect of the maternal serological status on children&#x02019;s immune status was analysed
by the seropositivity before vaccination and the proportion of children who did not
seroconvert after vaccination, stratified by type of vaccine. The analyses of
immunogenicity and reactogenicity were stratified by collaborating centre.</p><p>The frequency, time of the beginning and duration of adverse events were tabulated by
type of event and group. Adverse events were analysed according to the following
categories: well-known reactions to vaccine, events whose relationship to the vaccine
was not known and events considered not associated with the vaccine. Regardless of the
known associations, the event frequencies were compared between the groups per category
of time of appearance, i.e., distinguishing the early and late events. The data were
entered into an application specifically prepared for this study that generated
databases formatted for analysis using SPSS software v.16.0 (SPSS, Inc, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 1,966 children were recruited between October 2005-December 2006 in four
collaborating centres that received one of the two types of vaccine against YF used in
the study. The number of mothers approached is not available. The collaborating centres
were the municipalities of Ribeir&#x000e3;o das Neves and Contagem, in the metropolitan region
of Belo Horizonte (n = 521), Juiz de Fora, Lima Duarte and Matias Barbosa, in MG (n =
819), Campo Grande, MS (n = 374) and Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, SP (n = 252). There were no
incidents, adverse events or medical care that resulted in opening the codes (breaking
the blind).</p><p>Of the 1,966 volunteers who received one of the study vaccines, 14 children did not have
pre-vaccination serological test results and 55 children did not have post-vaccination
serological test results. The losses made up 3.2% of the participants in the 17D-213/77
vaccine group and 2.4% of those in the 17DD vaccine group and resulted from difficulties
in venipuncture or missing the post-vaccination blood collection. Blood samples could
not be collected from the mothers of 252 children (12.8%) because they either did not
want to participate or they were not the ones responsible for the children at the time
of the vaccination.</p><p>The distributions of the relevant variables were similar between the two groups before
vaccination (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). The seropositivity in
children before vaccination was substantial (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table
I</xref>), ranging from 12.8-5.6% between the collaborating centres and from 8.9-9.9%
in the age subgroups of eight-nine months and 12 months and older, respectively (data
not shown). The majority of the mothers were seropositive for YF at rates that varied
substantially among the collaborating centres (88.6-71.9%).</p><p>

<italic>Adverse events</italic> - A total of 25.9% and 25.5% of children who received
the 17D-213/77 and 17DD vaccines, respectively, presented signs or symptoms, either
systemically or at the injection site, regardless of the presumed association with
vaccination. Of the 505 children with some type of adverse reaction, 38.6% (17D-213/77)
and 39.8% (17DD) received medical care. Fever was the most common adverse event (16.8%
and 15.8% in the 17D-213/77 and 17DD vaccines, respectively). Of the children who had
fever, 44.2% in the 17DD group and 40.6% in the 17D-213/77 group received medical care
(not necessarily only due to fever). Vomiting was reported in 3.1% of children, with no
significant difference between the two groups. Two severe events temporally associated
with vaccination were reported. In the first, in Juiz de Fora, a nine-month-old child
had one seizure 4 h after receiving the YF vaccine used in the study and had a second
episode during his/her stay in the emergency department. Lumbar puncture was not
performed and the child was discharged two days later. After three months, the child did
not present abnormalities and was medicated for anaemia and epilepsy. In the second
event, also in Juiz de Fora, 6 h after vaccination, a nine-month-old child presented
with a 39.5&#x000ba;C fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, cough with hoarseness, postnasal drip,
refusal of diet offered, hydrated and absence of nuchal rigidity. Complete clinical
remission was observed a few days after treatment. A causality assessment based on WHO
classification (WHO 2013b) indicated inconsistent causal association to immunisation in
both cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Immunogenicity variations among strains are known in other live attenuated viral
vaccines and had been shown for YF 17D vaccine substrains in adults (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Pfister et al. 2005</xref>). In the present study,
differences in the intensity of the immune response to the 17D-213/77 and 17DD
substrains showed no significant impact on either seropositivity or reactogenicity in
children, which is in agreement with studies in adults (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al. 2004</xref>) and in 12-month-old children (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento-Silva et al. 2011</xref>). The confirmation that the
immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the 17DD substrain were similar to those observed
in other substrains is relevant because Brazil is the only country using the 17DD
substrain.</p><p>The data from the immunisation programme indicating high YF vaccination coverage in
children (unpublished data) led us to change the protocol of this study, limiting the
target age range to children under two years. In fact, the study group consisted
predominantly of children under the age of 12 months, which constituted the majority of
children spontaneously brought to health care facilities for the YF vaccination.
Therefore, this study could not analyse possible differences in the immune responses
between infants and children over 18 months, with the latter group being expected to be
less influenced by maternal immunity and to exhibit greater maturity of the immune
system.</p><p>Seropositivity for YF before vaccination (9% in this study) has been reported with a
frequency of 0-19% in previous paediatric studies (Meyer Jr et al. 1964, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ruben et al. 1973</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yvonnet et al. 1986</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lhuillier et al.
1989</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Mouchon et al. 1990</xref>, Soula 1991,
<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adu et al. 1996</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Stefano et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Osei-Kwasi et
al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Belmusto-Worn et al. 2005</xref>,
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento-Silva et al. 2011</xref>). These studies
were performed over five decades in different populations in Africa and South America,
with different age groups and serological methods as well as potential differences in
nutritional status, previous exposure to other flaviviruses and maternal vaccination
history or natural YF infection. None of those studies presented serological data,
vaccination or infection history of mothers. In general, pre-vaccination seropositivity
can be explained by the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies to the foetus and
it can interfere with the immune response to vaccination in infants (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Niewiesk 2014</xref>). Monitoring of children whose mothers
had been vaccinated against YF during pregnancy revealed neutralising antibodies for YF
in 89.4% of these children shortly after birth (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Suzano
et al. 2006</xref>). These neutralising antibodies were likely of maternal origin
because none of the new-borns were positive for IgM and 95% of the mothers had IgG
antibodies against YF. At 12 months of age, 7% of these children were seropositive and
12% presented with indeterminate serology (2.7 log<sub>10</sub> mIU/mL). In the present
study, the proportion of mothers who were seropositive for YF at the time of vaccination
was high (79%), which is consistent with the vaccination recommendation for the areas in
which they lived. However, maternal immunity was not associated with the seropositivity
of children before vaccination. It must be considered that the maternal serological
status at the time of vaccination of the children was a proxy of the serological status
at the time of delivery. This assumption seemed reasonable because there had not been
any recent immunisation campaigns or outbreaks of the disease in those areas. It was
also convenient, considering that verification of the maternal immunisation history from
the vaccine record is difficult in adults and does not inform about immunity by natural
infection. Breastfeeding, which was not assessed in this study, can also affect the
response to vaccination, either favouring (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg et
al. 1994</xref>) or inhibiting immunity (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pichichero
1990</xref>).</p><p>The interference of heterologous immunity in the immune response or in the antibody
titration methods has been a concern in areas with circulation of other flaviviruses.
Although plausible, this interference has not been confirmed in previous studies
conducted in areas endemic for dengue (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Belmusto-Worn et
al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Martins et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Monath et al. 2013</xref>). Data on flavivirus infections
other than dengue and YF in humans are scarce in Brazil and neighbouring countries and
indicate that flaviviruses do circulate. Except for rare and limited outbreaks, they
have not raised public health concerns. Even if flaviviruses besides dengue and YF posed
undisclosed public health problems, it is unlikely that it would be concealed for so
long if its magnitude were substantial. Thus, it seems legitimate to assume that
flavivirus interference has not played a major role in the serological status of
children who participated in this study.</p><p>The WHO recommendation of YF vaccination from nine-12 months of age is based on safety
data and risk of infection (WHO 2013a) and does not consider the differences in the
immune response in this age group compared to adults. The immaturity of the immune
system in the first year of life has been recognised as a limiting factor for the
immunogenicity of various vaccines (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Siegrist
2013</xref>) and may partially explain the results of this study that showed lower
seroconversion and seropositivity rates compared to adults. The seroconversion rates
observed in this study were comparable to those observed in Peru (88.5% with
YF-VAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>vaccine) in children nine-18 months old (Belmusto-Worn 2005) and in
Bras&#x000ed;lia, the Federal District (DF) (88.8% with 17DD vaccine) in children 13 months old
in which the YF vaccine was administered at least 30 days after the MMR vaccine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento-Silva et al. 2011</xref>). In the latter study,
children who received the MMR and YF vaccines on the same day (in separate injections)
had an even lower seroconversion rate (70%) than children who received these vaccines 30
days apart. Lower seroconversion rates compared to those of adults (67.9-84.6%) were
also observed in SP (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Stefano et al. 1999</xref>), where
nine-month-old children received YF and measles vaccines at intervals ranging from
one-28 days. In Upper Volta (Meyer Jr et al. 1964), a study analysed children aged
five-54 months (approximately 75% of them younger than 12 months) vaccinated with a
needle-free injector (&#x0201c;jet injector&#x0201d;). A seroconversion rate of 97% was observed in the
subgroup of children who received the YF vaccine alone and a rate of 85% was observed in
children who received a combination of vaccines against measles, smallpox and YF in the
same syringe. In Mali (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Soula et al. 1991</xref>), a
study reported a seroconversion rate of 92.7% in infants aged four-eight months who
received a combination of vaccines against YF and measles. Additionally, a combination
of measles and YF vaccines in C&#x000f4;te d&#x02019;Ivoire (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lhuillier
et al. 1989</xref>) resulted in seroconversion rates of 88% and 91% in infants
younger than seven months and older than eight months, respectively. In Nigeria (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ruben et al. 1973</xref>), children aged six-24 months (34%
of them aged 6-11 months) who received simultaneous measles, smallpox and YF vaccines in
separate applications with a &#x0201c;jet injector&#x0201d; had a seroconversion rate of 96.6% for YF. A
subgroup who received measles, smallpox, YF and diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP)
vaccines had a seroconversion rate of 94.8%. In Nigeria (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adu et al. 1996</xref>), infants aged six-eight months had a seroconversion rate of
87.1% when they received a simultaneous application of the YF and measles vaccines and a
rate of 93.1% with the YF vaccine alone. In these subgroups of vaccines, children aged
nine-12 months presented with very similar seroconversion rates (95.7% and 96.9%,
respectively). In Senegal (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yvonnet et al. 1986</xref>),
children aged nine-36 months who received a simultaneous application of the hepatitis B,
measles, polio and DTP vaccines in separate injections had seroconversion rates of
91.5-93.6% for YF in subgroups with different mean ages (18.3 and 26.2 months). In Ghana
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Osei-Kwasi et al. 2001</xref>), the seropositivity
of infants aged six and nine months was 98.6% and 98%, respectively, three months after
the YF vaccination. In a multicentre observational study in children (mean age 9.3
months) in Senegal and Guiana (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Michel et al.
2015</xref>), 92.9% of children vaccinated simultaneously against YF and measles and
90.7% vaccinated seven-28 days apart were seropositive.</p><p>Other studies performed in children older than 12 months of age have reported
post-vaccination seropositivity rates against YF of 94% in the Central African Republic
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Georges et al. 1985</xref>), 94.7% in Mali (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Soula et al. 1991</xref>) and 94.6-96.6% in Peru (Vacina
Arilvax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Belmusto-Worn et al.
2005</xref>).</p><p>The great diversity of scenarios, methodological approaches and other features not
specified in previous studies precludes clearly distinguishing what determines the
differences observed in the levels of seropositivity and antibody titres after
vaccination. Relevant elements, such as the power of the vaccine, mode of
administration, concomitant application of other vaccines (particularly the live
attenuated viral vaccines) and the serological method used, varied widely and may have
interfered in the evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.</p><p>The three outcomes established in this study sought to help with the challenges in
immunogenicity measurement using imperfect tests. The inaccuracy in the proportion of
seropositivity results from the application of cut-off points in the titres and
misclassifications in both pre and post-vaccination tests. The proportion of
seroconversion after excluding seropositive individuals before vaccination was also
affected by the limitations of seropositivity classification. The derivation of
seroconversion from the variation of the antibody titres of each individual before and
after vaccination reduces the impact of the serological test inaccuracy and highlights
the capacity of the vaccine to increase the pre-existing titres. In contrast,
seroconversion arbitrarily defined as a four-fold increase over pre-vaccination titres
may be less sensitive in detecting weak responses.</p><p>The variations in the results obtained in the collaborative centres of this study did
not affect its conclusions and can be attributed to differences in the age distribution
and in the pre-vaccine immunity and maternal immunity profiles. Considerable effort was
invested in the standardisation of the study procedures, thus minimising the
contribution of the methodology to the differences (e.g., vaccination technique and
measurement of antibody titres) in the results among the centres.</p><p>Despite the limitations on comparability with previous studies, most of the studies have
reported a lower seropositivity in infants than what is generally observed in adults and
older children. The eligibility criteria for routine vaccination excluded some of the
most important conditions that interfere with the immune response, such as
immunodeficiency and malnutrition, which therefore do not explain the lower
seroconversion rates relative to adults. Infants who would have been eligible for
routine vaccination may have been excluded by the conservative criteria of clinical
studies. Thus, the result is a healthier-than-average study population vaccinated under
controlled conditions, which may optimise the performance of the vaccine.</p><p>The reactogenicity profile of the vaccines in this study was similar to that in other
studies regarding the frequency and nature of events (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Belmusto-Worn et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento-Silva
et al. 2011</xref>). The systemic events were nonspecific and cannot be distinguished
from the clinical problems common in this age group. Perhaps the variations in the
frequencies of these complications explain part of the differences between the studies.
The signs and symptoms at the injection site also occurred with expected
frequencies.</p><p>The data from this study are not conclusive regarding the interference of maternal
immunity on the immune response to the YF vaccine. Interference from other vaccines
applied simultaneously, particularly those from live attenuated viruses, has been
suggested in several studies cited above. Regardless of the mechanism, the evidence that
the YF vaccination may fail to seroconvert a significant proportion of infants indicates
that the recommendation to vaccinate every 10 years or that one dose of vaccine protects
throughout one&#x02019;s lifetime needs to be reviewed. This issue has been controversial, which
prompted an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Work Group (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) to conduct an additional review of the available evidence (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Staples et al. 2015</xref>). As a result, the
recommendation for booster doses was discontinued for most travellers but was kept for
travellers who plan to spend a prolonged period in endemic areas or those travelling to
highly endemic areas.</p><p>The Brazilian PNI has maintained vaccination at nine months of age and anticipated
booster vaccination at four years of age based on epidemiological and programmatic
criteria and published studies on the vaccine (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">MS/SVS/DVDT/CGPNI 2014</xref>). A second dose was not considered appropriate during
the second year of life, which already has several other vaccines for diseases
considered more relevant than YF for public health. Postponing to four years of age (~3
years after the 1st dose) averted the busy immunisation schedule, without adding
significant risk of disease. In fact, from 1990-2009, 21 cases of YF below five years of
age were reported in Brazil. From 2007-2012, seven cases have been reported in children
below 15 years of age, all of them unvaccinated (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Martins
&#x00026; Homma 2014</xref>). Future studies should investigate whether individuals will
need to be vaccinated indefinitely every 10 years after the second dose of YF
vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>COLLABORATIVE GROUP FOR STUDIES OF YELLOW FEVER VACCINE</title><p>
