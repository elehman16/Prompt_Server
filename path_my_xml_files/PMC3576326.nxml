Preliminary evidence suggests that home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT) might help increasing the chance of achieving blood pressure targets and improve patient&#x02019;s therapeutic adherence. However, all these potential advantages of HBPT have not yet been fully investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The purpose of this open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled study is to assess whether, in patients with high cardiovascular risk (treated or untreated essential arterial hypertension - both in the office and in ambulatory conditions over 24 h - and metabolic syndrome), long-term (48 weeks) blood pressure control is more effective when based on HBPT and on the feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on blood pressure determination during quarterly office visits (conventional management (CM)). A total of 252 patients will be enrolled and randomized to usual care (<italic>n</italic>=84) or HBPT (<italic>n</italic>=168). The primary study endpoint will be the rate of subjects achieving normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure targets (&#x0003c;135/85 mmHg) 24 weeks and 48 weeks after randomization. In addition, the study will assess the psychological determinants of adherence and persistence to drug therapy, through specific psychological tests administered during the course of the study. Other secondary study endpoints will be related to the impact of HBPT on additional clinical and economic outcomes (number of additional medical visits, direct costs of patient management, number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed, level of cardiovascular risk, degree of target organ damage and rate of cardiovascular events, regression of the metabolic syndrome).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The TELEBPMET Study will show whether HBPT is effective in improving blood pressure control and related medical and economic outcomes in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. It will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological determinants of medication adherence and blood pressure control of these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01541566</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Home blood pressure telemonitoring</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Personality traits</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of arterial hypertension in the European population is estimated to approximate 20%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, and renal failure, and it is one of the most frequent reasons for access to medical care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hypertension is also often associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes, which give rise to a condition known as metabolic syndrome, affecting one-quarter of the population and increasing by five- to six-fold cardiac morbidity and mortality as compared to healthy individuals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although numerous studies have shown that antihypertensive treatment may reduce cardiovascular risk and despite availability of several valuable antihypertensive drug options, today, no more than 30% of treated hypertensive patients maintain a satisfactory blood pressure control
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>This may be caused by many factors, among which poor or complete lack of adherence to treatment prescriptions have been reported to play a major role. Compliance to therapy seems to be related to many factors including the high number of pills to be taken daily, an excessive cost of the available medications, the lack of motivation and poor patient&#x02019;s involvement in the management of this clinical condition, the long wait in the doctor&#x02019;s office, the absence of symptoms, the inability of the patient to understand the real long-term consequences of high blood pressure, and finally the psychological and personality traits of the patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Different solutions may be adopted in order to improve blood pressure control and patients&#x02019; adherence to therapy. An effective organization for a better management of this condition based on new technologies, through which the efficacy of therapy can be monitored, could help patients to get more involved in the daily care of their treatment, and to better cooperate with the physician. One of the methods used to obtain a better therapy adherence and therefore a more effective blood pressure control is now represented by self-measurement of blood pressure at home by automatic electronic devices
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This method represents a valuable alternative to conventional blood pressure measurement by physicians in their offices. Several studies have shown that, compared to office blood pressure measurement, self-measurement of blood pressure at home allows a better control of blood pressure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and that the blood pressure assessment so obtained has a superior prognostic value
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Home blood pressure may also have some positive effect on therapeutic adherence, though evidence on this aspect is controversial, with some studies showing a clear benefit and others showing no advantage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Lack of definite evidence might be attributed to the limited number of studies performed so far, and to the heterogeneity of the methodologies employed to assess and quantify patients&#x02019; compliance with treatment in the different trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Evidence from randomized studies suggests that home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT), defined as home blood pressure monitoring coupled with telematic data transmission to the doctor and real-time feedback on patient&#x02019;s status, may improve blood pressure control and compliance to treatment, and may help in optimizing the patient&#x02019;s therapeutic regimen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Although HBPT may in particular be of great advantage for those patients requiring a closer follow-up, as in the case of high-risk hypertensive patients, at the moment it has not yet been clarified whether this approach may actually improve blood pressure control and adherence and persistence to antihypertensive drug treatment also in this category of hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The study aims at investigating whether in high-risk patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome, daytime ambulatory blood pressure control over 48 weeks is more effective when based on regular HBPT (intervention group), through monthly automated blood pressure teletransmission and feedback to the patient by the doctor, rather than when based only on periodic measurements made by doctors in their office during quarterly visits (conventional management (CM) control group). The main study endpoint will be the assessment and comparison of the rate of subjects achieving a daytime ambulatory blood pressure normalization (average daytime blood pressure &#x0003c;135/85 mmHg) in the two randomization groups (intervention <italic>vs</italic>. control).</p><p>The study will also assess the psychological determinants of adherence and persistence to drug therapy and the influence of HBPT on such psychological factors, as well as the impact of HBPT on additional clinical and economic outcomes. These will include the number of additional medical visits, direct costs of patient management, number of drugs or drug combinations used to achieve blood pressure control, the level of cardiovascular risk, the degree of target organ damage and frequency of cardiovascular events, and the regression of the metabolic syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study has an open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled design. After 1 week of run-in, patients will be randomized to two different arms: (1) intervention group (HBPT), with automated teletransmission of home blood pressure values to the Investigator, every month, over the first 24 weeks, followed by manual transmission of self-measured blood pressure data to the HBPT center immediately before each office visit, with regular doctor&#x02019;s visit every 3 months, in the second 24 weeks (see below for details); (2) control group (CM) managed only through regular office visit every 3 months.

These devices will be kept at home until the end of the study.</p><p>The patient will be adequately trained by the Investigator on measurement procedures. Patients will be asked to self-measure their blood pressure at home twice a day, using a validated, automatic, electronic, oscillometric, upper arm monitor (A&#x00026;D UA-767PC, A&#x00026;D Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The device can store up to 126 blood pressure measurements in its memory, is operated by non-rechargeable batteries, and is equipped with a serial port for interfacing with a personal computer or a transmission unit.</p><p>Two measurements, at a 2-min interval, will be taken in the morning before going to work or before starting daily activities (between 08:00 and 10:00), and two measurements will be taken in the evening (between 18:00 and 22:00), for a minimum of 3 days a week. The measurements have to be taken in a quiet environment, with the patient in a relaxed, comfortable, sitting position for at least 5 min before self-measurement.</p><p>After each measuring session and when not used for measuring blood pressure, the blood pressure monitor will be connected through a serial cable to a GPRS wireless interface (BluMed). During the first 24 weeks, the transmitter will send blood pressure data every day to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.morepress.net">http://www.morepress.net</ext-link> website, (Biotechmed Ltd., Somma Lombardo, Varese, Italy) where they will be analyzed and a report will be generated and sent once a month via email to the Investigator. A feedback on the status of patient&#x02019;s blood pressure control will also be visualized on the interface display.</p><p>The wireless interface also comes with a button which allows the patient to manually send the data to the HBPT center whenever it is deemed necessary (for example, in case of symptoms or very high blood pressure values), independently from the scheduled program. During the last 24 weeks of the follow-up no automatic data transmission will be done, but the patient will be requested to manually send to the HBPT center the self-measured blood pressure data, immediately before each scheduled office visit.</p><p>A diagram of the telemonitoring web-based system is shown in Figure&#x02009;

Laboratory tests useful for the determination of the organ damage and cardiovascular risk will be assessed as well. These tests include biochemistry and urinalysis (plasma lipids, fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, creatinine, C-reactive protein, albumin/creatinine ratio on morning urine sample or 24-h microalbuminuria), an echocardiogram with determination of left ventricular mass, a carotid ultrasonography for determination of intima-media thickness, a fundoscopy, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Waist circumference will also be measured. A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be performed (see below for details).</p><p>Within 1 week from Visit 1 those patients complying with the inclusion criteria (that is, values of office systolic blood pressure &#x02265;140 mmHg and/or office diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;90 mmHg plus daytime systolic blood pressure &#x02265;135 and/or daytime diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;85 mmHg, plus presence of metabolic syndrome) will be randomized to the CM group or to the HBPT group (Visit 2).</p><p>During the same visit the patients will be administered the following psychological tests: Medical Outcome Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36), Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Locus of Control (LoC), Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI), Illness Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ) and Coping strategies (COPE), forming set 1, and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAY), Type D Personality (TDP), Type A Personality (TAP), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), forming set 2

Office blood pressure will still be measured by the Investigator with the same automatic electronic instrument used for self-measurement, in all patients, including those randomized to HBPT. Additional visits are scheduled 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after randomization (Visits 4, 5, 6, and 7). During each of these visits office blood pressure will be measured and antihypertensive medication will be changed according to office (CM group) or home blood pressure values (HBPT group). Drug treatment can also be changed in the patients of the HBPT between the scheduled visits, based on the home blood pressure report monthly received and reviewed by the Investigator. The same laboratory tests performed at screening visit and a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recording will be repeated at Visits 5 and 7. During these two visits psychological tests will also be administered, with the exclusion of STAY, TDP, TAP, and TCI test, administered only at Visit 2.</p><p>Occurrence of adverse events, adherence to therapy and concomitant therapies will be checked at all visits during the trial. Evaluation of adherence to drug treatment will be based on patient&#x02019;s report on amount of prescribed drug intake and on counting the quantity of study medication taken by the patient, comparing this datum with the quantity expected to be returned. The Investigator will instruct each patient to bring back used and unused drug blisters at each visit. The compliance will be computed as the ratio between the number of pills taken and the number of pills which should have been taken, expressed as a percentage, and will then be graded as follows: excellent (100% of prescribed pills taken), good (80% to 99%), fair (40% to 79%), or poor (&#x0003c;40%).</p></sec><sec><title>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring</title><p>At Visit 1, and subsequently at Visit 5 and at final visit (Visit 7) an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be performed non-invasively over 24 h by an oscillometric validated device

Based on these reports, the Investigator will be allowed to adjust drug treatment before the next visit or to schedule an extra study visit. Starting from Visit 5 until the end of the study (Visit 7), the patients randomized to HBPT will continue to self-measure blood pressure at home, but automatic transmission will be disabled and each patient will be asked to manually send blood pressure data the day immediately preceding the office visit at the Center. These home blood pressure measurements will be reviewed by the Investigator exclusively on Visits 6 and 7, and treatment adjusted accordingly.</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological tests</title><p>With the aim to investigate the psychological impact of HBPT clinical psychologists will assess psychological dimensions at Visits 2, 5, and 7 by using the following standardized questionnaires: </p><p>(1) SF-36: a generic tool for assessing the quality of life, aiming at quantifying the impact of disease on general health and on the psychological profile, for the determination of the most characteristic aspects affecting quality of life in relation to a standard reference population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]</p><p>(2) PGWBI: a tool for the assessment of psychological wellbeing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]</p><p>(3) BDI: this test can be considered as a standard reference among the self-assessment scales. A key feature of the scale is the precise definition of the criteria for quantification, since every item corresponds to a given level of severity. The scale is the most specific self-assessment tool for depression, exploring a narrow range of symptoms by excluding those related to anxiety
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]</p><p>(4) LoC: this test measures the tendency to attribute the causes of behavior to internal or external conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]</p><p>(5) SEI: this test measures the degree of self-esteem of the patient
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]</p><p>(6) IBQ: this test measures the disease perception
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]</p><p>(7) COPE: the test is designed to be a measuring instrument capable of assessing the more subtle individual differences in coping. It is able to balance the general trend of the subject with the current response to the stressful situation. Due to its characteristics, this test is suitable for studies aiming at clarifying more thoroughly the possible influence of personality aspects on adaptation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</p><p>In order to investigate the personality traits underlying the adherence behavior, clinical psychologists will also assess the following psychological dimensions only at Visit 2 by using the following standardized questionnaires:</p><p>(1) STAY: this test assesses the degree of trait anxiety severity

Our study will help adding further evidence on the effectiveness of treatment decision of hypertension based on home blood pressure monitoring or HBPT. Findings from previous studies are controversial to this regard. In the THOP (Treatment of Hypertension based on home or Office blood Pressure) trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], antihypertensive drug treatment in hypertensive patients with an office diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;95 mmHg, was adjusted in a stepwise fashion based on either the self-measured diastolic blood pressure at home or on readings taken at the doctor&#x02019;s office. Adjustment of antihypertensive treatment based on home blood pressure led to less intensive drug treatment and marginally lower costs, but also to less blood pressure control, with no differences in quality of life and target organ damage. Similarly, in the HOMERUS (Home versus Office blood pressure MEasurements: Reduction of Unnecessary treatment Study) trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] self-measurement of blood pressure at home led to less medication use than office blood pressure measurement without leading to significant differences in office blood pressure values or target organ damage. However, in both the aforementioned studies, the target value for home blood pressure was the same as that for office blood pressure and higher than that recommended by current guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. More recently, the HOMED-BP (Hypertension Objective Treatment Based on Measurement by Electrical Devices of Blood Pressure)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] proved that adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment on the basis of blood pressure values collected through HBPT is feasible and effective for maintaining an optimal target blood pressure level and optimal antihypertensive medication. This is in line with a systematic meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies, which demonstrated the superiority of HBPT <italic>vs</italic>. usual care in improving blood pressure control in either low- or high-risk hypertensive patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Secondarily, the trial will investigate and compare between randomization groups personality traits predictive of adherence. This will be useful to identify possible psychological determinants of adherence to antihypertensive treatment, also relating them to blood pressure response to antihypertensive treatment in daily life conditions. Poor adherence to treatment remains one of the major limitations in the management of hypertension: it may cause poor blood pressure control and may contribute to increased morbidity, mortality, and costs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown that persistence with antihypertensive therapy decreases with time: discontinuation rates vary from 22% to 50% of patients during the first year after treatment initiation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, improving adherence to treatment remains a major challenge for the treating physician. Use of blood pressure telemonitoring technique, which might help in improving blood pressure control and adherence, together with quantification and definition of the psychological trait of the hypertensive patient, might help identifying features of high-risk hypertensive patients and increase the chance of successful treatment.</p><p>The study will also evaluate the impact of HBPT on additional medical and economic outcomes, which might help in unmasking possible additional advantages of this technique in high-risk hypertensive patients, on a relatively long-term follow-up.</p><p>Before drawing the conclusions we must acknowledge that the study protocol suffers from some potential methodological limitations. First, allocation of patients to one of the two study groups will be concealed from the Investigator by means of sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes. We acknowledge that this approach may introduce a bias and that central computerized randomization would be preferred. However, web-based randomization was not possible due to limited availability of continuous Internet connection in some centers and telephone interactive voice response services could not be afforded because too expensive. Second, assessment of medication adherence will be based on both self-report of patients and on manual pill count by the Investigator. This methodology might be imprecise. However, adherence is not the primary study endpoint, and though the use of electronic pill-box monitoring was taken into account at the time of study planning and designing, we opted out of this choice because the device was too expensive and its management too complex for the study purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>At the moment no studies have assessed the impact of HBPT and of the quantification of patient&#x02019;s psychological characteristics on improvement of blood pressure control and adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
