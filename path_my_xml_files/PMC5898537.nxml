Recent studies indicated that baseline serum TNF-&#x003b1; could be considered as a key indicator for optimal dosing of infliximab for RA treatment to achieve the clinical response and its sustained remission. The Remission induction by Raising the dose of Remicade in RA (RRRR) study is an open-label, parallel group, multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the proportions of clinical remission based on the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) after 1 year of treatment and its sustained remission rate after another 1 year between the investigational treatment strategy (for which the dose of infliximab was chosen based on the baseline serum TNF) and the standard strategy of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg per 8 weeks of infliximab administration in infliximab-na&#x000ef;ve patients with RA showing an inadequate response to MTX. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who kept discontinuation of infliximab 1 year after discontinued infliximab at the time of 54 weeks after the first administration of infliximab. The secondary endpoints are the proportion of clinical remission based on SDAI and changes in SDAI from baseline at each time point, other clinical parameters, quality of life measures and adverse events. Target sample size of randomized patients is 400 patients in total. The main results of the RRRR study are expected to be published at the end of 2017.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>Infliximab</kwd><kwd>TNF-&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>Sustained remission</kwd><kwd>Protocol paper</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive systemic inflammatory disease characterized by joint destruction and functional disability <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. RA occurs globally in about 1.0% of the general population, with 2&#x02013;4-times higher prevalence in women than in men <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although the etiology of RA is not quite clear, some inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) have been shown to play a central role in the occurrence and progression of RA <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Infliximab, an inhibitor of TNF-&#x003b1;, is one of the most widely used biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); combined use of infliximab and methotrexate (MTX) shows clinical and radiographic benefits compared with placebo in patients inadequately controlled with therapeutic doses of MTX <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

This trial indicated that early treatment of RA with infliximab induces a permanent response that persists, even after discontinuation of the drug. After publication of the TNF20 study, the Behandelstrategie&#x00451;n (BeSt) study evaluated biologic-free treatment in much larger cohort <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Sixty-four percent of patients with early RA were able to discontinue infliximab and in 56% patients treated with MTX monotherapy for 2 years, low disease activity was maintained and progression of joint damage was inhibited. In established RA patients exhibiting an inadequate response to MTX, the Remission induction by Remicade in RA patients (RRR) study also examined the possibility of biologic-free remission or low disease activity <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The patients enrolled in the study were those who had reached and maintained a disease activity score 28 (DAS28) of less than 3.2 for more than 24 weeks with infliximab treatment and who then agreed to discontinue the treatment. Among the 102 evaluable patients who completed the study, 56 (55%) maintained low disease activity after 1 year and showed no progression in radiological damage and functional disturbance; 44 (43%) remained in clinical remission (DAS28&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2.6).</p><p id="p0025">In this context, subanalysis of the dose-escalation study of infliximab with MTX (RISING study) showed a significant interaction between baseline TNF-&#x003b1; and the dose of infliximab in the clinical response. Additionally, the clinical response and disease activity were significantly better when the treatment was applied at 10&#x000a0;mg/kg than at 3 and 6&#x000a0;mg/kg, with a high baseline TNF-&#x003b1; (baseline TNF-&#x003b1; values: 1.65&#x000a0;pg/mL or greater) <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

Although several previous studies have provided the evidence of the possibility of sustained &#x0201c;biologic-free remission&#x0201d; with no functional or radiographic progression in patients with early RA after treatment with combination of TNF inhibitors and MTX <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the efficacy results are less convincing for established patients with RA who have inadequate responses to MTX. Smolen et al. evaluated whether low disease activity would be sustained with reduced doses or withdrawal of Etanercept in patients with moderately active RA (PRESERVE Study) <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In their study, conventional or reduced doses of Etanercept with MTX in patients with established RA more effectively maintained low disease activity than did MTX alone after withdrawal of Etanercept. In contrast, Tanaka et al. investigated the possibility of discontinuing adalimumab for 1 year without flaring (DAS28-ESR&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;3.2), and they found that the proportions of patients who sustained a DAS28-ESR score of less than 2.6 or less than 3.2 for 1 year were not significantly different between the ADA discontinuation group and the ADA continuation group if patients acquired deep remission (DAS28-ESR&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;1.98) <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The latest American College of Rheumatology Guideline does not recommend to discontinue all RA therapies for patients with established RA <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> even if the patient's disease is in remission.</p><p id="p0130">The RRRR study is the first randomized trial to compare the efficacy of the treatment strategy between the investigational treatment in which the dose of infliximab was decided based on the baseline serum TNF, and the standard dose (3&#x000a0;mg/kg) of infliximab in established patients with RA exhibiting an inadequate response to MTX. After the results of the trial are published, we may be able to answer several clinical questions as follows. First question was if it is really possible for established patients with RA to discontinue infliximab with sustained clinical remission after the achievement of a SDAI of less than or equal to 3.3&#x000a0;at 54 weeks. Second question was whether the baseline serum TNF-&#x003b1; is a biomarker of therapeutic response to optimize choice of treatment strategy. The final question was, what the baseline predictive factor was for clinical remission and whether we could identify baseline and other biomarkers (including serum infliximab concentration at the time of 54 weeks) for sustained remission. Considering the potential safety issues and the economic burden caused by the use of biologic DMARDs, all of the above clinical questions are important when we consider the possibility of discontinuation of biologic DMARDs after achieving remission. The main results of the RRRR study are expected to be published at the end of 2017.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0135">Y.
