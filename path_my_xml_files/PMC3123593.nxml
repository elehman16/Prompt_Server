The prevalence of diabetes in adults worldwide was estimated to rise 366 million in the year 2030 from 171 million in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Malaysians above 30 years old was reported to be between 11% and 14% in 2006, and it is estimated to rise further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. T2DM accounts for a huge burden of morbidity and mortality through micro and macrovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This has lead to an increasing demand on dietary and lifestyle modifications to delay the disease progression.</p><p>Web-based interventions have been successfully implemented in improving self-management of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in adults with T2DM. A web-based nutrition education for diabetes prevention study among young adults has shown significant reduction in dietary fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To date there is no published study focused solely on dietary behaviour change in adults with T2DM via a website-based system. Nevertheless, dietary modification has been incorporated as a component of multifactorial behavioural interventions in diabetes prevention and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The success of a web-based intervention relies heavily on the website log-in rates, usability, and personalisation. Content development in simplified local language improves the usability of the website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], while regular reinforcement using reminder services such as e-mails and SMS increases the log-in rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The use of behavioural theories could assist the personalisation of web-based interventions. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] is one of such behavioural model that has been recently used in web-based interventions, especially those focusing on improving dietary and lifestyle behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a web-based dietary intervention for patients with T2DM in Malaysia is presented here. We hypothesised that the e-intervention group will show a greater improvement in dietary KAB than the control group. Secondly, we hypothesised that the web-based intervention to results in a better dietary practices, anthropometric measurements and blood biomarkers in the e-intervention group than the controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a two-armed matched-design randomized controlled trial (RCT) scheduled for 12 months (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Twelve dietary modules in the intervention package is personalised according to the patients' Stages of Change (SOC), and is expected to improve their dietary KAB and assist them to progress in their respective SOC. The improvements in KAB and progress in SOC are expected to be reflected in the patients' dietary practices. Adoption of healthy dietary practices then is expected to be reflected on the anthropometric measurements and biomarkers.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Conceptual framework</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-11-359-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study aims</title><p>The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of a six month dietary e-intervention on dietary knowledge, attitude and behaviour (KAB) in patients with T2DM.</p><p>The secondary aim is to determine the impact of the intervention on dietary practices (nutrient intake, dietary GI, food frequency score, supplements intake, cooking method and eating out habit), physical measurements (height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage and blood pressure) and blood biomarkers (fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid profile).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study has received ethics approval from Malaysian Ethics Research (NMRR-09-303-3416) and Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (CF09/1583 - 2009000877).</p></sec><sec><title>Study sample</title><sec><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on a difference in fat and fibre-related behaviour score as reported by a previous computer assisted dietary intervention study in type 2 diabetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using a reduction in the mean behaviour score from 1.93 &#x000b1; 0.5 (baseline) to 1.69 &#x000b1; 0.4 (post intervention), the GPower software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] calculated that 31 patients are needed in each group to detect this difference with a two-sided alpha of 0.05, a power of 80%.

We are employing existing guidelines in the development of the intervention package that will be modified to suit local context. TTM's SOC construct will be incorporated in the development of the study website, <italic>my</italic>DIDeA. We are aiming for a net improvement in the KAB score in participants of the e-intervention group, besides investigating the impact of the e-intervention on the dietary practices, physical measurements and blood biomarkers of those patients.</p><p>We hope to capture the 'teachable moment' to promote dietary behaviour change in diabetics with uncontrolled HbA1c (&#x02265;7.0%) and lower level of diabetes-specific dietary KAB (&#x02264;50% of total score). We are anticipating an increase in dietary KAB at the end of the trial, which may contribute to a better blood glucose control and ultimately prevent complication due to diabetes.</p><p>Besides offering a theory and evidence based education program, this trial will be utilising bilingual educational materials that have been modified to suit the local content. Culturally sensitive dietary intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and web content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] leave greater impact, giving this trial an edge in helping the patients to improve their dietary KAB and achieve better glycaemic control.</p><p>This trial is capable of generating a personalised dietary intervention program for a large group of patients. At the same time, the intervention program could be accessed 24 hours using any device connected to the Internet. This will empower the patients to have total control of the intervention materials.</p><p>We will be conducting this RCT in urban hospitals, which means the respondents may be of a higher socio-economic background than average Malaysians. This may not be representative of the entire population as uptake of internet is different in the urban as compared to the rural. However, we are expecting for a better response to a web-based program in the urban area and it will be interesting to investigate responses from those with higher socio-economic status to an interactive website. This trial can be a model that is first implemented at the urban area for us to evaluate its success. If successful, it can be a precursor for policy makers to initiate more rigorous promotion of such web-based programs to other parts of the country.</p><p>Like all web-based interventions, this trial's reach also depends on the participants' responsiveness. Besides personalisation according to SOC, culture and language, the success of this intervention relies on the log-in rates and usability of <italic>my</italic>DIDeA. In order to maximise the participation of the trial patients, we will be regularly reinforcing them to log-in via e-mail and SMS.</p><p>Although qualitative assessments such as in-depth interview or focus group discussion were not part of this RCT, the outcome evaluation is supplemented by a detailed process evaluation. The process evaluation is measuring program reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity and implementation as well as the participants'' satisfaction with the program and acceptability. Collectively, these measures will enable us to draw conclusions about potential program enhancers and barriers if the program were to be delivered in other settings and contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AR developed the study framework and will be involved in data collection and in the development and implementation of the intervention.
