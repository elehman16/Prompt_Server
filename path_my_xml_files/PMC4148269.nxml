perception on their position in life in the context of the culture and value system
in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and
concerns."<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Dermatologists
frequently use intuitive aspects to evaluate the extent to which skin diseases
affect their patients and to make decisions regarding the management of these
diseases; however, patients may evaluate their QL differently from their physicians,
which may lead to difficulties for patients to adhere to and follow treatment
recommendations.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The
evaluation of patient's symptom-related QL is useful in treatment decision-making
and allows patients to become more instructed and involved in their own
care.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Itching causes great suffering; thus, its impact on patient's QL may be
profound.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It is crucially
important to quantify the QL of patients with notalgia paresthetica (NP), because
they complain of great discomfort caused by intense itching, sometimes accompanied
by pain. This disease decreases patients' physical and professional performance,
which impairs their social interactions and has a negative impact on patients'
perception on their own health, including mental health.</p><p>NP, which is named after the terms <italic>notos</italic> (back),
<italic>algos</italic> (pain), and <italic>parestesias</italic>, is a sensory
neuropathy defined for the first time in 1934 and affects dorsal spinal nerves, more
specifically the upper branches of T2-T6 nerves.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> NP etiology has not been completely elucidated yet, but it
is especially attributed to nerve impingement syndrome affecting the dorsal branch
of spinal nerves.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A study that
found the presence of at least one spinal disorder associated with NP in nine out of
12 patients confirmed that spinal nerve compression results from degenerative
changes in the spine and that this contributes to NP pathogenesis.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Another study evaluating 10 NP
patients observed that seven of them presented with associated degenerative changes
in the vertebrae.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> An
investigative study involving 65 NP patients conducted in Brazil and Germany in 2012
by Huesmann<italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> found that 32.3% of patients showed radiological tests
revealing spinal stenosis and 47.7% revealing spinal degeneration. Other causes of
nerve involvement include trauma and accidents.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, other hypothesis to explain the etiology of this
disease postulates that it would be a sensory neuropathy resulting from the
compression of upper branches of peripheral thoracic nerves by muscle fibers. Since
these branches run in a straight angle through the muscles, it is suggested that
this makes nerves more vulnerable to impingement, which causes itching.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>With regard to the genesis of itching, microneurography studies have demonstrated
that there is a small subset of C nerve fibers that are sensitive to histamine and
responsible for transmitting pruritus and not pain. It has been shown that these C
nerve fibers have spontaneous activity in patients with chronic itching.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Thus, itching may be understood as an irritation of
sensitive skin nerve endings due to the biochemical action of substances spread on
skin, including histamine released, for example, by substance P.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although the occurrence of itching is not rare, studies conducted so far provide
little knowledge on clinical and laboratory findings. An important clinical finding
characterizing NP is a hyperpigmented wellcircumscribed stain. Additionally, its
more common symptom is itching on the mid-upper portion of the back in the
distribution of T2-T6 dermatome that may be associated with other sensory damages
such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia and pain.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Savk <italic>et
al</italic> studied 10 NP patients, seven women and three men,<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> who were asked about dermatological
and neurological symptoms and family history for the disease. Afterwards, the
affected area was subjected to biopsy and electromyography. None of the cases
analyzed in the study presented with peripheral neuropathies, e.g., diabetes, nor
had a positive history of NP. Hyperpigmentation in the dorsal area was observed in
all patients. Pruritus was the common symptom in all cases. Moreover, only two
patients complained of episodes of pain and only one patient described a feeling of
burning on the affected site. These initial findings are suggestive of a neurogenic
disorder.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>There are cases of NP treated with capsaicin or topical corticosteroids, botulinum
toxin, and systemic gabapentin and oxcarbamazepine for pain relief.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Topical
corticosteroids are usually inefficient unless a secondary inflammation is present.
They act by stabilizing membranes and contribute to the suppression of ectopic
neural pacemaker activity.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
Botulinum toxin type A may be efficient in several pain syndromes, including
postherpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia, and even in cases of itching.
However, further research is needed to confirm its efficacy in the treatment of
NP.<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Due to its presumably neural origin, many treatments for NP consist of acting on the
lesion or involvement in the spinal dorsal nerve.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Antipruritic agents may be divided into
antihistaminic, antiserotonergic, antiopioid, non-hormonal anti-inflammatory,
phototherapy, and brain antiarrhythmic or anticonvulsant.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Among these, brain antiarrhythmic or
anticonvulsant drugs are indicated when itching has a neuropathic origin, i.e., the
neural lesion unstabilizes the activity of electrical conduction at peripheral and
central levels, as occurs in NP.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>
Currently, the systemic drugs most used and that showed better results are those
that act in the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), such as gabapentin and
pregabalin.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Thus, the
treatment with anticonvulsants seems to be the most promising approach for
neuropathic pruritus caused by NP.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Gabapentin (1-aminomethyl)cyclohexyl]acetic acid) has the structure of the GABA
neurotransmitter but does not interact significantly with this neurotransmitter or
with any other neurotransmitter.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Its basic role on the chain of
pain generation would be grounded on its action on calcium channels by inhibiting
ion entry, reducing glutamate levels, and acting also on the control of allodynic
phenomena.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The
lipophilic characteristics of gabapentin allow for this substance to pass through
the blood-brain barrier.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It has
anti-hyperalgesic action that reduces hyperexcitability of neurons of the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord, which is the responsible for central sensitization, and has
proven to be clinically useful in the control of ectopic discharges from injured
peripheral nerve sites.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In addition, it shows good results
in postherpetic neuralgia and in some cases of neuropathic syndromes.</p><p>Tolerance to gabapentin is usually good, with no reports of significant hematologic,
hepatic and dermatologic complications.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Its adverse effects are directly related to the dose used,
the most common being sleepiness (20% of patients), ataxia (17%), nystagmus (15%),
and asthenia.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Magalh&#x000e3;es <italic>et al</italic> reported a case of NP that showed no improvement
after being initially treated with hydrocortisone/pramoxin ointment 2.5%. Topical
treatment with capsaicin was refused by the patient. Thus, the treatment of choice
was gabapentin at a dose of 300 mg every night. Pruritus improved as early as one
month after treatment.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Topical capsaicin is another currently used treatment choice. This substance is a
compound coming from chilli extract and acts by running out neuropeptides of C
polymodal fibers that transmit itching from skin to the central nervous
system.<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Capsaicin may be useful, but symptoms tend to
reappear after treatment discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Adverse effects of capsaicin, whose intensity depends on
its concentration in drug formulation, result mainly from its local mode of
administration and involve burning and erythema. These reactions may compromise
treatment adherence; therefore, it is estimated that one out of 10 patients tend to
drop out of therapy due to the presence of local symptoms.<sup><xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Thus, many patients prefer other forms of
treatment.</p><p>Although the occurrence of NP is not rare, studies conducted so far provide little
knowledge on clinical and laboratory findings. The main objective of this study was
to investigate the efficacy of the treatment of NP using gabapetin by evaluating the
degree of improvement in pruritus and the influence of gabapetin on the QL of NP
patients compared to topical capsaicin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>An experimental, non-randomized, parallel, non-blinded study was conducted with 20
patients aged from 20 to 60 years old and with clinical and histopathological
diagnosis of NP treated at the dermatology outpatient clinic of Faculdade de
Medicina de Jundia&#x000ed;, located in Jundia&#x000ed;, Brazil, from August 2011 to May 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). Patients presenting with renal
dysfunction or contraindications to the use of gabapentin were excluded from the
study. Considering a confidence interval of 95%, a maximum error of estimate for
visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of 1.5, and a standard deviation of 3.4, sample
size was calculated to be 20 individuals.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Notalgia paresthetica: brownish hyperpigmented grouped macules measuring 0.1

research and about the confidentiality of personal information. After the
participants signed a written consent form, the VAS of pain adapted for pruritus was
administered to evaluate the intensity of itching. The VAS is composed of a 10-cm
line divided into a scale from 0 to 10, and patients should indicate the score that
best represents the intensity of their itching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Visual analogue scale administered in this study to measure itching
intensity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abd-89-04-0570-g02"/></fig><p>Participants also answered the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). DLQI is an
instrument validated for use in Brazil and consists of a 10-item questionnaire
divided into six domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure,
work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Answers yielded scores from zero
to three for each domain, and overall score is calculated as a simple sum of domain
scores, with higher scores indicating worse healthrelated QL.</p><p>For didactic purposes, patients were divided into two groups, A and B. Patients
included in group A should have a VAS score of at least five. The investigators
decided to establish this inclusion criterion in order to prevent patients with mild
complaints from receiving treatment with gabapentin, which has a higher risk of
systemic side effects. Group A comprised 10 patients who underwent treatment with
gabapentin at a dose of 300 mg/day for four weeks.</p><p>Group B also comprised 10 individuals, but they underwent the standard topical
treatment with daily doses of capsaicin 0.025% for four weeks.</p><p>After four weeks of treatment, patients answered again the VAS for calculating the
degree of itching intensity and assessing their treatment response.</p><p>Data were subjected to statistical analysis and evaluation of clinical significance.
Data for the variable "difference in VAS for the evaluation of pruritus ( VAS)"
before and after the use of medication were tested for normality in each group using
the Shapiro-Wilk method. Treatment effect was assessed by the paired Wilcoxon test.
In spite of selection bias for the groups and lack of randomization, percentage
variation between the groups was compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The result of
this comparison should be carefully analyzed, because there was a great difference
in mean initial VAS scores</p><p>Analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SSPS)
software (SPPS Inc., Chicago, USA), version 13.0. Significance level for statistical
tests was set at 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 20 patients analyzed in this study, 12 had already received previous and short
treatment with capsaicin soon after disease diagnosis, but nine of them interrupted
the treatment at the beginning due to intense burning.</p><p>A significant improvement in itching was observed in patients from group A, which was
demonstrated by the decrease in mean VAS scores for itching. Before the treatment
with gabapentin, mean VAS score was 9.5, and after treatment it decreased to 5.0,

The side effects of this drug were well tolerated.</p><p>Of the 10 patients from group B, who were given topical capsaicin, six patients
maintained the same score for itching before and after treatment, and only three
patients reported improvement. Additionally, all patients who used capsaicin
reported intense burning, which may hinder treatment adherence very much.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of NP are characterized by clinical hyperpigmented stains
associated with itching and paresthesia.<sup><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Manifestations of NP range from invisible skin lesions to
hyperpigmented circumscribed macule, as found in most patients.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the present study, 100% of
patients presented with hyperpigmented macule on their back. The main symptom of NP
is itching on the back, occasionally accompanied by pain, paresthesia, and
hyperesthesia, resulting in skin hyperpigmentation on the affected area.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In the patients analyzed, in addition to itching and hyperchromic macule on the back,
paresthesia was reported in 60% of cases and back pain in a 70%. This study found
that the main factor of worsening of itching is heat, which was reported by 65% of
patients. Many of them reported worsening of itching during summer and on days with
high temperatures, and associate presence of sweat with disease worsening. One of
the possible explanations for this finding is that itching and temperature are
conducted by the same nervous fibers; therefore, an increase in temperature worsens
itching, similar to what occurs in itching caused by atopic dermatitis.</p><p>It bears stressing that, although a statistical significance was observed in the
evaluation of the effect of the treatment with gabapentin, this study has a patient
selection bias, since groups were not randomly divided. Additionally, the Hawthorne
effect cannot be ruled out, because there is an influence on patient's symptoms
simply because they are being observed. Another study limitation was the
impossibility of performing a blinded investigation, because the treatments we
compared consisted of different forms of administration.</p><p>The statistical and methodological design of the present study had several
difficulties, due to reasons common for several clinical trials. There was great
difficulty in randomizing the groups, since there was a great variation in the
measurement of symptoms between patients and even for the same patient at different
periods of time. Furthermore, we used VAS scores in an attempt of turning a
subjective symptom into numerical information to facilitate the analysis of
treatment response.</p><p>There are no studies on the use of gabapentin for the control of itching in NP,
treatment that was considered by the authors as belonging to category D. Thus, we
decided to prevent patients with low QL impairment and not very intense symptoms to
receive a controlled drug that has several adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study, the use of oral gabapentin 300 mg a day for the treatment of
itching caused by NP showed to be efficient and led to a significant improvement in
rates of itching intensity as assessed by the VAS. Capsaicin, a widely used drug in
these cases, is effective but did not show statistically significant difference
between pre- and post-treatment. Additionally, all patients reported burning
throughout the entire topical treatment with capsaicin, which hindered treatment
adherence. The only side effect produced by gabapentin was a mild gastric discomfort
that did not interfere with treatment.</p><p>The most common associated symptoms, in addition to itching and macula on the back,
were paresthesia and back pain; therefore, these symptoms should also be
investigated in all patients with suspected NP. Guidance on using light clothes and
staying at environments that help body temperature to remain low may be useful,
since more than a half of patients report that itching worsens with heat.</p><p>This is a pioneering study on the treatment of NP that provides data to be used in
clinical trials, with better investigation methodology and comparison with a placebo
group. Although large samples of patients diagnosed with NP are difficult to obtain,
studies with a greater number of patients will confirm hypotheses and help in the
treatment of this still little understood disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflict of interests: none.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial support: PIBIC/CNPq.</p></fn><fn id="fn01" fn-type="other"><label>*</label><p> Work conducted at Faculdade de Medicina de Jundia&#x000ed; (FMJ) - Jundia&#x000ed; (SP),
