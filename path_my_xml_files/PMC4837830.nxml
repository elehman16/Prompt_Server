Surface electrocardiogram (ECG) showed that idiopathic VA had a characteristic left/right bundle branch block morphology with a dominant R wave in the inferior leads. For patients with polymorphism of PVCs, only patients with the most PVCs from OT were included in this study. Patients with structural heart diseases, no spontaneous or inducible VA during electrophysiological study (EPS) were excluded. Structure heart disease was defined as the presence of coronary artery disease, a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &#x0003c; 40%, moderate or severe valvular heart disease[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or cardiomyopathy. The remaining consecutive patients were divided into a sensitive group (S group) or an insensitive group (I group) according to the adenosine test. The patients of each group were randomized into a nonirrigated catheter (NA) subgroup or an irrigated catheter (IA) subgroup with a 2:1 ratio of enrollment through a randomly generated number table.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study procedure</title><p>All patients completed baseline questionnaires for eligibility screening and baseline characteristics were gathered. Routine 12-lead surface ECG and ambulatory ECG monitoring for 24 hours were obtained to determine the arrhythmia burden. Physical examinations, transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography were performed at baseline and again at 3 months post ablation. EPS and the adenosine test were performed first followed by mapping and ablation. Patients were sent questionnaires to update their medical and lifestyle information at 3 months post ablation. The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Board of the Hospital, and all patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Electrophysiological study</title><p>Electrophysiological study was performed after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half-lives prior to the study. Catheters were inserted through the right femoral vein into the high right atrium and right ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance. LV mapping was performed through the retrograde aortic approach. An initial 3000-unit bolus of heparin was administered intravenously, followed by 1000 units/h throughout the procedure.</p><p>Programmed stimulation was performed at twice the diastolic threshold with a pulse width of 2 ms using a programmable stimulator (MicroPace EPS320 Cardiac Stimulator, USA). If VA did not occur spontaneously and were not induced during the baseline state, intravenous isoproterenol infusion (2&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/min) was administered to provoke clinical arrhythmia[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and programmed stimulation was repeated. Ventricular programmed stimulation was performed with up to three extra stimuli at two basic drive cycle lengths (500 and 400 ms) and incremental burst pacing at a cycle length up to 250 ms, starting at RV apex, then at the RVOT at baseline and repeated after infusion of isoproterenol.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Adenosine test</title><p>During EPS, adenosine was administered as a bolus (18 mg)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] via a peripheral vein during frequent PVCs or short-burst VT. Adenosine action was defined as suppression or termination of VA, sinus node suppression, or atrial-ventricular block occurring within 60 s of adenosine administration. The starting-point of adenosine action was defined as the time at P-R or R-R interval prolongation by 30% or more above baseline level and the end-point was defined as the time when the P-R or R-R interval decreased by 30% or more of baseline level. Adenosine action interval was calculated as the difference between the starting-point time and the end-point time. The time interval between adenosine infusion and the starting-point of adenosine action was defined as the adenosine onset time. The response of the arrhythmia to adenosine was defined as follows: Adenosine sensitive when VT, which had persisted for at least 1 min before adenosine injection was terminated within 30 s of administration of adenosine[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or there were no PVCs or short-burst VTs of same morphology as spontaneous VA during the adenosine action interval [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]; adenosine insensitive when VT was not terminated or PVCs were not abolished during the adenosine action interval [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A representative case of adenosine sensitive response of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

For patients in NA subgroup, ablation was performed with a 4-mm-tip nonirrigated catheter (Biosense Webster). If this procedure was ineffective after 5 energy applications, a 3.5-mm-tip irrigated catheter (Thermocool, Biosense Webster) was used for ablation. For patients in IA subgroup, ablation was made only using an irrigated tip catheter. A three-dimensional activation map (3D map) was reconstructed with a 3D mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster) in all patients. A suitable target site for ablation was selected based on the earliest endocardial activation time (preceding the QRS by at least 20 ms) during arrhythmia and ideal pace mapping. The ideal pace mapping is an identical QRS pattern in at least 10 surface ECG leads (&#x02265;10/12 match) with a pace map score &#x02265;90% between the clinical arrhythmia and the paced QRS morphology. Unmodulated radiofrequency current was delivered in a unipolar fashion from a generator (Stockert Epshuttle&#x02122;, Germany). RFCA applications were delivered at a power of 30&#x02013;35 W with a temperature limit of 65&#x000b0; for patients in NA subgroup. If VA disappeared within 30 seconds, energy was delivered continuously for 180 seconds. If radiofrequency current application failed to terminate the tachycardia or PVCs within 30 seconds, the catheter was moved to a different site. Five periods of RF application were applied to eliminate VT or PVCs. In NA subgroup, if ablation was unsuccessful after five periods of energy delivery, it was ineffective and repeated with the irrigated catheter. RFCA applications in IA subgroup were delivered at a power of 30 W with temperature limit of 43&#x000b0;, and the same procedure sequences (five applications) were performed as in the NA subgroup.</p><p>The ablation endpoint was defined as complete elimination of spontaneous VA for at least 30 minutes after the last application of energy, and VT or PVCs did not occur or could not be induced by ventricular stimulation or isoproterenol infusion. If VA appeared or was still inducible, the catheter was moved to another site, and the mapping was repeated. If the ablation endpoint was achieved, we considered it an effective ablation, and the ablation site was defined as the effective site.</p><p>Coronary artery angiography was performed prior to RFCA at the CVS or aortic sinus to confirm the distance from the ablation catheter tip to the coronary artery. Furthermore, a safe separation (above 0.5 cm) between the ablation target and the orifice of the coronary artery was maintained.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Follow-up</title><p>After RFCA, all patients received ECG monitoring for 24 h. Ambulatory ECGs were made within 1 week after the procedure. Subsequently, the patients received examinations on an outpatient basis, and clinical data were obtained. Holter recording (24 hours) was performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter. Ablation was defined as successful with &#x02265; 80% reduction of PVC burden,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or &#x02264;1500 PVCs or no VT episodes during the follow-up period. Otherwise, the case was defined as recurrence. All antiarrhythmic drugs were withheld after the ablation procedure. Repeat ablation was performed after 3 months from the time of the procedure for recurrent VA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD for continuous variables, median and 10%&#x02013;90% confidence interval (CI) for ordinal variables and percentage for categorical data.

Interestingly, a lower recurrent rate was observed in the adenosine sensitive patients compared with the adenosine insensitive patients after nonirrigated catheter ablation.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Mechanism of ventricular arrhythmia sensitivity to adenosine</title><p>In addition to reentry and automaticity mechanisms, cAMP-mediated triggered activity has been reported as a third mechanism responsible for VA.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, adenosine could terminate VA by means of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor activation of the inhibitory G-protein G-&#x003b1;I. This would then inhibit cAMP generation by adenyl cyclase and block the triggered release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum even in the presence of normal calcium storage.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Thus, termination of VA by adenosine suggests cAMP-triggered activity. In the case of adenosine sensitive RVOT VT,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] focal ablation at the earliest ventricular activation site resulted in long-term abolition of VT in the endocardium.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Diker found that the origin of adenosine sensitive left VT was located near to the anterior fascicle, that is, the focus was from the endocardium and suitable for nonirrigated catheter ablation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The fact that adenosine is unable to terminate VA might be explained by the lack of any direct effect of adenosine on the ventricular myocardium.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Most cases of adenosine insensitive OT-VA may be caused by reentry and automaticity mechanisms. The origin sites of these OT-VAs were usually located on the septum of RVOT and might not be suitable for nonirrigated catheter ablation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a prior study, reentry VT originating from LVOT that could not be terminated by adenosine was successfully ablated from the aortic sinus.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Various sites including the aortic sinus, the great cardiac vein, and the anterior interventricular vein that could generate ectopic impulses have been identified.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In these cases, intramyocardial or epicardial ablations with an irrigated catheter for adenosine-insensitive OT-VA are usually indicated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Lesion depth of ablation</title><p>During RFCA, the local temperature increase is proportional to the energy applied per second and to the heat transduction capacity of the local medium.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Ablation with nonirrigated catheters might result in unpredictable power delivery because of variations in endocardial contact and local blood flow. Since irrigated catheters are equipped with active cooling of the tip electrode by saline, larger and deeper ablation lesions could be produced compared with a nonirrigated catheter.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Since the origin depth or the critical isthmus of VA may be located intramyocardially or epicardially,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] ablation using the irrigated catheter or epicardial approach is recommended.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In line with above-mentioned suggestions, we postulated that adenosine sensitive VA is more likely originated from endocardium and therefore amenable to nonirrigated catheter ablation.
