passive movement and repetitive active movement on proprioception in forearm supination.
[Subjects] This study had a cross-sectional design. Twenty-three right-handed healthy
subjects were recruited. All subjects randomly received both repetitive passive movement
and repetitive active movement (repetitive passive/active movement at 120&#x000b0;/s with 60
repetitions over a 0&#x02013;80&#x000b0; range). Active and passive joint repositioning of all subjects
was measured using the error score for position sense, both before and after repositioning
intervention. [Results] In the repetitive passive movement test, there was a statistically
significant decrease in the pre- versus post-repositioning error scores in the active and
passive angle examinations. In the repetitive active movement test, there was a
statistically significant increase in pre- versus post-repositioning error scores in the
active and passive angle examinations. In the comparison of position sense, there was a
statistically significant decrease in both active and passive angle repositioning error
scores in repetitive passive movement versus repetitive active movement. [Conclusion]
Repetitive passive movement improved the proprioception results for forearm supination,
compared to repetitive active movement. Results of this study indicate that repetitive
passive movement can be recommended to clinicians for rehabilitation therapy as it
provides greater proprioception benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Joint position sense</kwd><kwd>Repetitive passive movement</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The primary outputs of muscle function at the elbow and forearm include elbow flexion and
extension, and forearm supination and pronation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rotation of the forearm, as in pronation and supination, are
important motions used in everyday life in performing tasks such as turning keys or door
handles, bringing food to the mouth and performing personal hygiene activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The forearm muscles involved in rotation
include the supinator, biceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, brachioradialis, extensor
pollicis longus and abductor pollicis longus. In particular, the actions of the supinator
and biceps brachii muscles produce the supination motion<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The action of these muscles greatly affects the stability of the
elbow<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining the safety of the
joints requires that they return to their proper position after movements, and that they
maintain their integrity with minimal movement. The process of proprioception has a
fundamental effect on the stability of the joints and in balance control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioception enables safe human movements in daily activities and sports. The
proprioception process involves muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, articular and
cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and enables position sense, movement sense and force sense<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a position-matching task, position sense
measures the target angle of the joint that is tested.</p><p>The output of proprioception therapy can be affected by therapeutic exercise type. The
exercises used in proprioception therapy are divided into active and passive components<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most clinical studies have found that
exercise affects proprioception ability.</p><p>Baek et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that repeated
passive exercise was beneficial for improving proprioception. Ju et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that repeated passive exercise resulted in a
significant improvement of joint position sense. However, Lattanzio and Petrella<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that repetitive passive
movements deleteriously affect of proprioception capabilities.</p><p>Hazneci et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
isokinetic exercises positively affected passive position sense, the stabilization of joints
and proprioceptive acuity. Active exercises such as <italic>tai chi</italic> have been found
to decrease position errors in subjects completing a position matching task<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Ju et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> found that repetitive active exercise had a negative impact on joint
proprioception. Other experimental studies have shown that active exercises negatively
affect proprioception because exercise fatigue can disturb position sense<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have been performed on elbow and forearm proprioception, but most of these
were conducted in order to evaluate flexion and extension<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although forearm supination is very important for the proper
functioning of the upper limbs, there have been few scientific studies on this topic, and
studies of proprioception are rare. Therefore, this study was conducted in order to
investigate the effect of repetitive passive movement (RPM) and repetitive active movement
(RAM) on the proprioception capabilities involved in forearm supination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total (N=23)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.52 &#x000b1; 4.27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.15 &#x000b1; 9.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.72 &#x000b1; 6.80</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>A total of 23 healthy right-hand dominant volunteers participated in this study (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The inclusion criteria for the subjects
were as follows: no upper extremity diseases, no sensory deficits, no limited range of
motion (ROM) of the upper extremities, no psychological or emotion problems. The study
protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>For the repositioning test of supination position sense in the right forearm, we used a
Biodex (Biodex Multi-Joint System 2, Biodex Corp, NY, USA) which includes an
electrogoniometer which is sensitive to 1&#x000b0; increments. All assessments were performed with
the subjects blindfold and seated on a chair. The subjects&#x02019; trunks were strapped to the
chair to prevent unwanted motion. Proprioception was measured in terms of passive and active
repositioning. The starting position of measurement was the elbow flexed at 90&#x000b0;, midway
between pronation and supination. In this starting position, the Biodex device display unit
was set to 0&#x000b0;.</p><p>Position sense is generally evaluated using repositioning tests such as active or passive
angle reproduction<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study
conducted both the measurement of passive angle repositioning (PAR) and active angle
repositioning (AAR). In PAR, the subjects&#x02019; forearms were passively moved to the target angle
by the machine, whereas in AAR, the subjects actively moved their forearms to the target
angle. PAR and AAR assessments were executed using the method described by Ju et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> For PAR, the forearm was rotated by the
machine with the subject&#x02019;s forearm in a starting position between 0&#x000b0; and 80&#x000b0; relative to the
target supination angle by random selection. The rotation occurred at a velocity of 2&#x000b0;/s.
The forearm was held at the target angle for 5 seconds, and then passively returned to the
starting position with a rest period of 10 seconds. The subject then actively reproduced the
selected target supination angle which had been passively positioned by the device. The
subject pressed a handheld stop button when they felt they had reproduced the correct target
supination angle. The set of repositioning tests was performed three times and the subject
rested for 20 seconds between each test. In order to avoid any learning effect during the
measurements, we chose different angle settings for each test.</p><p>For AAR, the subjects actively moved their forearms to the target supination angle,
approximately 0~80&#x000b0;, by random selection. All other procedures used were identical to the
passive measurement method. The difference between the reproduced angle and the target angle
was calculated. The position sense error was evaluated using the absolute error score. All
subjects were measured at pre-test prior to intervention, and at post-test after the
intervention. All measurements were repeated three times, with a one-minute break between
measurements.</p><p>All subjects randomly performed both RPM and RAM exercises for two days. At random, one of
the interventions was assigned on the first day with the remaining intervention performed on
the second day in order to avoid a learning effect.</p><p>The RPM exercise was performed with the Biodex using the system&#x02019;s passive exercise module.
The device was set to move in a passive supination-pronation mode within a 0&#x000b0; to 80&#x000b0; range
with a repetition of 60 times. The angular velocity of the passive exercise module was
120&#x000b0;/s. The RAM exercise was carried out using the Biodex system&#x02019;s isokinetic exercise
module with an angular velocity of 120&#x000b0;/s. The subjects were instructed to perform the
supination (concentric) and pronation (eccentric) exercises within a range of 0&#x000b0; to 80&#x000b0; for
60 repetitions. Each exercise was performed in three sets, with a one-minute break after
each set.</p><p>Data was analyzed using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows. The results are presented as the
mean and standard deviation. The data collected in this study was analyzed using parametric
statistical tests. The analysis used the paired t-test for differences in the position sense
error score before and after the intervention. Significance was accepted for values of
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Position sense error score at baseline and after the movement

through the sensory receptors in muscle spindles of the joints and muscles<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception enables neuromuscular control of dynamic restraints
and segmental movements, and delivers position information to the motor control system<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Motor control is an important aspect of rehabilitation<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Loss of proprioception capability leads to microtrauma, re-injury
of previously damaged joints, deficits in postural control and joint instability<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, various interventions for improving proprioception have
been performed. Fitzgerald<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that closed-chain exercise is more effective at facilitating proprioceptors than open-chain
exercise, and therapeutic exercises such as sensorimotor training<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, proprioceptive feedback training<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> and re-education exercise of proprioceptors<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> have been reported to be effective at
improving proprioceptor senses.</p><p>In this study, we studied passive and active movements. Kisner and Colby<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> explained that passive exercise promotes
awareness of movement. Friemert et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
evaluated the effects of a continuous active motion (CAM) device on joint proprioception,
and found a significant increase in joint position sense after the CAM exercise.</p><p>The goal of our study was to determine which exercise type, RPM or RAM, was more effective
for proprioception training.</p><p>In the present study, the accuracy of proprioception was measured using a Biodex, and there
was a significant difference in both active repositioning and passive repositioning found in
RPM, both before and after intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05). Changing the pattern of RPM resulted in
a decrease in the error score of position sense.</p><p>Friemert et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> found that, after RPM
exercise, the proprioception error was reduced. Ju et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> had 15 subjects perform RAM and RPM exercises, and the RAM
exercises resulted in an increase in proprioception error scores while RPM resulted in a
decrease. This result was the same as the one found in our study, indicating that RPM
exercises reduce proprioception errors.</p><p>Passive movements play a role in the activation of mechanical receptors and increase
activity in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, bilateral
inferior parietal cortex, secondary somatosensory areas and ipsilateral cerebellum of the
brain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. This activation of the brain enables the position of joints to be
determined by sensory inputs from the peripheral system, allows the planning of movements,
controls the motor response by comparing the sensory input signals and output signals, and
provides a significant input to the ability to sense joint position<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. For all of these reasons, we should expect that
repetitive passive movement would function to reduce error in the sensation of position.</p><p>In RAM, there was a significant difference observed in both the AAR and PAR, both before
and after the intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, the changing patterns of RAM and RPM were
different. RAM showed an increasing trend in the error score of position sense.</p><p>RAM exercise consisted of concentric and eccentric exercises in our study. Allen et
al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that forearm concentric
and eccentric exercises increased position matching errors and reduced the accuracy of the
sense of position<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brockett et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that eccentric exercise increases errors in the sense of
position. This result supports the finding of our study that RAM exercise increases error in
position sense.</p><p>The intensity of brain activation can be influenced by proprioceptive stimulation at the
joint<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Brain activation occurs in
active exercise as well as passive exercise<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Active exercise results in fatigue at the joint, whereas passive
exercise does not. Continuous high-intensity exercise causes muscle fatigue which increases
the error in the position sense by reducing the threshold sensitivity of fibers in the
muscle spindles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we should
expect that continuous active movement would increase errors in the position sense.</p><p>A limitation of the present study was that it is difficult to generalize research results
using young and healthy persons to the elderly and people whose forearms are injured or
impaired. This was not a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the number of study subjects
was small. Therefore, future studies should include more subjects or be conducted as a RCT
with participants of different ages and subjects whose forearms are injured or impaired.</p><p>We conducted this study in order to examine which of RAM or RPM exercise is more effective
for training forearm proprioception. The results of show that RAM exercise increased
proprioception errors and RPM reduced them. Thus, RPM exercise is more effective for forearm
proprioception training than RAM. Therefore, we recommend the use of RPM exercise in
clinical situations in order to improve proprioception ability related to the use of the
forearm and stability of joints.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Magee</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Zachazewski</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Quillen</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name></person-group>: Pathology and intervention in musculoskeletal rehabilitation.
