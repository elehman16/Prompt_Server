The training includes a module for emotion recognition and one for theory of mind. A comparison with a validated cognitive remediation intervention, the Social Skills And Neurocognitive Individualized Training (SSANIT), was conducted to verify the efficacy of the SoCIAL in improving SC. Ten stabilized patients with schizophrenia accepted to participate. Five patients were randomized to SoCIAL and five to SSANIT. The SoCIAL intervention includes individual sessions of neurocognitive individualized training (NIT) and group sessions of SC training. SSANIT includes individual sessions of NIT and group sessions of social skills individualized training. The interventions were matched for the overall treatment duration (20 weeks) and for the frequency of the sessions (two times a week, one for SoCIAL or social skills individualized training and one for NIT, with a duration of 80 minutes for each session). Results showed a significant treatment effect (effect size: Cohen&#x02019;s d 0.32) on the primary outcome; in fact, only the SoCIAL intervention improved theory of mind. Patients receiving the SoCIAL intervention also showed an improvement of avolition. These preliminary findings support further development of the SoCIAL and suggest that cognitive remediation should include an SC module.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cognitive remediation</kwd><kwd>psychiatric rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>negative symptoms</kwd><kwd>avolition</kwd><kwd>MATRICS consensus cognitive battery</kwd><kwd>MCCB</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Impairment in several domains of cognition has been reported in patients with schizophrenia.<xref rid="b1-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Cognitive dysfunctions are associated with poor functional outcome<xref rid="b6-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and quality of life<xref rid="b8-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in these patients.

Exclusion criteria were: 1) presence of diseases involving disability and 2) habitual use of alcohol or drugs in the last 6 months. Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, among those consecutively visited within 1 month (December 2013) at the outpatient unit for schizophrenia spectrum disorders of our University Department of Mental Health, were asked to participate in this pilot study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera of the University of Campania &#x0201c;Luigi Vanvitelli&#x0201d;. Ten patients agreed to participate in this study and signed written informed consent; five patients were randomized to SoCIAL (three females and two males) and five (three females and two males) to SSANIT. A patient from the latter group moved to another city before completing 1 month of treatment and was not included in the analyses. Details of the reasons for patients&#x02019; exclusion and number of completers are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-13-1947">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation of the training program</title><p>The study included the following phases: 1) implementation of ecological materials for SoCIAL (photographs and videos involving professional actors, sound engineers, scriptwriters and a director); 2) referrer training for both the intervention programs before recruitment of the subjects; 3) baseline assessment of psychopathology, neurocognitive functions, functional capacity, perceived quality of life and SC of patients enrolled in the study; 4) 20-week active intervention (SSANIT or SoCIAL integrated with NIT) and 5) posttreatment evaluation of psychopathology, neurocognitive functions, functional capacity, perceived quality of life, SC and patients&#x02019; level of satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Photo and video materials used in the SoCIAL</title><p>Ecological materials were developed with the involvement of professional actors, scriptwriters, sound engineers and a director. Psychiatrists and psychologists specialized in the field of psychiatric rehabilitation supervised the development of the training materials. The module &#x0201c;Emotion Recognition&#x0201d; comprises 10 videos in which a professional actor portrays one of five basic emotional states (happy, sad, fearful, disgusted and angry). In each vignette, the actor is engaged in an interaction with one or more participants using a script that is ambiguous and can therefore be interpreted in a number of ways.</p><p>The module &#x0201c;Theory of Mind&#x0201d; comprises 15 videoclips of social interactions. The videoclips show trained actors in dynamic displays of emotions, as well as in conversational interactions with others, requiring the integration of multiple changing cues (face expression, prosody, gesture and context) to identify the emotions, beliefs and intentions of target characters within the social context. The videos thus provide an ecologically valid measure of SC that assesses several domains of SC (ER and ToM) showing six different social interactions comprising sarcasm, disappointment, hostility, misunderstanding, deceit and sincere.</p><p>The materials have been designed, since the beginning, for a training program, in order to ensure a greater ecological validity. Moreover, the use of simple and everyday contexts such as family, friendship and work, in our opinion, brings the training closer to the real life of patients with schizophrenia, and we assume that this will increase the effectiveness of video stimuli for SoCIAL.</p></sec><sec><title>Training of the personnel and intervention fidelity assurance</title><p>Six social workers, two psychologists and four psychiatric rehabilitation technicians (PRTs) of the Department of Psychiatry of the Second University of Naples, were trained by an expert psychiatrist in rehabilitation programs of the same center (two PRTs for NIT, one psychologist and one PRT both for SoCIAL and the SSIT component of SSANIT). During the 3-month training, these personnel attended ten 2-hour sessions and became familiar with the theory and practice of NIT, SoCIAL and SSIT. After the training, the personnel had to be able to design the interventions, to supervise patients for the NIT program and to be trainer or co-trainer for the SoCIAL and SSIT groups. Intervention fidelity to NIT, SoCIAL and SSIT was assessed by means of supervisory meetings held once a month, in which the trainer supervised the activity of the trained personnel. For SoCIAL and SSIT groups, the supervision was carried out by addressing patients&#x02019; individual difficulties: this represented the starting point to discuss strategies used in coaching, providing corrective/positive feedback and assigning homework, as well as managing difficulties encountered during the sessions; similarly, for NIT, the supervision was carried out by evaluating the computer outputs relevant to progression on each module during the session, with subsequent discussion of strategies used in selecting the level of difficulty as well as in giving positive or corrective feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of clients&#x02019; satisfaction, psychopathology, neurocognitive functions, SC, functional capacity and real-life functioning</title><p>At the end of the SoCIAL training, we used the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8),<xref rid="b31-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> an eight-item version, to evaluate patient satisfaction. The sum of the responses to the CSQ-8 ranges from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Psychopathological evaluation was carried out by means of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).<xref rid="b47-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Ratings on PANSS items were summed to calculate two dimensions of schizophrenia symptomatology: positive symptoms and disorganization, according to the method proposed by Wallwork et al.<xref rid="b32-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Negative symptoms were assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale, composed of 13 items, rated from 0 (normal) to 6 (most impaired), and five negative symptom domains: anhedonia, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia. The Italian version of the scale was validated in the wider study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses activities.<xref rid="b33-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In line with previous research,<xref rid="b9-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> domains evaluated by the scale loaded on two factors: &#x0201c;avolition&#x0201d;, which includes anhedonia, asociality and avolition, and &#x0201c;expressive deficit&#x0201d;, which evaluates blunted affect and alogia.<xref rid="b34-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Neurocognitive functions were rated using the MAT-RICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB) that includes tests for the assessment of different cognitive domains. We evaluated processing speed, attention/vigilance, working memory, visual learning, verbal learning and reasoning and problem solving.<xref rid="b35-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The assessment of SC included the Facial Emotion Identification Test (FEIT),<xref rid="b37-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which examines facial affect recognition, and the Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT),<xref rid="b38-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> which is a ToM test consisting of seven scales (positive emotions, negative emotions, sincere, simple sarcasm, paradoxical sarcasm, sarcasm enriched and lie), organized into three sections: ER, social inference (minimal) and social inference (enriched). The manual of the TASIT was translated into Italian by a psychiatrist of the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Naples SUN, who gained experience in the use of the English version of the instrument during his stage at the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, as part of his PhD course. The videotaped vignettes of the TASIT were dubbed in Italian at the Fono Roma Studios (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fonoroma.com">http://www.fonoroma.com</ext-link>), a prestigious society in the field of film industry. As to the FEIT, the adaptation of the Italian version required the translations of the six emotions reported on the screen above the stimuli.</p><p>Functional capacity was evaluated by the short version of the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment Brief,<xref rid="b39-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> a performance-based instrument that assesses &#x0201c;financial skills&#x0201d; (counting money and paying bills) and &#x0201c;communication skills&#x0201d; (to dial a telephone number for emergency or reschedule an appointment by telephone). The total score, starting from 0 (poorest functional capacity) to 100 (best functional capacity), was used in statistical analyses.</p><p>Real-life functioning was assessed using the Specific Level of Functioning Scale (SLOF), a hybrid instrument that examines several aspects of functioning. It is based on key caregiver&#x02019;s judgment on behavior and functioning of patients and consists of 43 items including six domains: physical efficiency, skills in self-care, interpersonal relationships, social acceptability, community activities (eg, shopping, using public transportation) and working abilities. For outpatients living in the community, a ceiling effect can be expected for self-care and social acceptability; thus, according to Sabbag et al,<xref rid="b40-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> three SLOF subscales can be used in this population: interpersonal relationship, community activities and working abilities. Higher scores correspond to better functioning. In our study, the key relative was interviewed, as usually this is the individual most frequently and closely in contact with the patient in the Italian context.

Both interventions included individual sessions of NIT; the SoCIAL program included group sessions of ER (first 10 sessions) and ToM (next 10 sessions), while the SSANIT program included group sessions of SSIT (communication skills in the first 10 sessions and assertive skills in the last 10 sessions).</p><sec><title>Neurocognitive individualized training</title><p>NIT is based on a computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation program, RehaCom, developed by the HASOMED GmbH (Inc., Ltd) in Magdeburg, Germany.<xref rid="b29-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The patient can work with RehaCom on a personal computer, using a special keyboard with simple, large and clear keys. All training procedures can be adapted to the individual needs and the trainer can decide on the basis of his/her judgment to reduce or increase the level of difficulty for each module.</p><p>The program provides different difficulty levels: when the subject successfully passes a level, the program will automatically switch to more complex level; if the subject finds difficulty in an exercise, the program passes immediately to the simplest level. The threshold for passage from one level of difficulty to another is set by the trainer, based on the cognitive abilities of the subject. Therefore, the training never appears too complex or too simple for the trainee. The motivation of the person being trained is supported by close-to-reality practices and positive feedback. The data obtained during the training are registered on the computer that provides both an immediate feedback on task performance and a post-session feedback for all the modules informing the trainer and the patient of the session outcome, that is, the level of difficulty successfully performed by the subject.</p><p>On the basis of the results displayed on the computer, the trainer provides the patient with positive and/or corrective feedback and strategy coaching or compensatory skills training. The following training modules were used: &#x0201c;Attention and Concentration&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Verbal Memory&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Memory for faces&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Shopping&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Day planning&#x0201d;.

Real-life aspects of the patient are modeled into SSIT; the subjects were asked to report some special episodes involving them recently at home or in other social contexts, so as to set the training on them and on the specific social skill deficit. To promote generalization from training to real life, the patients&#x02019; attempts to practice the skills outside the training group were carefully reviewed in subsequent sessions, positive feedbacks were provided and any difficulties perceived by the person were discussed with the group.</p></sec><sec><title>Social Cognition Individualized Activities Lab</title><p>SoCIAL was carried out by a psychologist in the role of conductor and by a PRT in the role of co-conductor. As already mentioned, the training is divided into two modules comprising two different areas of SC:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ER module trains the ability to discriminate emotions and consists of 10 sessions, 2 sessions for each basic emotion: fear, anger, surprise, sadness and joy. Educational materials (photos and videos) are used to analyze prototypical elements of each emotion (facial micro expressions, prosody, gestures and so on). In particular, the ER module is divided into two phases:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Emotion prototypical elements: During this phase, patients are provided with didactic information on how to identify facial expressions of basic emotions. For this purpose, several pictures depicting emotional expressions in static images of faces have been used. In addition, patients are trained to recognize prosodic features (voice) and dynamic features (physical, eg, gestures, posture) of emotions using clips depicting emotionally connoted everyday situations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Role-play: the role-play is meant to train patients to &#x0201c;live&#x0201d; decode the emotion expressed by the actor (co-conductor) with whom they will act the scene. Besides ER, patients are also asked to modulate an appropriate response to the emotion elicited by the co-conductor during the scene.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>ToM module trains the ability to discriminate emotional expressions in social contexts and the ability to attribute mental states to others (to understand how they feel and what they think in real-life situations). The ToM training includes 10 sessions that illustrate, using 15 videos, the following social interaction: sarcasm, disappointment, hostility, misunderstanding, deceit and sincere. The patient is required to argue about the thoughts, feelings (including subtle emotions or misunderstandings), intentions and meaning of the actors of the videos, based upon their facial expression, tone of voice and gesture.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The ToM Module is divided into two phases:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Identifying social and contextual cues to understand the mental states of others: patients acquire skills to identify social cues which are useful for a proper understanding of the mental states of others.

In a controlled trial design, patients who received the SoCIAL intervention obtained significant improvements in SC after 20 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Although the groups receiving the two interventions were comparable at baseline for all variables, after 20 weeks of treatment, only patients assigned to SoCIAL had a significant improvement of SC. This result is even more significant when considering that both the interventions included an NIT. Our data suggest that the effect of the SoCIAL intervention on the SC domain was not due to an improvement of neurocogni-tive functions: if this was the case, the SoCIAL group should have presented a greater improvement on neurocognition; instead, it did not differ in change score with respect to the SSANIT group.</p><p>The design of this pilot study was aimed to verify whether a training specifically addressing ER and ToM had any advantage over a consolidated social skills training program when both the interventions were integrated with a neurocognitive training. The advantage of SoCIAL over SSANIT on SC suggests that this domain is amenable to remediation only using dedicated programs, specifically targeting its components.</p><p>Furthermore, only participants in the SoCIAL group showed an improvement of negative symptom domain avolition. This result is in line with evidences of a relationship between SC and negative symptoms.<xref rid="b43-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b45-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In a study conducted by Lincoln et al,<xref rid="b45-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> the negative symptoms were significantly associated with deficits in ToM, explaining 26% of the variance.</p><p>No effect was observed for either intervention on positive symptoms, disorganization and functional capacity, in agreement with most of the literature findings.<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b46-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p><p>Finally, no effect was observed for either intervention on real-life functioning, despite the improvement of neurocognition in both groups and of SC and negative symptoms in the SoCIAL group. A reduced power to detect changes in functioning could be hypothesized, but the significance of effects on SC argues against this hypothesis. A more plausible hypothesis is that the lack of significant changes in functioning as measured by the SLOF might be related to the relatively high levels of functioning at baseline, with ceiling effects also on community activities, generally impaired in most of the community-dwelling patients. This hypothesis can explain the negative results observed with the SSANIT program, for which we had previously observed an impact on functioning.<xref rid="b29-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Some limitations of our pilot study should be discussed. Participants randomized to the SoCIAL group had a better ER at baseline, and this could be considered one of the reasons for their improvement after treatment. However, the baseline difference was not significant and no effect of treatment was observed for the FEIT change score which could be influenced more directly by the baseline difference on ER.</p><p>The main limitation of the study is the low statistical power due to the small sample size. It could be that we did not detect some treatment effects due to the small sample size. However, the two samples were comparably small, and even with a conservative ANCOVA design, we could demonstrate a significant treatment effect on the primary outcome. A sample extension will allow us to better understand the advantages of the SoCIAL versus the SSANIT.</p><p>In conclusion, the major results obtained in our pilot study are the improvement of SC and avolition only in the participants receiving SoCIAL that specifically addressed the SC domain. Our results are in line with a recent meta-analysis of SC remediation programs<xref rid="b27-ndt-13-1947" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> showing a moderate&#x02013;large effect on SC dimensions, such as facial affect recognition and ToM, and a small to moderate effect on negative symptoms. The inclusion of both a neurocognitive and an SC remediation program might represent the most promising intervention with a potential impact on core dysfunctions of people with schizophrenia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr Francesco Mancuso for his participation in the development of the SoCIAL intervention.</p><p>The
