Subjects were dosed BID beginning 1 day before the cataract surgery, the day of surgery, and 14 days after surgery. A slit lamp biomicroscopy examination was performed to evaluate the signs of inflammation, including anterior chamber cells (ACC) and anterior chamber flare (ACF). The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects with an ACC grade of 0 at Day 15. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved a pain score of 0 at each postsurgical visual analog scale (VAS) assessment and the proportion of subjects with an ACF grade of 0 at Day 15.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At Day 15, proportionally more subjects in the bromfenac 0.075% group than in the vehicle group had an ACC grade of 0 (57.1% vs 18.8%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). At each of the postsurgical time points (Days 1, 8, 15, and 29), proportionally more bromfenac 0.075%-treated subjects (76.8%, 90.5%, 92.9%, and 85.1%, respectively) had no pain (a VAS score of 0) compared with the vehicle-treated subjects (48.2%, 38.8%, 42.4%, and 47.1%, respectively), and at each time point, these differences in proportions were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). More subjects in the bromfenac 0.075% group had complete ACF resolution (151/167; 90.4%) compared to those in the vehicle group (54/85; 63.5%).

As a result, the subject was discontinued from the study.</p><p>Most treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were of mild or moderate severity, and the proportions of subjects with these TEAEs were similar between treatment groups. More subjects in the vehicle group had severe TEAEs compared to those in the bromfenac 0.075% group (7.1% [6/85] vs 1.8% [3/169], respectively). Frequent AEs are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-opth-10-2311">Table 6</xref>. One notable exception is the higher number and greater percentage of subjects in the bromfenac 0.075% group who had ocular hypertension (n=16, 9.5%) compared to those in the vehicle group (n=3, 3.5%), although these differences were not significant. All episodes of ocular hypertension occurred immediately after surgery and were not unexpected. None of the study investigators believe that an increase in ocular hypertension was a result of the bromfenac 0.075% or vehicle but was a result of the surgery itself. Changes in IOP from baseline were considered small and not clinically significant. By the following study visit (Day 1), all subjects had returned to their preoperative levels with or without any intervention. There was no evidence of a persistent or delayed elevation in IOP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During the postoperative period, ocular NSAIDs are prescribed to reduce the pain and inflammation associated with surgery. In this Phase III study, we found bromfenac 0.075% to be superior to vehicle in both primary and secondary endpoints (resolution of ACC and ACF grades at Day 15 [after 16 days of dosing] and prevention of postoperative pain). The bromfenac 0.075% group reported proportionally less pain early in the postsurgical period (Day 1) compared to the vehicle group.</p><p>The results of this study confirmed those of a previous Phase II study, where bromfenac 0.075% reduced inflammation better than the currently marketed versions of bromfenac in both once- and twice-daily formulations (InSite Vision Inc., data on file, 2012).</p><p>Our results add to the recent literature about the analgesic effects of bromfenac postcataract surgery.<xref rid="b14-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In particular, our study used bromfenac 0.075% encased in DuraSite, and our efficacy results were similar to others published on bromfenac 0.07% without DuraSite.<xref rid="b16-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, the bromfenac 0.075% in this trial was able to prevent pain, which has not been established with other formulations of bromfenac.</p><p>There has been discussion among clinicians about the perceived benefits of once-daily or twice-daily dosing.

There may be advantages with using DuraSite as the bioadhesive support matrix as well; clinical trials evaluating 1% azithromycin and 0.6% besifloxacin in DuraSite found a more convenient therapeutic course and better efficacy in the clinical resolution of bacterial conjunctivitis when DuraSite was used compared to either vehicle or other ophthalmic formulations.<xref rid="b18-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The use of DuraSite has been extensively researched and validated as an efficacious and safe method for ocular drug delivery.<xref rid="b13-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b21-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-opth-10-2311" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>There are some limitations to this study. For instance, we limited the number of patients in the vehicle group as they were not allowed pain medication postoperatively in the study eye. (It is important to note, however, that analgesics were available as rescue medications regardless of assigned group.) This may, in fact, be a cause of the higher percentage of subjects in the placebo group who withdrew from the study. Although not all these patients were followed after withdrawal, the majority did so based on the lack of efficacy of the vehicle alone. Almost all the baseline subjects (93.7%) completed the first postoperative visit (InSite Vision, Inc., data on file, 2015), indicating a willingness to continue study participation. While unlikely, it is possible that the ingredients in DuraSite (vehicle) may contribute to a patient&#x02019;s pain assessment. As both groups were dosed with DuraSite, we believe that there may have been a placebo effect in the vehicle group.</p><p>We have shown bromfenac 0.075% in DuraSite is safe, well tolerated, and effective at reducing inflammation and preventing pain associated with cataract surgery.
