AKI is associated with increased rates of postoperative arrhythmias, wound infections and sepsis, and independently predicts a five-fold increase in death at 30&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that intraoperative oxidative damage, quantified by measuring plasma concentrations of F<sub>2</sub>- isoprostanes, independently predicts AKI following cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Excess oxygen exposure (hyperoxia) induces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cell-culture and ischemia reperfusion experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, hyperoxic reperfusion of ischemic tissues is associated with tissue damage and poor outcomes in some patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Anesthesiologists administer supplemental oxygen (fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<sub>2</sub>) greater than room air (i.e., FIO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.21)) to patients undergoing surgery to avoid hypoxia because prolonged hypoxia leads to organ injury and death. In the majority of patients undergoing surgery, however, supplemental oxygen administration is not required to maintain an arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (O<sub>2</sub> sat) greater than 95%, and with the development of continuous O<sub>2</sub> sat pulse oximetry, the excess administration of supplemental oxygen may not reduce the incidence of hypoxia. The use of continuous pulse oximetry O<sub>2</sub> sat monitors and point-of-care arterial blood gas measurement machines provide better assessments of patient oxygenation but have not affected the practice of administering excess supplemental oxygen during surgery. During cardiac surgery anesthesiologists typically ventilate patients with a FIO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0. In normal conditions, approximately 99% of the oxygen in blood is bound to hemoglobin, and administering oxygen at concentrations higher than those needed to saturate hemoglobin does not increase oxygen content in blood by a clinically important amount. It does, however, increase the partial pressure of oxygen in plasma to super-physiologic levels. These super-physiologic levels may increase the production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] which could induce an oxidative stress and lead to organ injury. At the cellular level, oxidative stress causes direct damage to proteins, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and lipids, resulting in organelle autophagy, cellular apoptosis and necrosis, organ injury and dysfunction, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that ROS impair endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The endothelium regulates perfusion. Thus, endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the associations among patient oxygenation, oxidative stress, and organ injury following cardiac surgery.</p><p id="Par24">In other clinical scenarios hyperoxia is harmful. Following cardiac arrest and successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); for example, hyper-oxygenation is associated with poor neurologic recovery, coma, and a 44% increase in the odds of death per 100&#x000a0;mmHg change in partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This hyperoxia-associated organ injury may be mediated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a recent investigation of critically ill patients, the patients randomly assigned to conservative supplemental oxygen administration (goal PaO<sub>2</sub> 70&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mmHg and O<sub>2</sub> sat 94 to 98%) had decreased mortality compared to those assigned to higher oxygen levels/conventional care (PaO<sub>2</sub> up to 150&#x000a0;mmHg or O<sub>2</sub> sat 97 to 100%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In another study, patients suffering myocardial infarction but without hypoxia who were randomly assigned air had reduced infarct size compared to those assigned supplemental oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These findings and the lack of evidence supporting routine administration of hyperoxia support the need to further investigate the effects of conservative supplemental oxygen administration in critically ill patient populations.</p><p id="Par25">We hypothesize that the maintenance of physiologic oxygenation during cardiac surgery, defined as the administration of oxygen concentrations no greater than what is required to maintain arterial hemoglobin saturation at 97%, decreases renal dysfunction and oxidative stress compared to hyper-oxygenation. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that maintaining physiologic oxygenation (normoxia) during anesthesia for cardiac surgery (1) decreases postoperative kidney (primary clinical endpoint), brain, and myocardial injury, (2) reduces the generation of superoxide radicals in blood, (3) decreases systemic oxidative stress (primary mechanism endpoint), and (4) improves endothelial function compared to hyper-oxygenation (hyperoxia).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par26">This is a single-center, randomized, blinded, investigator-initiated clinical trial of 200 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN, USA). We will recruit 220 patients in order to study 200 patients to account for an anticipated 10% of patients who will consent to be studied but will fail exclusion criteria, have surgery cancelled, or withdraw for personal reasons prior to randomization. We will screen and recruit patients prior to surgery, randomly assign them to intraoperative oxygenation treatment, measure proposed mechanism markers prior to, during, and following treatment, and measure clinical outcomes until hospital discharge and again at 1-year follow-up.

Clinical exclusion criteria were created with the goal of avoiding harm to patients. Because the control group receives protocolled management similar to usual care, and patients not participating would receive usual care, we will exclude patients from study if the active treatment might increase harm rather than the control group increasing harm (there are biologic reasons why both active treatment or usual care could increase harm). Specifically, since physiologic oxygenation could increase the risk of hypoxia compared to hyper-oxygenation (usual care), patients with conditions associated with regional tissue hypoxia will be excluded, thereby not exposing these patients to a treatment that could increase risk beyond usual care. This was the logic for excluding patients with acute coronary syndrome and carotid stenosis. Patients who might require significant supplemental oxygen to maintain normoxia will be excluded. This was the logic for excluding patients on supplemental oxygen at home, patients requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain O<sub>2</sub> sat &#x0003e;92%, and those with right to left intracardiac shunting. Patients who will require circulatory arrest during surgery will be excluded because it will be impossible to provide physiologic oxygenation during extreme iatrogenic hypothermia for those patients if they were randomized to physiologic oxygenation. Patients on dialysis are excluded because of an inability to measure acute kidney injury, the primary endpoint of the trial. Pregnant patients will be excluded because of lack of preliminary safety data related to the intervention on pregnant patients and unborn babies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par29">Subjects will be randomized to physiologic oxygenation (the minimum FIO<sub>2</sub> required to maintain an O<sub>2</sub> sat between 95 and 97% during mechanical ventilation or a PaO<sub>2</sub> between 80 and 110&#x000a0;mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass, but no less than that of air (FIO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21)) or hyper-oxygenation (administration of FIO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0 during mechanical ventilation and FIO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8 during cardiopulmonary bypass) during surgery.

For each of the four strata, a computerized random number generator was used to generate a sequence of binary treatment assignments in randomly permuted blocks of size 2 or 4, where block size is selected uniformly at random. The randomization table was uploaded to the centralized automated randomization module in REDCap&#x02122;. The study statistician wrote the computer program (R; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) that generates the randomization table. However, to preserve the blinding of study personnel, a third-party statistician executed the program and uploaded the resulting tables to the online randomization module. Immediately prior to the subject being brought into the operating room, study personnel access the online randomization module to randomize and learn the treatment assignment for that patient. This type of stratified block randomization ensures a degree of balance both within and across strata, while random selection of block sizes ensures that study personnel cannot predict the treatment assignment of subsequent patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par37">Study anesthesiologists and perfusionists will be responsible for protocol-directed administration of physiologic oxygenation or hyper-oxygenation. Therefore, anesthesiologists and perfusionists will be aware of subject treatment assignment. Subjects, surgeons, laboratory technicians, statisticians and ICU staff will remain blinded to treatment group. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care will remain unaffected by inclusion in this study or by study group assignment aside from oxygenation treatment. Since there is a potential for anesthesiologists to alter the care of patients based on intervention allocation aside from the protocol-directed treatment, we have instituted protocols to guide other aspects of anesthetic care such as mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drug administration, and anesthetic administration, and we will instruct anesthesiologists to not alter their care in any way based on treatment assignment aside from oxygen administration. However, to measure any differences in clinical care between groups that could be a result of oxygenation treatment or the treatment assignment, we also will collect metrics of respiratory, anesthetic, and hemodynamic management, including respiratory rate, tidal volume, PEEP, concentrations of all inhaled and exhaled gases and anesthetics, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output, collected and stored automatically every minute in the perioperative data warehouse; and vasoactive drug administration, fluid administration, and transfusion recorded in the anesthetic record.</p><p id="Par38">We expect subjects randomized to physiologic oxygenation or hyper-oxygenation to have similar vital signs, similar responses to surgery, similar response to medications, and to not warrant any differences in care based on treatment assignment.

We do not expect any knowledge of subject treatment assignment to affect surgical management of subjects.

The ROCS trial will test the hypothesis that physiologic oxygenation during surgery will decrease the production of ROS, oxidative damage, and organ injury compared to hyper-oxygenation.</p><p id="Par65">Two recent studies have been conducted to test similar hypotheses. First, the SO-COOL study randomly assigned cardiac surgery patients to avoidance of hyperoxemia versus usual care during cardiopulmonary bypass at two hospitals in New Zealand and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Here, McGuinness et al. reported no difference in AKI measured using creatinine and urine output KDIGO criteria or in other secondary clinical markers. The study protocol did not limit hyperoxia prior to, or following, cardiopulmonary bypass, and during these periods patients were hyper-oxygenated. Following cardiopulmonary bypass pulsatile flow is restored, and ischemic tissues may be reperfused. In experimental models markers of oxidative damage surge following reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Markers of oxidative stress also surge after cardiopulmonary bypass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, measurements of perioperative oxidative stress were not reported, thus it is unknown if the intervention decreased the putative mechanism for organ injury related to hyper-oxygenation.</p><p id="Par66">Second, the Oxygen-ICU Randomized Clinical Trial randomly assigned critically ill patients in a medical-surgery ICU to conservative oxygenation (target PaO<sub>2</sub> 70&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mmHg or O<sub>2</sub> sat 94&#x02013;98%) or standard ICU practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although the median PaO<sub>2</sub> in the conservative oxygenation group was only 15&#x000a0;mmHg lower than the median PaO<sub>2</sub> in the control group, the conservative oxygenation group had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and lower rates of death, shock, liver failure, and bacteremia. Renal failure was similar between groups. This study was terminated early due to difficulty with enrollment.</p><p id="Par67">Dissimilar from prior studies, the ROCS trial will randomize cardiac surgery patients to physiologic oxygenation or hyper-oxygenation throughout the entire operative period and will measure the putative mechanisms involved, namely oxidative stress and endothelial function, in addition to clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par68">Limitations of the ROCS trial include an inability to blind anesthesiologists to intervention assignment. This is not possible since anesthesiologists are required to implement the oxygen titration protocol, but it creates a risk for study groups to be treated differently, masking the effect of intervention. Similarly, while cardiac surgeons will not be informed of patient treatment assignment and will be informed that they cannot ascertain treatment assignment, surgeons could examine oxygen flow meters on the anesthesia machine to ascertain treatment. If this were to happen, we do not expect that it would alter surgical technique or management or affect any outcome assessments. Another limitation is the use of serum creatinine as a marker of renal injury in the primary analysis. Serum concentrations of creatinine may be affected by processes aside from renal injury, and the use of serum creatinine change to diagnose AKI may limit accurate measurement of renal injury. However, current consensus guidelines designate change in serum creatinine as the primary metric for AKI diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We will also measure urine concentrations of AKI biomarkers and the need for renal replacement therapy to phenotype AKI. And finally, the study is limited by a poor ability to assess oxygen tensions in organ tissues of interest, specifically within tubule cells in the kidney and neurons in the brain. We will, however, use near-infrared spectroscopy to measure brain tissue hemoglobin O<sub>2</sub> sat, a metric that we and others have correlated with acute brain injury following cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">The high incidence of AKI, delirium, arrhythmia, and other organ injuries after cardiac surgery and the associations between these organ injuries and oxidative damage warrant the investigation of intraoperative physiologic oxygenation as a means to reduce organ injury and patient morbidity.
