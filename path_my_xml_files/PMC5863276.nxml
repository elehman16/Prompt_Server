inappropriate use of interventions (routine amniotomy, lithotomy and intravenous
infusion of oxytocin) and restriction of the parturients&#x02019; rights (restriction of the
presence of companions) in all stages of labor. These problems can be prevented or
reduced by adopting the best scientific evidence available in obstetric care<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A hospital-based study called Birth in Brazil, coordinated by the National School of
Public Health Sergio Arouca, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Rio de Janeiro), surveyed the
profile of obstetric care in the country through an investigation of 23,940 puerperae
and pointed out that some practices, such as lithotomy position (91.7%), oxytocin
(36.4%), amniotomy (39.1%), Kristeller maneuver (36.1%), and cesarean sections (51.9%)
continue to be offered as routine care in normal-risk pregnancies<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>If, on the one hand, the advance of modern obstetrics has contributed to the improvement
of indicators of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, on the other hand, it
has allowed the implementation of a model that deals with pregnancy and childbirth as if
they were diseases rather than as expressions of health. As a consequence, women and
newborns (NBs) are exposed to high intervention rates<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed in 1996 some changes in labor
and delivery care, including the need to rescue the idea of childbirth as a natural
event, with a stimulus for the work of obstetric nurses, the use of practices based on
the best scientific evidence and access to appropriate technologies for childbirth
care<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. In this perspective, the importance of health policies and practices to be
grounded on the best available evidence and of translating knowledge into action,
promoting the effectiveness and safety of interventions, stands out<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>However, introducing practices scientific evidence-based care practices requires more
than knowledge and beliefs, since changes of behavior, overcoming barriers and filling
gaps in the transfer of knowledge are required<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Implementation refers to the use of evidence in clinical practice, through changes in
care and/or in health services<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>, and clinical audit is one of the strategies to achieve its consolidation. </p><p>Clinical audit is a quality improvement strategy that provides data on the disparities
between current practice and desired performance. It is based on the assumption that
practitioners modify their practices when they receive a feedback showing that they are
inconsistent with the desirable performance<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A usual clinical audit models is the one adopted by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI),
which consists of three phases: baseline audit, implementation of best practices, and
post-implementation audit<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Although plenty research on good delivery care practices is available, there is a lack
of studies on the assessment of the impact of interventions proposing the implementation
of this evidence. Aspects such as implementation methodology still need to be better
investigated<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this sense, this study seeks to answer the following question: does the
implementation of evidence-based practices modify normal delivery care?</p><p>Thus, this study was proposed to evaluate the impact of the implementation of
evidence-based practices in normal delivery care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Quasi-experimental, before-and-after intervention study that followed the clinical audit
process to implement evidence-based care practices, used by the JBI, composed of the
phases: 1) planning and conduction of a baseline audit; 2) evaluation and discussion of
results of the baseline audit and educational intervention to implement best practices
with the audit team; 3) post-intervention audit, in which the same criteria of the
baseline audit are measured and whose objective is to compare the differences between
the results of the two audits and to verify the conformity of each audited
criterion.</p><p>The study was conducted between July 2015 and March 2016 at the M&#x000e3;e Luzia Women&#x02019;s
Hospital (HMML), a reference public maternity hospital in the state of Amap&#x000e1;, in Macap&#x000e1;,
which provides care to women at normal and high obstetric risk. In 2015, the monthly
mean of admissions was 650 births (66.5% normal and 33.5% cesarean section) .</p><p>This study used data obtained through interviews with health professionals and puerperal
women and by consulting the medical records of women attended at the HMML.</p><p>In the case of health professionals, it was decided to use the population; 71
professionals were eligible. Of these, 52 met the inclusion criteria, but 10 were not
located or did not agree to participate in the study. Thus the remaining 42
professionals participated in the baseline audit (25 nurses and 17 physicians). In
addition to these losses, 10 professionals refused or were unavailable in the subsequent
phases of the study, resulting in a total of 32 professionals (20 nurses and 12
physicians) who shared in the educational intervention and post-intervention audit. The
inclusion criteria of professionals were: obstetric nurse, obstetrician, nursing or
medical resident and assistants of normal delivery in the HMML.</p><p>The sample size of puerperal women was defined by the prevalence test for
before-and-after studies, considering the rate of oxytocin use in the Northern region of
Brazil of 22.8%<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>, reducing to 10.5%. Thus, it was estimated that at least 280 women (140 before
intervention and 140 after it) were needed to reach an 80% test power and 95% confidence
level. The inclusion criteria were: women admitted to the hospital and in the active
phase or with overt signs of labor and up to 8 cm of cervical dilatation; women with
normal-risk pregnancy and current normal delivery; non-indigenous women, and without
special needs.</p><p>In both phases, medical records were selected by intentional sampling. In the baseline
audit, all hospital discharges of puerperae occurred 30 days before the beginning of
this phase were considered. In this moment, 424 medical records were made available and,
after checking the inclusion criteria of the puerperae, 291 were selected. In the
post-intervention audit, the records of hospital discharge of the puerperae between the
second fortnight of February and the first of March of 2016 were included. In this
period, 440 medical records were made available, and, after application of inclusion
criteria, 264 remained. The following variables were noted: presence of companion,
amniotomy, delivery position, oxytocin prescription, oxytocin administration, directed
pushing and Kristeller maneuver.</p><p>Data collection took place in three phases: a baseline audit was initially carried out
(between July and September 2015), with formation of a team and definition of the audit
criteria and preliminary evaluation of outcomes and practices used in labor and
delivery. The audit team included people involved in the management and care process,
called &#x0201c;key professionals&#x0201d;. These were the general manager, the HMML technician and
clinical physician, the obstetrics manager, all the physicians, the coordinator of the
Nursing team and the head of the Permanent Education Center.</p><p>Some practices and maternal outcomes that could indicate the use of the best scientific
evidence were adopted as criteria in the audit. These included the increase in the rate
of normal delivery, the number of companions chosen by the women, the frequency of the
birth position chosen by the women, and upright positions; reduction of amniotomy rate,
lithotomy position, intravenous oxytocin, directed pushing and Kristeller maneuver. In
this phase, interviews were also carried out with the professionals of the service and
with the puerperal women in the rooming-in within 1-2 days postpartum. The questions
were related to the presence of companion of the women&#x02019;s choice, amniotomy, oxytocin,
delivery positions, directed pushing, and Kristeller maneuver. Data from the medical
records of the puerperal women were also collected.</p><p>In the phase 2 (October 2015), an educational intervention called &#x0201c;Seminar of scientific
evidence-based care practices to normal delivery&#x0201d; was presented to professionals who
participated in the baseline audit. The seminar was held outside the service, lasted 8
hours, and presented the preliminary assessment of the results obtained in the baseline
audit and the best practices of delivery care (presence of companion of the choice of
the women, upright positions, selective amniotomy and oxytocin, avoidance of Valsalva
and Kristeller maneuvers), all of which were discussed with the professionals in the
light of scientific evidence. The HMML directors were facilitators in the presentation
and discussion of practices. Updated printed material (randomized clinical trials and
systematic reviews) were also was made available to all the professionals who shared in
the seminar.</p><p>However, only 18 (11 nurses and seven physicians) out of the 42 professionals who
participated in the baseline audit also participated in this phase. Thus, between
October and November of 2015, another strategy was proposed with banners presenting a
synthesis of the evidences in the work place of the participants, so as to reach the
other professionals. Another 14 professionals (nine nurses and five physicians)
participated in this intervention, totaling 32 participants.</p><p>Considering that the JBI did not establish the period for development of the
post-intervention, the investigators decided to carry it out 60 days after the phase 2.
To this end, an audit with the same instruments and criteria applied in the phase 1 was
used to identify the application of the practices discussed in the seminar and compare
it with the results of the baseline audit.</p><p>Data analysis was performed by calculating the absolute and relative frequencies of the
categorical variables. Inferential analysis was performed by comparing the results of
phases 1 and 3. The chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of the practices
identified in the interviews with the puerperae. The Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests
were used to compare the proportions of the practices identified through the
consultation of medical records. A methodology for repeated measures with a generalized
estimating equation model (GEE) was used to compare the practices identified in the
interviews with the professionals in phases 1 and 3<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing of the
University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, under Opinion n&#x000ba; 698.421/2014. The participation of
professionals and users of the service was voluntary, after reading, clarifications and
signing the Informed Consent Term or Assent Term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The comparative analysis between phases 1 and 3 showed that there was an increase of 5.3
percentage points (p.p.) in the normal delivery rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In the interview with the puerperal women, the post-intervention audit showed that there
was a statistically significant increase of the presence of companions of free choice,
statistical reduction of amniotomy and of lithotomy position and infusion of oxytocin

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This quasi-experimental, before-and-after intervention study was based on the clinical
audit model and sought to assess the impact of the implementation of evidence-based
practices on normal delivery care. Few studies have explored this subject in the
obstetric area despite its great clinical and academic relevance.</p><p>The care model adopted in Brazilian hospitals results in the exposure of women,
especially those with habitual obstetric risk, to unnecessary interventions that lack
evidence to justify their use<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. Thus, the protocol of this research defined some practices and maternal
outcomes that represent the use of the best evidence in childbirth care recommended by
the WHO. In the HMML, such changes were fundamental in view of the framework found in
the baseline audit, that is, high rates of interventions without scientific
recommendation or even considered iatrogenic.</p><p>Although this study has resulted in improved clinical practice, scientific
evidence-based childbirth care practices has not been fully implemented, possibly
because this is a complex and continuous process that involves changes and overcoming of
barriers at the individual and institutional levels, as it has been indicated by other
researchers<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The scientific literature points out several factors that hinder the implementation of
evidence-based clinical practice. At the organizational level, the main barriers are
lack of time, inadequate facilities and lack of support<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. In the hospital where this research was conducted, workload of professionals
was detected, as well as a small number of beds inconsistent with the high demand of
deliveries, and lack of physical infrastructure. The implementation of evidence could
have been more successful if there were an organizational context that supported
evidence-based practice.</p><p>At the individual level, barriers include lack of knowledge about research methods and
results and negative attitude towards evidence-based practice<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Added to this is the resistance of some health professionals who cannot break
up with the current paradigm of childbirth care<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, probably because they were trained in a time before the launching of
humanization policies and evidence-based practice. Moreover, medical education does not
yet focus on the training of professionals to provide comprehensive, quality and
humanized care, but it is rather inclined to reproduce the use of interventionist
practices<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The competition imposed by other health priorities, the scarcity of resources, the lack
of motivation to implement and sustain the changes in the practice of care and the
ineffective dissemination of the results are factors that contribute to the resumption
of the previous practice after a research intervention<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>There are a large number of strategies that can contribute to an effective
implementation of changes in the clinical practice. These are based on different
theories about human behavior, professional change and organizational performance. The
literature suggests that real and sustainable changes can be achieved by combining these
different approaches<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>After the educational intervention, there was an increase of 5.3 p.p. in the normal
delivery rate, possibly stimulated by discussion of the implementation of evidence-based
practices in the seminar. However, because of the limitations of the study design, it is
not possible to state that this was the only determinant for this change. Additional
data, such as the risk situation of women during labor progression and indications to
perform cesarean section, were not analyzed. In any case, it was noticed that more
professionals began to adopt practices that contribute to the viability of normal
delivery, including the presence of companions, and reduction of amniotomy and of
infusion of oxytocin.</p><p>The post-intervention audit revealed a significant increase in the number of women who
had companions of their choice during labor and delivery. Individual support has
beneficial clinical effects to women and newborns, as indicated by scientific evidence.
Such support results in shorter labor, greater chance of spontaneous delivery, less need
for analgesia, fewer newborns with an Apgar score in the fifth minute and fewer reports
of dissatisfaction with childbirth, which should be guaranteed for every woman<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In Brazil, the presence of a companion of the woman&#x02019;s free choice during childbirth has
been guaranteed, for more than 10 years, by Federal Law n&#x000ba; 11,108, of April 7, 2005<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, the National Agency for Supplementary Health concluded, through
Normative Resolution 387, that obstetric care in the private sector should cover the
expenses of the companion, including proper clothing, lodging and meals, regardless of
health insurance<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The National Guideline on Childbirth also strengthens the recommendation that women have
companions of their choice during labor and delivery, not invalidating the support given
by persons that are outside the women&#x02019;s social network<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. This is a demonstrably useful practice and should be encouraged, since it
contributes to the humanization of care and reduction of unnecessary obstetric
interventions<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to point out that, in recent years, the legitimizing of
the respect for this right has faced difficulties in Brazil, mainly because of the
professionals&#x02019; resistance to the presence of companions, lack of physical structure,
lack of human and material resources in health institutions and lack of institutional
support and guidelines for implementation of the Law on Companions<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the HMML, the structure of the old obstetric center, the current CPN, did not offer
physical conditions to satisfactorily host the women, their companions and the
professionals. In 2014, this structure has undergone changes to adapt the environment as
established in the current policy on assistance for women, of the Cegonha Network/MOH.
Thus, the changes in space associated with the educational intervention carried out in
this study may justify the increase in the presence of companions of the women&#x02019;s choice
during delivery. </p><p>The decrease in the rate of amniotomy after the intervention was an unexpected finding
because, in the HMML, this practice was performed in a way associated to oxytocin
infusion under the justification of reducing the length of stay of the women in the
delivery center, what was necessary due to the high demand in the service. Amniotomy
before full cervical dilatation is often used to accelerate labor, but the effectiveness
of this intervention has not been proven and remains the subject of debate and
investigation.</p><p>Two systematic reviews without meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of active labor management. The first one, with 5,390 women, evaluated
whether this type of maneuvering reduced the number of cesareans in normal-risk
gestations and if it improved the satisfaction of the women. Practices included routine
amniotomy, oxytocin infusion, and individual support in labor. The authors concluded
that active management is associated with a small reduction in the cesarean rate, but it
is highly prescriptive and interventional. More studies are therefore needed to evaluate
the acceptability of this management by the parturient<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The second review concluded that there is no evidence that amniotomy is associated with
shortened cervical dilatation, cesarean section rate, maternal satisfaction, and Apgar
score at the fifth minute<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, this procedure should not be routinely adopted as part of parturient
care.</p><p>As for delivery position, there was a significant reduction of the use of lithotomy and
a substantial increase in the adoption of upright positions after the intervention. This
finding may be justified by the greater participation of obstetrical nurses in the
seminar. It was also observed that, in the daily practice, these professionals started
to guide women more often regarding the different delivery positions and giving them the
possibility of free choice.</p><p>Our results are in line with the findings of a study carried out in S&#x000e3;o Paulo (Brazil)
in which the authors observed that, after an educational intervention with the
professionals of a maternity ward, upright positions were adopted by all parturient
women and lithotomy was no longer used, a finding supported by statistical significance
(p = 0.001)<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In humanized care, women are encouraged to use their freedom to choose their position at
labor and delivery. However, in Brazil, the lithotomy position continues to be used
during the expulsive period by the majority of parturient<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Study shows that, when women adopt vertical positions, the physical and psychological
benefits include shorter duration of labor, fewer interventions and less severe pain,
and greater satisfaction with childbirth<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. A systematic review concluded that it is not yet possible to estimate the risks
and benefits of different birth positions because of the poor methodological quality of
the available studies. Thus, every woman should have the possibility to choose the
position she wants in childbirth. However, a substantial reduction of attended
deliveries, episiotomy, and increase in second-degree perineal lacerations are observed
in the upright position, without epidural anesthesia<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>According to the puerperal women, the post-intervention audit also revealed a
statistical reduction in the number of women subjected to oxytocin infusion during
labor. Such an outcome can be explained by the impact of the seminar (in line with the
advice that oxytocin infusion should not be a routine practice) and the introduction of
other practices in childbirth care, such as encouragement to walking, warm baths and an
the opportunity to choose the delivery position, in particular the upright ones, which
make it possible to accelerate labor.</p><p>A systematic review evaluated the use of oxytocin to accelerate the slow progression of
dilatation <italic>versus</italic> the reductions of cesarean rates and maternal and
fetal morbidity and found no statistical difference in the frequency of cesarean
sections (p = 0.88) or in adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (p = 1.02) when
comparing to late use or non-use of the hormone. In contrast, it was observed that the
early use of the drug resulted in uterine hyperstimulation associated with fetal cardiac
changes and reduction of labor in about 2 hours<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. Thus, infusion of oxytocin during the period of dilatation should be restricted
to specific situations such as failures in the progress of labor, in which there is a
need for correction of uterine dynamics<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. Thus, the results achieved after the educational intervention seem to favor the
relationship between the care practices and the scientific evidence in the service where
this research was conducted.</p><p>Directed pushing and Kristeller maneuver were also significantly reduced after the
educational intervention. When comparing the results of the interviewed mothers with
those of the professionals, the data on these practices reveal partial agreement, since
only directed pushing had a statistically significant decrease.</p><p>Regardless of complete cervical dilatation, stimulating the parturient to force,
preventing her from obeying her own impulses, thus disrespecting the physiology of
childbirth, is a frequent practice in maternities<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The National Guideline on Parturition Care recommends spontaneous pushing
during the expulsive period in women without analgesia, and avoidance of directed
pushing<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>A recent literature review that assessed maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with
the type of pushing used during the expulsive period found that the groups did not
differ in perineal lesions, episiotomies or type of delivery. Only one study found a
higher Apgar score in the fifth minute and better umbilical artery pH in the spontaneous
pushing group. The study concluded that the low methodological quality of the studies
and the differences between the protocols do not justify recommendations on any type of
pushing<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Professionals justify their guiding long and directed pushing with the purpose of
shortening the expulsive period<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. However, the systematic review that investigated the interference of directed
pushing in the expulsive period concluded that this action resulted in no effect in the
length of this period and in the rates of perineal trauma when compared to spontaneous
pushing<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, the woman should be encouraged to follow her own impulses.</p><p>Regarding the Kristeller maneuver, an observational study was performed in Egypt with
8,097 women undergoing normal labor to verify the effects of this maneuver. The authors
found that, despite the shorter duration of the second period, there was a significant
increase in the risk of severe perineal lacerations, uterine rupture, dyspareunia and
urinary incontinence 6 months postpartum. In the NB, there were shoulder dystocia,
increased risk of Apgar scores below seven in the fifth minute, fetal sequelae such as
hypoperfusion and cerebral palsy<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The practices and maternal outcomes identified in the interviews with professionals
showed that, after the intervention, all of them reported &#x0201c;always or most of the times&#x0201d;
to allow women to choose their companions, but this result had was not statistically
significant, because almost all professionals already did so before the intervention.
Similar results were found in the interviews of the women. Thus, it can be inferred that
the educational intervention improved this practice, ratifying the maintenance of
scientific evidence.</p><p>Regarding amniotomy, although there was a decrease in the number of professionals who
reported they &#x0201c;always or most of the times&#x0201d; adopt this procedure, the result was not
significant. This finding differs from that obtained in the interviews with the
puerperal women, probably due to the small number of professionals interviewed.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that, because amnioscopes were not available in the studied
scenario, amniotomy is used as a method to assess the appearance of amniotic fluid,
which may have contributed to the maintenance of high rates and the difficulty in
changing the care practice.</p><p>Regarding the delivery position, different from the women&#x02019;s reports, there was no
significant difference in the reduction of the lithotomy rate. It was also verified that
the interviews of both professionals and puerperal women revealed no significant
difference in the possibility of choosing the delivery position by the parturient,
showing that the decision of this aspect is still centered on the professionals.</p><p>An observational study conducted in Nigeria, which aimed to identify the relationship
between delivery positions and perineal trauma, revealed high lithotomy rates. Women who
adopted this position (85%) reported it as of no help for the progress of labor, but
that they had been given no choice, due to the imposition of professionals. The midwives
had used this practice in 98% of the births, justifying the conduct with the argument
that this is a condition imposed by the institution. Routine use of the lithotomy
position is a reflection of the medical culture incorporated into these hospitals, and
midwives are educated and trained to assist women in this position<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The most effective care is the one in which the parturient is the central figure and her
needs are valued at the expense of the demands of professionals or institutions.</p><p>Prescription/administration of oxytocin at delivery had a statistical decrease after the
intervention. It should be noted that, in the years prior to the intervention, this drug
was routinely prescribed and associated with amniotomy for the active management of
labor, especially by medical professionals, under the justification of reducing the time
of the women in the obstetric center in view of the high demand in the service.</p><p>Administration of oxytocin, whether or not associated with early amniotomy, should not
be routinely performed in cases of labor with good progression<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A systematic review compared the low initial dose versus high initial dose of oxytocin
and indicated that the higher dosage of the drug significantly reduced the duration of
delivery (&#x000b1; 3.5h) and cesarean rates, and increased vaginal delivery. The study
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of high doses of
oxytocin in women with slow progression of labor, and recommended further research to
evaluate this effect<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>There was a non-significant reduction in orienting or encouraging directed pushing and
Kristeller maneuver after the educational intervention. The reduction of these
interventions, although satisfactory, did not allow the audit criterion initially
defined to be achieved. The persistence of directed pushing and Kristeller maneuver
how&#x02019;s that there is still resistance from the part of professionals to change the
interventionist care model which is based on previous beliefs or experiences. Since the
studied maternity is a teaching hospital, this scenario is even more worrying, as it may
result in the perpetuation of this delivery model.</p><p>Since the planning of this study, difficulties to retrieve information from medical
records were expected, especially with respect to some practices that, although
performed, are often hidden, especially for the risk that they represent to the
parturient women and the newborns, such as directed pushing and Kristeller maneuvering.
Other practices such as oxytocin use, amniotomy, birth position and presence of
companion were chosen because they are important indicators in the obstetric area and,
in general, recorded in medical charts. For some of these variables, the quantity and
quality of the records were deficient, limiting the discussion of the findings of this
study.</p><p>After the educational intervention, the record of the presence of companions increased,
although without statistical significance, probably because this information was still
absent in more than 90% of the medical records. On the other hand, all the professionals
interviewed in the phase 3 reported that they &#x0201c;always or most of the times&#x0201d; allow the
presence of companions, and more than 90% of the puerperae reported having been allowed
to have a companion during labor.</p><p>As for the practice of amniotomy, it was found that there was a decrease of records in
the medical charts after the intervention, with a significant difference. This result is
similar to the reports of puerperae, but differs from those of the professionals. It is
worth clarifying that only when the amniotic sac was described as intact in the medical
record at the moment of admission without reference to artificial rupture until delivery
is that non-realization of amniotomy was noted. Furthermore, in the post-intervention
audit, the missing records of this practice more than doubled compared to the baseline
audit.</p><p>The registration of membrane integrity is an important factor in the evolution of labor,
in contrast with the negative repercussions of artificial rupture on maternal and fetal
health. There is evidence that undesirable effects result from this intervention,
including increased early deceleration of fetal heart rate and a higher risk of fetal
and puerperal infection<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.Thus, it is essential to encourage the recording of this information in the
medical record.</p><p>Regarding the positions adopted in the expulsive period, the records in the charts
showed that, after the educational intervention, there was a decrease in the lithotomy
position, while upright/squatting position increased, with a significant difference.
This finding corroborates the reports of the puerperal women, but not those of the
professionals, probably, due to the small number of professionals interviewed.</p><p>The records in the medical records concerning the prescription of oxytocin during labor
revealed that this practice was proportionally reduced after the educational
intervention, but without statistical difference. In the post-intervention audit, it was
found that the use of oxytocin in the period of dilatation was less frequency in all
sources of data audited, i.e., interviews with puerperal women, professionals and
medical records. It should be noted that for this variable, the information was
available in the medical records.</p><p>These findings are in line with a Palestinian study that used the methodology to
implement better evidence in normal childbirth care to investigate possible changes in
practices adopted by professionals. The authors demonstrated a lower frequency of some
important practices, including liberal use of oxytocin and artificial rupture of
membranes after the intervention, with statistically significant difference<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The absence of pre-defined audit criteria in the JBI for the implemented practices was
an important limitation in this study. Other limitations were the high frequency of
missing data on the practices in the medical records, the non-randomized collection of
puerperae to be interviewed, and the difficulty to recruit professionals.</p><p>Our findings not only bring contributions to the knowledge of professionals who assist
labor and delivery, but also eliminate empirical, routine and unnecessary care measures
for parturient women and improve clinical practice. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results allow us to infer that the methodology of implementation of scientific
evidence improved some obstetric practices and maternal outcomes. There was an increase
in the rate of normal delivery. In the other outcomes, the improvements found varied
according to the information source. From the perspective of the puerperae, there was a
significant increase of free choice of companions during labor and the upright/squatting
position, a significant reduction of amniotomy, lithotomy position, oxytocin infusion,
directed pushing and Kristeller maneuvering. From the perspective of professionals, the
practice that presented statistical decrease was prescription/administration of oxytocin
during labor. The analysis of the medical charts showed a statistical reduction of
amniotomy and lithotomy, with a consequent increase of upright/squatting positions. </p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Minist&#x000e9;rio da Sa&#x000fa;de IBR).
