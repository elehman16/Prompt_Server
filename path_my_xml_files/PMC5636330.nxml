However, the additional abdominal dissection results in increased pain post-operatively, requiring additional narcotic usage. It has been our mission to improve pain control following this reconstruction with the aims of facilitatating patients&#x02019; recovery while decreasing narcotic usage, hospital stays and overall treatment costs. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block uses a local anesthetic to block the nerves supplying sensation to abdominal wall. Bupivacaine is the most commonly used anesthetic and can be injected plain or as a newer liposomal formula (Exparel&#x000ae;), which has sustained release and lasts three to four days. It is not currently known if either of these delivery methods provides a better pain relief.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> IRB approval was granted to recruit women undergoing mastectomy with abdominal-based tissue reconstruction to be randomized to one of two study groups: a Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block performed with either bupivacaine or liposome bound bupivacaine (Exparel&#x000ae;), a sustained relief pain medication. A retrospective control cohort consisting of six consecutive previously reconstructed patients who did not receive a TAP block were also identified. Pain was assessed using a subjective 1&#x02013;5 pain scale, both at rest and after coughing, an abdominal specific assessment. Pain, nausea, emesis and activity were assessed at six, twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six and seventy-two hours. Total narcotic usage was calculated for hospital stay.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> From 2016, a total of sixteen patients have been enrolled: Exparel&#x000ae; (eight) and bupivacaine (eight). Patients who received Exparel&#x000ae; had a shorter average length of hospital stay as compared to the bupivacaine and control groups (4, 4.6 and 4.8 days). The Exparel&#x000ae; group demonstrated better sustained subjective pain control across time points both at baseline and during coughing. Oral, intravenous, and total narcotic usages (mg/body weight/day) were significantly less in the Exparel&#x000ae; group compared to the bupivacaine and control groups.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Our preliminary results suggest that delivering Exparel&#x000ae; via a TAP block in abdominal-based breast reconstruction can result in decreased hospital stays and narcotic usage with improved pain control.</p></body></article>
