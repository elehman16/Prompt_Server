periods after maximal concentric and eccentric exercises. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-two participants voluntarily participated and were divided into two groups: the
athlete and sedentary groups. An incremental treadmill running test was performed until
exhaustion. During the subsequent passive recovery session, heart rate and venous blood
lactate level were determined every 3 minutes until the venous blood lactate level reached
2&#x02005;mmol/l. The same test protocol was implemented 15 days later. [Results] Both groups
showed significantly shorter running durations in concentric exercise, while significant
differences were found between the athlete and sedentary groups in terms of venous blood
lactate level responses. In addition, there were significant differences between the
athlete and sedentary groups in terms of running duration and heart rate in concentric and
eccentric exercises. [Conclusion] The present study revealed no difference between the
athlete and sedentary groups in terms of recovery durations after eccentric and concentric
loadings, although the athletes demonstrated faster recovery in terms of HR compared with
the sedentary group. It was thought that concentric exercises cause greater physiological
responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Eccentric</kwd><kwd>Concentric</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recovery is defined as the process of normalization of the organism after workout<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. After maximal exercise, the purpose of the
recovery period is to rest the organism or return to conditions before the exercise.
Recovery also accelerates the regeneration rate of the organism between training sessions
and decreases fatigue and injury risk. Lactic acid accumulation is one of the important
factors that causes fatigue. Therefore, recovery or resting starts with the decrease of
lactic acid in the body. Removal of lactic acid, which is eliminated in blood and muscle,
occurs over a period of approximately 2 hours with passive recovery and over a period of 1
hour on average with active recovery after maximal exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Skeletal muscle contraction is classified in the literature as
isometric contraction, concentric contraction, and eccentric contraction. In eccentric
contraction, the load torque is greater than the muscle torque, and the muscle lengthens. In
contrast, the muscle torque is greater than the load torque in concentric contraction, and
the muscle length shortens<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some studies
in the literature have demonstrated that eccentric exercises lead to strength losses, while,
others have shown different results because of the effects of exercise intensity, exercise
type (resistance, downhill running), and area where the exercise is implemented<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Studies have shown that blood lactate levels increase 6&#x02013;10 folds during eccentric
exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to this, it can
therefore be seen that mechanical stress per fibril during eccentric exercises is higher
than that during concentric exercise. However, concentric exercise also causes more energy
expenditure, and it leads to more maximal contraction, lactic acid, and heart rate responses
compared with eccentric loading<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Eccentric contraction has been shown to produce greater muscle hypertrophy than a
concentric contraction after resistance training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to greater hypertrophy, eccentric contraction training
tends to exert lower stress on the cardiovascular system<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast to eccentric training, the cardiovascular and
metabolic responses show a linear increase in concentric running<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been stated that this difference can be associated
with the contribution of gravity during eccentric exercise. Furthermore, it is understood
that gravitational force increasingly assists with the work of performing the activity as
the negative slope becomes steeper, thus reducing the physiologic work required of the
body<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result of this, negative
slope walking e.g., walking downhill may be associated with cardiovascular or metabolic
stress<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of this study was to
compare the differences in recovery periods after maximal concentric and eccentric exercises
between athletes and sedentary individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was designed as a comparative study. All measurements were performed in the
Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Gazi University Faculty of Health Sciences,
in a temperature-controlled performance laboratory. All participants were notified of the
research procedures, requirements, benefits, and risks before giving informed consent.
Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by
the research ethics committee of Gazi University and was conducted in a manner consistent
with the institutional ethical requirements for human experimentation in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. All measurements were performed by the same researchers at a
similar time of the day between 8:00 and 12:00 a.m. Participants were asked not to exercise
exhaustively on the day prior to assessment and to have eaten and to be hydrated on the day
of the test. After excluding chronic or acute health conditions, musculoskeletal system
problems, and any drug intake, that might affect performance. Twenty-two participants were
voluntarily participated. The participants were divided into two groups: the athlete group
and the sedentary group. The athlete group trained on average 2 hours/day a least 4
days/week, whereas the sedentary group performed no training and had no lifestyle changes
during the study.</p><p>All the players completed an incremental treadmill test on a motorized treadmill (Cosmed,
Italy) at an incline of 10% until exhaustion. The test began at 8&#x02005;km.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and the
speed was increased by 1&#x02005;km.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every 3 minute until exhaustion. The participants
were verbally encouraged to give maximal effort during the test. Heart rate was monitored
continuously throughout the test and passive recovery session with a Polar RS400 heart rate
monitor (Polar, Finland). The heart rate data were transferred to a computer and smoothed
(average of 1 second) by the Polar Precision Performance Software (PPP4, Finland). During
the passive recovery session, the venous blood lactate level (La) was determined every 3
minutes until it reached 2&#x02005;mmol/l. The same test protocol was implemented 15 days later. The
data are reported as means and standard deviations. Differences in all test performance
variables between the athlete and sedentary groups were by nonparametric Wilcoxon signed
rank tests for independent samples. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS version
16.0, and the level of statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Descriptive characteristics of participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Athlete</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1 &#x000b1; 1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">176 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174 &#x000b1; 0.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.4 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.9 &#x000b1; 8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.5 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.8 &#x000b1; 3.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> shows the descriptive characteristics of the subjects.</p><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of running durations, recovery durations, post-recovery heart rates,

concentric and eccentric exercises. One of the main findings of the present study is that
the post-exercise La responses are significantly higher with concentric loading compared
with eccentric loadings. However, the athlete group had a significantly lower running
duration with concentric loading. Both the athlete and sedentary groups tolerated eccentric
loading better in terms of running durations and post-exercise lactic acid levels. As La and
H+ are removed from blood via oxidation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, the type of the recovery significantly affects the elimination of La
from blood<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have repored that
anaerobic energy metabolism, an important part of recovery session, is closely associated
with the elimination of La from muscle and blood after high intensity activities<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The elimination of La from muscle and blood after a maximal exercise
occurs over a period of approximately 2 hours with passive rest and over a period of 1 hour
on average with active rest<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several
studies have demonstrated that active recovery is a more effective strategy for eliminating
of La from muscle and blood and subsequent exercise performance compared with other recovery
strategies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Active recovery allows
greater reoxygenation of myoglobin and therefore oxygen delivery to the muscles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, recovery strategies are of
crucial importance for subsequent performance or loading after maximal or supramaximal
loading.</p><p>Our results showed that no significant difference was observed in an intragroup comparison
made between +10% and &#x02212;10% slopes in post-exercise recovery durations and post-recovery HR
of the athletes, while significant differences were detected in running durations and
post-exercise La values in the athlete and control groups. This may explain why the athlete
group tolerated exercise better in both loading types and they recovered more efficiently
after the end of the exercise. A previous study showed that passive recovery strategies
showed no advantages in recovery except for after high intensity exercise with a recovery
period of less than 3 minutes<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
these reasons, active resting is advisable if the recovery period is longer than 3&#x02013;4 minutes
after high intensity exercise. Moreover, many studies have shown that elimination of La and
post-exercise HR responses are correlated with aerobic capacity<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low-intensity exercise effectively increases endurance
capacity, but it does not effectively induce hypertrophy of the skeletal muscle<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, several studies have shown
that capacity of the endurance affects muscle lactate concentration and lactate elimination
after maximal loading<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study
showed that the ability to eliminate lactate increases in workout endurance exercises during
active recovery<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, endurance
exercises reduce lactate production and increase the removal of lactate<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, no differences were found between trained
and sedentary people in terms of La during passive recovery after exhaustive exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of that study are similar our
study results. It is known that aerobic training, which improves maximal oxygen uptake and
oxidative capacity, increases the activity of aerobic enzymes and mitochondrial and
capillary densities in muscles<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, is one
of the most common and popular activities among adults of all ages, decreasing the resting
HR<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and shortening the post-exercise
recovery phase<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it was
found that the recovery of HR within 30 seconds after exercise is negatively correlated with
the pre-exercise levels<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study also showed that running duration and post-recovery HR responses were
significantly higher in after concentric loading in the athlete group compared with the
sedentary group. Additionally, passive recovery had an effect on running duration and
post-recovery HR responses, and the athlete group had a significantly lower running duration
and post-recovery HR responses after eccentric loadings. This can be explained by the
positive physiological effect on athletes of training for a long time. Many activities of
daily living use muscle combinations that require the coordinated use of concentric and
eccentric contractions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is
known that long-term eccentric contractions generate acute pains and reduction in functional
strength in the sedentary individuals. Nevertheless, it can be possible to continue
exercise, especially exercise in the form of downhill running for a long time without tiring
with the contribution of gravity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. After
two different styles of aerobic loading, that is, walking and jogging for men and women on
&#x02212;5% and &#x02212;10% and +5% and +10% slopes respectively, were found lower heart rates responses
found for both groups on the 5% and &#x02212;10% slopes<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both the athlete and sedentary groups continued the running
exercise on the &#x02212;10% slopes under eccentric loading for longer and completed running with a
lower lactic acid level in our study as well.</p><p>In conclusion, athletes continued to exercises for a longer duration at a higher intensity
under both concentric and eccentric loading. It was observed that concentric exercise led to
more La accumulation and higher HR responses. Although there was no difference between the
athlete and sedentary groups as a result of eccentric and concentric loadings in terms of
recovery durations, it was observed that athletes recovered faster in terms of HR. In
addition, both the athlete and sedentary groups performed eccentric running for longer under
all loading conditions. La values were found to be lower in eccentric exercise. This fact
demonstrates that athletes tolerate eccentric exercise better due to the contribution of
gravity. The contribution of regular aerobic workouts to the recovery period was
demonstrated in this study. However, it was observed that these effects were limited with a
passive recovery period. Further studies are required to compare different recovery types
and different loading programs. The results of this study suggest that people who wish to
derive more benefits from training should pay special attention to choosing the exercise
type and should consider their health profile. In addition, eccentric exercises are more
effective for improving muscle size and gaining strength in healthy individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>: The physiological basis of physical education and athletics, 4th ed.
