A stent-graft is proved to be superior to a bare metal stent (BMS) for the construction of a TIPS. However, the clinical results of the combination application of stents and stent-grafts have not been determined. This study aimed to compare the technique of using a combination of stents and stent-grafts with using a single stent-graft to construct a TIPS.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>From April 2011 to November 2014, a total of fifty patients were randomly assigned to a stents-combination group (Group I, <italic>n</italic> = 28) or a stent-graft group (Group II, <italic>n</italic> = 22). Primary patency rates were calculated. Clinical data, including the technical success rate, bleeding control results, incidence of encephalopathy, liver function preservation, and survival rate, were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Technically, the success rate was 100% for both groups. The primary patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years for Group I were 96%, 84%, and 77%, respectively; for Group II, they were 90%, 90%, and 78%, respectively. The survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years for Group I were 79%, 74%, and 68%, respectively; for Group II, they were 82%, 82%, and 74%, respectively. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was 14.3% for Group I and 13.6% for Group II. The Child-Pugh score in Group I was stable at the end of the follow-up but had significantly increased in Group II (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;2.474, <italic>P</italic> = 0.022).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The construction of a TIPS with either the single stent-graft or BMS/stent-graft combination is effective for controlling variceal bleeding. The BMS/stent-graft combination technique is superior to the stent-graft technique in terms of hepatic function preservation indicated by the Child-Pugh score. However, considering the clinical results of the TIPS, the two techniques are comparable in their primary shunt patency, incidence of encephalopathy and patient survival during the long-term follow-up.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Esophageal and Gastric Varices</kwd><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Portal</kwd><kwd>Radiology</kwd><kwd>Interventional</kwd><kwd>Stent</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPSs) are currently used for the treatment of portal hypertension complications, especially variceal bleeding refractory to medical or endoscopic treatment. However, shunt dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), liver insufficiency, and even liver failure remain frequent complications of the procedure.</p><p>Stent-grafts have been proved to be superior to bare metal stents (BMSs) in terms of shunt patency.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Thus, the specialized stent-graft Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (W.

An excess shunt flow volume depends on the revision procedures thereafter. In fact, some of the shunt flow volumes were never revised due to deteriorated liver function.</p><p>Inspired by the shunt flow reduction procedures used in the treatment of HE,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] we tried using a BMS/stent-graft combination to create a TIPS. During a step-by-step employment of the stents, we tried to precisely cover the parenchymal segment of the shunt with a stent-graft while maintaining nutrient portal perfusion and to actively adjust the PSG by implementing various combinations of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons and stents.</p><p>Thus, the aims of the present prospective randomized control study were to investigate the probability of PSG adjustment in the step-by-step shunt creation procedures and to compare the clinical results of the stent combination technique for the creation of a TIPS with a routine stent-graft technique in the treatment of variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed as a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label, active control trial to investigate the efficacy of a stents-combination technique for the creation of a TIPS, and a classical single stent-graft (Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bard International, Inc., USA because Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is not available here) technique was the control arm. The trial was performed in our department.</p><p>Between April 2011 and November 2014, fifty consecutive cases of variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension were enrolled in the study. The ethics committee of our hospital approved the study protocol. The inclusion criteria were (1) a definite diagnosis of variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension by endoscopy, (2) medical and endoscopic treatment failure, (3) age between 18 and 75 years with written informed consent, and (4) absence of early-stage cancer or malignancy. The major exclusion criteria were (1) previous interventional or surgical shunt treatment, (2) thrombosis or cavernous transformation of the portal vein, (3) Child-Pugh's score &#x0003e;10, and (4) poor operation tolerance because of comorbidities such as heart failure.</p><p>Patients enrolled were randomized into two treatment arms, a stents-combination arm (Group I) and a stent-graft arm (Group II), according to a computer-generated randomization list made by an independent biostatistics unit before the study. The purpose of the study, enrollment and randomization procedures, and details of the TIPS operation were clearly explained to all patients before obtaining their written informed consent. The same interventional radiology team carried out all of the TIPS procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Diagnosis and definitions</title><p>In our study, a gastroscopy was used as both a first-line diagnosis measure and a temporary hemostasis measure of variceal bleeding. If a patient's condition was adequately stable, computed tomography (CT) was undertaken to clarify the status of the liver and the portal vein system to determine any possible malignancies and to exclude portal vein occlusion, cavernous transformation, extensive thrombosis, and other adverse conditions. If the condition of a patient was unstable, they were transferred directly from the emergency room to the interventional catheterization room for an emergency operation.</p><p>A confirmation diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was established by the history of liver disease, signs of portal hypertension, ultrasonography or CT exam of the liver, and deteriorated liver function.</p><p>Technical success of the shunt was defined as (1) a shunt created between the portal vein branches and inferior vena cava (IVC) with the stents in the right position and (2) PSG decreased to &#x0003c;50% of its original value.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Shunt dysfunction was suspected when the following conditions arose: (1) variceal bleeding recurrence, (2) increasing ascites, or (3) a shunt maximum flow velocity &#x0003c;50 cm/s or an absence of flow by Doppler ultrasound. A CT scan was then used to show details of the liver, portal vein, and stents. However, shunt dysfunction was finally confirmed by portography and portal venous pressure measurements that showed an obliterated shunt or shunt stenosis &#x0003e;50% and/or PSG &#x0003e;12 mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kP).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedures for the stents-combination and stent-graft groups</title><p>All TIPS procedures were performed under local anesthesia and used a transjugular approach. An RUPS-100 puncture set (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA) was used in all patients. Indirect portography was achieved by a superior mesenteric arteriography or splenography. An angiography catheter was then selectively inserted into the left hepatic artery and kept there for an indirect indication of the left portal vein, which was our preferable target vessel for puncture. Once a successful puncture of the portal vein was achieved, a pigtail angiographic catheter was introduced into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) to obtain an outline of the portal venous anatomy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>].

Today, BMS and self-expanding stent-grafts are routinely used for TIPS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft significantly improved the shunt function with decreased numbers of revisions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, shunt dysfunction is still a major drawback of TIPSs.</p><p>The cause of shunt dysfunction varies. Pseudointima hyperplasia is one of the major causes of intrastent stenosis, especially at the hepatic vein end. Several studies[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have identified the sites of stenosis after creating a TIPS with a Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft. Hepatic venous-end stenosis represents 43%&#x02013;100% of the stenosis found. Extending the TIPS stents to the hepatic vein/IVC junction is essential for reducing hepatic venous end stenosis and thereby increasing TIPS patency.</p><p>The authors suggested two improvement points for this purpose. Typically, the right portal vein was the preferred entry site. However, we suggested the opposite side as the entry site [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], i.e., the sagittal segment of the left portal vein. Anatomically, the shunt at this direction had a more straight angle than that through the right portal vein [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The second improvement was the indirect marking of the target vein. Before puncturing the left portal vein, a catheter would be selectively inserted into the left hepatic artery. Thus, an operator obtained a visible &#x0201c;target&#x0201d; of the left portal vein. The success rate of the puncture procedure could be improved to as high as 100%, which was our result for fifty patients and was consistent with other studies,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in which the right portal vein was the preferred target vein. Therefore, technically, the left (portal vein) entry was as efficient as the right entry.</p><p>The PSG control was another key point during shunt construction. The degree of PSG reduction depended largely on the choice of the stents&#x02019; diameter. Most of the centers preferred 10-mm-diameter stents to 8-mm-diameter stents.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the authors&#x02019; center, we took this as a step-by-step procedure to meet the technical requirements (PSG: 50% of the original). Thus, the 8-mm-diameter stent-grafts were used most frequently.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>The patency rate and clinical efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</title><p>Most studies assessing the patency of TIPS created with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent-grafts only evaluated the short- to intermediate-term follow-up results. The literature contains few data evaluating long-term patency beyond 2 years [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The present study provided an opportunity to evaluate the long-term patency and clinical efficacy of a TIPS created with the combined use of an ePTFE-covered stent-graft and self-expanding metal stents. The series demonstrated acceptable primary patency rates at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Compared with the statistics [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] from the TIPSs with a Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft, the primary 2-year patency rate for both groups (90% for Group I vs. 84% for Group II) were excellent and consistent with earlier studies. Three-year follow-up results of primary patency are rarely seen in the statistics. For this study, it was approximately 77% for both groups. From the perspective of shunt patency, the TIPS created with the Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft either alone or combined with a BMS when located in the left portal vein had a comparable

ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which was comparable to the rate observed in the present study. One year later, the mortality rate continued to slightly increase. It then stabilized until the end of the second year. It was approximately 20% for both groups, however, the rate of Group II was lower than that of Group I. The difference might be the result of the patients&#x02019; better liver function (as indicated by the Child-Pugh score) in Group II.</p><p>The clinical success rate for bleeding control ranges between 71% and 100%, with the majority of studies reporting a range of 90%&#x02013;100%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The present study had a comparable successful bleeding control rate during the 4-year follow-up period. The higher re-bleeding rate in Group I (10.7%) compared to Group II (4.5%) might be the result of portal venous system thrombosis. Two of the three re-bleeding patients in Group I had a mural SMV or splenic vein thrombosis before the TIPS, and the shunts were found to be occluded by thrombi when the re-bleeding occurred. The re-bleeding was successfully controlled by revising the TIPS shunt with a BMS and long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Encephalopathy and liver function</title><p>Deterioration of the liver function after TIPS has always been a major concern. Portal blood bypassing the liver is considered a trigger factor. However, some studies have reported an improvement of liver function. Bureau <italic>et al</italic>. reported a significant reduction of the Child-Pugh score 2 years after a TIPS with a Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We analyzed the patients&#x02019; Child-Pugh scores to determine the changing profile of the liver function for both groups. For Group I, the Child-Pugh score decreased slightly from 7.5 &#x000b1; 1.9 to 7.3 &#x000b1; 2.1. For Group II, it increased from 6.6 &#x000b1; 1.9 to 7.6 &#x000b1; 2.0. Based on the results of the paired <italic>t</italic>-test, the change was significant for Group II but not for Group I. When the Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft alone was positioned between the left portal vein and IVC, as done in Group II, almost all of the flushing portal blood for the left hepatic lobe was diverted to the IVC compared with Group I, in which only a short-length Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was adopted to cover the parenchymal section of the shunt to maintain the patency of the portal vein branches. This difference might account for the liver function deterioration observed in Group II.</p><p>HE is another major concern for complications after a TIPS. The incidence of <italic>de novo</italic> or worsening of existing HE can occur in approximately 30% of patients, regardless of whether the Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft or BMS is used.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In contrast, we found a relatively low incidence in this series: 14.3% for Group I and 13.6% for Group II. All of the HE patients were controlled by conservative measures, except for necessary revisions of the shunts. We attributed this to several factors. First, the quality control idea for the PSG adjustment during the construction of the TIPS. Second, we employed stent-grafts of 8 mm in diameter for most of the patients. The limited but required (PSG: 50% of original) fulfilled portal blood bypassing contributed to decreasing the incidence of encephalopathy. Finally, all of our patients were asked to keep a strict, low-protein diet after the operation for as long as 3 months.</p><p>The principal weakness of this study was the limited number of cases enrolled and the limited indications (only bleeding patients were indicated) of TIPS. Therefore, the results of the study were only applicable for patients with upper digestive bleeding and not for all TIPS patients, especially not those with refractory ascites. The 4-year follow-up period was longer than that used in most previous studies [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], however, it should be extended to observe longer-term results. Fortunately, the study was prospective and further results could be reported later following ongoing observation. Another obvious weakness was the absence of a control group in which TIPS was constructed with the specialized Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft, which is currently widely used. This weakness was difficult to overcome because the Viatorr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft is not commercially available in China.</p><p>In conclusion, this prospective controlled study suggested the following: (1) constructing the TIPS through the left entry into the portal vein with either single stent-graft or stents-combination technique was effective for the control of variceal bleeding; (2) the stents-combination technique was comparable to a single Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> stent-graft technique in terms of the shunt patency, incidence of HE, and patient survival rate; (3) the stents-combination technique was superior to the Fluency<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> alone in liver function preservation, as indicated by the Child-Pugh score; and (4) the 50% reduction of the PSG as the technical requirement was effective for bleeding control and with an acceptable lower HE incidence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
