The analgesic method has to be with high efficacy, low side effects, and easy administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The control of the pain during the surgery (intraoperative) and after it (postoperative) is called preventive analgesia, which results in accelerated recovery and improvement in the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Tonsillectomy is one of the painful operations, which is common in children and it is necessary to apply an analgesic drug to prevent this pain and the complications due to it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Opioids including morphine are sometimes used and have high efficacy to suppress post-tonsillectomy pain, but the important side effects, especially respiratory depression, have limited use of them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), including diclofenac, are also used as preventive analgesia, but they increase the risk of site-bleeding after tonsillectomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Acetaminophen is another analgesic drug that is used commonly in oral and rectal form, during and after tonsillectomy. Nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia after tonsillectomy have limited oral intake of acetaminophen, so rectal administration is the better route.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (15 mg / kg) was compared with the rectal form (40 mg / kg) in pediatric adenotonsillectomy and the rectal form showed better analgesic effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is a drug to induce anesthesia, and has also been used as a postoperative analgesic in surgeries like pediatric tonsillectomy, in several studies. IV and intra-muscular (i.m.) ketamine has compared with morphine and placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Also the preventive analgesic effect of the peritonsillar administration of ketamine has been demonstrated in some studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Rectal ketamine also has analgesic efficacy in treating nociceptive and neuropathic pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Also some studies have been established to try rectal ketamine as a premedication before surgeries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>However, there is not enough information to prove the hypothesized preventive effect of rectal ketamine for painful surgeries like tonsillectomy in children and there is no study to compare this effect with a routine analgesic like rectal acetaminophen. Thus, we designed this study to find out the preventive analgesic effect of rectal ketamine and compare it with rectal acetaminophen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After study approval by the Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 70 patients were selected to participate in this randomized, single-blinded comparative trial. On account of the difference in administration between rectal ketamine (needle removed syringe) and rectal acetaminophen (suppository form), the anesthesiologist was aware of the applied drug, but the person who recorded the data was unaware of it (blinded).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were children without neurological, renal, psychiatric or hepatic disease, 5 &#x02013; 15 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, and undergoing elective tonsillectomy. Patients with neurological, renal, psychiatric or hepatic disease, with history of allergy to any of the study drugs and usage of other analgesics were excluded from the study.</p><p>Informed consents were obtained from the parents before the study and they were randomly divided into two groups by selection of a sealed envelope with the drug code inside. One group received ketamine rectally (2 mg/kg) by syringe with the needle removed and lubricated, at the end of the surgery (even we were allowed to use up to 10 mg / kg ketamine rectally to obtain just analgesia without anesthesia).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The other group received acetaminophen rectally (20 mg / kg), in suppository form, at the end of the surgery (the applied dose of rectal acetaminophen was safe and without side effects).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The patients were fasted for eight hours before surgery; anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental (5 mg / kg), atracurium (0.6 mg / kg), and fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g / kg) and maintained with an equivalent of 1 MAC of isoflurane, a gas mixture of nitrous oxide (50%) &#x02013; oxygen (50%), and morphine 0.1 mg / kg. The patients underwent basic monitoring including, echocardiogram (ECG), Pulse oximetry, and End tidal CO2 continuously during the surgery and blood pressure and pulse rate every five minutes for 15 minutes, and every 15 minutes till the end of operation.</p><p>At the end of surgery, the anesthesiologist applied the drug for each patient and the children were transferred to Recovery Room and discharged from the Recovery Room to the ward, based on the Aldrete scale which scored the circulation, respiration, consciousness, and activity of the patient. A person, who was unaware about the used drug, recorded the information in a data form. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) was the pain score assessed in the study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], and was recorded 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the operation in the Recovery Room and one, six, 12, and 24 hours after transferring the patient to the ward. A patient with CHEOPS &#x02265; 11 was given morphine 0.1 mg / kg and excluded from study.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>CHEOPS pain score (range 4 &#x02013; 13)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-150-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The vital signs of the patients were recorded 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the operation in the Recovery Room and six, 12, and 18 hours after transferring them to the ward.</p><p>The Wilson sedation score was used to estimate and compare the level of consciousness between the two groups[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], and recorded 15, 30, and 60 minutes and six, 12, and 24 hours after the operation.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Wilson sedation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-150-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The time between discontinuation of nitrous oxide and extubation (extubation time), the time from tonsillectomy position until bleeding control (operation time), and the time the patient stayed in Recovery until discharge, based on the Aldrete score (time to recovery stay), were recorded.</p><p>Also side effects in the groups were evaluated, including, vomiting, hallucinations, dreams, disorientation, and nystagmus.</p><p>The sample size of 70 patients, was estimated based on 80% power, to detect a difference of at least 1 score between two groups with &#x003b1;-value = 0.05.

No hallucinations or dreams were reported at all. Some of the patients, only in the ketamine group, had nystagmus (14.2 %), which was absolutely significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results showed that rectal ketamine reduced pain more effectively when compared with rectal acetaminophen in the first hours after surgery (one and two hours) and had an equivalent analgesic potential with acetaminophen at other times, for 24 hours (this might be because of the short half life of rectal ketamine).</p><p>Also the acetaminophen group had longer recovery station, which could be because of the higher pain scores in first hours after surgery.</p><p>Both groups had equivalent sedation scores for 24 hours and we could compare the CHEOPS based on it. Some parameters in the CHEOPS were related to the sedation score, so we needed to compare the CHEOPS in two groups with the equivalent level of consciousness.</p><p>Rectal administration of course was a suitable route of use, not invasive and was just done with a needle removed syringe. We used a sub-anesthetic dose of rectal ketamine (2 mg / kg). We were even allowed to use up to 10 mg / kg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Some studies were done to detect this effect in tonsillectomy, which was common and painful in children, to evaluate if we could replace other analgesics with ketamine.</p><p>In one study that was done by R.J. Marcus <italic>et al</italic>., i.m. ketamine was compared with i.m. Morphine (0.1 &#x02013; 015mg / kg) and the analgesic effect was comparable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] A similar study done by Spinal <italic>et al</italic>., and similar results were concluded.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Also i.m. ketamine (0.1 mg / kg) was compared with placebo in tonsillectomy, and the results demonstrated the pain relief effects of i.m. ketamine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Heidari <italic>et al</italic> tried oral ketamine and compared it with placebo in one study and reported the analgesic effect of the oral form of this drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] In another study i.v. ketamine had significant analgesic effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>The studies were usually performed based on oral, peritonsillar, i.v., and i.m. ketamine for postoperative analgesic effects, but there was no study that proved ketamine to be a postoperative analgesic when it was administered rectally, although rectal ketamine was useful in neuropathic pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Our study demonstrated the fact that rectal ketamine had an analgesic effect even for postoperative pain. On the other hand, in the studies with a control group, we avoided an analgesic in the patient that felt pain, so it was better to compare the analgesic with another one.</p><p>The analgesic effect of ketamine is due to some mechanisms. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, and is known for analgesia in subanesthetic doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] NMDA receptors are in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and are involved in central sensitization to painful stimulation and ketamine reduces pain with the blockage of these receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The blockage of sodium and potassium channels in the peripheral nerves is another mechanism that may also be effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Serious side effects like Hallucinations and Dreams were not seen in the 2 mg / kg use of rectal ketamine, and other side effects like vomiting and bleeding were not significant and were equivalent in the two groups. Nystagmus was not severe and no other complications like vertigo were seen, so it was not an important point.</p><p>Ketamine has sympathetic activation potential, because of the inhibition of epinephrine reuptake, so the increasing of the blood pressure and pulse rate can be seen in ketamine usage. Acetaminophen has no significant effect on the patient's vital signs in the analgesic doses. The increase in systolic blood pressure, which has been reported in the ketamine group in comparison with the acetaminophen group, is not at a risk level to worry us, so we can forget about the hemodynamic effects of using rectal ketamine at 2 mg / kg.</p><p>Finally, we conclude by stating that rectal ketamine can be useful for pain relief in pediatric tonsillectomy, in comparison with acetaminophen, and it can be an alternative analgesic drug with acetaminophen in tonsillectomy, particularly in the first hours after the operation. In our study we have not recorded or compared anti-emetic and rescue analgesic drug doses or parent satisfaction. Higher doses of rectal ketamine can be tried in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn
