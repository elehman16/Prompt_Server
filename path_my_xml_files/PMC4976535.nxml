Cutaneous infections, allergic reactions, mechanical trauma, drug reactions, phototoxic reactions and inflammatory diseases such as lichen planus, lupus erythematous and atopic dermatotis all may cause this extra deposition of melanin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>PIH may also occur following application of the electromagnetic devices such as ultrasounds, radiofrequency devices, laser, light emitting diods, visible light and even microdermabrasion.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The most common causes of the burning are exposure to fire flame or boiling water.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The type and severity of burning are dependent on the depth and extend of the skin involvement. Most of the burn injuries are superficial.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Burn injuries are classified into six groups according to their injury mechanisms including; boiling water burn, contact burning, fire burning, chemical burning, electrical and radiation burning.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Dyspigmentary changes commonly occur following burn injuries. The hypopigmentation occurs because of melanin loss in the basal cell layer and thickening of the skin layers. Hyperpigmentation is due to melanocyte injury.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Different topical agents including hydroquinone, kojic acid, arbutin, azelaic acid and other medications have been used for treatment of the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Wai Sun <italic>et al</italic>. have achieved good clinical response following use of a topical combination of the hydroquinone, steroid and tretinoin for treatment of the post-burn hyperpigmentation in the face area.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Topical agents used for hyperpigmentation are classified into two groups of the phenoloc and non-phenolic. Hydroquinin is a phenolic group agent that is regarded as gold standard treatment for hyperpigmentation in the last 50 years. It blocks tyrosinase enzyme and the conversion of DOPA to melanin. Also, melanin and melanocyte destruction and prevention of the RNA and DNA synthesis are the possible mechanisms of this medication.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Antioxidants such as vitamin C and penetration enhancing agents such as tretinoin are usually added to hydroquinone for better efficacy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] That is why we used modified Kligman formula that included hydroquinone, vitamin c, tretinoin and triamcinolon in both groups of treatment.</p><p>Different modalities including topical agents, lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) are suggested for treatment of the post-burn PIH. There is only one study that evaluated efficacy of IPL in the treatment of the post-burn hyperpigmentation as a non-controlled case series. Over 78% of the patients showed more than 50% clinical clearance and nearly 32% of the patients were able to achieve more than 75% clearing with one patient had 100% clearing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In the current study we evaluated the efficacy of IPL plus modified Kligman formula (MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM) versus modified kligman formula alone in the treatment of the post-burn PIH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized, non-blinded clinical trial that was performed in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Skin Diseases and Leishmaniasis Research Center clinics in 2013-2014 (Research no: 391067) The ethical committee clearance and informed consent was achieved. All of the selected patients had history of burning with its resulting PIP. All of the selected patients were female and only patients who were older than 5 years old were recruited. The lesions were randomized to receive MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM or IPL + MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM using simple randomization method.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included history of sensitivity to any MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM components, pregnancy, lactation, and aggravation of the lesion after MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM or IPL treatment, history of skin cancer or connective tissue disorder and non-compliance of the patients for treatment.</p><p>The interval between burning and PIP should be at least 3 months. A total of 53 patches of PIP were selected in the 14 patients. If there were two similar patches with the same color and same location, each of them were randomized to receive modified Kligman&#x02019;s cream (MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM) or MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM + IPL and if not, half part of the patch was treated with MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM and other part was treated with or MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM + IPL.</p><p>The MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM was provided by pharmacist and included the combination of 5% hydroquinone, 3% of vitamin C, 0.025% of tretinoin, and 0.01% of triamcinolon in the cold cream base.</p><p>The patients were recommended to apply a small amount of MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM their lesions at night (for 12 h) as all of the patch would be covered with a thin layer of the cream and to apply sun screen cream with SPF of 55, three times a day.</p><p>For IPL, Smooth Cool Device (Jeisys company), and cut-off filter of 590 nm or 640 nm (according to skin type) with contact cooling temperature of &#x02212;5&#x000b0; of centigrade was used.

Patients were treated with an energy fluence of 28-46 J/cm (2), pulse width of 1.7-4 milliseconds, double pulse mode, and a delay of 15-40 milliseconds. Over 78% of the patients showed more than 50% clinical clearance and nearly 32% of the patients were able to achieve more than 75% clearing. Although two patients had no clinical response, one patient had 100% clearing. Three patients developed blisters and one patient had erythema that all resolved within 1 week without leaving permanent marks.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, in this study, in contrary of the current study, no bleaching agent was used.
