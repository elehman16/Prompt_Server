Thus, reduced 5-HT availability or turnover has been associated with impaired long-term memory but improved focused attention (Booij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>; Sobczak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2002b</xref>); by contrast, increased 5-HT release, for example, after loading with high doses of the precursor amino acid <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan (TRP) can result in reduced vigilance (Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>; Silber and Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>).</p><p>These effects of reduced 5-HT function are thought to underlie changes in emotional processing and cognitions associated with depression, anxiety and poor stress coping (Robinson and Sahakian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>); thus, antidepressants may exert their beneficial effects by normalising deficits in central 5-HT transmission, although the precise mechanism for this remains elusive (Cowen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>).</p><p>The strongest evidence for a role for functional 5-HT deficits in depression arises from studies using amino acid loads devoid of the precursor amino acid TRP to suppress 5-HT synthesis (acute TRP depletion (ATD)) (Young <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>; Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1985</xref>). This results in a substantial (e.g. &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;%) drop in plasma TRP within 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h, and can induce dysphoric mood, especially in recovered depressives or those genetically at risk (Silber and Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>). Essentially, reducing TRP access to the brain in this way tends to mimic the cognitive biases seen in depressed populations, such as impaired memory for, or attention to, positive vs. negative information (Mathews and MacLeod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Thus, recognition of emotions in faces can be affected by ATD: for example, recognition of fear was reduced in women (Harmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). Furthermore, using asymmetry of the frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum, an indicator of risk of depression and poor psychological wellbeing, Allen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>) showed that the extent to which ATD altered the EEG asymmetry in at-risk and healthy subjects predicted occurrence of depression in the following 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Conversely, an important question is whether similar behaviours can be improved by increasing/facilitating entry of TRP into the brain and thus elevating 5-HT synthesis. Indeed, there has been long-standing clinical and research interest on effects of oral or intravenous dosing with TRP (Fernstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). One particularly relevant finding has been the induction of a positive bias in processing of emotional faces in women (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). However, a complication of oral TRP as the free amino acid is that it increases release of several hormones including growth hormone, cortisol and prolactin (the latter thought to indicate increased central serotonin&#x02014;and dopamine&#x02014;activity) (Porter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>).</p><p>It has long been recognised that serotonin synthesis in the brain can be affected by dietary manipulations that change availability of TRP to the brain. The rationale for interest in dietary manipulation of serotonin arises from the following facts: (i) TRP is an essential amino acid that has to be obtained from the diet and cannot itself be synthesised in the body; (ii) in the synthesis of 5-HT, the rate-limiting enzyme step involves conversion of TRP to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by TRP hydroxylase, prior to synthesis of serotonin; and (iii) TRP hydroxylase is not fully saturated by substrate, and so synthesis is sensitive to substrate availability, i.e. the brain level of TRP. Thus, increasing or decreasing TRP ingestion could in principle raise or lower 5-HT synthesis. However, the situation is more complex because of a specific transport system through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and liver metabolism. To enter the brain across the BBB, TRP has to compete for uptake not only against other amino acids, in particular a group known as the large neutral amino acids (LNAA), especially the branched chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, but also phenylalanine and tyrosine (the precursors for catecholamine transmitter synthesis). For this reason, the ratio of plasma or serum-free TRP/LNAA is typically thought to be the best predictor of uptake of TRP into the brain. TRP is the scarcest amino acid in most dietary protein, so eating a protein-rich meal normally reduces this ratio: conversely, eating a high-carbohydrate, low-protein meal will raise the ratio, particularly as the rise in insulin leads to peripheral tissue uptake of the competing LNAA (Fernstrom and Fernstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1995</xref>).</p><p>This mechanism has been suggested to underlie dietary effects on mood and performance, such as calming after high-carbohydrate meals vs. arousal after protein-rich meals (Gibson and Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>; Hoyland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). More specifically, there is evidence that individuals with inherently insufficient 5-HT activity, who may be prone to neuroticism or depression, may be most likely to benefit, in mood and cognition, from a 5-HT-enhancing high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, a method has been developed to enhance TRP availability to the brain, and so potentially 5-HT function, by administering TRP-rich dietary proteins: the most published example is the whey protein &#x003b1;-lactalbumin. The effects of this protein are usually compared with responses after another protein, typically casein hydrolysate (another milk protein), which has lower levels of TRP but greater amounts of the competing LNAA. In addition, the proteins have typically (though not always) been given on two occasions, as drink supplements to high-carbohydrate meals (Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b1;-Lactalbumin has been shown to enhance (or correct) serotonin function (indexed by prolactin release) and cognition, and to reduce cortisol release, in stress-prone (more anxious) participants (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). Another &#x02018;vulnerable&#x02019; group investigated is women suffering from premenstrual syndrome, in whom memory may be impaired premenstrually. &#x003b1;-Lactalbumin attenuated deficits in delayed memory for abstract patterns in this group (Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>) , and in recovered depressives and healthy subjects (Booij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). There are also reports of increased perception of emotional faces with TRP-rich protein in women (Attenburrow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>): however, so far, effects on emotional face processing appear to be weaker or less specific than dosing with TRP alone (Scrutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>).</p><p>LumiVida&#x02122;, a product developed by DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., is based on a similar premise, but is an egg-white protein hydrolysate formulation that contains fewer competing LNAAs. LumiVida&#x02122; has recently been shown to be more effective in raising plasma TRP/LNAA ratios than either &#x003b1;-lactalbumin or TRP alone (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Mitchell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>). There is preliminary evidence that this high (12&#x000a0;g) dose of LumiVida&#x02122; may be effective in improving mood (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>) and in enhancing psychomotor and vigilance performance, at least in individuals more resilient to stress (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>).</p><p>This report concerns the acute effects of two relatively low doses of LumiVida&#x02122; on emotional and cognitive function in healthy middle-aged women. In selecting the doses, the intention was to detect the smallest efficacious doses for modification of plasma TRP/LNAA ratio and behaviour. Women were chosen because (a) they are more prone to suffer from anxiety and depression over their lifetime than men and (b) there is evidence that women may be more sensitive to behavioural effects of 5-HT manipulations (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). Older women were also more likely to have relatively stable sex hormone levels, thus avoiding another potential confound (Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>). The timing of testing (1 to 3&#x000a0;h after the treatment drink) was intended to follow peak increases in plasma TRP/LNAA ratio (Collins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; Fernstrom and Fernstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1995</xref>), with the expectation of maximising any impact of early increases in 5-HT synthesis and release on outcome measures.</p><p>Based on the findings described above, it was hypothesised that (a) acute treatment with LumiVida&#x02122; would cause dose-dependent increases in plasma TRP levels and TRP/LNAA ratio; (b) LumiVida&#x02122; would improve mood, psychological wellbeing and emotional processing, in line with effects seen with enhancement of serotonin function, including reducing negative bias in face recognition and perception of emotional stimuli; and (c) LumiVida&#x02122; would improve performance, in a dose-dependent manner, on tests of hand-eye coordination, verbal memory, working memory, sustained attention and driver hazard perception. Importantly, this range of tests also allows the study to determine whether these treatments produced any negative effects, such as reductions in cognitive function or sedation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study was double-blind, randomised and controlled with treatment between subjects. Sixty women were randomised to control (casein hydrolysate, 3.11&#x000a0;g), LumiVida&#x02122; (egg-white protein hydrolysate, 2&#x000a0;g) or LumiVida&#x02122; (4&#x000a0;g). Prior to any testing, randomisation was stratified within three age subgroups (using Excel) to ensure an even spread of ages across treatment groups. Three participants failed to begin the study after randomisation (personal reasons). The final sample sizes were: control (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19; 2&#x000a0;g (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20); 4&#x000a0;g (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21). Each participant received either a single dose of the egg-white protein hydrolysate supplement, or casein hydrolysate as a protein control, on the treatment test day. The sample sizes were chosen to be towards the larger end of the range used in previously published studies of effects of TRP-rich proteins on amino acids, cognition and/or emotion, i.e. from <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14 to <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23 per group (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Merens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>; Scrutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). Cognitive and emotional function, mood and physical sensations were assessed at baseline (screening day) and between 60 and 180&#x000a0;min after supplement consumption on the test day. The between-subjects design reduces practice effects as well as order effects that may result from differential tolerance, etc., when using within-subject designs in multiple dose treatment studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment</title><sec id="d30e491"><title>Active condition</title><p>LumiVida&#x02122; (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) is a hydrolysed, enzymatic digest of a dietary egg-white protein manufactured by using a proprietary mix of enzymes from a dietary source to provide a high-quality source of peptides. LumiVida&#x02122; contains a guaranteed minimum quantity of bioactive TRP-containing peptides. The molar ratio of these TRP peptides to peptides containing the LNAAs valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine is approximately 0.2. LumiVida&#x02122; is intended for use in food products such as beverages, bars, yoghurt drinks, etc., and these doses were considered (at the time) to be (a) sufficiently active on TRP entry to the brain (b) at a commercially viable level. In this study, LumiVida&#x02122; was taken as a citrus-flavoured non-nutritively (Acesulfame) sweetened beverage; 2 and 4&#x000a0;g of LumiVida&#x02122; were used, which contain approximately 0.13 and 0.27&#x000a0;g TRP, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="d30e496"><title>Placebo condition</title><p>Casein hydrolysate (3.11&#x000a0;g; primary milk protein; DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) was used to provide an intermediate amount of energy and total protein, in the placebo beverage, relative to the active treatments.

Double-blind randomisation was carried out by means of a label code associated with a specific participant ID number, whose meaning was known only to the supplier. Participants were allocated randomly to these numbers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 60 women, aged 45 to 65, physically and mentally healthy, as defined by a brief medical history check (not concurrently receiving medical/pharmacological treatment except mild painkillers), free of gastrointestinal complaints, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, not in pain and not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (no treatment for depression or anxiety and other psychiatric disorders). Body mass index was required to be above 18 and below 35.</p><p>In addition, it was necessary to establish menstrual status prior to arranging the first (baseline) visit, as any premenopausal participants needed to be tested in the follicular phase (within 2&#x000a0;weeks of the start of menstrual bleeding). Menstrual status was established by questionnaire once verbal consent was established.</p><p>Recruitment was via notices in local newspaper/magazines, women&#x02019;s organisations, campus posters, e-mail announcements and word of mouth (not family members). A participant information sheet was sent or read out to participants initially expressing interest, and if this seemed acceptable (verbal consent), they were invited for a screening interview and baseline test morning. The following restrictions applied: (i) No alcohol on the day before testing (including baseline day), (ii) usual caffeinated drink (if taken) to be drunk before 0800&#x000a0;hours on each test day and (iii) no other food or drink except water to be taken from 2200&#x000a0;hours the previous evening, until after testing has ended.</p><p>The study was approved by the University Ethics Committee of the University of Roehampton, in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

At the screening interview, the information about the study was repeated, and they were asked to read and sign the consent form, a copy of which they kept. Then, the brief health history and demographic information was checked, which was followed by measurements of their height and weight. Next, the participant was offered water to drink, and then asked to complete a series of 28 mental and physical sensation ratings on a computer screen. This computer-based mental and physical sensations scale (MAPSS) was run on E-Prime (v.2, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., PA, USA), questions were randomly sequenced and the scale ranged from 1 = 'Not at all' to 9 = 'Extremely'. This test was repeated once again at the end of all testing. MAPSS has been found to be sensitive to mood changes following psycho-pharmacological manipulations (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cognitive test battery schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th>Task</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>09:20</td><td>Mental and physical sensations scale (MAPSS)</td></tr><tr><td>09:25</td><td>National adult reading test (or drink on treatment test day)</td></tr><tr><td>09:30</td><td>Rest 1&#x000a0;h</td></tr><tr><td>10:30</td><td>Simple reaction time</td></tr><tr><td>10:40</td><td>Rotary pursuit task</td></tr><tr><td>10:55</td><td>Rest (or second blood sample of Day 2)</td></tr><tr><td>11:10</td><td>Verbal recognition memory (VRM); immediate recall/recognition</td></tr><tr><td>11:15</td><td>Match to sample (MTS): colour patterns for visual matching, attention, motor skill and reaction times</td></tr><tr><td>11:20</td><td>Rest</td></tr><tr><td>11:35</td><td>VRM: free delayed recall: paper test</td></tr><tr><td>11:40</td><td>Rapid visual processing (RVP): number sequence pattern detection</td></tr><tr><td>11:50</td><td>VRM: delayed recognition</td></tr><tr><td>11:55</td><td>Affective go/no-go (AGN): positive/negative/neutral target words</td></tr><tr><td>12:15</td><td>Emotional facial expression task: perception of angry, fearful, sad, surprised, disgusted and happy expressions</td></tr><tr><td>12:25</td><td>Rest</td></tr><tr><td>12:30</td><td>Driving hazard perception task</td></tr><tr><td>12:50</td><td>MAPSS</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Participants then completed the national adult reading test (NART; 2nd edition, Windsor NFER-Nelson, 1991), which provides a measure of stable verbal IQ and was only given on the baseline test day. This involves participants reading aloud a series of 50 words, presented one by one on cards: they were scored for number of errors in pronunciation. After a rest of approximately 1&#x000a0;h, the baseline set of cognitive tests started at 1030&#x000a0;hours, in line with the subsequent test day, and lasted 2&#x000a0;h and 20&#x000a0;min including breaks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Treatment test session</title><p>As before, participants arrived in the laboratory for 0830&#x02013;0850&#x000a0;hours and were asked about their current health, in case any adverse events needed to be noted, and also whether they experienced any stress so far that morning. The test schedule followed that of the baseline day, except that (i) two blood samples were drawn during the morning using a butterfly needle inserted in a vein in the antecubital fossa of the forearm and (ii) the freshly prepared experimental drink was given immediately after the first MAPSS, followed by a 1-h rest before cognitive testing began. Just prior to the first test (reaction time), a buccal (cheek) cell swab was taken, for later DNA assay (data not presented here). The first blood sample in the morning was drawn in a seated position prior to the initial MAPSS ratings, while the second sample was drawn 90&#x000a0;min later at the time of expected peak changes in plasma TRP and TRP/LNAA levels (Mitchell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>), following completion of the rotary pursuit task but before starting the critical memory tests. This blood sample was taken in order to verify that the LumiVida&#x02122; treatment raised the plasma TRP/LNAA amino acid ratio in the expected dose-dependent manner, compared with the control. The blood (6&#x000a0;ml) was collected in a Vacutainer&#x02122; lithium-heparin tube, shaken, stored on ice and processed within 2&#x000a0;h in the Clinical Laboratory at the University of Roehampton (see &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Blood assays</xref>&#x02019; below).

The test consists of several trial blocks, each of which presents a series of words from two of three different affective categories: positive (for example, joyful), negative (for example, hopeless) and neutral (for example, element). The participant is given a target category and is asked to press the response pad only when they see a word matching this category. Some pairs of trials maintain the same target type (non-shift; easier), whereas others change the target type (shift; harder). Outcomes are category-specific reaction times, their differences and accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Facial emotion recognition task</title><p>This task assesses subjective perception of positive and negative social stimuli, i.e. facial expressions of six basic emotions, fear, anger, sadness, happiness, surprise and disgust. The version used here is adapted from Richards et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>). The task is run on a computer using E-Prime (v.2, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., PA, USA) and presents participants with black and white images of a male face, front on, one face at a time (from the Ekman face set, Ekman and Friesen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1978</xref>). The expressions on the face are arrayed in blends of two emotions varying in ratios of 10&#x000a0;%:90&#x000a0;%, 30&#x000a0;%:70&#x000a0;%, 50&#x000a0;%:50&#x000a0;%, 70&#x000a0;%:30&#x000a0;% and 90&#x000a0;%:10&#x000a0;%. Participants are asked to rate each face for the intensity of one of the emotions, on a 9-point scale from 1 = &#x02018;not at all (emotion)&#x02019; to 9 = &#x02018;very (emotion)&#x02019;. Each emotion is blended separately with two others in this way, thus providing an average rating of perceived emotional intensity over ten faces of varying blends. However, the rated response to the two 50&#x000a0;% blends for each emotion (e.g. fear with sadness and surprise) should provide the most reliable measure of perceptual bias, so these were analysed separately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blood assays</title><p>Blood samples were centrifuged in Vacutainer&#x02122; lithium-heparin tubes at 4,000&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The amino acid assays were carried out by DSM Food Specialties B.V., Delft, NL. Plasma amino acid analysis was conducted with HPLC via a 2- to 3-mm Bischof Spherisorb ODS II column. The plasma TRP ratio was calculated by dividing the plasma TRP concentration by the sum of the other LNAA, i.e. valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine.

This was achieved using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including Day 1 performance as a covariate. In addition, for the reading-dependent AGN test, errors on the NART (a measure of English verbal IQ) were included as a covariate. This variable did not differ by treatment group (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) but could still contribute to variance in performance because NART errors correlate positively with increased latency to respond and more omission errors in this task (e.g. Spearman&#x02019;s rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30&#x02013;0.50). These ANCOVAs also included planned contrasts between each LumiVida&#x02122; dose group and the control group (simple contrasts). Baseline means were compared by one-way ANOVAs or Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis tests for non-parametric data. Where data were skewed greater than &#x000b1;1, each variable was transformed appropriately, e.g. positive skew reduced by natural log (Ln) transformation, before analysis. Significance level (alpha) was taken as 0.05: where results were predicted by directional hypotheses, one-tailed probability (<italic>p</italic>) levels are reported; otherwise, two-tailed levels are given. Significance of multiple pairwise comparisons within a particular dependent variable was adjusted by Bonferroni correction or by use of Dunnett&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. Otherwise, alpha was not adjusted for numbers of tests of a priori hypotheses across multiple variables, as that would increase the risk of Type II errors, particularly for relatively small sample sizes.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Age, NART errors, neuroticism and aggression by treatment group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Treatment group</th><th>Number</th><th>Age (years) mean (SD)</th><th>NART errors mean (SD)</th><th>Neuroticism mean (SD)</th><th>Aggression mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Control</td><td>19</td><td char="(" align="char">55.7 (6.1)</td><td char="(" align="char">9.3 (4.7)</td><td char="(" align="char">11.4 (8.5)</td><td char="(" align="char">15.7 (6.3)</td></tr><tr><td>2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;</td><td>20</td><td char="(" align="char">54.6 (5.5)</td><td char="(" align="char">8.4 (5.3)</td><td char="(" align="char">6.3* (4.5)</td><td char="(" align="char">11.8* (2.7)</td></tr><tr><td>4&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;</td><td>21</td><td char="(" align="char">54.7 (6.9)</td><td char="(" align="char">11.5 (6.1)</td><td char="(" align="char">8.1 (5.5)</td><td char="(" align="char">15.5 (6.1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, mean different from control; Dunnett&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> for multiple comparison to the control group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Sixty women aged 45&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years completed the study, 19 receiving the control treatment, 20 receiving 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122; and 21 receiving 4&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;.

The minor differences were that (a) two items, &#x02018;fatigued&#x02019; and &#x02018;headaches&#x02019;, loaded weakly and negatively on the wellbeing factor (&#x02212;0.50 and &#x02212;0.57, respectively) rather than on the fatigue factor, while &#x02018;strange&#x02019; did not load above 0.50 on any factor. (b) The agitation factor had a slightly higher Eigen value than the anxiety factor, but the structures were the same. Thus, it seems unlikely that treatment considerations in later mood measures had significantly distorted the factor loadings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Effects on wellbeing</title><p>Wellbeing raw scores were normally distributed and did not require transformation.

The mean changes were 25 and 48&#x000a0;% above baseline, respectively. These changes compare well with levels achieved by studies using TRP-rich &#x003b1;-lactalbumin (Booij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Merens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>), and also with pharmacokinetic data for 4&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122; (Mitchell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>), and would be expected to raise synthesis of serotonin in the brain; however, in a previous report concerning LumiVida&#x02122;, TRP levels and mood, the dose that produced a substantial and lasting improvement in mood was at least 5-fold greater (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). It is also worth noting that the absolute doses of TRP (0.08&#x02013;0.16&#x000a0;g) are considerably smaller than typically used in studies assessing effects of TRP alone (e.g. 0.5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;g). Moreover, given that equivalent increases in TRP/LNAA after &#x003b1;-lactalbumin are seen at doses containing about 0.5&#x000a0;g TRP, this suggests that the LumiVida&#x02122; peptide preparation is substantially more efficient in raising TRP/LNAA than &#x003b1;-lactalbumin; the TRP/LNAA content ratio is at least double that in &#x003b1;-lactalbumin, though it should be considered that LumiVida&#x02122; might also provoke a greater insulin response, thereby increasing peripheral uptake of competing LNAAs, particularly the branched chain amino acids.</p><p>The control drink, containing 3.11&#x000a0;g casein hydrolysate, slightly, but significantly, reduced TRP/LNAA relative to baseline (9&#x000a0;%): this is to be expected given the increase in LNAA that would result from casein hydrolysate intake, although there was no fasting comparison group in this study to rule out a decline due to circadian changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Mental and physical sensations</title><p>Effects on mood, arousal and other physical sensations were assessed using ratings made on a computer (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>), at baseline and after performance testing. Treatment effects were found for the two dominant components, labelled wellbeing and fatigue, following principal components analysis.</p><p>Wellbeing tended to decline by the end of the testing period. This decline was prevented specifically by 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;, though not by 4&#x000a0;g. One explanation for this &#x02018;inverted-U&#x02019; dose&#x02013;response effect could be that the higher dose produced other effects that began to counteract any improvement in wellbeing. In this respect, it is therefore interesting that the effect on fatigue was also strongest for the lower dose: 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122; prevented any increase in fatigue after testing, which was clearly apparent for the control group, whereas 4&#x000a0;g had an intermediate effect. One study using &#x003b1;-lactalbumin to raise TRP availability to the brain reported increased nausea at a dose that produced less than double the TRP/LNAA ratio to that seen here (Scrutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). Inverted-U-shaped responses have been reported in the literature after TRP supplementation: &#x003b1;-lactalbumin supplementation trials that increased plasma TRP/LNAA to 21&#x02013;67&#x000a0;% did not have an effect on mood (Booij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Merens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>; Scrutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). In a recent study comparing a higher dose of egg-white protein hydrolysate (containing 0.8&#x000a0;g TRP) against casein (providing a 10-fold difference in TRP/LNAA content&#x02014;not plasma&#x02014;ratio), the egg-white protein hydrolysate induced an increase in feelings of vigour, whereas this positive mood state declined after casein (Firk and Markus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). Conversely, a 15-fold increase in TRP/LNAA achieved after an intravenous injection of 7&#x000a0;g pure TRP was shown to impair mood and cognition (Sobczak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>). Thus, there may be an inverted U-shaped relationship between TRP/LNAA ratios and mood in healthy subjects.</p><p>Nevertheless, adverse effects of TRP loading are more usually seen at much higher doses (Silber and Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>), and there is a previous report that an acute 12&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122; dose improves mood (Markus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). Even so, it should be noted that, in that study, participants were not engaged in stressful performance testing, which itself can affect mood as well as potentially the serotonin system (Gibson and Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>); indeed, stress is known to upregulate the enzymes TRP pyrrolase and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase involved in catabolysing TRP, and thus potentially reducing its availability for brain serotonin synthesis (Russo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>).</p><p>Anxiety was relatively low, though levels were slightly higher before than after testing: treatment had no effect on anxiety. The remaining mood states (agitation, negative affect) were at low levels and were not affected by treatment.</p><p>These findings are most appropriately compared with previous research using healthy participants, as opposed to those with a (family) history of affect disorders. Firstly, it is interesting to note that the beneficial effects of 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122; on wellbeing are echoed by that dose&#x02019;s prevention of fatigue caused by the testing. As the wellbeing measure included terms related to arousal and alertness, both mood effects might reflect a slight underlying stimulant effect of 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;. Although some other studies have reported positive effects on mood after TRP manipulation, these often involved substantially higher doses of TRP and thus greater changes in TRP/LNAA (Charney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1982</xref>). Moreover, it is not clear to what extent those improvements might reflect anxiolytic and even sedative effects, which are often observed at higher TRP doses (Fernstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>; Leathwood and Pollet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1982</xref>; Sobczak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>). There are also several studies that have failed to find reliable mood changes by TRP supplementation (Merens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>; Scrutton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>), though others have demonstrated benefits to mood interacting with social behaviour context (Young <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). Observed effects may depend on the variety of mood measures that have been used; the MAPSS measure used here might be particularly sensitive in the context of this study, but there are no previous reports of effects of TRP or 5-HT changes on this measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Emotional processing and sensitivity</title><p>There is an expanding literature examining effects of serotonin manipulations on aspects of emotional processing; the interest arises from attempts to understand the role of serotonin in affect disorders such as depression and anxiety (Cowen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>; Robinson and Sahakian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). However, there are fewer studies that have looked at TRP supplementation on such effects in healthy participants. The theory is that in states of low serotonin activity, such as in depression, there is an attentional bias toward negative stimuli (Harmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>; Mathews and MacLeod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Therefore, emotional processing is assessed by comparing responses to negative vs. positive stimuli; for example, speed and accuracy of recognition of pleasant and unpleasant emotional expressions or responses to target vs. distractor emotional words (Mathews and MacLeod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>).</p><p>However, the results have not been entirely consistent; one oral dose of 1.8&#x000a0;g TRP enhanced recognition of both happy and fearful faces (Attenburrow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>), whereas 3&#x000a0;g/day TRP for 14&#x000a0;days increased recognition of happiness but decreased recognition of disgust expressions, and reduced attention to negative stimuli, suggesting a shift in bias toward positive stimuli (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). Such effects are more often seen in women than men (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, LumiVida&#x02122; produced faster and more accurate (fewer omissions) responding to positive target words, which might reflect less distraction by, and thus a shift in attention from, negative words, as well as increased attention to positive words. It is notable that the most reliable effect was again for the 2&#x000a0;g dose&#x02014;only this dose improved accuracy, although both doses were equally effective in reducing the latency to respond. Moreover, in the test of perception of emotional expressions, 2&#x000a0;g was again the effective dose, producing reductions in, and increased accuracy of, ratings of fear and sadness: one exception was a slightly more accurate perception of 50&#x000a0;% happy expressions after 4 vs. 2&#x000a0;g LumiVida&#x02122;. These findings are consistent with LumiVida&#x02122; increasing serotoninergic activity in pathways processing emotional stimuli, leading to a potential anti-depressant like activity of a shift in emotional processing away from negative bias (Bari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Importantly, we controlled for any influence of neuroticism here, as such a &#x02018;threat sensitivity&#x02019; aspect of personality has been shown to interact with serotoninergic modulation of brain processing of emotional expressions (Cools et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>). It is worth emphasising that, although the group receiving the effective 2&#x000a0;g dose was also the least neurotic and aggressive of the three groups, these personality differences were adjusted for by analysis of covariance, and either had no impact, or, if anything, strengthened the effect of that dose. This argues against personality differences contributing to the lack of linear dose-response results, but given the relevance of these traits to serotonin function, the possibility of residual confounding must be acknowledged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Summary</title><p>Consistent with accumulating evidence from both enhancement and depletion of serotonin function (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Robinson and Sahakian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Silber and Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>), the most reliable effects of LumiVida&#x02122; across the tasks have been on processing of emotionally relevant stimuli. The direction of these effects is in line with the widely acknowledged antidepressant function of enhanced serotonin neurotransmission, i.e. a shift in processing bias from negative towards positive stimuli (Bari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Sharp and Cowen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of this study was restriction of participants to middle-aged women, who may be more susceptible to dietary TRP manipulation than men (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Silber and Schmitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>). Moreover, there was no fasted-only condition, i.e. all comparisons are made to a casein hydrolysate control treatment, which, while matching for energy and protein intake, may not be inert itself on the behaviours considered here. Nevertheless, it is possible that comparison with a fasted group may have exaggerated beneficial effects of LumiVida&#x02122;. Still, the lack of linear dose-response results in this study questions whether the mechanism of action is the hypothesised increased release of serotonin per se. The pattern of results could depend on individual differences in susceptibility of brain serotonin function to dietary manipulation, although this was not indicated by the personality measures examined here. A possible role for serotonin transporter receptor gene polymorphisms remains to be explored in our data.</p><p>In conclusion, firstly our data provide the evidence that consumption of LumiVida&#x02122; does not induce any negative effects. Furthermore, these findings encourage the conclusion that daily consumption of a low dose of LumiVida&#x02122; may have beneficial effects on emotional function that may promote feelings of wellbeing; however, further work with such chronic dosing is required to be confident of this. These acute results suggest the potential for some emotional benefits, particularly during demanding occasions, and thus could confer resistance to depressive episodes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., Kaiseraugst, Switzerland.</p><sec id="d30e2617"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>This research was funded by a grant from DSM Nutritional Products Ltd., but the sponsors had no influence on conducting the experiments beyond consultation over design, nor on statistical analyses.
