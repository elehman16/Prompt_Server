Standard triple treatment: Esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1000 mg each bid for 14 days.

Approximately half of the world's population has <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with an estimated prevalence of 51%&#x02013;78% in Saudi Arabia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Consequences of infection include chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, or primary gastric MALT lymphoma.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Curing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection might cure dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and MALT lymphoma and may prevent the development of gastric cancer as well.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Recommended first-line treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection consists of a triple-therapy regimen containing a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin (CLR), and either amoxicillin (AML) or metronidazole (MTZ) given for 7&#x02013;14 days.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Recent data suggest that the success rate of classic triple therapy has decreased worldwide with increased rates of resistance to CLR and/or MTZ suspected as the underlying cause.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A previous study from Saudi Arabia reported <italic>H. pylori</italic> resistance to MTZ in 80%, CLR in 4%, AML in 1.3%, and tetracycline (TE) in 0.4% of infected people.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Assessment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> clinical isolates from 368 Saudi patients found a similar pattern of antibiotic resistance.

Therefore, researchers have looked at combinations of antibiotics and determined sequential therapy as a successful alternative.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A 10-day sequential therapy consists of 5 days of treatment with a PPI plus one antibiotic (usually AML 1 g bid) followed by a 5-day treatment with a PPI plus two other antibiotics (usually CLR and tinidazole/MTZ). A recent meta-analysis concluded that a 10-day sequential regimen is superior to standard triple therapy given for 7 or 10 days. The crude rates of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication in 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2747 patients were 93.4% for sequential therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 1363) and 76.9% for standard triple therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 1384).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Prolonging duration of PPI-based triple therapy to an optimal 14 days also appears to increase the cure rate.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Data from the Middle East comparing the efficacy of sequential therapy with standard first-line therapy in na&#x000ef;ve, adult, <italic>H. pylori</italic>&#x02013;infected patients are lacking.

The enrollment lasted from October 2011 to February 2014. Patients eligible for randomization had <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, previously untreated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment (na&#x000ef;ve), and were older than 18 years. The study excluded pregnant or lactating patients, those allergic to AML, CLR, or tinidazole, and patients with severe cardiac, renal, pulmonary or hepatic disease, or malignancy. Patients provided written-informed consent prior to undergoing esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD). The study was approved by the institute's ethics committee and the research promotion group (RAC #2111019).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients underwent EGD. During endoscopy, five biopsies were retrieved; two from the antrum, one from the incisura, and two from gastric body. Tissue from the antrum was used for the rapid urea test (RUT). <italic>H. pylori</italic> culture and sensitivity testing involved antrum and gastric body tissue and histology assessment evaluated specimens from the incisura and gastric body. A patient was considered <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive if the RUT (HP Fast. GI supply&#x02122;, PA, USA) detected a <italic>H. pylori</italic> organism, demonstrating <italic>H. pylori</italic> organism in the histology or the culture was positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to sequential therapy or standard therapy by computer-generated assignment. A research assistant managed the randomization and distributed the medication. Two pathologists and the nuclear medicine staff remained blinded to the treatment allocation. The information on treatment allocation was kept hidden from the physician until the medications were prescribed.</p><p>Patients randomized to sequential treatment received esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 10 days, AML 1000 mg bid for the first 5 days, followed by 5 days of CLR 500 mg and tinidazole 500 mg both given twice daily. The standard triple treatment consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg, CLR 500 mg, and AML 1000 mg (each drug administered twice daily) for 14 days. Patient interviews assessed compliance to treatment by asking for details about the number of prescribed pills consumed.</p><p>The primary endpoint was a negative urea breath test (UBT) after 6 weeks of eradication treatment. The Nuclear Medicine Department took care of administering the UBT, using Carbon-14 bound urea (3 microcurie of C-14) as the source of radiolabeled carbon dioxide. Patients abstained from PPIs and bismuth-containing agents for 2 weeks and antibiotics for at least 4 weeks prior to the test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing of <italic>H. pylori</italic></title><p>Urease-positive gastric biopsy specimens were cultured in a microaerophilic environment (CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C for 72 h). Blood agar, chocolate agar, and selective <italic>Campylobacter</italic> agar and Thayer&#x02013;Martin agars were utilized as culture media. The organism was identified as <italic>H. pylori</italic> with its predefined properties. Once the colonies were identified as <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the primary isolation, a subculture was performed for the purpose of acquiring a secondary isolation, which was used for antibiotic sensitivity testing.</p><p>Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined with the E-test method (Epsilometer test; AB Biodisk Solna, Sweden; Biomerieux, France). Antibiotics evaluated with E-test strips included AML, MTZ, CLR, TE, rifampin, and levofloxacin. The strips were aseptically placed onto the dried surface of inoculated agar plates, which were then incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 35 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C. MIC was read as the intersection of the elliptical zone of growth inhibition using the MIC scale on the E-test strip after 48&#x02013;72 h of incubation. The following breakpoints were used: (AML; MIC &#x02264;0.12 sensitive and &#x0003e;0.12 &#x003bc;g/mL resistant), (CLR; MIC &#x02264;0.25 sensitive, 0.5 intermediate, and &#x02265;1 &#x003bc;g/mL resistant), (levofloxacin; MIC &#x0003c;1 sensitive and &#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;g/mL resistant), (TE; MIC &#x02264;1 sensitive and &#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;g/mL resistant), (MTZ; MIC &#x02264;8 sensitive and &#x02265;8 &#x003bc;g/mL resistant).

The eradication rate was 50.4% with sequential therapy and 59% with standard therapy as per ITT analysis. These data suggest that we need to develop a better therapy against <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p><p>The rate of resistance to both AML (14.8%) and CLR (23.3%) in this study mirrors data published by Momenah <italic>et al.</italic>, but is higher than earlier reported values.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Increasing resistance to these antibiotics may be a consequence of their frequent usage for treating bacterial infections such as upper respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis. Saudi Arabian studies have also consistently reported a high incidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> resistance to MTZ. A study from Jeddah (Western region, Saudi Arabia) showed <italic>H. pylori</italic> resistance to MTZ in 80% of isolates.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We evaluated <italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic susceptibility using the E-test method and determined MTZ resistance in 48.5% of patients. The Momenah study, which examined susceptibility using the disk diffusion method, identified a similar MTZ resistance (48.2%).</p><p>Several studies have investigated the role of sequential therapy in the treatment of na&#x000ef;ve <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the bulk of which were carried out in European countries and North America.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The meta-analysis by Jafri <italic>et al.</italic> suggested a superiority of sequential therapy over standard therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. In that particular meta-analysis, the crude eradication rate with sequential therapy was 93.4% versus 76.9% with standard therapy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, most studies included in this meta-analysis took place in Italy, and only one was double- blinded.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report addressing the use of sequential therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> in adults from the Middle East. A study on pediatric patients from Jeddah (Western region, Saudi Arabia) that compared sequential and standard therapy showed no difference in treatment effects.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A multicenter study involving a center from Egypt and two centers from Saudi Arabia compared the role of levofloxacin-based firstline therapy versus standard therapy consisting of AML, CLR, and esomeprazole; both regimens were administered for 7 days. In this trial, the eradication rate was 90.6% using the levofloxacin-based regimen and 78.6% with standard therapy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In our study, eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> occurred more frequently with standard therapy, which may relate to CLR resistance. The efficacy of CLR decreases if the bacteria can develop efflux channels, by which they can transfer the drug out of the cell. AML given in the first 5 days weakens the cell walls and thereby inhibits the production of efflux channels, ultimately increasing the availability of CLR intracellularly.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, this advantage in sequential therapy may not work if the organism is already resistant to CLR. Hence, the success of treatment involving CLR depends highly on bacterial susceptibility. We noted CLR resistance as a predictive factor for failure of sequential therapy possibly due to its diminished availability within the cell. It is also possible that the higher eradication with standard therapy relates to 14 days of treatment in this group.</p><p>That 30%&#x02013;40% of our patients failed to eradicate the <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection seems rather high. In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, poor adherence to medications and other factors such as age, smoking, intragastric bacterial load, and genetic polymorphisms might have played a role.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>We attempted to culture gastric tissue from each patient and detect the resistance pattern. Culturing the <italic>H. pylori</italic> organism was difficult because of its innocuous nature. We succeeded in culturing the organism in 85 of 232 (36.6%) patients. Identifying antibiotic susceptibility of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was another difficult task, as many centers still do not have E-test kits for performing sensitivity tests. The resistance pattern of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to different antibiotics established in our study should be helpful to researchers in their future work.</p><p>Determining the antibiotic susceptibility through molecular-based tests could improve the success rate of eradicating <italic>H. pylori</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] PCR-based tests such as restriction fragment length polymorphism represents one such method. Another method known as the rRNA-based whole cell hybridization method detects <italic>Helicobacter</italic> species <italic>in situ</italic> within gastric tissue and identifies CLR-resistance genotype.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Future trials incorporating TE will be justified in view of the very low resistance to this antibiotic. Switching to bismuth- based quadruple therapy or adding newer molecules specifically targeting <italic>H. pylori</italic> to current regimens represents a second option for increasing the <italic>H. pylori</italic> cure rate. Developing diagnostic agents for detecting antibiotic susceptibility and making them available freely in the market is another important step in the eradication of the organism.</p><p>The strength of the current study is its methodology; it was conducted strictly following all the rules for an RCT. Adequate numbers of patients were recruited and followed up in both arms. The study had some notable weaknesses. Patients self-reported adverse events and adherence to medication was from the patient's history. For unknown reasons, the study determined lower overall eradication rates than expected for both the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The current randomized controlled study conducted in Saudi Arabia showed that both sequential therapy and standard therapy were equal in efficacy to eradicate <italic>H. pylori</italic>.
