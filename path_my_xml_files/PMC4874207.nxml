Women were excluded if there was a known fetal abnormality, a bleeding disorder, a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or English was not spoken in the home (as children undergoing developmental testing were required to understand and take instructions from a psychologist in English). At study entry, women were randomly assigned to receive either a fish oil concentrate (800&#x02005;mg DHA/day) or a blend of vegetable oils (no DHA) in capsules that were identical in appearance from &#x0223c;20&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation until birth.

The neurodevelopment cohort subset consisted of all preterm children and a random sample of term-born children whose mothers were recruited from Adelaide. Secondary outcomes included Bayley-III language and motor scales, as well as developmental delay. We assessed 694 of the 726 (95.6%) infants selected for the neurodevelopment cohort. We found no significant difference between groups in the mean cognitive scores of children whose mothers were assigned to receive DHA supplements compared with those assigned to receive placebo (101.8&#x000b1;11.1 vs 101.8&#x000b1;12.6), although fewer children from the DHA group had scores indicative of mildly delayed cognitive development (DQ&#x0003c;85, 2.7% vs 6.6%, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78, p=0.007).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> These data are consistent with the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood finding<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and provide evidence that DHA supplementation is effective at preventing developmental delay in early childhood.

Secondary outcomes were general language ability measured with the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF)-Preschool, Second Edition, inhibitory control measured with the efficiency score of the Day-Night Stroop, and short-term memory measured with the Recognition of Pictures and Recall of Digits Forward tests from the Differential Ability Scales. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)-Preschool and provided information regarding family demographics, the child's dietary intake of DHA-rich foods, such as fish, eggs, DHA-enriched breads and yogurts, use of DHA supplements, parent-reported medical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and behavioural or learning disorders of children, as well as the home environment (Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ)),<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> life events (the Recent Life Events (RLE)),<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and family functioning (the Family Assessment Device (FAD)).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> As at 18&#x02005;months, we found no significant mean group difference in general cognitive functioning of children whose mothers were assigned to receive DHA supplements compared with those assigned to receive placebo at 4&#x02005;years (DHA group DQ=99.6, 95% CI 98.4 to 100.8 vs control group DQ=99.4, 95% CI 98.3 to 100.6).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We also found that there was no longer a group difference in cognitive delay, and no sex by treatment interactions, although children from the DHA group had slightly poorer scores on the parent-completed measures of behaviour and executive functioning than control group children, indicating increased parent-perceived problems in the DHA group.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Rationale for the current follow-up</title><p>We propose to conduct a neurodevelopmental assessment focused primarily on cognitive functioning at 7&#x02005;years of age in the DOMInO neurodevelopment cohort. While the previous assessment at 4&#x02005;years for these children provided an indication of neurodevelopment in the preschool years and school readiness, new skills develop with age, and as a result, long-term effects on cognitive functioning and deficits that emerge in later years need to be examined.</p><p>Cognitive skills develop rapidly during early childhood,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and by age 7&#x02005;years most cognitive domains can be reliably assessed using valid and standardised instruments.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Importantly, a measure of IQ at 7&#x02005;years of age is predictive of adult IQ and adult attained education and occupation,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> occupational status, material well-being,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and mortality risk.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Although an assessment after 7&#x02005;years of age will also provide a predictive measure of adulthood IQ, there is a greater chance of loss to follow-up as the children get older. Assessment at age 7 provides us with the best compromise between an assessment of cognitive function that is predictive of adult functioning with maximal follow-up and the lowest risk of attrition. The suite of developmental assessments at early, middle and late (18&#x02005;months, 4 and 7&#x02005;years) childhood is complementary and will provide a more complete picture of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnancy on children's developmental trajectory during early-mid childhood. Follow-up at 7&#x02005;years is vital to complete the picture and provide the long-term outcome data necessary to indicate the permanency of any effects of prenatal DHA supplementation. Furthermore, given the information relating to previous trial quality and low power, the methodologically robust and well-powered DOMInO RCT is expected to provide robust data regarding the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnancy on long-term cognitive development of children.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Aims and hypothesis</title><p>Our aim is to determine whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy enhances cognitive function at 7&#x02005;years of age, with our primary outcome being IQ. The areas of the brain thought to be most susceptible to DHA exposure in the last trimester of pregnancy when our intervention took place are the frontal lobes. These lobes undergo two critical periods of development during childhood. We expect that the hypothesised benefits of prenatal DHA supplementation on the performance of these lobes will be detectable following these key development periods.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We hypothesise that children who were exposed to a DHA-rich environment during the second half of gestation will have higher IQ scores at 7&#x02005;years of age than children whose mothers consumed a regular Australian diet typically low in DHA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a prospective, follow-up study of children born to women who participated in the DOMInO trial.

Full-scale IQ, Verbal Comprehension Index and Perceptual Reasoning Index scores will be calculated. Each scale is age standardised with a mean of 100 (SD 15). Mild intellectual impairment will be defined as a full-scale IQ from 70 to 84 (from &#x02212;2 to &#x0003c;&#x02212;1 SD from the mean), and major intellectual impairment defined as an IQ&#x0003c;70 (ie, &#x0003c;&#x02212;2 SD from the mean). Corrected age will be used to standardise the scores of children who were born preterm.</p><p><italic>Secondary outcomes</italic>: Secondary outcomes include neurobehavioural domains that are thought to be sensitive to DHA depletion and are important indicators of child development: executive function, attention, memory and learning and behaviour.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Executive function</italic> will be assessed with the Rey Complex Figure (RCF),<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> the Fruit Stroop test (F-Stroop),<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> the Number Repetition Subtest of the CELF, 4th Edition (CELF-4)<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and the BRIEF.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The RCF requires participants to copy a complex geometric figure and evaluates spatial organisation (the ability to perceive and interpret complex spatial stimuli) and strategic decision-making (the capacity to plan ahead and devise efficient and effective strategies to reach a specific goal). The F-Stroop assesses behavioural inhibition and mental flexibility. The Number Repetition from the CELF-4 requires participants to recall a series of digits in the order they were presented, and in the reversed order. It measures working memory, a core element of executive functioning. The BRIEF is a parent-completed questionnaire that is an important adjunct to formal assessment of executive functioning as some elements of executive dysfunction are more obvious in everyday settings such as the home and kindergarten.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Attention</italic> will be assessed using subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh).<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The TEACh provides a comprehensive assessment of attention skills across different modalities. The subtests to be administered will be Sky Search (selective attention), Score! (sustained attention), Creature Counting (attentional control) and Sky Search Dual Task (divided attention). The divided attention score will be calculated by multiplying the proportion of visual stimuli found by the proportion of auditory stimuli counted, multiplied by 10 (with 10 signifying a perfect score).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Memory and learning</italic> will be assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT).<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> This test is used extensively to assess immediate verbal memory, learning ability and delayed recall.

The SDQ is a well-validated questionnaire that assesses overall behaviour problems, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behaviour. As there is growing speculation that DHA plays a role in preventing and reducing ADHD, we will also administer a specific ADHD diagnostic questionnaire, namely the Conners&#x02019; ADHD/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) scales, which will be completed by parents.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Academic abilities/educational progress</italic> will be captured with the Word Reading, Spelling and Math Computation subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth edition (WRAT-4).<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p><italic>Other outcomes</italic>: Children will have their head, waist and hip circumferences measured, they will be weighed and their height will be measured at the time of the cognitive assessment as an index of the nutritional well-being of children.</p><p><italic>Additional data</italic>: Sociodemographic data (such as parental age, education, employment, gestational age at birth, birth weight, birth order and sex) were collected for the DOMInO trial at trial entry or at birth. Parental education and employment were collected again at the 4-year follow-up and will also be collected at the 7-year follow-up, as these details may change over time. Information regarding duration of exclusive breast feeding, type of infant formula used, age at introduction to solid foods and the number of, and reason for, hospitalisations have all been collected as part of the DOMInO trial. At the 7-year follow-up, we will again seek information about the child's medically diagnosed conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder or ADHD), medications and hospitalisations. All hospital admissions &#x0003e;24&#x02005;h will be documented as possible adverse events and the frequency of events will be compared between the treatment and control groups. Admission to intensive (level 3) care or death will be treated as possible serious adverse events. The recent use of DHA supplements and DHA-rich or fortified foods were collected at 18&#x02005;months and 4&#x02005;years of age, and will again be collected at 7&#x02005;years.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>There were originally 726 children selected for developmental follow-up. If 80% of the original 726 participate in the 7-year follow-up, we will have at least 89% power to detect a four-point difference in full-scale IQ (mean 100, SD 15) between the treatment and control groups (&#x003b1;=0.05, two-sided). If 75%, or even 70%, of the original 726 are successfully followed up at age 7&#x02005;years, the power remains high (at least 87% and 85%, respectively). To achieve a minimum of 80% power, we would need to successfully follow-up 61% of participants (222 per group). Detection of a four-point difference in IQ is realistic and comparable to the magnitude of cognitive benefit found in 8-year-old children whose mothers consumed 2&#x02013;3 servings of fish/week during pregnancy compared with those who ate &#x0003c;1 serving/week<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the findings from one RCT.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Similar sized differences in DQ and IQ have been observed between iron deficient anaemic and non-anaemic children<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and also in children who were exposed to high and low levels of lead from the environment.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> In both cases, public health policy was changed as a result; infant cereals were fortified with iron and the lead is now removed from petrol and the environment as much as possible.</p><p>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis according to the mother's allocation to the treatment or control group. No interim analyses will be conducted for this study, and all analyses will be performed according to the prespecified statistical analysis plan. Analyses will be performed using SAS V.9.3 or later, and Stata Release V.13 or later. No data transformations are planned or expected. Both adjusted and unadjusted analyses will be performed, with the adjusted results used to draw conclusion about the effect of treatment on the outcomes of interest. Results will be presented as differences in means for continuous outcomes, or relative risks for binary outcomes, with 95% CIs and two-sided p values. Statistical significance will be assessed at the 5% level, and no adjustment will be made for the number of analyses planned, as a single primary outcome has been prespecified for the study.</p><p><italic>Potential confounders</italic>: Since recruiting centre and parity were used as stratification variables in the randomisation process, all analyses will be adjusted for centre and parity.</p><p>Adjustment will also be made for additional baseline variables that are potential confounders for some outcomes specified a priori; these include smoking during pregnancy, maternal secondary education, maternal further education and infant sex.</p><p><italic>Primary outcome</italic>: Mean IQ scores will be compared between the treatment groups using a linear regression model.</p><p><italic>Secondary outcomes</italic>: Will be analysed using linear regression models for continuous (normally distributed) outcomes and log binomial regression models for binary outcomes.</p><p><italic>Secondary analyses</italic>: We will test for evidence of effect modification by sex by including a treatment by sex interaction for primary and secondary neurodevelopmental outcomes, as we have previously found differential effects of DHA supplementation on aspects of the neurodevelopment of boys and girls.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>

Children who are missing scores on psychological assessments because they were untestable for developmental reasons will be reviewed by a psychologist (who is blinded to treatment group) to determine whether the lowest possible score should be assigned. Multiple imputation will be used to create 100 complete data sets for analysis using the fully conditional specification method separately by treatment group.</p><p>Analyses will be performed on the raw and imputed data, with conclusions to be drawn based on the results of the analyses performed on the imputed data. Imputed data sets will include all children whose primary carer consented to the follow-up study. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using different imputation models and for all 726 children in the originally selected subsample, excluding known deaths.</p><p><italic>Accounting for study design</italic>: The selection procedure for the neurodevelopmental follow-up was stratified by preterm status, sex, recruiting centre and time period. Sampling weights were calculated for each infant as the inverse of the probability of selection. Infants will be weighted according to these sampling weights and the stratification variables will be specified in all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approval in writing from the Human Research Ethics Committee at each study site (the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide and Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide) shall be granted prior to the initiation of the study at that site. This study will be carried out in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans which builds on the ethical codes of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Principles of International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (as adopted in Australia). Caregivers will be required to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the follow-up study, and will be given a copy of the signed consent form and participant information sheet. Parents will be advised that they are free to decline any aspect of the 7-year follow-up, or withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.</p><p>This is a follow-up study with no active intervention and is considered a low-risk study. The developmental assessments described in this protocol will be conducted by a team of trained assessors supervised by a psychologist. The full suite of assessments will take each child about 2&#x000bd; to 3&#x02005;h, including a break between neurodevelopmental assessments. The assessments do not pose any apparent physical risk to children and are enjoyable for 7-year-old children. Given the short and engaging nature of the tasks, children generally maintain interest and concentration throughout the assessment. If a child becomes upset or uncooperative during the assessment, the child will be given time to recover or parents offered the opportunity to return and complete the assessment on another occasion.</p><p>Parents will be given $50 to cover travel/parking and childcare expenses of other siblings not attending the appointment.</p><p>The results of this follow-up study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences. No individual participants will be identified or identifiable. All data will be analysed in de-identified form. Data, both paper copies and the electronic database, will be kept (locked and password protected) for 30&#x02005;years after completion of the study and publication of the results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the paucity of evidence, recommendations exist internationally to increase DHA intake during pregnancy<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59&#x02013;61</xref> and the nutritional supplement industry markets prenatal DHA supplements to optimise fetal brain development.

<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> calls for rigorous scientific evidence regarding benefits of fish oil supplementation during pregnancy for child development from RCTs. Such trials are fundamental to establishing a causal link between DHA exposure during gestation and child development. Our follow-up study can provide robust data regarding the potential long-term effects of supplementing the diets of pregnant women with DHA on cognitive functioning in middle childhood. IQ at 7&#x02005;years is an important outcome as it is known to predict adult IQ, academic achievement, income<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and employment.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In fact, a one-point increase in a nation's average IQ is associated with a 0.11% annual increase in quality of life as assessed by gross domestic product per capita.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> If the results of this study indicate beneficial effects of DHA supplementation, changes to public health policy and subsequent strengthening of human capital has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Australia and the World.</p><p>Only two other RCTs have followed children through to 7&#x02005;years of age after supplementing pregnant women with DHA; however, one study only assessed 143 children of the 590 participants included in the trial (75% attrition)<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and the other study only included 50 of 98 children (49% attrition)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which meant the randomisation integrity may not have been maintained in either study.</p><p>Strengths of our study include building on a well-powered, well-conducted multicentre RCT with the highest retention rates to date, and assessment of a range of neurodevelopmental domains. The DOMInO trial has the broadest inclusion criteria of all the RCTs of DHA supplementation in pregnancy to maximise representativeness of the sample.</p><p>The DOMInO trial is likely one of the last opportunities to compare the effect of a DHA supplement with a placebo due to the high use of prenatal supplements that contain DHA by pregnant women today.
