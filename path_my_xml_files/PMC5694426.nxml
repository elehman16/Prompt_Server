</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Despite consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], debate continues about the potential harms from statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Much of the case for harms rests on real-world reported evidence of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials do not support significant increases in serious adverse events (SAEs) with statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">However, it is well known that observational reports are susceptible to two well-known important sources of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. First, since real-world use of statins is generally not randomized, unmeasured confounding may bias the rate of reported side effects. This is particularly the case where confounding by indication exists: the indications for statin prescription are independently associated with side effects, beyond any potential causeway through statin use. Such bias is difficult and may be impossible to adjust for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Second, since real-world use of statins is unblinded, an ascertainment bias may impact the reporting of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Without the masking of treatment assignments, it is possible that patients or their physicians wrongly attribute a side effect to the use of statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such an effect is suggested by the recent Odyssey Alternative trial: one in 16 patients with documented statin intolerance were screened out during a 4-week placebo run-in period, thereby &#x0201c;suggesting that some patients may experience muscle symptoms because of negative expectations surrounding the potential for statin treatment or for reasons unrelated to statin therapy&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">To tease apart the impact of such biases on reported statin adverse events, the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial&#x02014;Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) recently compared events in the non-randomized and non-blinded follow-on phase with events reported in the earlier randomized, blinded phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This demonstrated that patient-reported adverse events such as muscle pain and weakness were higher in the non-randomized and non-blinded setting than in the randomized, blinded setting.</p><p id="Par11">In this current study, inspired by the ASCOT-LLA approach, a secondary analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) blood pressure (BP) management trial is conducted. The objective is to understand whether adjudicated SAEs, either deemed related to BP treatment or not, differed by baseline statin use. The premise of this study is simply that any such association between statin use and SAEs is observable in the data. This study is silent as to possible mechanisms for such effects, which could be due to statin therapy alone or the interaction between statin therapy and BP management with one or more classes of BP-lowering medicines.</p><p id="Par12">For example, while short-term imbalances in sodium and potassium levels are well known to be associated with diuretic-based BP treatments, one large observational study of statin use in the UK found significant associations between statin use and liver dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, while declines in kidney function may occur with the beta blockers or renin-angiotension system blockers used in BP management in either arm of SPRINT, the same study showed higher rates of acute kidney failure among statin users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Again, while the thiazide diuretics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and beta blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] used in SPRINT are known to increase diabetes risk, this risk was also found to be associated with statin use in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In all these examples, therefore, whether the SAE was deemed related to the BP treatment or not, it will be ascertained as an SAE. Moreover, if an interaction occurs between statin therapy and BP management pharmacological therapy, this would also be ascertained as an SAE as well.</p><p id="Par13">In another example, far less likely to be due to BP treatment, cognitive status and glucose tests were explicitly assessed in all SPRINT participants and reported as an SAE if abnormal. Cognitive functioning abnormalities and diabetes have previously been of concern to some as a side effect of statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; if present, such potential SAEs would likely have been ascertained. Finally, some possible rare effects of statins such as rhabdomyolysis or more common effects such as muscle weaknesses and myalgia, if unexpected and sufficiently serious, would also have been reported as an SAE.</p><p id="Par14">Accordingly, I hypothesized that if statins are associated with SAEs, then comparing overall SAE and treatment-related SAE rates by statin use would reveal this signal. To reduce confounding by statin indication, adjustment was made for baseline characteristics and the main analysis was restricted to those without baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD). To reduce confounding from the effect of the BP intervention, the main analysis was further restricted to only those randomized to standard BP management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data Source</title><p id="Par15">The SPRINT BP trial dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was obtained from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute under an institutional data use agreement with the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

The overwhelming majority of SAEs were not separately described except as events that were fatal or life threatening, resulted in significant or persistent disability, required or prolonged a hospitalization, or were an important medical event that the investigator judged to be a significant hazard or harm to the participant that may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other SAEs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par19">Outcomes were calculated as overall unadjusted event rates over the median 3.3&#x000a0;years of follow-up by cohort.

The findings here suggest the need for further investigation of the interaction between SAE risk and ASCVD risk among those taking statins.</p><p id="Par36">This study is greatly limited by two separate weaknesses: the data origin from a clinical trial, and a maintained hypothesis that any SAE caused directly or indirectly by statin use would be identifiable in the data.</p><p id="Par37">In terms of data origin, this study is weakened by its reliance on a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. To the extent to which this trial is not representative of the real-world population taking statin medication, so too are the results circumscribed. For example, diabetics were excluded from the SPRINT trial, and this secondary analysis cannot comment on this important subgroup. Additionally, this secondary analysis, as many others do, relies on an original trial that was not powered for this re-analysis, and in turn on a re-analysis with uncorrected multiple testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the significantly higher hazard rate for SAEs among statin-using, higher risk patients represents the play of chance rather than a true positive finding.</p><p id="Par38">Data analyzed here are also incomplete in important ways. While the proportion of patients reporting taking statins at baseline was meaningful at between 38 and 69% depending on cohort examined, there were no data recorded in the trial on type of statin taken or dosage, nor was adherence to statin use or crossover to use recorded.</p><p id="Par39">Finally, the reliable attribution of an SAE to a statin medicine taken at baseline as opposed to a particular BP intervention or another cause is not possible. Nevertheless, somewhat mitigating these concerns is the widespread availability of clinical trial data for secondary analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In terms of the maintained hypothesis, a key premise of this analysis is that reported side effects are temporally related to statin use. However, it is generally believed that statin side effects occur relatively early (weeks to months) on initiating or re-starting statin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. If patients had systematically started statin therapy closer to the trial date, or changed statin medications or doses during the trial thereby exposing themselves to greater SAE risk, then this premise would not be threatened. If on the other hand, participants in the SPRINT trial had been stable on statins for some period of time before the trial, most SAEs would have occurred and resolved, and this would lead to a bias towards the null of finding no association between statin use and SAE rates. Assuming the opposite, that this bias was widespread, it could explain the insignificant differences in the lower risk cohorts. However, it would then also strengthen polypharmacy and statin-drug interactions as the explanation for this study&#x02019;s finding in the highest risk cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">Within the important limitations of this clinical trial secondary re-analysis and the other acknowledged design weaknesses, these results support the findings of the original statin randomized clinical trials that statin side effects may be limited in nature. These results also support the concerns that real-world evidence of statin side effects may be biased by unobserved confounding, confounding by indication and ascertainment bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study therefore cautiously supports the view among many clinicians that in general and on average, the benefits of statins likely outweigh concerns about statin-related harms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par42">No direct funding; unrestricted research allowance.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par43">Marco D.
