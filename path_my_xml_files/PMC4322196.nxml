<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Frailty is a medical syndrome with numerous causes, characterised by reduced strength, endurance and physiological function, resulting in increased vulnerability to functional decline, dependence and/or death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Pre-frailty is an intermediate stage between non-frail and frail. Identifying and treating people in the pre-frail state may be an effective way to prevent or delay frailty.</p><p>Frailty can be defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty phenotype<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which contains five criteria (unexplained weight loss, weakness, low activity, exhaustion and slowness) that reflect underlying dysregulation in multiple physiological processes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> People are classified as non-frail if they meet no criteria, pre-frail if they meet one or two criteria, and frail if they meet three or more criteria. The frailty phenotype is predictive of falls, disability, institutionalisation, hospitalisation and mortality; pre-frail individuals have a significantly higher risk of developing these adverse outcomes than non-frail people, and frail individuals have a still higher risk.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pre-frailty and frailty are common; a recent systematic review found that the prevalence of pre-frailty (as defined by the frailty phenotype) in community-dwelling people aged 65&#x02005;years or older was 38&#x02013;53% (mean 44.2%), and the prevalence of frailty was 4&#x02013;17% (mean 9.9%).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> As the proportion of older people is rising globally, the costs associated with frailty will increase in the future. Preventing or delaying frailty has the potential to reduce the burden on individuals and society.</p><p>Research into interventions to prevent or reduce frailty is in its infancy. While studies have found that outcomes for frail older people can be improved using multifactorial interventions such as comprehensive geriatric assessment, and single interventions including exercise programmes,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> nutritional supplementation and reduction of polypharmacy,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the effect of intervention on frailty itself is seldom examined. Our recent randomised trial evaluated the effect of a multifactorial interdisciplinary intervention on frailty as a primary outcome (measured using the frailty phenotype), and found that the intervention significantly reduced frailty in frail community-dwelling older people.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Implementing interventions for pre-frail older people may prevent the development of frailty. Older people transition between frailty states,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and pre-frail individuals have more than twice the risk of becoming frail compared with non-frail people.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Transition from pre-frail to frail often ensues from an acute medical event or a psychological stress exceeding the person's capacity for recovery.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Intervention to increase reserve capacity and reduce the impact of potential stressors may therefore reduce the risk of becoming frail. Evidence suggests that pre-frail older people may respond better to intervention than people who have already moved to a frail state,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and because pre-frail people have significantly less disability than frail people<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> there is potential for more intensive interventions.</p><p>Few trials have identified and targeted pre-frail participants. Previous trials have included samples that are probably pre-frail, for example people at risk of falling;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> however, studies need to have pre-frailty as an inclusion criterion for results to be generalisable to this population. Recent randomised trials<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and an observational study<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have investigated the effects of exercise in people defined as pre-frail using the frailty phenotype; exercise appears to improve function in pre-frail people; however, larger studies are needed. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been developed to specifically prevent the transition to frailty in pre-frail older people.</p><p>We plan to conduct the Pre-Frailty Intervention Trial (Pre-FIT), a randomised controlled trial that aims to determine whether delivering a multifactorial, interdisciplinary intervention to older people who are pre-frail prevents progression to frailty and improves mobility. We will implement a modification of the intervention previously found to reduce frailty and improve mobility in frail older people<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> to determine whether pre-frail participants receive similar benefits with respect to frailty levels and mobility. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study to examine the effects of an intervention specifically targeting the degree of frailty among older people who are pre-frail. The primary research question is: Does the multifactorial interdisciplinary intervention prevent the progression to frailty (assessed with a frailty phenotype score) and improve mobility among pre-frail older people, when compared with usual care?</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>A randomised controlled trial will be conducted among 230 participants who are pre-frail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007091F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> gives an overview of the study design.

There will be five sessions in the first 3&#x02005;months after randomisation, and five sessions over the following 9&#x02005;months. Visits will be of 60&#x02013;120&#x02005;min duration. The physiotherapist will prescribe a home exercise programme to be performed for 20&#x02013;30&#x02005;min, up to six times per week, for 12&#x02005;months. The exercises, degree of difficulty and number of repetitions prescribed will be based on assessment of the individual participant's abilities. Lower limb balance and strengthening exercises will utilise the Weight Bearing Exercise for Better Balance (WEBB) programme, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webb.org.au.">http://www.webb.org.au.</ext-link><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The programme targets strength and control of the lower limb extensor muscles (hip and knee extensors, ankle plantarflexors) with exercises including standing up from a chair, forward and lateral step-ups onto a block and heel raises while standing on a wedge. Resistance will be applied by body weight or by weighted vests or weight-belts as appropriate. Balance will be targeted with exercises performed while standing on a progressively narrowed base (feet together, tandem stance, single leg stance), stepping, walking and reaching. Upper limb support will be minimised in order to adequately challenge balance, but to ensure safety the environment will be set up with stable supports (eg, bench or table) close by that can be held as necessary. In addition, if upper limb weakness is creating functional problems, then the physiotherapist may prescribe upper limb exercises incorporating theraband or free weights for resistance. The physiotherapist will regularly review and modify the optimal intensity and type of exercises for each participant to ensure that the intervention remains appropriate and challenging over the study period. We will encourage family members or carers to assist with the exercise programme when this is indicated.</p><p>Appropriate safe mobility programmes will be prescribed if participants have low activity levels, reduced endurance or specific functional goals. Feedback will be provided via monitoring of distance/time or via a pedometer or <italic>FitBit (</italic>internet-linked pedometer). Participants will be encouraged and supported in increasing their physical activity using exercise equipment that they have at home, as well as community physical activity programmes (such as Tai Chi or strength and balance classes), community exercise facilities (such as gymnasiums and swimming pools) and a return to past leisure activities such as golf and bowls.</p><p>In addition to the interventions targeting the CHS frailty characteristics, individually tailored intervention will address additional problems identified during assessment.

Specifically, it will determine whether a multifactorial interdisciplinary intervention reduces transition to frailty and deterioration in mobility among pre-frail older men and women who live in the community. Frailty and the associated negative effects such as disability, institutionalisation and hospitalisation are costly to individuals, their families, the health system and society. Despite this cost, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research to date examining the effectiveness of an intervention designed to reduce the transition to frailty among pre-frail older people.</p><p>The proposed multifactorial intervention will target the needs of each participant based on the characteristics of frailty present and comprehensive geriatric assessment. The exercise component was designed using evidence from systematic reviews and randomised trials that have demonstrated improved strength, balance and mobility in older people. We will implement strategies to maximise adherence to the intervention, in line with research suggesting that good patient adherence increases the effectiveness of health interventions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The intervention is based on the programme that was feasibly delivered to frail older people in the Frailty Intervention Trial,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> with some modifications to enable a greater challenge to balance, strength and physical activity. Tailoring the exercises to the individual and ongoing reassessment by the treating physiotherapist will ensure safety.</p><p>Additional strengths of the study are the generalisability to pre-frail older people and aged care health service settings, and the robust, but pragmatic, clinical trial design. This study uses an objective measure of pre-frailty; the CHS criteria have previously been used to recruit frail<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and pre-frail<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> people to clinical trials. We have avoided excessive exclusion criteria. The intervention being examined is readily transferable to routine clinical practice in the aged care health service setting and the interdisciplinary approach is relevant to several professional groups in aged care.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, participants cannot be blinded to group allocation, which is a potential source of bias due to possible differential reporting of the weight loss, activity and exhaustion frailty criteria. However, the weakness and slowness frailty criteria and the co-primary outcome measure (CSPS) are performance based, which should reduce this bias. Second, as there is no frequency-matched social intervention for the control group, we will not be able to exclude the impact of social aspects of the programme on any difference between groups. Third, there is no consensus on how to identify pre-frailty<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and while the CHS phenotype is the most widely accepted instrument, other validated tools<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and attention to cognition could be considered in the clinical setting.</p><p>If this intervention is shown to be effective, there are major potential benefits to the older population in terms of preventing transition to frailty and improving mobility. Avoiding frailty has the potential to reduce adverse health outcomes, such as fall rates, hospitalisation and institutionalisation, and the associated financial costs. Improved mobility may also result in improved function and better quality of life for older people, their families and carers. If cost-effectiveness is demonstrated, this intervention will lead to more efficient utilisation of health services. The findings will be disseminated through scientific and professional conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e233" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007091.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e234" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007091.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Doris Whiting Special Purpose and Trust Fund, administered by the Division of Rehabilitation and Aged Care, Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Health Service, Australia.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NF drafted the manuscript.
