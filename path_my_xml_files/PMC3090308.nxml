There is increasing evidence that topically administered medication affects the structure and the integrity of the ocular surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-5-517">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-5-517">4</xref> Besides its intraocular pressure-lowering effect, local adverse effects, such as conjunctival hyperemia, foreign body sensation, or other symptoms of dry eye disease, can accompany its use. These symptoms can be related to the negative impact of topical antiglaucoma medication and its preservatives on tear-film stability. Because glaucoma therapy typically consists of long-term treatment, these symptoms usually become worse over the long term, eventually leading to a drop in compliance or to complete break-up of drop application in glaucoma patients. At this point, patient care and guidance suffer.</p><p>In contrast with studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-5-517">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-5-517">6</xref> investigating their long-term effects on the ocular surface, quantitative investigations to evaluate the short-term effects of relatively &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; topical antiglaucoma medications on tear-film stability and corneal sensitivity are comparatively limited at the present time.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of the commonly used antiglaucoma medications, ie, brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost, timolol, and apraclonidine, as well as a fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol, on tear-film stability, tear secretion, and corneal sensitivity in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><p>Thirty healthy subjects were included in this prospective, double-blind, crossover study. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Dresden in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects signed an informed consent form before participating in the study. Break-up time and a Jones test were performed 60 minutes before, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes after drop application. Corneal sensitivity was determined 60 minutes before, and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after topical drop application. In accordance with the crossover design, all subjects received one topical medication, which was applied once into the lower fornix of the conjunctiva of one randomly chosen eye. Additionally, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) 0.02% and 0.005% and sodium chloride solution 0.9% as control substances were applied once in one randomly chosen eye.</p><sec><title>Break-up time</title><p>For determination of break-up time, 10 &#x003bc;L of 0.2% fluorescein solution was applied to the inferior fornix, and the participant was asked to close his/her eyes. Using the blue light of the slit lamp, the time in seconds between eyelid opening and the appearance of initial defects in the tear film was measured.

Data analysis of follow-up examinations after five, 10, and 15 minutes (corneal sensitivity) and after 30, 60, and 90 minutes (break-up time and basal secretion) were performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements. In the event of a statistically significant difference, a <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to determine the time point at which a significant difference from baseline examination was observed. Based on multiple testing for significant differences, the level of significance was adapted according to the Bonferroni method as follows: <italic>P</italic> = 0.05/3 = 0.017. <italic>P</italic> = 0.017 was therefore considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses of results between the medications at different time points were performed using analysis of variance. Statistical significance was tested with post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni method to assess significant differences among the medications. In cases of significant differences in the test of homogeneity (Levene&#x02019;s test), analysis of variance could not be performed, so the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used for further statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty healthy subjects (16 women and 14 men) of mean age 32.1 &#x000b1; 8.8 (range 19&#x02013;59) years were included in this study.</p><sec><title>Break-up time</title><p>Due to interindividual variability and for a better comparability, measurement results were normalized to 100% and the relative changes in break-up time were determined.

Recent studies investigating the effect of topical antiglaucoma medication on tear secretion,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-517">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-opth-5-517">12</xref> tear-film stability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-5-517">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-5-517">14</xref> and corneal sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-5-517">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-5-517">16</xref> have mainly focused on the side effects of topical &#x003b2;-blockers. Quantitative investigations of relatively new antiglaucoma medications are limited at the present time. Therefore, this study was conducted to address this issue.</p><p>Latanoprost induced the highest reduction in break-up time, ie, to 50%. In contrast, Thygesen et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-5-517">17</xref> observed no changes in break-up time at 30 minutes and 28 days after latanoprost therapy. There are some methodological differences between our study and the one by Thygesen et al in that in our study, baseline measurement was performed one day before the first drop application, and the amount and concentration of fluorescein used was different in both studies (2.5 &#x003bc;L versus 10 &#x003bc;L and 1% versus 0.2%). Although latanoprost contains the highest amount of BAK (0.02%), the application of BAK alone led to a significant reduction of break-up time (40%), but not until 90 minutes had passed. After 30 and 60 minutes, no significant changes could be observed. As a consequence, it is conceivable that the high concentration of BAK is not only responsible for the reduction in break-up time but also of latanoprost itself. This finding is supported by the result for apraclonidine, containing BAK 0.01%, leading to a reduction of break-up time, although this was not statistically significant.</p><p>The short-term effect of preservative-containing timolol on break-up time showed a reduction of up to 16%, but this was not statistically significant. Strempel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-517">18</xref> reported a reduction of 33% with both timolol and sodium chloride. The differences in percentage may be related to the time interval between drop application and the first break-up time measurement (20 minutes versus 30 minutes). Additionally, the abovementioned study was not a randomized, double-blind crossover study, but was an investigation of different groups of healthy subjects.</p><p>Break-up time was clearly higher after application of the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol than it was after application of dorzolamide and timolol separately. Even after taking the concentrations of BAK into account, and accounting for the approximately one-quarter higher BAK concentration than in the fixed combination, there is no reasonable explanation for our observation. It can only be assumed that the active agents themselves or other contributing factors which are included in the original substances are responsible for this effect on tear-film stability, which is, of course, rather hypothetical and cannot be derived from our data.</p><p>The reduction of basal secretion was highest in the apra-clonidine and brimonidine groups, which can be explained by vasoconstriction and the consequent water and electrolyte secretion by &#x003b1;-agonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-5-517">19</xref> Moreover, &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptors exist in lacrimal gland acinar cells, stimulating the secretion of proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-opth-5-517">20</xref> However, it is not known whether activation of these receptors promotes an increase in tear secretion.</p><p>Basal secretion after latanoprost application was reduced significantly after 60 and 90 minutes (&#x02212;18.6% and &#x02212;20.1%, respectively). In contrast, in an animal model, prostaglandin E1 showed a stimulating effect on tear secretion of the lacrimal gland under the additional effect of &#x003b2;-receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-5-517">21</xref> No change in tear secretion was observed by Thygesen et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-5-517">17</xref> two hours after topical prostaglandin application, which is in contrast with our study results. However, there are three major factors which make a direct comparison of these two studies quite difficult. First, Thygesen et al performed Schirmer&#x02019;s I test instead of the Jones test. Second, baseline measurement of basal secretion was conducted one day (versus 60 minutes) before drop application. Third, patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, a mean age of 69 years, and a drop abstention period of 3&#x02013;4 weeks (versus healthy subjects with a mean age of 32 years) were included. Basal secretion was not significantly affected by the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol, which is surprising, because neither dorzolamide nor timolol alone induced a reduced basal secretion. There is no reasonable explanation for our observation, because sodium chloride and BAK in both concentrations affected basal secretion negatively.</p><p>Timolol induced a reduction in basal secretion (&#x02212;14.3%) which was statistically significant after 90 minutes. Other studies have focused on the long-term effect of timolol on basal secretion. Merte and Merkle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-5-517">11</xref> reported a reduction of 10.2% in basal secretion in 25 patients applying topical timolol in concentrations of 0.1% and 0.5% over two years. Other research reported reductions of 10%&#x02013;25% in basal secretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-5-517">22</xref> In contrast, Kitazawa and Tsuchisaka did not find any reduction in basal secretion after 13 months of topical timolol application.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-5-517">23</xref> However, a temporary reduction in basal secretion after one week of treatment, as measured by fluorometry, was observed by Gobbels et al which resolved after 4&#x02013;7 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-opth-5-517">24</xref> Kuppens et al also observed a significant reduction of basal secretion in glaucoma patients after six months of timolol therapy, in contrast with basal secretion in healthy subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-5-517">25</xref></p><p>In our study, corneal sensitivity decreased by approximately 5% from baseline after 10 minutes. H&#x000f6;h observed a significant reduction in corneal sensitivity at one minute after a single application of timolol 0.5%. After minutes 3, 6, 10, 15 and 30, no statistically significant changes were detected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-5-517">26</xref> Unfortunately, additional data about the short-term effect of &#x003b2;-blockers are only available for pindolol, levobunolol, befunolol, metripranolol, carteolol, bupranolol, and betaxolol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-5-517">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-5-517">31</xref></p><p>Latanoprost showed a decrease of 5% in corneal sensitivity after 10 minutes. In contrast, Thygesen et al did not detect any decrease in corneal sensitivity after 30 minutes or after 28 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-5-517">17</xref></p><p>Consistent with the findings of Kohlhaas et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-5-517">32</xref> in our study we found that dorzolamide caused a reduction in corneal sensitivity after five, 10, and 15 minutes, but this was not statistically significant. In contrast with our study, the study by Kohlhaas et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-5-517">32</xref> determined measurements of corneal sensitivity using an electronic-optical esthesiometer.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first in which the effect of apraclonidine, brimonidine, and the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol on corneal sensitivity has been investigated. Brimonidine and the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol showed the strongest reduction in sensitivity, but only the changes after five minutes (brimonidine) and after 15 minutes (fixed combination) were statistically significant. The statistical significance of the fixed combination is surprising, because neither timolol nor dorzolamide showed a trend towards a reduction of sensitivity.</p><p>There are three major limitations in our study. First, the short-term effects of antiglaucoma medication on break-up time, basal secretion, and corneal sensitivity were investigated only in healthy patients. An extrapolation of our results to patients with glaucoma is limited, because glaucoma therapy is mainly a long-term treatment and, therefore, alterations of the ocular surface with disturbances of tear film-stability are also the result of long-term drop application. Nevertheless, in light of a negative additive effect on tear-film stability and a higher prevalence of dry eye disease in glaucoma patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-opth-5-517">33</xref> it is conceivable that our results, observed in young and healthy participants, are also relevant for glaucoma patients.</p><p>Second, the measurement techniques that we used in our study resulted in considerable inter- and intraindividual variability, which could have influenced the data analysis. However, we chose a double-blind, crossover design, and all antiglaucoma medications in our study were subject to the same measurement procedures and were used in an identical study population. The double-blindness of the study design reduced the subjective influence of both the investigator and the participant on measurement results.</p><p>Third, due to methodological differences compared with other studies and limited availability of reliable data, a comparison of study results was difficult. Nevertheless, despite a certain heterogeneity in our study results, our data might be helpful for making treatment decisions for glaucoma patients who also suffer from ocular surface problems.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-opth-5-517"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Broadway</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Grierson</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02032; Brien</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hitchings</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adverse effects of topical antiglaucoma medication I.
