Participants consumed a product, &#x0201c;AquaCharge Energy Water,&#x0201d; falsely-labeled as containing 200 mg of caffeine but which was actually plain spring water, in one of three conditions: a no social influence condition, a disconfirming social influence condition, and a confirming social influence condition. Results demonstrated that the effect of the product labeling on physiological alertness (systolic blood pressure), psychological alertness (self-reported alertness), functional alertness (cognitive interference), and product endorsement was moderated by social influence: participants experienced more subjective, physiological and functional alertness and stronger product endorsement when they consumed the product in the confirming social influence condition than when they consumed the product in the disconfirming social influence condition. These results suggest that social influence can alter subjective, physiological, and functional responses to a faux product, in this case transforming the effects of plain water.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data are available from Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2275g">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2275g</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data are available from Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2275g">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2275g</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although we are told, &#x0201c;a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,&#x0201d; decades of psychological research establishes that the sensory properties of an object or substance are not the sole determinant of how we experience it. This is especially true for shaping experiences of food and beverage consumption, in which case simply altering the name or label of a food can literally make the product taste sweeter. For example, people enjoy the taste of Coke more when it is consumed in a brand name cup [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], children enjoy the taste of french fries, milk, and carrots more when they believe them to be from McDonald&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and beer infused with vinegar is enjoyed more if it is labeled as having a &#x0201c;special ingredient&#x0201d; than when the actual ingredient is unveiled [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Inspired by the neurological and physiological effects found in clinical trials and placebo research [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a growing body of research suggests that, in addition to influencing perception and behavior, mindsets and expectations can also alter more objective outcomes such as sensory experience and physiological processing. For example, increasing the perceived cost of wine results in heightened activity in areas of the brain related to pleasure and reward when consuming the exact same wine [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, participants who thought they were drinking an indulgent, high-calorie milkshake showed steeper declines in ghrelin, a hunger-inducing hormone, than when they thought that the same shake was a sensible, low-calorie milkshake [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A review of research on placebo caffeine suggests that believing one is drinking caffeinated coffee can result in increases in subjective arousal, physiological arousal, and cognitive performance even though no caffeine has been consumed [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and neuroimaging studies suggest that placebo caffeine is associated with a significant bilateral dopamine release in the thalamus, therefore indicating the placebo caffeine may share some of the same dopaminergic mechanism as does actual caffeine [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly however, the effects of placebo caffeine are not found consistently. Some studies have found no effect of expectancy manipulations [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. And some have found a counter-effect of expectancy manipulations [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The unpredictability and variability of placebo responses in caffeine and other domains leads to an important question: what factors strengthen or weaken the power of placebo effects and thereby influence the overall experience of a product or substance?</p><p>Several moderators of the placebo response have been identified in prior research. For example, studies have shown that the effect of placebo caffeine is weakened when there is more uncertainty about whether or not one has received caffeine, as in the case of double blind manipulations (i.e., telling participants that they may have received either a placebo or the actual caffeine) [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other studies have shown that the effect of placebo caffeine is moderated by the expectancies individuals hold about the effects of caffeine. For example, Kirsch and Weixel [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that placebo caffeine (decaffeinated coffee) improved motor performance among individuals who reported at baseline that they expected it to improve performance and impaired performance for individuals who expected it to impair performance. Similarly, Fillmore and Vogel-Sprott [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] manipulated the expected effects of caffeine and found that those told to expect impairments had worse cognitive performance whereas those who were told to expect improvements had improved performance on the task. Finally, one study has shown that the expectancies of the experimenter might influence the effects of placebo caffeine. For example, Wallach [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found that wellbeing and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were affected by placebo caffeine to a greater degree when the experimenter believed that the placebo caffeine would produce heightened alertness than when the experimenter did not believe in placebo response. Taken together, these studies suggest that the effects of placebo caffeine are moderated by the expectations of the participant and perhaps even the expectations of the experimenter.</p><p>Social influence is another potential moderator of the placebo response. Expectations and beliefs do not exist in a vacuum and instead are dynamically informed by social forces. Social forces supply new information, confirm or correct old information, and serve as a foundational source for our mindsets, beliefs, and expectations [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Individuals often turn to others for information about what foods are good or bad, what diets work or fail, and what medications are most effective. Decades of research support the idea that social forces can change subjective emotions and preferences [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. And more recent research has accumulated to suggest that social information (e.g., about other&#x02019;s attractiveness) can increase or decrease the neurological activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, suggesting that social influence can produce changes in brain areas corresponding to hedonic experience [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>One unexamined question is: can social influence literally &#x0201c;get under the skin&#x0201d; and affect physiological experiences of a product? Literature from medical and placebo research suggests that biological effects of social influence may indeed be possible. Research on mass psychogenic illness (MPI) demonstrates that the collective occurrence of self-reported physical symptoms in the absence of an identifiable pathogen is a relatively common occurrence [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Studies exploring MPI empirically have shown that the belief that one has inhaled a substance described as an environmental toxin, when in fact it is just odorless ambient air, can evoke the experience of corresponding symptoms (e.g., headaches, nausea, and drowsiness). Most relevant to our question of interest is evidence that these symptoms are increased (up to an 11x increase in one study) when participant are in the presence of an ostensible participant (confederate) displaying the expected symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Placebo analgesia research has also demonstrated that pain relief can be conditioned by witnessing another person receive pain relief [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While these medical studies suggest that social influence may affect physiological or visceral experience, they don&#x02019;t actually measure physiological responses, but rather assessed them via self-reports (e.g., of pain or nausea). Further, these studies are limited to a clinical context, but it is likely that the effects of placebos have consequences for everyday life. Thus, an important question remains unanswered: can social influence moderate the physiological effects of a product or experience as indicated by objective physiological measures such as cardiovascular response?</p><p>In summary, previous research has demonstrated that beliefs and expectations about a product or experience induced by labels and other marketing actions can affect physiological and psychological responses to that product [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A separate body of research suggests that social influence can affect psychological responses and possibly physiological response although no study to our knowledge has directly tested the latter. Thus, it remains to be investigated whether the physiological, psychological, and functional responses to a placebo product may be moderated by social influence.</p><p>To test these questions we created a product, &#x0201c;AquaCharge Energy Water.&#x0201d; The bottle&#x02019;s label indicated that the product contained 200 mg of performance and energy-enhancing caffeine. In reality, it was plain spring water. After participants consumed the product, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167121.g001">Fig 1</xref> for study timeline), we compared measures of subjective arousal, physiological arousal and cognitive function known to respond to the effects of caffeine across three conditions: a no social influence condition, in which the participant consumed the water in a room alone; a disconfirming social influence condition, in which the participant consumed the water alongside a confederate who denied the effect of the product; and a confirming social influence condition, where the confederate participant endorsed the effect of the product. In line with research on social influence, we predicted that the effects of product consumption on subjective alertness, physiological alertness, functional alertness, and product endorsement would be moderated by social influence such that the effects would be stronger with an affirming confederate and weaker in the presence of a denying confederate.</p><fig id="pone.0167121.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0167121.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Study Timeline.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0167121.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants and Design</title><p>We recruited 99 females (40% White, 36% Asian, 24% Black,) (mean age = 24 years; SD = 5) from a university study pool. The decision to have at least 30 participants in each condition was predetermined based on published research on MPI, placebo caffeine, and social influence [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Participants were screened at the onset and excluded from the study if they were a smoker, had high blood pressure, or reported intake of alcohol, antihistamines, caffeine, or anything besides water two hours prior to experiment. Participants received $20 for their participation, with the opportunity to earn a $100 gift card reward if they completed the one-week follow-up questionnaire. Participants were randomly assigned to: 1) a no social influence condition (N = 35); 2) a confirming social influence condition (N = 32); or 3) a disconfirming social influence condition (N = 32). To heighten the effect of social influence [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and reduce variability from gender effects on arousal [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], participants were matched to the same-race and same-sex confederates. All procedures, including the consenting and debriefing process, were reviewed and approved by the University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Subjective Alertness</title><p>Because caffeine intake has a robust effect on subjective arousal [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], subjective alertness was measured once pre-consumption (minute 13) and twice post-consumption (minutes 24 and 29) by a well-validated scale [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for the purposes of studying the effects of caffeine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167121.g001">Fig 1</xref> for study timeline). The scale includes fifteen adjectives along a 5-point Likert scale, which factor in three subscales indicating alertness, relaxation, and tension. In the current sample, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was adequate (alertness subscale alpha = .79; tense subscale alpha = .73; relaxation subscale alpha = .86).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Physiological Alertness</title><p>The most consistent effect of caffeine consumption is its effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP) [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, we used SPB as our primary measure of physiological alertness, although we also collected diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Participants&#x02019; systolic blood pressure was measured using a Noninvasive Blood Pressure System (NIBPH100D; Biopac Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA). The NIBPH100D uses a standard upper arm cuff and a finger sensor to estimate continuous blood pressure signals. The signals were recorded with Acqknowledge software (Biopac Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA). SBP responses were averaged across 1-minute epochs. A very small proportion of data (&#x0003c; 2%) could not be scored due to faulty sensors, loss of signal, or noisy signals; however, our models were able to account for this. To address any outliers, we used a 90% winsorization: within each minute, values at the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile or below were set to the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile value; values at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or above were set to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile value. We also tested an alternative approach for dealing with outliers in which we computed the means and standard deviations separately for each of the 32 minutes, and dropped those observations that were greater than or equal to 3 standard deviations from the mean for a given minute. This approach produced consistent results with the winsorizing method (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167121.s003">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167121.s004">S2</xref> Tables).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Functional Alertness</title><p>Because cognitive performance can be affected by caffeine intake [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], participants&#x02019; cognitive interference was measured using the Stroop color-naming task [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], both pre-consumption (minutes 5&#x02013;8) and post-consumption (minutes 25&#x02013;28). Participants were instructed to indicate the font color of a letter string by pressing one of four appropriate color-coded keys as quickly as possible. 20 practice trials and 180 experimental trials were randomized into three variations: on incongruent trials (~60 trials) a color word appeared in a font color different from its semantic meaning (e.g., &#x0201c;BLUE&#x0201d; in red font), whereas confirming trials (~60 trials) displayed a color word that matched its font color (e.g., &#x0201c;BLUE&#x0201d; in blue font). Control trials (~60 trials) consisted of a string of &#x0201c;@&#x0201d;s in one of the four font colors. Stroop interference scores were computed as the difference in response latencies (in milliseconds) between incongruent and congruent trials, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive depletion.

One week following their participation, participants were contacted by email and asked to fill out a short survey asking how many people they had told about the product and for each person to indicate the reasons for telling them (response options included: because a) &#x0201c;I love the product and want people to know about it&#x0201d;; b) &#x0201c;I am just a talker and tell everyone things&#x0201d;; c) &#x0201c;I didn&#x02019;t like the product and wanted them to know I didn&#x02019;t like it&#x0201d;; c) &#x0201c;I thought it was an interesting idea&#x0201d;; d) &#x0201c;I thought they would be interested in it&#x0201d; and; e) &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;). The number of people who were told for reason (a) or reason (d) were included as a fourth item of product endorsement. Finally, as a thank you for completing the one-week follow-up survey, participants were asked to choose whether they wanted to be entered into a lottery to win either a $100 gift card or an $80 gift card and a case of 30 bottles of AquaCharge. This behavioral preference (0 = no, 1 = yes) was included as our fifth item of product endorsement. As an overall measure of product endorsement, we created a composite index combining the items: Since each item was measured on a different metric, we first standardized them before averaging them together to form a single index. Because only 52 subjects completed the one-week follow-up survey, we created two indices of product endorsement, one that contained all five items (alpha = .66) and one that contained only the three items asked at the end of the experiment (alpha = .63). As described in more detail below, both indices produce consistent results.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Caffeine Exposure and Expectancies</title><p>Because caffeine exposure and caffeine expectancy have been shown to alter the effect of caffeine consumption on subjective and physiological alertness [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we measured caffeine exposure (number of days in a typical week they drink caffeine) and caffeine expectancy (11 items, e.g. &#x0201c;Caffeine makes me feel more energetic&#x0201d; (1 = very unlikely to 6 = very likely) (adapted from [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]).

The experimenter explained the procedures and risks documented in the consent form with the participant, following which the participant was given time to review and sign. Upon consenting, participants completed short questionnaires assessing their height, weight, caffeine exposure, and caffeine expectancies. Participants were then directed into a room in which the ostensible participant (confederate) was present (confirming and disconfirming confederate conditions) or into an empty room with no other participant present (no confederate condition). The participant and (for the two social influence conditions) the confederate were then connected to the blood pressure machine to record SBP responses after which they completed a Stroop task (minutes 4&#x02013;6).

Specifically, we fit multilevel models that contained two submodels: a Level-1 submodel that described how the outcome changed over time for a given participant, and Level-2 submodels that predicted key parameters of the Level-1 model as a function of condition, controlling for blood pressure during the baseline period (minute 1 to 13). We also included time-varying predictors at Level 1 when these allowed us to test additional hypotheses beyond effects on basic linear slope; these permitted intercepts or slopes to vary by condition as a function of different time periods associated with key inflection points in the experimental procedure. Potential inflection points included minute 14, when participants first began drinking the beverage; minute 16, after they finished drinking the water; and minute 19, when the confederate first spoke in the two confederate conditions. The best fitting model contained only a shift in slope at minute 19. As a supplemental analysis, we also analyzed subjective alertness (measured at three points: minutes 13, 24, and 29) using a longitudinal multilevel model (the cross-sectional analysis for this outcome is described below).

They believed that they were drinking water infused with caffeine, when in fact it was just plain water. Our results demonstrated that the effect of this belief on physiological, psychological and functional alertness was moderated by social influence: participants experienced more subjective alertness, physiological alertness (SBP) and functional alertness (cognitive interference) after consuming the product in the confirming social influence condition than when they consumed the placebo product in the disconfirming social influence condition. Furthermore, the social influence manipulation proved to have effects on product endorsement. Participants in the confirming social influence condition more strongly endorsed the product than participants in the disconfirming social influence condition.</p><p>Comparisons between the social influence conditions and the no confederate condition were less consistent but in the expected direction. For subjective alertness, functional alertness (cognitive interference), and physiological alertness (SBP), the disconfirming confederate condition was significantly different than the no confederate condition on the relevant parameters; by contrast, there were no significant differences between the confirming confederate condition and the no confederate condition for these outcomes. With respect to product endorsement, confirming confederate condition participants had significantly higher levels of product endorsement than participants in the no confederate condition, while levels of product endorsement in the disconfirming confederate condition were statistically indistinguishable from those in the no confederate condition. Taken together, these results suggest that whether the effects of social influence are driven more strongly by confirming or disconfirming influence may differ depending on the outcome measure in question. In particular, our results might suggest that product endorsement is moderated by social influence because confirming social influence boosts it whereas product experience (as indicated by the physiological, psychological, and functional effects of the product) is moderated by social influence because disconfirming social influence diminishes it. Of course, any non-significant results may have instead been driven by inadequate statistical power. Therefore, future research with larger samples and in other settings is needed to more deeply understand the different effects of confirming versus disconfirming social influence on various outcome measures.</p><p>It is also important to note that participants in the disconfirming confederate condition still reported increases in subjective alertness compared to baseline (even though their increases were significantly lower than the increases found in the confirming confederate condition) while also exhibiting significant reductions in blood pressure and worse cognitive interference as measured by the Stroop task. These patterns may suggest that the effects of disconfirming social influence assert a stronger effect on measures that are less likely to be biased by self-report (i.e., physiological responses). Once again however, any non-significant results may have instead been driven by inadequate statistical power and thus future research with larger samples and in other settings is needed to parse apart the different effects of confirming versus disconfirming social influence on conscious and subconscious indices.</p><p>Although future research is needed to more deeply explore the intricacies and nuances of disconfirming and confirming influence on various outcome measures, our results inform and extend the literature on social influence, placebo research and product consumption in two important ways. First, researchers have traditionally struggled to distinguish the effects of social influence on true changes in preference versus mere public compliance [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent research has informed this debate by employing neurological techniques that suggest that social influence can produce changes in brain areas corresponding to hedonic experience [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results extend this research and suggest that social influence may also take hold on physiological and functional responses, such as differences in SBP and cognitive interference to a faux stimulant.</p><p>Second, our research extends the existing body of research on placebo responses by furthering our understanding of moderating variables that influence the efficacy of placebo effects. The finding that social influence may strengthen placebo response when the expected effect is endorsed (compared to when the effect is denied) may help explain why placebo effects are found in some conditions and not in others [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]: social forces may strengthen or weaken the expected effects. Although the results herein only demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of placebo caffeine, the influence of social modeling on placebo response are likely to be relevant to other domains where placebo effects occur, such as in medicine. Patients are not only influenced by the beliefs and expectations of their doctor, nurse, or caretaker but also by friends, family, and peer-patients who share or have shared the same conditions, medications, and treatments. While much of the science practice of medicine aims to parse out the effects of non-specific or social and psychological factors, the results herein suggest that such factors should not be seen as superfluous but, instead, as potentially active ingredients in clinical care.</p><p>Our findings are interesting in light of the increasing popularity of &#x0201c;aquaceuticals&#x0201d; and other products that contain active ingredients while claiming to have effects that are not scientifically supported. If these products are actually producing the claimed effects&#x02014;even if the cause of the change is driven primarily by the psychosocial context as opposed to the ingredients themselves&#x02014;does that make the selling of those products and their growing popularity more legitimate? This is a complex question that is beyond the scope of this paper, but our results do remind us that to understand the true effects of any product or substance we must consider carefully the psychosocial setting in which it is consumed.</p><p>When reflecting on the legitimacy of marketing claims, it is important to note that the differences in blood pressure in our study did not result from an increase from baseline levels; instead, after the initial placebo effect that began at minute 14, overall blood pressure dropped during the study procedure and this drop was exacerbated in the disconfirming confederate social influence condition but eliminated in the confirming confederate social influence condition. This decline in blood pressure is to be expected given the prolonged sedentary behavior throughout the course of the experiment and is a common occurrence in similar experimental paradigms. However, future research aimed at understanding the effects of the expectation alone would benefit from including a control condition in which participants consumed the same bottled water without the belief that it was caffeinated. While research has already established that placebo caffeine can increase blood pressure response as compared to decaffeinated control [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our primary aim was to test the moderating role of social influence on physiological responses and the differences in decline are indicative of the impact of social influence on physiological arousal.</p><p>Although the results of this study provide important data on the impact of social influence on product experience and endorsement, several questions remain. First, how did the presence of a confederate participant influence physiological or functional responding? Although it is possible that there was an influence from the mere presence of the confederate (Zajonc, 1965), the same presence of a confederate either increased or decreased the effects depending on what the confederate said about the product experience. A more likely mechanism is that what the confederate said about the product experience altered the response expectancies of the participant, which in turn influenced the participant&#x02019;s physiological and functional responding. In the current study we did not measure the momentary change in expectations because we were concerned that asking participants about their expectations after the social encounter would lead them to question the study guise, and also these expectations would have occurred after random assignment. Thus, more research is needed to thoroughly understand the precise mechanisms (i.e. increased expectancy or other avenues) through which social influence can affect physiological and functional responding. For example, such research might deliberately recruit participants with different levels of baseline caffeine expectancies and assess how they respond to a caffeine placebo product in the presence of a confirming or disconfirming confederate. It is possible that the greatest social influence would occur for high caffeine expectancy participants paired with a confirming confederate and for low caffeine expectancy participants paired with a disconfirming confederate because the confederate would be providing social verification for the participants&#x02019; beliefs, thereby strengthening those beliefs [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Future research should also examine the effects of consuming the product with another person (or confederate participant) who does not verbally endorse or deny the effect of the product to help disentangle the effects of the social information versus social presence alone. It may be the case that just consuming the product in the presence of another could introduce an element of social influence (i.e., the participant might look over to see what the confederate is doing, and infer from the confederate&#x02019;s non-verbal behaviors how they are responding to the product). Therefore, future research should also include measures regarding what the target person believes the other is feeling in response to the product.</p><p>Second, in today&#x02019;s world, social influence is often transmitted through technology (via social media, email, etc.). Does technologically-transmitted social influence have the same effect as in-person social influence? There is evidence that the social modeling of a placebo analgesic is effective both when presented in person and when participants view a recording of a participant [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, more work is needed to understand the context in which social influence is likely to have the most potent effects. One question that remains is the degree to which social information is merely providing additional information about the benefits of the product or if there is something inherently unique about a human connection that does or does not provide direct social verification [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Third, what is the relative weight of impact from social influence and objective qualities of a product, substance, or experience? We intentionally chose water as our product, rather than something like decaffeinated coffee, in an effort to isolate the effect of social influence from conditioning or other effects that might result from the <italic>smell</italic> of decaffeinated coffee [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Future research is needed to understand how social influence interacts with sensory properties to engineer the ultimate impact of a product, medication, or experience.</p><p>Finally, what are the boundary conditions of these effects? In the current study we chose to study women only and to match the race and gender of the confederate with the participant to reduce variability and maximize perceived similarity between the participant and the confederate. According to Bandura&#x02019;s Social Learning Theory, male subjects are more prone to imitate male models and female subjects more prone to imitate female models [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Research exploring social modeling on placebo responding has shown mixed effects of gender, with some studies demonstrating greater effects with matched confederates [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167121.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], others demonstrating greater effects with male models [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and still others showing no gender differences in responding or matching affect [<xref rid="pone.0167121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The present study is limited in its ability to inform this debate and or make claims outside of female-female interactions.</p><p>Though much remains to be explored, our results are intriguing in demonstrating that social influence&#x02014;working hand in hand with the psychological construction of sensory input&#x02014;can alter physiological and functional response to a product, in this case changing the experience of, and attitudes toward, simple water.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167121.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Effects of condition on subjective alertness: longitudinal analyses.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167121.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167121.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>All AquaChargeWater.com website pages.</title><p>The AquaCharge Energy Water website was designed specifically for the purposes of study by Gibbs Graphics.
