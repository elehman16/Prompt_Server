Normal populations may show little change on clinically validated outcome measures, control groups may experience contamination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> and, because the effects of parenting on health and social outcomes appear to be life long, cost-effectiveness, essential to inform decision making, may be difficult to establish.</p><p>With the exception of the Triple P,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> a suite of parenting interventions which can be offered in combination or singly, trials of universal parenting programmes are relatively rare. Two brief group-based parenting programmes have been subject to randomised controlled trials (RCTs); the first a cluster trial in Australia with parents of 8-month-olds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> and the second an individually randomised trial in Germany with preschoolers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> In these trials, although there has been some indication of changes in parental attitudes, no changes in parenting or child outcomes have been observed. In contrast, trials of Triple P have been successful in showing effects on parenting and child behavioural outcomes including child abuse. Various combinations of universal approaches to Triple P have been subject to large quasi experimental designs at area level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> and smaller studies with individual randomised designs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></p><p>The Family Links Nurturing Programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> (FLNP) has much in common with Incredible Years and the group-based component of Triple P and, like these programmes, meets the criteria for effective parenting programmes specified in the recently updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of conduct disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> Like Incredible Years and Triple P, FLNP not only covers the principles of positive behaviour management but also addresses the emotional underpinning of problem behaviour and the effect on parenting of the parents&#x02019; own childhood experiences. It therefore focuses as much on the child's and parent's emotional and social well-being as it does on problem behaviour. The evidence base for FLNP includes qualitative research showing that parents recruited through schools value the programme and perceive it to have an impact on family relationships, children's behaviour and their own mental health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>; &#x02018;before and after&#x02019; studies in community groups showing impact on self-report measures of relationship quality and well-being<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>; and routine evaluation by parents attending programmes showing that the great majority value the programme.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></p><p>We evaluated the effectiveness and cost utility (as part of a cost consequences analysis) of the programme in an RCT in four deprived areas of South Wales.

It offers support to help parents build on pre-existing parenting skills, use positive behaviour management, communication and relationship strategies and look after their own emotional needs, so they can parent more effectively.</p><p>The programme is run by a minimum of two facilitators trained over a 4-day programme with a refresher day 1&#x02005;year later. As part of the contract provider, organisations agree to offer two supervision sessions to facilitators during the course of each programme.

The programme was delivered as per usual practice in these localities with no additional training or supervision. It was delivered in term times and entry to the group was closed after the third session In order to deliver viable groups, parents who were not taking part in the trial attended groups with parents who were. Families randomised to the control arm of the trial were offered usual practice, including advice and other forms of support available in the locality during the trial period.

Factor analysis of the HOME observations produced two scales as in Sure Start&#x02014;responsivity and acceptance. Overall factor analysis showed very similar findings to those derived in Sure Start.

The grade and mix of staff used to deliver FLNP programmes varied within and between each study site and so costs were estimated for each site and the mean cost per programme and per family attending derived from these estimates.

Assuming a drop-out rate from the trial of approximately 20%; this sample size was sufficient to detect a standardised effect size of 0.4 at 85% power and &#x003b1; of 0.05 in the primary outcome measure if there was no clustering and a standardised effect size of 0.6 allowing for clustering by course with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.178 or less; for this sample size calculation, we conservatively imagined clustering within control families as well as intervention families. As the sample size was specified in terms of the number of families rather than the number of children, correlation between siblings in the same family was not considered at the design stage. No interim analyses were planned or conducted.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation</title><p>We stratified randomisation by site and maintained balance between groups within each stratum using a minimisation method using computer-generated random numbers to give an equal chance of allocation to each group when groups within the stratum were balanced and an increased chance (0.667) of allocation to the smaller group when there was an imbalance within the stratum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref> The randomisation service at Warwick Clinical Trials Unit generated the random allocation sequence and informed the FLNP co-ordinators of group allocation following recruitment of a family by the researchers. This ensured the concealment from both families and researchers prior to initial consent being given and from the researchers throughout the trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Blinding</title><p>The participants and FLNP coordinators knew the allocation to intervention or waiting list control. The researchers were blind to group allocation, except on rare occasions when families disclosed their assignment status during postcourse interviews. Researchers who did not know the families coded videos and speech samples and all data analyses were carried out blind to group allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Analysis strategy</title><p>The primary analysis for the primary as well as secondary outcome measures was carried out by treatment allocated. Positive change scores indicate a benefit to parenting or well-being. A per protocol analysis compared outcomes for families in which parents did not attend an FLNP session to outcomes for families in which parents attended six or more FLNP sessions. For both treatment allocated and per protocol analysis, we report complete cases analysis results for all outcomes. In all analyses, we fitted multilevel models with a random effects term for course and for outcomes corresponding to individual child data and a random effects term for family. For the families in the control, the between-family variance was assumed to be equal to that between families in the intervention group attending different courses; terms in the model were thus included as if each control family formed their own course, so that they contributed to estimating the between course random effect variance. For sensitivity analysis, we performed multiple imputation using predictive mean matching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref> and results are reported for the primary outcomes and SF-12. For each outcome, we created 10 imputed datasets using the Hmisc package in the R statistical programme and combined the analysis results from the 10 imputed datasets using Rubin rules.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The groups had similar baseline characteristics in terms of gender, employment, ethnicity, parents&#x02019; education and parenting scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002851TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013002851TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of families</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FLNP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of parents</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">143</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">143</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of children</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">145</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">150</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative parenting: mean (SD)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.07 (10.20)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.61 (11.36)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Supportive parenting: mean (SD)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.00 (2.64)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.88 (2.92)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parent gender: n (%) of females</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">139 (99.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">136 (95.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of parents with partner: n (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49 (34.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 (32.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parent working: n (%) working</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">112 (78.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">112 (78.9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Parent's ethnicity: n (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White British</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">103 (72.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 (69.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White other</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (14.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (15.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Black African</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (2.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Black Caribbean</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Asian Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (6.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (4.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Asian Chinese</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (4.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (8.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Parent's education: n (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;NVQ</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (18.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28 (20.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;GCSE/O levels</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 (32.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (28.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;A levels</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (11.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (10.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Degree</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (12.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (10.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Higher degree</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (2.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (2.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;None</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (17.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (17.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (5.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (10.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>FLNP, Family Links Nurturing Programme.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="s3a"><title>Uptake of intervention</title><p>Forty-eight families (34%) randomly allocated to the intervention (FLNP) group did not attend any sessions, a further 27 (19%) discontinued the programme in the first three sessions.

Although recruitment needed to be extended both geographically and temporally,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> the full sample size was recruited and follow-up rates were exemplary.</p><p>The results of the treatment allocated analyses showed no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups on any of the outcome measures. For most outcomes, improvement was observed in both groups with families in the FLNP arm of the trial improving more than those in the control arm by a small and not statistically significant amount, the differences observed being very much smaller than those which the trial was powered to detect.</p><p>The 3-month results suggest that differences in parental well-being were greatest at the end of the programme and declined over the next 6&#x02005;months. In contrast, the observed differences in child well-being as measured by the PedsQL increased over time.</p><p>Our economic analyses do not provide evidence that FLNP represents value for money, but are based on an estimate of parental utility alone. A recent study of the cost-effectiveness of the Incredible Years Programme in a targeted population on key outcomes in later life has demonstrated favourable long-run economic returns.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></p><sec id="s4a1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The most important challenges were well-recognised threats to health promotion and disease-prevention trials; those of poor exposure among the intervention group, contamination of the control group and varying programme fidelity. Our predicted programme non-attendance and dropout rate in the first three sessions, based on the provision of this programme in other settings,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> was 16%. In the event, the rate was 53%. It is possible that the trial setting may have influenced attendance rates by preferentially recruiting families who were not ready to change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> as such families were more likely to be willing to be randomised. Testing the effectiveness of an existing programme in a pragmatic trial makes it challenging to restrict access to the programmes in control group families and in this trial 10% of the control group violated the rules of the trial and attended an FLNP course before the 9-month follow-up. A further 9% of control parents accessed different parenting support courses available in the locality, but only one of the intervention group families accessed any other type of parenting support. The main trial results therefore compare the changes in parenting and family well-being among a group in which just under one in two parents were exposed to the FLNP with changes among a control group in which roughly one in five parents attended the FLNP or other parenting support programme. Had these factors been entirely responsible for the trial findings, however, we would have expected to see significant results in the per protocol analysis. Changes in the latter analysis were larger than those in the as-allocated analysis, but still did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Our assessment of programme fidelity was constrained by costs. We showed that programmes run in one of the allocated sites did not meet the standards for running FLNP in all respects. It is important to note that the sites running programmes with the highest level of fidelity were those with the highest costs and those with the lowest fidelity, the cheapest to run. We attempted an analysis of results by programme fidelity and also by area, and no statistically significant differences between the groups were found. It may be that our estimates of fidelity were inadequate being based on a random sampling of only one session in most of the programmes.</p><p>A further limitation of our study is the lack of information on the effect of the programme on child QALYs. FLNP aims, by improving parenting, to improve children's well-being as well as parent's well-being. In our CUA, we were able only to include change in parental QALYs and the measure used (SF-6D) did not prove sensitive to variation in parental well-being as measured by other instruments. Given that non-significant positive changes in PedsQL scores were considerably greater (&#x0003e;1 SE) than the non-significant changes in parental SF-6D scores, including child QALYS could greatly increase cost utility estimates. If it becomes possible in future to estimate QALYs from PedsQL and adopt sensitive measures of parental well-being, it will be possible to revisit these estimates. If, as has been suggested, parenting has a life-course impact on health and social outcomes the relatively short-term outcomes possible in RCTs are inadequate to assess the full benefits and cost savings.</p><p>Despite inclusion in data collection, little self-reported information was provided by parents (and verified by contact with the research team) at follow-up on the use of health, social service, educational psychology or criminal justice service contacts during the course of the trial, attributable to these events or to involvement in the FLNP, with insufficient data to undertake any meaningful analysis. Several of these services are, however, unlikely to be relevant to children of 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;years. This has limited the ability of the study to consider the full range of perspectives in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Meanings and implications of the study</title><p>Although outcome measures improved more in the FLNP group than in the control group, the results of this trial fail to show that FLNP improved parenting or child or parental well-being more than could be expected by chance and do not provide evidence that FLNP represents value for money. Three main reasons for these negative results warrant consideration. The first is that the FLNP may not be effective in changing parenting in a universal setting. It would appear that programmes like Triple P which focus primarily on behaviour management are effective in a universal setting and this may simply be a better approach. Triple P is a more costly programme than FLNP. It can be offered more intensively with five different levels of intervention for different levels of need, including universal media coverage, and well-resourced trials have been able to offer the programme in this way. FLNP is a stand-alone group-based programme which may work synergistically with other parenting interventions including media coverage. In this trial, both intervention and control group parents were exposed to general parenting interventions available in the Flying Start setting.</p><p>FLNP aims to address the promotion of mental well-being in parents and children as well as behaviour management, thus potentially influencing resilience to a variety of mental health problems including anxiety and depression throughout the life course. In this way, it does more to address the aims of the current government strategy No Health without Mental Health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> than the better researched behaviour management programmes. However, as we failed to identify any change in parenting or family well-being as a result of the trial, it may be that the contents and approach of the programme need revisiting.</p><p>The second reason why the trial may have produced negative results is that the programme was implemented poorly in this setting. Even Triple P has shown negative results in independent pragmatic trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref> due in all likelihood to inadequate implementation. This trial measured changes due to the FLNP in an established setting where no attempt was made to improve implementation for the trial. It may be that the training and supervision of these facilitators were not sufficient to maintain high-quality provision. Our assessment of fidelity was constrained by resources. Although it was judged as adequate by the provider in three of the four settings, we did not examine every session and would not have known if problems had arisen in other sessions. We were also unable to assess the quality of supervision offered to facilitators by the provider organisations.</p><p>Finally, the trial may have produced negative results because of the research design.</p><p>It is possible that the outcome measures we selected were not sensitive to changes which did occur. The observations in the HOME inventory, the 5&#x02005;min speech sample and the meal-time video were made over a relatively short visit and some parents refused the video.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> Although objective measures are highly valued, the parenting recorded is that of parents on their best behaviour. Against this, we did not identify changes in parent or child well-being either.</p><p>The trial was powered to capture effect sizes reported for parenting trials in general most of which are in clinical or targeted settings where opportunities for improvement are greater than in universal populations. It may be that the trial was underpowered to pick up the level of changes that could represent a valuable change at the population level where smaller differences have great impact because of the numbers involved.</p><p>The open access early years centre setting certainly presented challenges including the contamination of the control group due to the ready availability of parenting support, and unusually low levels of attendance at the programme. We have also identified in a separate study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> the possibility of a threat to the external validity of the trial. Parents who consented to randomisation may have been different from those who would normally sign up for the FLNP in that some parents did not recognise a need for the programme for themselves and their families. They may therefore have been less ready to change and indeed had less need to change than those who attend the FLNP in the absence of a trial. Together, these factors undoubtedly reduced the study's power to detect any impact of the FLNP.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Future research</title><p>Overall, we have concluded that uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and cost utility of the FLNP in universal settings and that further investigation is required. It may be that, given the multiple challenges faced by trials of this nature, studies need to have more statistical power, be based in settings where contamination can be controlled, employ outcomes that are known to change during the course of the programme and where very high-quality programme implementation can be ensured. In the meanwhile, the results of this trial provide estimates to inform the design of a future trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e228" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002851.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e229" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002851.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to all the families who took part in this research project and to all the Sure Start/Flying Start staff including Health Visitors who facilitated recruitment by discussing this project with eligible families.
