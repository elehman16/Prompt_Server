IN subdissociative (INSD) ketamine may offer a safe and efficacious alternative to IN fentanyl and may decrease overall opioid use during the emergency department (ED) stay. This study examines the feasibility of a larger, multicentre clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of INSD ketamine to IN fentanyl and the potential role for INSD ketamine in reducing total opioid medication usage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This double-blind, randomised controlled, pilot trial will compare INSD ketamine (1&#x02005;mg/kg) to IN fentanyl (1.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/kg) for analgesia in 80 children aged 4&#x02013;17&#x02005;years with acute pain from a suspected, single extremity fracture. The primary safety outcome for this pilot trial will be the frequency of cumulative side effects and adverse events at 60&#x02005;min after drug administration. The primary efficacy outcome will be exploratory and will be the mean reduction of pain scale scores at 20&#x02005;min. The study is not powered to examine efficacy. Secondary outcome measures will include the total dose of opioid pain medication in morphine equivalents/kg/hour (excluding study drug) required during the ED stay, number and reason for screen failures, time to consent, and the number and type of protocol deviations. Patients may receive up to 2 doses of study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the local institutional review board and the study data safety monitoring board.

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The pharmacokinetics of IN drug administration dampen the rapidity of drug absorption and minimise side effects, yet still achieve therapeutic drug levels and adequate analgesia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> IN fentanyl is the most frequently used and most widely studied IN analgesic with a reported bioavailability of 71%.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In one prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, IN fentanyl at 150&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/kg demonstrated efficacy similar to IV morphine at 0.1&#x02005;mg/kg.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> IN fentanyl serves an ideal comparator in this study for its demonstrated benefit specific to children with orthopaedic injuries presenting to the ED.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We believe intranasal, subdissociative (INSD) ketamine offers a safe and efficacious alternative to IN fentanyl with the potential added benefit of decreasing overall opioid use during the ED stay. Ketamine has a known bioavailability of 45&#x02013;50% when administered through the IN route and standard 1&#x02005;mg/kg doses provide absorbed drug levels in the subdissociative range.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Ketamine is used increasingly for acute and chronic pain in children and adults with sickle cell disease and cancer.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> Ketamine has been found to be safe and effective for analgesia in the prehospital, battlefield, postoperative and ED settings.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The largest double-blind, randomised, paediatric trial to date took place in Australia and examined the safety and the mean reduction in pain between INSD ketamine and IN fentanyl.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> At 30&#x02005;min, median pain scale score reductions on a 100&#x02005;mm scale were 45&#x02005;mm for ketamine and 40&#x02005;mm for fentanyl (difference 5&#x02005;mm; 95% CI &#x02212;10 to 20) by combined results of the Faces Pain Scales-Revised (FPS-R; ages 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;years) and visual analogue scale (ages 7 and above).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> For fentanyl, 15 patients reported adverse events (AEs) and for ketamine 28 patients reported AEs, including dizziness, drowsiness, bad taste in the mouth, nausea, itchy nose and dysphoria, and hallucinations.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The authors concluded that both agents were acceptable for the relief of pain, but ketamine was associated with more minor AEs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This single study was underpowered to establish the non-inferiority of INSD ketamine. The study was also underpowered to examine the incidence of rare but important AEs such as laryngospasm (ketamine) or chest wall rigidity (fentanyl). The study did not examine the role of INSD ketamine in reducing the overall use of opioid analgesics in the treatment of acute fracture pain in children.</p><p>Animal studies have demonstrated that the NMDA receptor may play a role in opioid tolerance, and ketamine has been shown in rat models to prevent fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia by enhancing the antinociceptive activity of morphine.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is unclear if IN ketamine reduces opioid consumption in the treatment of painful conditions in the acute ED setting. Three studies of IN ketamine in the ED setting reported the number of patients requiring additional opioids for rescue analgesia. An observational study of 40 patients aged 11&#x02013;79&#x02005;years with pain treated in the ED using doses of intranasal ketamine of 0.5&#x02013;0.75&#x02005;mg/kg reported that three patients failed to complete the protocol at 60&#x02005;min because opioid rescue analgesia was required.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A pilot, observational study of 28 children aged 3&#x02013;13&#x02005;years with fracture pain examined the effectiveness of IN ketamine for analgesia and recommended a dose of 1&#x02005;mg/kg to achieve pain control.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Eight patients or 33% required additional opioid analgesia.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In contrast, a randomised controlled, double-blind trial of adult patients treated for pain in the ED compared IV ketamine at 0.3&#x02005;mg/kg to IV morphine at 0.1&#x02005;mg/kg and found no difference in the incidence of rescue fentanyl analgesia at 30 or 60&#x02005;min.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> IN ketamine provides pain relief up to 1&#x02005;hour and may reduce opioid usage during the ED stay on this basis alone.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

Suspected fractures will be defined as any deformity or pain to palpation that the triage nurse or treating physician deems as a potential fracture. Standard clinical practice at our hospital is for nurses to use the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (FPR-Scale) score (for children aged 4&#x02013;10&#x02005;years) or the Adult Pain Rating Scale score (for children aged 11&#x02013;17&#x02005;years) to quantify pain in triage. The triage nurses are asked to page a research associate for any patient with a suspected fracture and a Wong-Baker FPR-Scale score of &#x02265;4 or an Adult Pain Rating Scale score of &#x02265;3. These scales are suboptimal for research and are used solely to screen potentially eligible patients. The FPS-R (for children aged 4&#x02013;10&#x02005;years) and VAS scores (for children aged 11&#x02013;17&#x02005;years) are obtained after consent as baseline measures of pain and used thereafter as study measures.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with the following characteristics will be excluded:

The lists will be generated using SAS Enterprise Guide V.6.1 and the RANUNI function. To maintain allocation concealment, assignments will be placed in consecutively numbered, sealed opaque study packets in the ED and only opened once a child is deemed eligible.</p><p>Blinded study labels in the study packets and prepared by the research pharmacy will be affixed to the study drug syringe and scanned into the electronic medication administration record without revealing the treatment arm. The randomisation assignment and dosing table will then be sealed in a separate envelope in the study packet and stored. The investigational pharmacy or treatment team may unblind a patient if needed. Randomisation tables, drug logs and all unblinded study documents will be maintained by the research pharmacy. The study pack will include a separate sealed opaque envelope with instructions for a second dose of the study medication.</p><p>The drugs will be administered in similar volumes with identical administration procedures. The drugs are similar in colour and odourless. The drug vial is not viewed at the bedside and both drugs are administered in similar syringes attached to a mucosal atomiser device. The participants, treating physicians and outcome assessors will remain blinded to the group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Data collection and management</title><p>Research coordinators will document AEs (using a standardised checklist) every 5&#x02005;min for the first 15&#x02005;min after medication administration and then every 30&#x02005;min for the next 2&#x02005;hours. Vital signs and pain scale assessments will be repeated every 10&#x02005;min for the first 30&#x02005;min and then every 30&#x02005;min for the next 2&#x02005;hours. Online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> D details the schedule of study measures. All coordinators were trained on how to collect study measures prior to study initiation. Final assessments are made at 6&#x02005;hours unless the patient was already discharged to home.</p><p>Study data will be collected on a structured case report form and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for importing data from external sources. Data discrepancies and missing data will be reviewed weekly with the principal investigator and research manager. Confidentiality of participant personal information (date of birth, age, birthdate, medical record number) will be protected via secured storage using REDCap.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>For assessing of feasibility of a multicentre trial, we will estimate the proportion of patients consented out of all potentially eligible patients, the time to consent, the proportion successfully randomised and the proportion with blinding maintained. For assessing safety profiles, the two treatment groups will be compared on demographic and baseline variables using Student's t-test for interval data, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for ordinal data, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test for categorical data. The primary safety analysis will compare the proportion of adverse events (AEs) among children randomised to receive either INSD ketamine or IN fentanyl for pain control in the ED. Proportions and 95% CIs will be calculated for each AE and compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Since we will stratify the randomisation by age (4&#x02013;10 and 11&#x02013;17&#x02005;years), we will use multiple logistic regression to compare the rate of any AE between ketamine and fentanyl controlling for age. The Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to compare the mean total dose of opioid pain medication in morphine equivalents/kg/hour required during ED evaluation. We hypothesise the ketamine group will have lower use of opioid pain medication. SAS Enterprise Guide V.6.1 will be used for all analyses. A two-tailed p value of &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. We will also use this study to gain preliminary estimates of SDs for pain scores since the larger trial for this study would have a non-inferiority hypothesis with respect to ketamine being as effective for pain management as fentanyl. As an exploratory analysis, we will estimate the mean pain scores and corresponding 95% CIs over time for the two groups. We will also estimate the correlation among measurements within the same child over time which will be needed for planning future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Monitoring</title><p>A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will operate in accordance with the guidelines established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in &#x02018;Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committee&#x02019; jointly published by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for the FDA, OMB Control No. 0910-0581, March 2006, expiration date 10/31/2015 (updated guidance will be used as available).</p><p>The DSMB will be chaired by the medical director of a paediatric ED and include several other clinicians including a paediatric intensivist and a biostatistician.</p><p>The study biostatistics team will provide a report to the DSMB after the first 5 patients, and then after every 10 patients (or in the event of a serious, unanticipated and related AE) to monitor the data for quality control and will review the occurrence of AEs.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Auditing</title><p>The study will undergo an independent audit conducted by the monitors/educators from the Institution's Office of Clinical and Translational Research at least once during the study.
