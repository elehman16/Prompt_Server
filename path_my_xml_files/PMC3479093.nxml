There is no RCT evidence showing how to do this. Systematic reviews suggest feedback is most effective and call for long term well designed RCTs, applying behavioural theory to intervention design to optimise effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three year stepped wedge cluster RCT of a feedback intervention testing hypothesis that the intervention was more effective than routine practice in 16 English/Welsh Hospitals (16 Intensive Therapy Units [ITU]; 44 Acute Care of the Elderly [ACE] wards) routinely implementing a national cleanyourhands campaign). Intervention-based on Goal &#x00026; Control theories. Repeating 4 week cycle (20 mins/week) of observation, feedback and personalised action planning, recorded on forms. Computer-generated stepwise entry of all hospitals to intervention. Hospitals aware only of own allocation. Primary outcome: direct blinded hand hygiene compliance (%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All 16 trusts (60 wards) randomised, 33 wards implemented intervention (11 ITU, 22 ACE). Mixed effects regression analysis (all wards) accounting for confounders, temporal trends, ward type and fidelity to intervention (forms/month used).</p></sec><sec><title>Intention to Treat Analysis</title><p>Estimated odds ratio (OR) for hand hygiene compliance rose post randomisation (1.44; 95% CI 1.18, 1.76;p&#x0003c;0.001) in ITUs but not ACE wards, equivalent to 7&#x02013;9% absolute increase in compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Per-Protocol Analysis for Implementing Wards</title><p>OR for compliance rose for both ACE (1.67 [1.28&#x02013;2.22]; p&#x0003c;0.001) &#x00026; ITUs (2.09 [1.55&#x02013;2.81];p&#x0003c;0.001) equating to absolute increases of 10&#x02013;13% and 13&#x02013;18% respectively. Fidelity to intervention closely related to compliance on ITUs (OR 1.12 [1.04, 1.20];p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003 per completed form) but not ACE wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite difficulties in implementation, intention-to-treat, per-protocol and fidelity to intervention, analyses showed an intervention coupling feedback to personalised action planning produced moderate but significant sustained improvements in hand-hygiene compliance, in wards implementing a national hand-hygiene campaign.

Adequate alcohol hand-rub data was available for 37 wards, 23 of which implemented the intervention (10 ITUs and 13 ACE) and 14 of which did not implement the intervention (14 ACE wards).

This confirmed the original trial hypothesis, despite difficulties in implementation and a downwards temporal trend in hand-hygiene compliance over the study period. The effect was stronger on ITUs, where it was easier to implement and where its effectiveness increased with fidelity to intervention. The effect of the intervention on implementing wards equated to an absolute difference in hand-hygiene compliance of 13&#x02013;18% on ITUs, and of 10&#x02013;13% on ACE wards. This was relatively constant over time, consistent with a sustained effect.</p><p>The principal strength of the study is that it met the requirements of systematic reviews calling for large well-designed long-term trials of hand-hygiene interventions <xref rid="pone.0041617-Naikoba1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> which apply behavioural theory to intervention design <xref rid="pone.0041617-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Michie2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Glanz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The stepped wedge design increases power as wards act as their own control and the extended duration allows assessment of sustainability <xref rid="pone.0041617-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The ability to control for temporal trends allows effectiveness to be assessed even against a background of a successful <xref rid="pone.0041617-Stone2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> national hand-hygiene campaign.</p><p>The study&#x02019;s main limitation was that the intervention was more difficult to implement than in the exploratory trial <xref rid="pone.0041617-McAteer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Such difficulties are well documented <xref rid="pone.0041617-Grimshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> in healthcare settings, but may also reflect changes in the National Health Service, including having to compete with other quality improvement initiatives. Cross-sectional interviews in the exploratory trial suggested that implementation might increase if the intervention were an integral part of a hospital&#x02019;s audit programme, carried out by infection control or ward staff with general responsibilities for assessment and appraisal, with more than one co-ordinator per ward, each having protected time for delivering the intervention <xref rid="pone.0041617-McAteer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>A second limitation was that ward implementers, once trained, neither had their training repeated nor their performance monitored. This might have reduced the effect of the intervention, and been partly responsible for the gradual decline in compliance seen during the study. This gradual fall might also reflect a possible wearing off of the national campaign over its final year (January-December 2008), or generic changes in working practices and pressures in the health service. Although this fall suggests some caution should be exercised in interpreting the effect of the intervention, the nature of the study design can cope with temporal trends which were allowed for in all analyses.</p><p>A final limitation was the difficulty collecting secondary and tertiary outcome data. The reluctance of ward staff to perform MRSA prevalence screening meant that no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of the intervention on healthcare associated infection. Collection of alcohol hand-rub and soap procurement was not a problem in the exploratory trial, but arose from lack of ward-level requisition or recording points in individual hospitals. Despite this, the effect of the intervention on soap procurement mirrored that on directly observed compliance for ITUs and provides further support for its efficacy.</p><p>Our results are consistent with systematic reviews <xref rid="pone.0041617-Jamtvedt1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> of 61 randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of audit and feedback on healthcare practices other than hand-hygiene. These report a significant effect of about the same size (adjusted odds ratio of compliance with desired practice 1.43 [1.28, 1.61]) that, as in our study, increased with increasing intensity of feedback, and lower baseline compliance.</p><p>Comparison with other hand-hygiene feedback intervention studies <xref rid="pone.0041617-Pittet1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041617-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> included in systematic reviews <xref rid="pone.0041617-Naikoba1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> is difficult because this is the only long term randomised controlled trial, and the only one coupling feedback to personalised goal setting and action planning. No other study compares their intervention with a baseline that includes another specific hand-hygiene intervention, whereas in our study standard practice included implementation of a national hand-hygiene campaign.</p><p>This gives the trial&#x02019;s findings extra relevance, as subsequent studies <xref rid="pone.0041617-Stone2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Stone3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Comptrollerandauditor1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> have shown that the campaign was widely implemented and successful. Although we did not routinely collect data on implementation of the campaign from infection control and ward staff, in case this acted as a prompt to alter &#x0201c;routine practice&#x0201d;, data on near-patient placement of alcohol hand-rub, the key component of the campaign, was routinely collected in the hand-hygiene observation tool <xref rid="pone.0041617-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This showed that this component had been implemented on all wards throughout the study. The World Health Organisation&#x02019;s SAVE LIVES initiative promotes a hand-hygiene intervention very similar to the English and Welsh hand-hygiene campaign <xref rid="pone.0041617-WHOSAVE1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Our study suggests that our intervention may improve hand-hygiene in such settings and could be the next step in hand-hygiene improvement after a hospital has adopted the SAVE LIVES intervention.</p><p>It would clearly be premature to recommend routine clinical use of our intervention as it is hard to comment on the generalisation of our results to settings other than ITUs and ACE wards, or to health services or countries with no sustained national hand-hygiene campaign. The post-randomisation pre-implementation rise in the odds of compliance on implementing wards may indicate that there were characteristics of those wards that eventually facilitated implementation. Those characteristics do not appear to include better baseline hand-hygiene compliance as there was no difference in the odds of pre-randomisation hand-hygiene compliance in implementing and non-implementing wards. Possible reasons for the greater implementation in ITUs are entirely speculative but include a higher degree of training and specialisation and a larger staffing pool from which to recruit ward co-ordinators. A further implementation study in a variety of settings is required, with the performance of ward co-ordinators monitored, and cost-effectiveness models developed, before the intervention can be offered routinely in acute hospital settings. This needs to be informed by further research to identify what each component of the intervention contributed to its effect. Nonetheless, hospitals keen to improve their hand-hygiene compliance could consider employing this intervention, with the same cycle and behavioural principles of feedback, to supplement their current audit and appraisal systems.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study has shown that a feedback intervention informed by behavioural science results in moderate significant and sustained increases in hand-hygiene compliance and soap procurement on wards already implementing a national hand-hygiene campaign as part of routine practice. The effect increases with fidelity to intervention. The intervention proved harder to implement than anticipated, and further implementation studies are required. Although audit and feedback is often suggested as a useful tool for hand-hygiene improvement <xref rid="pone.0041617-Joint1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-Pittet1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041617-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, this study puts its use on a firmer footing than previous non-randomised studies, providing the strongest evidence yet that this is an effective technique, when coupled with a repeating cycle of personalised goal-setting and action planning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0041617.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
