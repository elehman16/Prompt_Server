However, little research has examined enduring changes in traits. This study administered psilocybin to participants who undertook a program of meditation/spiritual practices. Healthy participants were randomized to three groups (25 each): (1) very low-dose (1 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2) with moderate-level (&#x0201c;standard&#x0201d;) support for spiritual-practice (LD-SS); (2) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with standard support (HD-SS); and (3) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with high support for spiritual practice (HD-HS). Psilocybin was administered double-blind and instructions to participants/staff minimized expectancy confounds. Psilocybin was administered 1 and 2 months after spiritual-practice initiation. Outcomes at 6 months included rates of spiritual practice and persisting effects of psilocybin. Compared with low-dose, high-dose psilocybin produced greater acute and persisting effects. At 6 months, compared with LD-SS, both high-dose groups showed large significant positive changes on longitudinal measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings. Determinants of enduring effects were psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience and rates of meditation/spiritual practices. Psilocybin can occasion enduring trait-level increases in prosocial attitudes/behaviors and in healthy psychological functioning.</p><p>

The phenomenon of quantum change is differentiated from the usual process of behavioral change, which occurs in small incremental steps (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">James, 1902</xref>). Such experiences, which have been described in anecdotal reports dating back centuries, have been variously labeled as mystical experiences, conversion experiences, religious experiences, peak experiences, transcendental experiences, transforming moments, or epiphanies (e.g. <xref rid="bibr25-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">James, 1902</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Maslow, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Miller and C&#x02019;de Baca, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr59-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Stace, 1960</xref>). Although numerous cases of such quantum change experiences have been described, they have generally not been examined in prospective experimental studies because such experiences occur at low rates and usually unpredictably (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Paloutzian and Park, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Administration of psilocybin, a classic psychedelic, provides a model for experimental investigation of quantum change experiences. Controlled, double-blind clinical trials in healthy volunteers show that under supportive conditions psilocybin can reliably occasion deeply personally meaningful and often spiritually significant experiences (e.g. mystical-type experiences) (<xref rid="bibr18-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr16-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Pahnke, 1963</xref>) having many characteristics similar to those described for quantum change experiences (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Miller and C&#x02019;de Baca, 2001</xref>). Such psilocybin effects are dose dependent (<xref rid="bibr16-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>) and have been demonstrated under conditions that provide substantial controls for expectancy bias (<xref rid="bibr18-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr15-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although participants often attribute enduring positive changes in well-being and worldview to such experiences, there is little evidence from studies in healthy volunteers that psilocybin produces enduring changes on well-validated trait measures of disposition or personality (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Darling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr10-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Doblin, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Leary et al., 1963</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Pahnke, 1963</xref>; <xref rid="bibr63-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Studerus et al., 2011</xref>). For example, a previous study in 36 participants who received a high dose of psilocybin showed enduring positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior attributed to the psilocybin experience, but no significant changes from screening to 14-month follow-up on various measures of personality, quality of life, faith maturity, and spiritual well-being (<xref rid="bibr17-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2008</xref>). A later post-hoc analysis which combined data from that study with data from a similar subsequent study with 18 participants (<xref rid="bibr16-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>) showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experiences were associated with increases in the personality trait of openness (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although an older literature on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in psychiatric patient populations suggests that administration of psilocybin in a psychotherapeutic context may produce enduring decreases in psychopathology and increases in positive worldview and dispositional characteristics, methodological limitations render those reports inconclusive (<xref rid="bibr47-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Passie, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bibr48-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, recent placebo-controlled trials in psychologically distressed cancer patients showed that psilocybin produced decreases in anxiety and depression and increases in quality of life that persisted for at least a month and possibly 6 months or more (<xref rid="bibr15-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Grob et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present study in healthy participants sought to extend understanding of possible enduring effects of quantum change experiences generally and psilocybin-occasioned experiences specifically by manipulating psilocybin dose and the intensity with which participants were encouraged to engage in meditation and other spiritual practices. Acute psilocybin effects, retrospective attributions to the experience, and enduring changes in prosocial attitudes and behaviors, and psychological functioning were assessed. More specifically, the present study used an across-group design to compare these outcomes in three groups of 25 healthy participants: (1) low-dose (active placebo) psilocybin with moderate-level (&#x0201c;standard&#x0201d;) support for spiritual practice; (2) high-dose psilocybin with standard support; and (3) high-dose psilocybin with high support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-0269881117731279"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section3-0269881117731279"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the local community through flyers seeking volunteers interested in developing their spiritual lives by participating in a study of the combined effects of meditation and psilocybin, a psychoactive substance found in mushrooms used as sacraments in some cultures. In total, 1305 individuals were screened by telephone and 184 were further screened in person. Primary reasons for exclusion between phone screen and in-person screening were prior use of psychedelics (312); medical/psychiatric exclusion (288); pre-existing regular meditation or other spiritual practice (261); logistics or lack of interest (220). Eighty-five volunteers were enrolled in the study and 10 did not complete the study. Reasons for non-completion included illness or a disqualifying medical or psychological issue (five volunteers), noncompliance with study procedures for personal or job-related reasons (three volunteers), and missing data on key measures (two volunteers). The 75 study completers (40% male) were medically healthy (as determined by medical history, physical examination, an electrocardiogram, routine medical blood laboratory tests, and urine testing for common drugs of abuse), and psychiatrically healthy. They were without personal or family histories of psychotic disorders or bipolar I or II disorder as determined by structured clinical interviews. Individuals with current alcohol or other drug dependence (including nicotine) were excluded, as were individuals with a past history within the past 5 years of alcohol or drug dependence (excluding nicotine). Twenty-five percent of participants reported past use of a psychedelic, with a mean of 25.1 years since last use. Participants were excluded if they reported any history of either spontaneous or psychedelic-occasioned salient mystical-type experiences. Participants had a mean age of 42 years (range 22 to 69) and a mean weight of 71.5 kg (range 49.2 to 97.5); 89% had college or post-graduate degrees and 87% were full-time employees or students. Although 31% reported practicing seated meditation, the mean frequency of practice was very low (1.1 times per month for the group). Volunteers did not receive monetary compensation for participation. Based on interviews, their motivation for participation was their interest in learning meditation, exploring their spiritual lives, and their curiosity about the effects of psilocybin. The Johns Hopkins IRB approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0269881117731279"><title>Study design and overview</title><p>The study procedures followed recommendations provided for safe conduct of research administering high doses of a classic psychedelic (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). This study investigated the effects of psilocybin dose and the frequency and intensity of support provided for spiritual practice (i.e. meditation, spiritual awareness practice, journaling) on a battery of attitudinal and behavioral outcome measures in 75 healthy participants. The psilocybin dose manipulation was double-blind.</p><p>The duration of each volunteer&#x02019;s participation was approximately 6 to 8 months. After enrollment and before the first of two psilocybin sessions (described below), each participant had several preparation meetings with two study staff trained to serve as session &#x0201c;guides.&#x0201d; The two psilocybin sessions were separated by about 1 month. Some measures were assessed during and immediately after sessions, and various longitudinal measures were evaluated immediately after study enrollment (i.e. baseline assessment) and 4 months after the second psilocybin session (i.e. 6-month assessment).</p><sec id="section5-0269881117731279"><title>Assignment to the three experimental groups</title><p>After screening and study enrollment, each participant was randomized to one of three groups of 25 each: (1) very low-dose psilocybin (1 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2&#x02014;functionally a placebo) with standard support for spiritual practice (LD-SS); (2) high-dose psilocybin (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with standard support for spiritual practice (HD-SS); and (3) high-dose psilocybin (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with high support for spiritual practice (HD-HS). An urn randomization procedure (<xref rid="bibr61-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Stout et al., 1994</xref>) was used to balance the three groups as closely as possible on six dichotomous variables

Although the most important comparative data on attitudinal and behavioral change were obtained in the first two sessions and subsequent follow-up, 39 participants were assigned to receive a third session after the 6-month data assessment in which they received 30 mg/70 kg psilocybin. This design feature was used in part to control expectancies through the 6-month follow-up evaluation. Although participants and guides were informed that over two or three sessions all participants would receive one or more high doses of psilocybin, they were not informed which participants or how many participants would be scheduled for a third session, nor were they told that the third session would be a high dose. In fact, all 25 participants in the low-dose psilocybin group (LD-SS) were assigned to receive a third session. An additional 14 participants (eight and six from HD-SS and HD-HS, respectively) were also assigned to receive a third session. Nine of these 14 participants were distributed within the first one-third (25) participants enrolled in the study. The purpose of scheduling a third session in these 14 participants was to obscure the study design from the guides early in the trial and reduce the possibility that guides would have strong expectancies whether or not a participant would have a third session. Data from the third session and data from several exploratory measures are beyond the scope of this report and are not presented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0269881117731279"><title>Guide&#x02013;participant meetings and support for spiritual practice</title><p>The guide&#x02013;participant meetings served the functions of establishing rapport, providing specific preparation for the psilocybin sessions (see <xref rid="bibr26-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>), and providing instructions and support for spiritual practices. The primary guides had established personal meditation practices as well as extensive experience supporting psilocybin sessions. An assistant guide was usually present at these meetings. Except for the dialogue-group meetings described below, the same primary and assistant guides were paired with a given participant throughout the study.

After each of the first two psilocybin sessions, participants in the standard-support group met for 1 hour within one or two days (usually one day) and had a 10 minute teleconference with guides about 2 weeks later. Thus, the total guide&#x02013;participant contact hours for those in the Standard-Support groups from study acceptance to the 6-month follow-up was about 7 hours and 20 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0269881117731279"><title>High-Support group</title><p>Before the first session (in the 1 month period following enrollment) participants and guides in the High-Dose High-Support group had five 2-hour meetings (10 total contact hours). Between the first and second psilocybin sessions (1 month apart) there were three 1-hour participant&#x02013;guide meetings (3 total contact hours). As with the Standard-Support groups, the first of these meetings was scheduled within a day or two following the session. During the 4-month period after the second psilocybin session, 1-hour participant&#x02013;guide meetings occurred within a day or two of the session, at weekly intervals for the first 2 weeks, and at twice-monthly intervals for the remainder of the 4 months (10 contact hours). Also during the 4-month period after the second psilocybin session, participants in the High-Support group participated in twice-monthly 90-minute dialogue-group sessions. Approximately eight study participants plus one or two facilitators (study staff) participated in each session. The group membership changed over sessions as individual participants entered and left the group as they progressed through the study. The facilitators provided an opportunity to discuss psilocybin experiences but mainly encouraged dialogue about successes and challenges in implementing and sustaining the regular spiritual practices of meditation, spiritual awareness, and journaling. The total guide&#x02013;participant contact hours for the High-Support group from study acceptance to the 6-month follow-up was 35 hours.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0269881117731279"><title>Spiritual practice support</title><p>At the first guide&#x02013;participant meeting, each participant was given: (1) a copy of the book, <italic>Meditation: A Simple 8-Point Program for Translating Spiritual Ideals into Daily Life</italic> (<xref rid="bibr11-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Easwaran, 1991/1978</xref>); (2) a blank journal; and (3) a one-page outline of spiritual practice suggestions. All participants were required to read the book on meditation and integration of spiritual values into daily life.

The spiritual practice suggestions had three primary elements: meditation (10 to 30 minutes of sitting meditation daily); daily awareness practice (use of mantra and one-pointed attention in daily activities); and daily self-reflective journaling of insights, benefits, and challenges of spiritual practice in daily life. Participants were also encouraged to engage in activities they personally judged to facilitate spiritual growth (e.g. being in nature, contemplative movement, artwork, or service activities). At each of the guide&#x02013;participant meetings, the guide asked about, encouraged, and offered instructions in the participant&#x02019;s implementation of the spiritual practice suggestions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section11-0269881117731279"><title>Psilocybin sessions</title><p>Psilocybin doses were prepared in opaque, size 0 gelatin capsules of identical appearance, with lactose as the inactive capsule filler.

After acceptance into the study, each participant designated as raters three adults who were expected to have continuing contact with the participant (e.g. family members, friends, or colleagues at work). Ratings were conducted via a structured telephone interview approximately 1 week after the participant had been accepted into the study, 3 to 4 weeks after the last session, and as part of the 6-month follow-up. The interviewer provided no information to the rater about the participant. The structured interview consisted of asking the rater to rate the participant&#x02019;s behavior and attitudes using a 10 point scale (from 1=not at all, to 10=extremely) on 13 items: inner peace; patience; good-natured humor/playfulness; mental flexibility; optimism; anxiety; interpersonal perceptiveness and caring; negative expression of anger; compassion/social concern; expression of positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, appreciation); self-confidence; forgiveness of others; and forgiveness of self. For the first rating assessment, which occurred soon after acceptance into the study, raters were instructed to base their ratings on observations of and conversations with the participant over the past 3 months. On subsequent assessments, raters were told their previous ratings and were instructed to rate the participant based on interactions over the last several weeks. Data from each interview with each rater were calculated as a total score, with anxiety and anger scored negatively. Changes in each participant&#x02019;s behavior and attitudes after drug sessions were expressed as a mean change score (i.e. difference score) from the baseline rating across the raters. At the same assessment times, the community observer who knew the participant best (as judged by the participant at baseline) also completed via telephone interview the 35 item Observer Rated ASPIRES questionnaire, which assesses spirituality and religious sentiments (Piedmont, 2010). Seven of 225 (<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>6%) scheduled ratings by community observers at 6 months were missed due to failure to return calls or to the rater not having contact with the participant over the rating period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section20-0269881117731279"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Pearson Chi-square (SPSS version 22.0.0.0) was used to compare experimental groups on dichotomous variables (demographics and proportion of group endorsing specific responses). Planned comparisons among groups were conducted with z-tests of proportions.</p><p>For time-course data during psilocybin sessions, for each participant, peak score during the time-course was defined as the maximum value from pre-capsule to 6 hours post-capsule and time to peak effect was defined as the time to peak score. ANOVA (SAS version 9.2, PROC GLM) with planned comparisons between groups were used to analyze data at each time-point, peak effects, and time to peak effects for Sessions 1 and 2 separately. A similar analysis was conducted using mean peak data from Sessions 1 and 2 combined. Similar analyses were conducted comparing peak effects and time to peak effect between sessions 1 (20 mg/70 kg) and 2 (30 mg/70 kg) collapsing across the two high-dose groups (<italic>n</italic>=50).</p><p>A similar approach (ANOVA with planned comparisons between groups) was used to examine demographic data for continuous variables, data obtained 7 hours after psilocybin administration (end of session), and single time-point data from the 6-month follow-up (e.g. spiritual practices and persisting effects attributed to psilocybin).</p><p>Longitudinal measures (i.e. those measures assessed immediately after study enrollment and at the 6-month follow-up), were analyzed with a repeated measures regression model with AR(1) covariance structure (SAS version 9.2, PROC MIXED) with planned comparisons between groups. Measures that showed significant differences between groups at baseline were reanalyzed as difference from baseline scores using ANOVA (SAS version 9.2, PROC GLM) with planned comparisons between groups. If difference scores at 6 months were not significantly different between groups, those measures were dropped from further analysis. For the remaining longitudinal measures, planned comparisons between groups at 6 months were conducted. Finally, to determine if there were changes over time within each group, planned comparisons between baseline and 6-month data were examined.</p><p>Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore the relationship of spiritual practices and psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience to various outcome measures. For this analysis, the three spiritual practice measures (minutes per day of mediation; times per day of spiritual awareness practice; times per week of spiritual journaling) were entered together in the first step of the regression model. In the second step, the mean of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) total scores (completed after both psilocybin sessions) was entered into the regression model. In another analysis, MEQ30 mean total score was entered into the regression model first.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section21-0269881117731279"><title>Results</title><sec id="section22-0269881117731279"><title>Integrity of blinding procedures</title><p>After the psilocybin sessions had been completed, the five study staff members who had served as primary guides for the study completed a questionnaire that asked about their understanding of the study drug and dose conditions. Although all correctly believed that psilocybin had been administered, most made incorrect inferences about the drug or dose conditions, with three of five believing that doses higher than 30 mg/70 kg had been administered, two believing that four or more psilocybin dose levels had been administered; two believing that a drug other than psilocybin was administered (guesses included MDMA, ketamine, and dextromethorphan), and two believing that a true placebo had been administered. Surprisingly, some of these incorrect inferences were contrary to study design parameters that had been described verbally and in the consent form to participants and these primary study guides (e.g. administration of something other than psilocybin).

This difference seems likely due to the experimental context of the present study, which provided encouragement for engagement in a nonsectarian program of meditation and other practices that emphasized the integration of spiritual values in daily life (e.g. prosocial values, self-knowledge through examining the nature of mind, and cultivating a sense of wonder).</p><sec id="section39-0269881117731279"><title>Effects of psilocybin dose</title><sec id="section40-0269881117731279"><title>Effects of psilocybin dose on session days</title><p>The time-course and profile of acute psilocybin effects were consistent with previous studies that have administered these doses of psilocybin to healthy volunteers under similar conditions (<xref rid="bibr18-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr16-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).

This subscale comprises items assessing respect for tradition, moderation of feelings and action, humility, accepting life&#x02019;s circumstances, and holding religious belief and faith. It is plausible that administering psilocybin in the context of encouraging spiritual practices accounts for this effect, which is consistent with the observation that indigenous sacramental use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, peyote, ayahuasca and other classic psychedelic-containing substances is often strongly grounded in cultural traditions (<xref rid="bibr55-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Schultes et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the personality domain of Openness increased from screening to 6 months in the HD-HS group but not in the HD-SS or LD-SS groups. Further, there were no between-group differences in Openness at 6 months. Further analyses of these data (not presented) did not show significant relationships between several measures of mystical-type experience and changes in Openness. These findings contrast with the results from a previous analysis that showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience was associated with increases in Openness from screening to 1&#x02013;2 months and to 14 months after psilocybin (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2011</xref>).

The measure of mystical experience used for this analysis was the mean total score on the Mystical Experience Questionnaires (MEQ30) that were completed immediately following the two psilocybin sessions (4 and 5 months before the 6-month follow-up). Spiritual practices were assessed at the 6-month assessment with a questionnaire in which participants retrospectively rated over the past 4 months the three spiritual practices that were taught and encouraged during the study (minutes per day of mediation; times per day of spiritual awareness practice; times per week of spiritual journaling). When mystical experience alone was entered into a regression model, it accounted for a significant proportion of variance in all 19 outcome measures studied. In a separate hierarchical regression analysis, when the three spiritual practices were entered first into the regression model, they accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in 13 of 19 outcome measures studied. However, when mystical experience was subsequently entered into the model, it accounted for a significant proportion of variance in 18 of 19 measures after accounting for the impact of spiritual practices. For the overall regression model, meditation was significant on six measures (Faith Maturity Scale, Daily Spiritual Experience Scale, Forgiveness-benevolence motivations, Forgiveness-avoidance motivations, Observer-rated spiritual and religious sentiments, and Participant retrospective rating of the personal meaning of the session experiences); spiritual awareness practices were significant on two measures (Daily Spiritual Experience Scale, and Observer-rated changes in behavior and attitudes); and journaling was significant on one measure (Observer-rated changes in behavior and attitudes).</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that both mystical experience and spiritual practices contribute to positive outcomes, with mystical experience making a substantially greater contribution. The fact that the measure of mystical experience preceded the assessment of outcome measures by 4&#x02013;5 months strengthens the interpretation that mystical experience and/or its neurophysiological or other correlates are likely determinants of the enduring positive attitudinal, dispositional, and behavioral effects of psilocybin when administered under spiritually supported conditions.</p><p>It is interesting that a previous study with a relatively high dose (200 &#x003bc;g) of LSD, a different classic psychedelic, produced only moderate increases in total mystical experience scores (MEQ30), with only 12.5% of participants meeting criteria for a complete mystical experience (<xref rid="bibr29-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Liechti et al., 2017</xref>). Whether this lower rate of mystical experience reflects pharmacodynamic differences between psilocybin and LSD, the use of a relatively lower dose of LSD than psilocybin, and/or differences between the studies in set, setting, or participant characteristics is unknown (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Griffiths, 2017</xref>). Future research should directly compare LSD and psilocybin within subjects, ideally using procedures to minimize expectancy effects.</p><p>There was little evidence that the standard-support intervention alone affected longitudinal measures at 6 months. Of the 23 longitudinal measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269881117731279">Table 6</xref>), only one measure in the LD-SS group showed a significant difference from baseline (immediately after study enrollment) to 6 months. Furthermore, across the longitudinal measures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269881117731279">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0269881117731279">7</xref>, the LD-SS group tended to be similar or lower than comparison data (e.g. norms) from previous studies. The absence of robust effects of the standard-support intervention contrasts with previous studies that showed a more intensive 8- or 9-session program using a similar intervention resulted in a variety of positive changes in spirituality, well-being, self-efficacy, and mental health outcomes (<xref rid="bibr13-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Flinders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Hedberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Oman et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bibr41-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>,b). The lack of greater efficacy for the standard-support intervention in the present study was likely due to the minimal level of teaching and support provided to the LD-SS group.</p></sec><sec id="section49-0269881117731279"><title>Experimental design strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of the present study include the double-blind design, the use of a very low (possibly inactive) psilocybin dose as a control, and instructions to participants and guides, all serving to obscure the actual dose conditions and thereby minimizing participant and guide expectancy effects. This strategy has been used in previous psilocybin research (<xref rid="bibr15-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, the effects of very low dose of psilocybin (1 mg/70 kg) were compared with the high-dose conditions. The low dose was below a dose (3.15 mg/70 kg) that did not produce statistically significant effects in a previous study (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881117731279" ref-type="bibr">Hasler et al., 2004</xref>). Participants and guides did report some psilocybin-like effects after the very low dose (e.g. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269881117731279">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269881117731279">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269881117731279">5</xref>), as might be expected under conditions in which participants (most of whom were psychedelic-naive) had been told they would receive psilocybin. For instance, three of 25 (12%) of participants in the low-dose condition rated their psilocybin session experiences to be among the five most spiritually significant of their lives. Although the low-dose condition served as an important comparison to the high-dose conditions, in absence of a true placebo-dose condition, it is not possible to determine if the very low dose was pharmacologically active.</p><p>The integrity of blinding the guides to the study conditions was assessed with a post-study questionnaire that asked guides about their understanding of study drug and dose conditions. The finding that most guides made incorrect inferences about drug or dose conditions suggests substantial success of the blinding conditions. Guides were not required to make guesses about drug conditions after each session because we did not want to make this a focus of interest for guides. However, the absence of such guide ratings on each session precludes drawing a stronger conclusion about the success of blinding guides to study conditions.</p><p>The experimental design of the present study can be viewed as representing 3 of 4 cells of a balanced 2&#x000d7;2 design with dose (low dose vs. high dose) and spiritual support (standard support vs. high support) as factors. The fourth cell of a completely balanced design would be the low-dose high-support condition. Addition of that group would have permitted evaluation of the effects of high support independent of psilocybin. Although we considered the benefits of the balanced 2&#x000d7;2 design, we decided against it because of substantially increased study costs and because of concern that participants in this group, who receive only a low dose of psilocybin, might be less likely to comply with the more intensive schedule of participant&#x02013;guide and dialogue-group meetings required in the high-support condition.</p><p>Additional limitations of the present study were the homogeneity of the participant population (predominately White, college educated, and employed) and the absence of brain-based or physiological measures of change or task-based measures such as assessment of implicit bias, emotion regulation, or social behavior. Finally, because the high-support condition involved group discussion of both spiritual practices and psilocybin experiences, the effect of group discussion of spiritual practice alone cannot be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section50-0269881117731279"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although previous research shows that psilocybin, under appropriate conditions, can reliably occasion mystical-type experiences to which participants frequently attribute enduring positive changes in well-being and worldview, there has been little evidence from studies in healthy volunteers that psilocybin produces enduring changes on well-validated trait measures of disposition or personality. In the present study, psilocybin was administered in the context of undertaking a nonsectarian program of meditation and other spiritual practices that emphasized integration of spiritual values in daily life. The study showed robust interactive positive effects of psilocybin dose and added support for spiritual practices on a wide range of longitudinal measures at 6 months including interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and rating of participants by community observers. Analyses suggest that the determinants of these effects were the intensity of the psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience and the rates of engagement with meditation and other spiritual practices. Most broadly, as a model system for studying so-called quantum change experiences, which have been described for centuries but which have eluded rigorous prospective experimental analysis, further investigation of psilocybin-occasioned experiences may have broad implications for the development of drug and non-drug interventions in both therapeutic and nontherapeutic applications in order to engender enduring positive trait-level changes in attitudes and behavior and in healthy psychological functioning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Frederick Reinholdt, M.S., Albert Garcia-Romeu, Ph.D., Daniel Evatt, Ph.D., Haley Sweet, Rosemary Flickinger and 13 other staff members for their roles as session guides.
