The consequences can be physical and/or psychological and falls resulting in injury are a leading cause of mortality <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Approximately 5% of community dwelling older people who fall annually experience a fracture <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and the estimated annual cost of fall related fractures in the UK is &#x000a3;2 billion <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Therefore, falls are an important focus of clinical and public health care <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="par0010">Falls have a multifactorial aetiology; and there are several proposed prevention strategies. Some of the major risk factors are potentially modifiable, including impairments of gait and balance. Exercise aimed at these risk factors has been shown to reduce rate and risk of falling <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, exercise programmes vary in type and mode of delivery <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="par0015">Another prevention approach is Multifactorial Fall Prevention assessment (MFFP) and intervention where a broader range of fall risk factors are identified and treatment is targeted <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The NHS currently commits substantial funding to MFFP services and a conservative estimate of the annual cost is &#x000a3;34 million per year <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of MFFP on preventing fall-related fractures and there have been no head-to-head comparisons of treatment options. Therefore, the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme, commissioned a large-scale RCT to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative interventions for preventing fractures and falls in community dwelling older adults (ISCTRN 71002650).</p><sec id="sec0010"><title>The Prevention of Fall Injury Trial (PreFIT)</title><p id="par0020">The design of the Prevention of Fall Injury Trial (PreFIT) is described in the trial protocol <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but in brief, is a three-arm, pragmatic, cluster RCT, comparing advice only (control), advice with exercise and advice with MFFP, in community dwelling adults aged 70 years and over. The unit of randomisation is the general practice. Based on the outcome of a short self-completed fall and balance screening survey <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, participants with a history of falls and/or current balance problems, deemed to be at moderate or high risk of falling, were eligible for invitation to the intervention. Intervention development began in October 2010, with the first participant recruited to the pilot study in September 2011.</p><p id="par0025">The Medical Research Council (MRC) recommends a description of interventions included in RCTs, its components, and rationale for inclusion <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, using the TIDieR checklist (Appendix B) <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, this paper describes the development and procedures for the PreFIT exercise intervention. The design of the MFFP intervention has been described elsewhere <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>Rationale for the development the PreFIT exercise intervention</title><p id="par0030">The rationale for using exercise to prevent falls is well established in the literature and clinical practice. Several exercise programmes have been developed and tested within high quality RCTs <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and are published with sufficient detail to allow accurate replication.</p><p id="par0035">Whilst developing the PreFIT intervention we adopted an evidence-based rationale for programme selection, including type and dose of exercise. Reflecting the pragmatic intention of the trial, the exercise programme needed to be deliverable within the budgetary and practice constraints of the NHS, and where possible, utilise high quality exercise programmes already well-embedded in NHS services. We, therefore, reviewed the current literature and existing systematic reviews of falls prevention interventions, published guidelines and pre-existing surveys of clinical practice, and carried out a pilot study and consensus work with therapists to specify the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Defining the essential elements of a fall prevention exercise programme</title><p id="par0040">There is positive and consistent evidence for strength and balance exercises as a falls prevention strategy <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Individually tailored exercises are necessary to account for differing health and physical function; these should be of sufficient dose, and be progressive to ensure physiological challenges continue as fitness and functional ability improves <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="par0045">At the time of intervention development, a Cochrane systematic review <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> investigating strategies to prevent falling in community dwelling older people, reported 59 RCTs examining exercise as a sole intervention. The review reported group exercise reduced fall rates by 29% and risk of falling by 25% and individual home exercise programmes (HEPs) by 32% and 22% respectively <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There is weak evidence suggesting that exercise interventions may reduce the risk of fall related fracture, but this observation is based on a meta-analysis of a small, selective group of trials (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="par0050">A separate systematic review of 54 exercise RCTs confirmed that exercise can prevent falls <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Higher dose exercise <italic>i.e.</italic> 50&#x000a0;hours over the trial period was found to be most effective, recommended as at least 2&#x000a0;hours per week for 6-months, including moderate/high challenge balance exercise, either in groups or HEP format <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Exercise to improve balance is most effective if performed three times per week for 3 months <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but for lasting effects, needs to be sustained <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. From a public health perspective, physical activity guidelines also recommend older people engage in activities to improve strength and balance at least twice a week <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="par0055">Strength training in falls prevention programmes has additional benefits as an effective means of improving physical functioning for older people <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Strengthening exercises should include a resistance element to overload major muscle groups <italic>i.e.</italic> using weights/exercise bands, be progressive and be undertaken on at least two days per week <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) promotes strength training for older adults, reporting that given adequate training, older people can make significant gains in strength in 3 to 4 months <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This, therefore, supports the inclusion of strength training in a 6-month intervention.</p><p id="par0060">The impact of walking as a falls prevention strategy remains unclear. International fall prevention guidelines do refer to several studies incorporating a walking component <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and although associated with a reduction in falls, it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of walking alone as they also included strength and balance exercise. There is, however, evidence suggesting walking can increase risk of falling <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, walking is considered a less important feature of falls prevention interventions, but is recommended, if safe to do so, without compromising balance re-training efforts <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><title>Selecting a specific intervention</title><p id="par0065">We searched the published literature, replicating the previous search strategies of the Cochrane review <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We identified several standardised programmes incorporating the essential elements of a falls prevention exercise programme, reported in sufficient detail to allow replication and/or delivered an accompanying accredited training programme. To reflect the pragmatic underpinning of the trial, information about exercise interventions already being delivered in NHS settings was considered <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and three eligible programmes meeting all these criteria were shortlisted.</p><p id="par0070">The exercise component of a multifactorial intervention developed by Tinetti <italic>et al.</italic>

At the time of PreFIT intervention development, FaME had only been tested in one RCT of women over 65 years <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> therefore it was excluded.

Participants are actively involved in the decision-making process regarding selection of exercises and goal setting; this can reinforce how best the exercises and walking plan can realistically and specifically help in maintaining activities that are important to them.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>Materials</title><p id="par0175">The equipment required for the exercise intervention includes a straight-backed firm chair (between 40 and 50&#x000a0;cm in height) and a stopwatch; both used during baseline and final assessments.</p><p id="par0180">Each participant was provided with a personalised A5 exercise folder including pictures of and instructions for each exercise, as well as general exercise advice. A set of ankle weights was provided for their strengthening exercises; these were replaced with heavier weights over time to ensure progression.</p><p id="par0185">After the intervention, participants were encouraged to continue with their exercise programme and a &#x02018;staying active&#x02019; leaflet, designed specifically for the trial, was given to each participant. This included information about purchasing weights, the benefits of continued exercise and current exercise opportunities in their local area.</p></sec><sec id="sec0050"><title>Where</title><p id="par0190">Due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, location of face to face appointments varied dependent on local service provision, but included outpatient/clinic settings and home visits. Some services could deliver the intervention in groups, but the majority saw participants individually, however either was permitted.</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><title>When and how much</title><p id="par0195">The supervised PreFIT exercise intervention is planned for 6 months. This is shorter than the original OEP, which lasted a year, but is likely to be longer than current usual NHS practice, where many services provide strength and balance training for up to 12 weeks <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. During the 6 months, therapists arranged <italic>a minimum</italic> of three face-to-face appointments, either individually or in a group setting and three telephone appointments with participants. Ideally, follow up appointments occurred at 3 and 6 weeks, 3, 4 and 5 months, with a final assessment (face to face) at 6 months to repeat The Chair Stand Test and Four Test Balance Scale (seven contacts over 6-month period).</p><p id="par0200">Therapists completed an exercise treatment log at each appointment. Information recorded included: exercises undertaken, weight/support used, number of repetitions or sets, participants&#x02019; progress <italic>i.e.</italic> whether the amount of exercise increased at follow up appointments or whether strength, balance and walking improved overall (final assessment), and the number of times exercises were completed per week (self-report).</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>Tailoring</title><p id="par0205">Tailoring is personalised and is used to ensure progression of exercise <italic>i.e.</italic> increasing repetitions, sets or weights or adding balance exercises to provide an on-going moderately intense challenge <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Tailoring occurs during the assessment and follow up appointments where exercises are individually prescribed to address deficits of strength and balance and to take account of other conditions and the preferences of the participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Modifications</title><p id="par0210">A pilot study, involving GP practices in North Devon, determined acceptability of the exercise intervention to participants and clinicians, and feasibility of delivering the intervention in an NHS setting. Following feedback from therapists, the exercise treatment log was modified to improve and simplify data collection and to overcome challenges of organising PreFIT appointments within their normal clinical work, we produced a scheduling tool for planning follow-up visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Adherence/fidelity</title><p id="par0215">To determine whether the intervention was delivered as intended, each therapist underwent at least one structured observation by a research physiotherapist to assess whether they delivered the exercise intervention in accordance with the specified protocol.</p><p id="par0220">Using a standardised checklist, the following items were assessed: correct exercise prescription in response to the initial assessment, effective and safe delivery of the programme including progression, adherence to the protocol <italic>i.e.</italic> not providing additional exercises or treatment, and completion of all paperwork. Each therapist received a written grading (satisfactory, minor concerns or serious concerns) and follow up visits were arranged if necessary.</p><p id="par0225">Fidelity to the intervention will be assessed through data collected on the treatment logs, and from postal questionnaires completed by participants at different follow-up time points <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0075"><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0230">Falls prevention strategies are complex interventions and published research often fails to describe trial interventions sufficiently, making it difficult to translate research findings into clinical practice. We provide a detailed overview of the PreFIT exercise intervention, using the TIDieR checklist, to ensure transparent reporting and potentially allow easier replication of this work into practice should the intervention prove effective.</p><p id="par0235">PreFIT is testing an exercise intervention using an established evidence based exercise programme within a large RCT. As per the evidence and recommendations for falls prevention exercise programmes, the intervention (OEP) comprises strength and balance exercises, a walking plan and is of sufficient duration <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Furthermore, the ProFouND initiative has promoted roll out across Europe, to disseminate best practice in exercise delivery <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p id="par0240">The pragmatic approach taken to deliver the PreFIT exercise intervention within the constraints of busy NHS physiotherapy departments, community falls services and existing exercise therapy services has been challenging <italic>e.g.</italic> due to NHS structural changes, service reorganisation and staff changes. However, if shown to be effective, this 6-month intervention is feasible for delivery in both community and hospital settings and is documented to a standard promoting consistency in delivery, enabling replication in future studies and practice. The intervention is acceptable to participants and clinicians, and despite waiting list pressures, staff shortages and a constantly changing NHS, we found that it could be delivered successfully.</p><p id="par0245">The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the PreFIT exercise intervention in comparison with advice only and a MFFP intervention, on the prevention of fractures and falls will be reported at the conclusion of the trial.<boxed-text id="tb0005"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><p id="par0315"><list list-type="simple" id="lis0025"><list-item id="lsti0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="par0250">This article describes the rationale for a falls prevention exercise intervention within a large randomised controlled trial.</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0040"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="par0255">A thorough description of the development and delivery of a complex falls prevention exercise intervention is presented.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec id="sec0080"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="par0260">We are very grateful to the general practices, physiotherapy departments, community therapy teams, falls teams, exercise specialists and other staff who contributed to the development and/or delivery of the PreFIT exercise intervention.
