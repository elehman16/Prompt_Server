Patients who were pregnant, hemodynamically unstable with a mean arterial blood pressure &#x0003c;65 mmHg, developed acute hyperglycemic complications, for example, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, required renal replacement therapy, or refused to participate in the study were excluded.

All eligible patients were switched to single-dose subcutaneous insulin glargine injection with a 1-h washout period before the transition. The dose of insulin glargine was derived from the accumulative dosage of the previous 24 h of regular insulin infusion. The 100% equivalent dose of insulin glargine (Lantus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sanofi-Aventis, USA) was then subcutaneously injected at the periumbilical area by critical care nurses. Arterial blood glucose was regularly measured every 2 h until 24 h by a point-of-care glucometer device (Accu-Chek Performa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Roche diagnostics, Thailand). The rate caloric supplement by enteral route was maintained before and during the study period to keep a constant level of glucose administration.</p><p>If the blood glucose levels were between 80 and 200 mg/dL during the study period, the patients were recorded as &#x0201c;success patients.&#x0201d; The patients who failed blood glucose control with blood glucose levels &#x0003e;200 mg/dL were switched back to continuous regular insulin infusion and were defined as &#x0201c;failure cases.&#x0201d; On the other hand, patients who developed severe hypoglycemia with blood glucose levels &#x0003c;60 mg/dL were immediately given 50 mL of 50% dextrose solution intravenously, and continuous intravenous dextrose solution infusion was started with hourly blood glucose monitoring.

The accumulative dosage of regular insulin in 24 h before the study period was also collected. The blood glucose levels from 24 h before and during the study period were recorded every 2 h. In addition, the success rate of glycemic control by insulin glargine and the rate of severe hypoglycemia were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Analysis</title><p>The sample size of this study was calculated by the noninferiority trial fashion. Bhurayanontachai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared glycemic control between continuous intravenous regular insulin infusion and single-dose subcutaneous insulin glargine injection by an 80% equivalent dose of the accumulative dosage of regular insulin.

With the power of 80% to detect noninferiority and the expected drop-out rate of 20%, this study eventually required 20 patients to confirm the hypothesis.

Because of some missing blood glucose values before conversion to insulin glargine, the time-averaged AUC of the blood glucose level was preferred and calculated as the AUC of blood glucose level divided by its total time interval. The mean time-averaged AUCs of the blood glucose level &#x000b1; SD between the types of insulin were compared by <italic>t</italic>-test.

Currently, the suggested standard recommendation to control blood glucose is between 140 and 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients by continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin during ICU admission.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This study aimed to identify the feasibility of using an alternative method for glycemic control in the ICU by comparing blood glucose levels between two types of insulin. Insulin glargine was selected in this study because it is long acting and has a peakless property that can be applied in critically ill patients with stable blood glucose by a constant dosage of regular insulin infusion. We found that the success rate of single-dose subcutaneous insulin glargine injection with 100% equivalence to the accumulative dosage of regular insulin infusion was 70%. Although the mean time-averaged AUC of blood glucose level of the insulin glargine treatment period was higher than regular insulin infusion, this difference was not statistically significant and less than the noninferior margin.</p><p>Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog with a 1-h onset of action after subcutaneous injection, and its action continues for 24 h. Although there is no significant insulin peak, full activity is reached within 4&#x02013;5 h after injection.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Given these specific properties, insulin glargine performs as basal insulin which causes fewer hypoglycemic complications. As a result, a single daily dose of insulin glargine can give optimal glycemic control in the diabetic population. Several studies in both type-1 and type-2 DM demonstrated good glycemic control compared to NPH insulin, and fewer nocturnal hypoglycemic events were evident in the outpatient population.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, the evidence for the application of insulin glargine in the ICU is limited and inconsistent.</p><p>Schmeltz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] conducted a study in hospitalized patients to identify the most appropriate dose of insulin glargine to maintain the blood glucose level between 80 and 150 mg/dL. This study group apparently found that the 80% conversion dose from the previous 6 h of regular insulin infusion to once daily dose of insulin glargine provided a 48% achievement rate of the predefined target range for the blood glucose. Datta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] conducted a randomized study to compare glycemic control between the standard sliding scale of premeal regular insulin injection and once daily adjusted dose of subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in postbariatic surgical patients. The initial dose of insulin glargine was derived from 20 times of the last dose of regular insulin (83.33% conversion dose) with a desired glycemic control range of 80&#x02013;140 mg/dL. They found that insulin glargine gave a lower mean daily blood glucose concentration than the regular insulin sliding scale (134 &#x000b1; 30 mg/dL vs. 154 &#x000b1; 33 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and the rate of achievement was 60% in the insulin glargine group. Bhurayanontachai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also conducted an experimental pilot study to compare the glycemic control in 12 medical critically ill patients between regular insulin infusion and single-dose subcutaneous insulin glargine injection by 80% conversion dose from the accumulative dose of daily regular insulin requirement. Unfortunately, they found a success rate of 63.33% and a significantly higher level in the mean time-averaged AUC of blood glucose level during the insulin glargine period.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therefore, the once-daily dose of subcutaneous insulin glargine injection in stable blood glucose control was feasible, but the optimal dosage of insulin glargine needed to be identified.</p><p>Silinski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that the dosage conversion of insulin glargine either by weight based or percentage based gave the equivalence in mean blood glucose level with a 66% success rate of the target blood glucose of 80&#x02013;140 mg/dL. Our current study demonstrated that the 100% conversion dose from the accumulative dose of daily regular insulin requirement showed a better success rate of glycemic control. However, the desired blood glucose range of 80&#x02013;200 mg/dL in our study was different from the previous studies (80&#x02013;150 mg/dL)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the current recommendation of 140&#x02013;180 mg/dL.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>From our findings, the failure cases tended to have higher disease severity and higher blood glucose levels before the insulin glargine injection. These results indicated that persistent severe stress or nonresolving inflammatory response in these patients may lead to poor blood glucose control by insulin glargine. However, a larger study is required to confirm this finding.</p><p>In addition to the levels of admission blood glucose, mean daily blood glucose, and peak blood glucose, the level of glycemic variability is a new index related to ICU outcome.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Several indexes had been introduced as glycemic variability measurements such as the SD of the mean blood glucose, coefficient of variation of blood glucose, mean amplitude of glycemic excursion, and glycemic lability index. A lower glycemic variability index was associated with a better ICU outcome.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>From the current study, we found that the SD of the mean time-averaged AUC of the blood glucose level during the insulin glargine period was higher than during the regular insulin infusion period. These findings represented wide glycemic variability and may result in a poor ICU outcome. The uncertain rate of drug absorption from subcutaneous tissue and alteration of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction in critically patients are among the possible factors that contributed to the variability of blood glucose levels from insulin glargine injection.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Nevertheless, a few small studies demonstrated better glycemic control and less glycemic variability using a combination of regular insulin infusion with subcutaneous insulin glargine injection.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>The accuracy and validity of the methods of blood glucose measurements were major considerations in blood glucose studies. Inappropriate techniques and methods can cause an exaggerated change of blood glucose values. From a recent consensus, the arterial blood glucose measured by a blood gas analyzer machine was recommended because of less error and good validity.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In this study, we used a point-of-care glucometer to measure the glucose level from the arterial blood because the recent validation of this glucometer device to measure blood glucose from arterial blood showed a very strong correlation and agreement with the standard venous blood sugar measurement.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>There are some limitations of the current study. First, this is a single-center study. There are differences in the glycemic control protocols and target blood glucose levels in other centers. The current glycemic control protocol in our unit was implemented several years ago, and the desired blood glucose level is quite different from the recent recommendation. Therefore, the clinical application of our finding may be a concern. In addition, since the study period duration was 24 h, the results would be difficult to apply in current clinical practice. A longer and larger research study is required before adopting insulin glargine into critical care practice. Although the mean time-averaged AUC of blood glucose level between the two types of insulin was comparable, the major clinical outcomes such as ICU complications and mortality need to be explored. Moreover, the majority of patients in our study were clinically stable, which was evidenced by the optimal mean arterial blood pressure. The number of days from ICU admission to the time of study recruitment was more than 7 days, which was possibly in the recovery period of illness. Therefore, the application of insulin glargine in critically ill patients is essentially feasible, particularly in clinically stable and recovering patients who require minimal and constant regular insulin dosage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>The mean time-averaged AUC of blood glucose level between a daily single-dose subcutaneous insulin glargine injection and continuous intravenous regular insulin infusion was comparable.
