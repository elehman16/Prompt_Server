Although home visiting has been repeatedly demonstrated efficacious in research evaluations, efficacy disappears when programs are scaled broadly. In this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), we examine whether the benefits of ongoing accountability and supervision within an existing government funded and implemented community health workers (CHW) home visiting program ensure the effectiveness of home visiting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">In the deeply rural, Eastern Cape of South Africa, CHW will be hired by the government and will be initially trained by the Philani Programme to conduct home visits with all pregnant mothers and their children until the children are 2&#x000a0;years old. Eight clinics will be randomized to receive either (1) the Accountable Care Condition in which additional monitoring and accountability systems that Philani routinely uses are implemented (4 clinics, 16 CHW, 450 households); or (2) a Standard Care Condition of initial Philani training, but with supervision and monitoring being delivered by local government structures and systems (4 clinics, 21 CHW, 450 households). In the Accountable Care Condition areas, the CHW&#x02019;s mobile phone reports, which are time-location stamped, will be monitored and data-informed supervision will be provided, as well as monitoring growth, medical adherence, mental health, and alcohol use outcomes. Interviewers will independently assess outcomes at pregnancy at 3, 6, 15, and 24&#x000a0;months post-birth. The primary outcome will be a composite score of documenting maternal HIV/TB testing, linkage to care, treatment adherence and retention, as well as child physical growth, cognitive functioning, and child behavior and developmental milestones.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The proposed cluster RCT will evaluate whether routinely implementing supervision and accountability procedures and monitoring CHWs&#x02019; over time will improve MCH outcomes over the first 2&#x000a0;years of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov registration <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02957799">#NCT02957799</ext-link>, registered on October 26, 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2074-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Maternal health</kwd><kwd>Perinatal health</kwd><kwd>Infants</kwd><kwd>Mothers</kwd><kwd>South Africa</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH111391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rotheram-Borus</surname><given-names>Mary Jane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Center for HIV Identification, Prevention and Treatment Services</institution></funding-source><award-id>P30MH058107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rotheram-Borus</surname><given-names>Mary Jane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UCLA Center for AIDS Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>P30AI028697</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences through UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute</institution></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001881</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Postdoctoral HIV Research Training Program for HIV Combination Prevention</institution></funding-source><award-id>T32MH109205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rotheram-Borus</surname><given-names>Mary Jane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Home visiting has been repeatedly demonstrated efficacious in improving maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes when delivered by nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and paraprofessionals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Each dollar invested in maintaining MCH yields a nine-fold benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Yet, when home visiting is scaled by community health workers (CHW), the efficacy often disappears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Alma Alta Declaration has encouraged attempts to mount CHW interventions in all LMICs, and therefore the strategies needed to consistently implement high quality programs with efficacious outcomes are increasingly important. The proposed study aims to identify how supervision and accountability strategies improve MCH outcomes of home visits by CHW.</p><p id="Par16">In South Africa, the challenges to secure positive child outcomes for MCH remain overwhelming. Between 26% and 30% of mothers are living with HIV (MLH) and, while only a small percentage of their children are going to be seropositive, the uninfected children of MLH have growth and immune function challenges. Approximately 25% of pregnant mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, yielding the highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome disorder in the world (9.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Maternal depression is self-reported by approximately 15% of mothers and 6% report depressive symptoms likely to be clinically significant. In every country, maternal depression impacts on child growth and development lifelong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finally, approximately 16% of mothers experience intimate partner violence, which remains very stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These maternal challenges threaten the health of their children. For example, in some South African communities, approximately 17% of babies are born with low birth weights (&#x0003c;2500&#x000a0;g) and these infants will be at lifelong risk for multiple negative outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Clearly, the number and scope of the challenges mothers experience indicate the importance of broad, structural implementation of efficacious interventions to support pregnant mothers and that this support needs to be extended over the first 5&#x000a0;years of life.</p><p id="Par17">While paraprofessional home visiting has been repeatedly demonstrated to be efficacious, it has not been scaled nor does it concurrently retain efficacy. African countries have the lowest per capita health budgets and fewest well-trained personnel globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Building the personnel capacity, especially by systematically implementing training and accountability structures, has rarely been addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This protocol is targeted at filling this gap.</p><p id="Par18">The Philani Intervention Model (PIM) is a non-government organization with a 30-year history of successful, non-stigmatizing, and sustainable home-based support for pregnant women and malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Key components of the PIM are to recruit CHWs who are community role models, train the CHWs extensively, with ongoing in-service trainings, and to monitor the quality of all contacts with supervisors randomly dropping-in on each CHW&#x02019;s home visits biweekly and reviewing charts weekly, using the charts to iteratively build on CHWs&#x02019; skills. Our planned trial will build on this model, seeing if existing government CHWs (not selected to be role models), can improve the quality of their skills and home visits with a significant impact on MCH outcomes.</p><p id="Par19">Therefore, in this study, the PIM field coordinators and supervisors will assume supervision and support responsibilities for government-hired CHWs in a deeply rural setting in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. CHWs in the PIM are equipped with mobile phones to allow easy accountability; that is, a phone that has a time and location stamp on which the CHW provides ratings of the visit&#x02019;s content, the skills utilized, child weight/height, and perceived impact. The standard supervision procedures used by PIM will be implemented with CHWs randomized to the PIM condition. Based on the Quality Implementation Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], MCH outcomes will be monitored over 24&#x000a0;months to examine if accountability improves CHW outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par20">The Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA; IRB#16-001362) and Stellenbosch University (#N16/05/064) have approved the study protocol. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will review interim analyses of the 6- and 15-month assessments prior to the collection of the primary outcome data at 24&#x000a0;months.

The area is ancient tribal land, with the tribe allowing only minimal industrialization. Zithulele Hospital serves 130,000 families with nine local clinics. To reach clinics, a patient must cover large distances of hilly terrain either by walking or using the expensive and infrequent mini bus taxis. Aerial maps provided information on the density of each potential study area.</p><p id="Par22">With the support of the District Health Officer, the team has documented the catchment areas of each CHW assigned to eight clinics in the catchment area of Zithulele Hospital. Data on access to electricity (8% in the region), water tanks (16%), flush toilets (few), distance from the road and the local clinics, and hilliness was used to identify areas of about 200 households each. The areas were matched by UCLA and all CHWs at each clinic (3&#x02013;5 per clinic) were randomized to either (1) the Accountable Care (AC) condition, in which the PIM supervision and training models will be implemented (4 clinics, 16 CHW, 450 households); or (2) Standard Care (SC) by existing government supervisors and CHWs implementing home visits (4 clinics, 21 CHW, 450 households). Risk of contamination is very low given it is a deeply rural region with vast distances between villages and even homes.

All mothers are asked to re-enroll annually with voluntary informed consent at each assessment. The initial messages to CHWs with pregnancy and new mothers and the first 6&#x000a0;months of life are (1) HIV testing, adherence to therapy for MLH, nevirapine at childbirth, hospital delivery, a single feeding method for 6&#x000a0;months, PCR infant HIV testing at 6&#x000a0;weeks, and MLH reengagement in care and adherence to medication; (2) breastfeeding solely for 6&#x000a0;months, monitored by charting growth at each visit, and problem solving on how and where to get food; (3) reducing and eliminating alcohol use; (4) getting the child grant; (5) engaging in pleasant activities and building a social network; and (6) attending clinic visits (four antenatal visits, Well-Child visits, immunizations). After the first 6&#x000a0;months, the CHW focuses on encouraging mothers to stimulate and support their children daily.</p><p id="Par34">Households in the target areas will be visited by government-funded CHWs. This is currently the SC in the Eastern Cape in the wards adjacent to the Zithulele catchment area (although not in all of the Eastern Cape). The existing government-implemented training, monitoring, and supervision structures will remain in place with the only addition being an initial Philani training for conducting home visits. The geographic areas covered by each of the existing CHWs in two wards will be defined and all pregnant women coming to the clinics will be recruited with voluntary informed consent by paraprofessionals or the assessment team. CHWs in the SC will refer all mothers to local clinics for HIV, blood sugar, and pregnancy testing. The rates of visits and tests are available from clinic data and also will be individually collected by the assessment team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>AC</title><p id="Par35">The CHWs in the AC will receive the initial Philani training as described above. In addition, the CHWs&#x02019; implementation will be consistently monitored and an accountability system will be established. In AC, supervisors will randomly observe home visits once every 2&#x000a0;weeks. CHWs in the AC will log their home visits on their mobile phones, including a rating of the content and skills addressed on the visit, children&#x02019;s height and weight, and report on achievement of outcomes such as receiving the child grant, immunizations, breastfeeding, and retention and adherence to HIV care. The supervisors have two types of information, (1) personal observations of the CHW as they accompany the CHWs on their visits for 1&#x000a0;day every 2&#x000a0;weeks; and (2) reviewing data from a console as well as a folder which summarizes and documents every home visit made daily, the length of the visit, its location, the topics covered, the skills used by the CHW, and the perceived impact. The console reports also include the weight and length ratings of the child visited plotted on a growth chart. The supervisors do not change this information collected by the CHW on mobile phones, but merely review and use it for supervision and management of the CHWs. Supervision will facilitate CHW skill improvement over time. CHWs will be able to call mothers to check on illnesses such as diarrhea, provide reminders for immunizations and follow-up medical visits for HIV ARV or CD4 counts, as well as to make supportive calls to encourage depressed mothers to engage in pleasant events and a range of other motivating activities. Support, reminders, and monitoring will be the three primary functions that the supervisors will be encouraged to perform. Supervisors will not provide specific scripts or text messages for the CHWs. At each visit, the CHW enters a child&#x02019;s weight and height in the mobile phone, which is translated into a WHO growth chart that both the mother and the CHW can review. The growth chart is brightly colored, clear, with a yellow color when the baby is in the desirable height-weight zone.</p><p id="Par36">There will be a &#x0201c;flag system&#x0201d; to prompt the CHW and supervisor when visits are due by the CHW and when a follow-up is needed. In addition to gathering real-time data on the health of the household, the mobile phone monitoring system automatically lists all follow-up visits needed for each week. For example, the CHW is expected to reach all households in their catchment area within a maximum of a 6-month period. Pregnant mothers are to be visited monthly and every 2&#x000a0;weeks within the last 6&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy. A household with a severely malnourished or stunted child must be visited weekly. A household with a child within one SD of the normal height and weight only needs to be visited monthly. MLHs must be visited more often both in pregnancy and post-birth, especially if there has been no reengagement in care following childbirth (See Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Identification of responsibility for administrative and implementation functions with community health workers (CHWs)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Standard Care</th><th>Accountable Care</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hiring</td><td>Local government</td><td>Local government</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>Local government</td><td>Local government</td></tr><tr><td>Training</td><td>Initial Philani Intervention Model (PIM) training</td><td>Initial PIM training and mobile phones provided</td></tr><tr><td>Visit documentation</td><td>Log sheet</td><td>CHW will log home visits in real time on mobile phones and enter information about the pregnant women in a folder for follow up purposes</td></tr><tr><td>Supervision</td><td>Local government</td><td>PIM</td></tr><tr><td>Type of supervision</td><td>Log sheet</td><td>Random supervision visits every 2&#x000a0;weeks including real-time and data-informed feedback; support and reminders will be sent to CHW and supervisors via mobile phones (&#x0201c;flag system&#x0201d;)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

It will be a sum of assessments of the attainment (1) or not (0) of well-being from 10 indicators of MCH. Outcomes will be assessed as present (1) or absent (0). Base rates influence the number of significant outcomes needed on individual domains to yield a significant result. To examine overall differences between MCH outcomes in the SC in contrast to the AC, a single index summing the 10 indicators will be calculated as the sum of 1&#x000a0;s, reflecting a score above the median (e.g., on months of breastfeeding) or present (getting all immunizations, attending&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 antenatal visits), or 0&#x000a0;s, reflecting a score below the median or not present (e.g., no child grant, no maternal HIV testing in pregnancy).</p><p id="Par38">The primary analyses will examine cumulative change across multiple indicators of maternal and infant health. For outcomes only assessed at 24&#x000a0;months, differences between AC and SC conditions will be examined using random effects regression models to control for neighborhood clustering. Differences between outcomes assessed at baseline, 6, 15, and 24&#x000a0;months will be explored using multi-level models adjusting for repeated measures and neighborhood effects. Data analysis will be conducted using SAS software version 9.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Linear regression will be used for continuous variables, and logistic regression and Poisson/negative binomial regression will be implemented for binary and count outcomes, respectively. Logistic regression will be used for longitudinal binary outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Moderators</title><p id="Par39">In addition to the overall impact of PIM on children and mothers, we will also examine the differential impact of PIM on subpopulations of children and mothers based on poverty and health-related characteristics at baseline (e.g., MLH, adolescent mothers, women using alcohol, depressed women); i.e., we will test the moderating effects of these baseline characteristics. Separate models will be run for each moderator. The number of visits, ratings of the CHW supervisor on competency, content of the visits, skills used, frequency of phone contacts logged in real-time on mobile phones and verified by such systems as GPS, and random observations every 2&#x000a0;weeks are also moderators and will be analyzed in a similar fashion as above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Mediators</title><p id="Par40">We will also use Structural Equation Models to examine three pathways, namely the extent to which the effect of PIM on child outcomes is mediated through maternal behavior (e.g., caretaking); the extent to which a direct (not mediated) effect of PIM on child outcomes is also present; and the direct effect of maternal behaviors on child outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Power calculations</title><p id="Par41">The primary outcome is the single outcome measure which sums the number of significant individual outcome measures and calculates the number of tests necessary to indicate a significant difference. All individual outcomes are based on an alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05. There is sufficient power of 0.8 to detect a small effect size of 0.21 overall omnibus test between the SC and AC by 24&#x000a0;months. An intraclass area correlation of 0.01 and 80% retention is assumed. For subgroup analyses whose sample size is 1/2 (1/3) of the full data set, there is power to identify effect sizes of 0.31 (0.38) for alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, supporting the detection of medium-small or better effect sizes in subgroups of size 1/2 or 1/3 of the population. Longitudinal analyses of child data beyond two time points (i.e., more than 6 and 15&#x000a0;months) may add modest increases to the power. For analyses of mothers&#x02019; data, longitudinal analyses will be conducted over all pre- and post-natal time points and tests of level shift for these analyses should have greater power than for child analyses, which will tend to be over fewer time points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Publications and community involvement</title><p id="Par42">Dissemination of findings will be provided to the community through meetings, which will serve as an opportunity for researchers to discuss results and receive feedback from community members.

South Africa remains an important site to demonstrate scaling of efficacious home visits by CHWs, especially for MLH. It is critical to include all mothers in home visiting so that MLH will not be stigmatized and rejected. In addition, HIV commonly co-occurs with depression, alcohol abuse, intimate partner violence, and malnutrition in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. South Africa did not meet the MCH Millennium Development Goals 4 (child health), 5 (maternal health), or 6 (infectious diseases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This project will be a strong test to assess if the government-employed CHWs can create efficacious outcomes, within a challenging work culture that currently does not have the resources to provide ongoing in-service training nor vigorous structures to maintain what is delivered during home visits.</p><p id="Par44">The importance of identifying effective training models is highlighted by the recent Accra Call for Action for all governments to fund CHWs to expand their capacity to deliver evidence-based interventions (EBIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Current scientific practice requires that an HIV prevention program be validated by two RCTs to document that it is an EBI; then, the manuals of specific HIV EBIs must be replicated with fidelity by providers or other researchers for a specific population and setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. While the scientific community may require replication with fidelity, these current scientific norms are often not realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], especially for LMICs. Rather than aiming for replication with fidelity to a manual, CHWs in the PIM are taught the foundational theory of behavior change and skills common to 80% of all child and adolescent mental health EBIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">In South Africa, CHWs are taught to address and encourage health regarding alcohol, HIV, malnutrition, and depression. For each topic domain, a manual is written, framing the issue and providing some information to be applied in everyday life, building skills, establishing a social network and a set of implicit rewards to maintain the behaviors, and addressing the barriers to implementation. The manuals become prototypes that must be adapted and tailored by the CHW. If CHWs cannot become socially skilled problem solvers, no EBI is likely to be efficacious. The goal of training is to provide these skills and allow substantial tailoring, building on the common theory, principles, and skills shared across EBIs. Diffusing an EBI in this manner will be a disruptive innovation to standard practice in implementation science. By establishing training, monitoring, and supervision structures of the government&#x02019;s CHWs, significantly improved MCH outcomes over 5&#x000a0;years are predicted. The results of this RCT will be applicable to the existing 1.2 million CHWs globally, to the 50% of Africa that is similarly deeply rural.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par46">At the time of manuscript submission, recruitment had not begun.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par53">
