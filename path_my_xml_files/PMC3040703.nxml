Many studies in different countries have shown the poor quality of end-of-life care delivery in hospitals. The Program "Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient" (LCP), developed in the UK to transfer the hospice model of care into hospitals and other care settings, is a complex intervention to improve the quality of end-of-life care. The results from qualitative and quantitative studies suggest that the LCP Program can improve significantly the quality of end-of-life care delivery in hospitals, but no randomised trial has been conducted till now.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This is a randomized cluster trial, stratified by regions and matched for assessment period. Pairs of eligible medical wards from different hospitals will be randomized to receive the LCP-I Program or no intervention until the end of the trial. The LCP-I Program will be implemented by a Palliative Care Unit.</p><p>The assessment of the end-points will be performed for all cancer deaths occurred in the six months after the end of the LCP-I implementation in the experimental wards and, in the same period of time, in the matched control wards. The primary end-point is the overall quality of end-of-life care provided on the ward to dying cancer patients and their families, assessed using the Global Scale of the Italian version of the Toolkit <italic>"After-death Bereaved Family Member Interview</italic>".</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study can be interpreted as a Phase III trial according to the Medical Research Council Framework. In this study, the effectiveness of a fully defined intervention is assessed by comparing the distribution of the endpoints in the experimental and in the control arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Research ID</title><p>RFPS-2006-6-341619</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01081899">NCT01081899</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Despite the development of palliative care services worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and numerous studies showing that most cancer patients would prefer to die at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], most cancer patients still die in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Official Italian statistics on place of death are not available for Italy, but according to ISDOC survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], it is estimated that one third (34.6%) of cancer patients die in hospital, with broad geographical differences (from 60.2% in the North East to 4.6% in the South and islands). According to the ISDOC survey it is also possible to estimate that about 50% of all hospital cancer deaths occur on medical wards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies carried out in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have shown the poor quality of end-of-life care delivery in hospitals. Inappropriate end-of-life care may result in the continuation of invasive treatments that, in addition to having negative consequences in terms of resource management, negatively impact the quality of life of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The results of two Italian studies conducted in patients who died in hospital from cancer (ISDOC) and other conditions (EOLO) confirm what observed for other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Since the second half of the 90 s, research groups in the UK and the USA, have developed, implemented and started to evaluate the effect of the introduction of "Care Pathway" for end-of-life care in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The aim of these programs was to introduce the skills necessary to address the complex needs of dying patients and their families into the hospital setting, in an attempt to transfer the "hospice expertise" into a non-specialist context.</p><p>A "Care Pathway" is a set of evidence-based, medical and care practices aimed at specific groups of patients. The Care Pathway defines the expected course of events in patient care on an established timeline. Care pathways documentation becomes an integral part of the clinical documentation and allows outcomes assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the healthcare setting, Care Pathways have proved to be useful in improving efficiency and effectiveness of the process of care for various pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Among the different Care Pathways proposed at international level, the most structured and proficient seems to be the "Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient" (LCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Developed in the UK to transfer the hospice model of care into hospitals and other care settings, it is currently in use in over 20 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The implementation of the LCP Program, after an intensive training phase, revolves around the introduction of the LCP medical chart and other specific documentation for patients who have been assessed by a multidisciplinary team to be at the end of their life. The LCP documentation provides recommendations on different aspects of care including comfort measures, anticipatory prescription of medication and the assessment of nonessential medical treatments. It also provides guidance for the psychological and spiritual support of patients and their families. The LCP documentation allows the monitoring of results and supports the implementation of audit procedures.</p><p>The Italian version of the LCP - Un percorso integrato per le cure di fine vita in ospedale (LCP-I) - has been developed by the Regional Palliative Care Network of the National Cancer Research Institute of Genoa (Italy) in compliance with the original format. The final version has been endorsed by the Central Team UK, Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute Liverpool (MCPCIL).</p><p>In Italy, the LCP-I Program has been successfully piloted in 2007 in the Medical Ward of "Villa Scassi Hospital" in Genoa. The implementation process has been evaluated using a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. Focus groups, performed on sample of doctors and nurses before and after the implementation of the LCP-I, showed a perception of effectiveness of the Program, particularly in pain management and in communication with patients and their families.</p><p>The availability of an effective quality improvement program for the care of dying patients in hospitals is particularly relevant to the healthcare scenario. The LCP-I Program has provided enough evidence to justify a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness. Although the core objective of the LCP-I is improving the quality of end of life care for dying patients, the Program targets the healthcare professionals working on the hospital ward. The only feasible method of assessing the effectiveness of this Program is by performing a cluster trial, where hospital wards are randomized to receive (or not to receive) the implementation of the LCP-I Program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomized cluster trial, stratified by regions and matched for assessment period.

This can be attributed, in part, to the ethical issues which inevitably arise when carrying out research in this field. The vulnerability of the individuals involved, often aggravated by physical and psychological conditions related to elevated levels of stress, poses serious ethical dilemmas. In addition, dying patients are often unaware of the diagnosis or the gravity of their illness or may be incapacitated. These circumstances, plus difficulties encountered in obtaining valid patient informed consent, constitute barriers which discourage research in the end-of-life care context.</p><p>Only a fraction of the above mentioned barriers affects this study. The LCP-I Program is not aimed at increasing knowledge about end-of-life care but at improving the quality of end-of-life care delivered in hospitals. The LCP-I Program introduces in a medical ward effective procedures currently practiced in hospices worldwide onto the hospital ward. Hence, this trial is not aimed at consolidating scientific knowledge regarding the clinical and non-clinical recommendations contained in the Program but rather at assessing the effectiveness of the entire Program as a tool for improving care delivery. In other words, the aim of this study is to assess if the Program succeeds in its intent of improving the quality of end-of-life care delivery on the hospital ward by shifting the attitudes and actions of clinical staff towards better care practices. The study population is the clinical ward staff and not the patients: the involvement of patients and their families is only necessary to verify the efficacy of the change toward a better quality of care delivery.</p><p>It is now widely recognized that healthcare institutions, and the medical workforce, have a moral obligation to promote and support interventions for improving medical practices. Although quality improvement activities share some of the characteristics of clinical research and the boundary between these two areas often overlap (in both cases the effectiveness of an intervention is measured) there are, nonetheless, fundamental differences between the two areas that justify the adoption of different procedures for guaranteeing ethical conduct. With consideration to these differences (the minimal risk for the patients involved in quality improvement programs, the demonstrable and immediate benefit to those directly concerned, the introduction of existing evidence-based practices, the flexible and not rigidly formalized protocols, the necessity and obligation for health care institutions to improve the of the quality of care practices, the indirect use of personal data, the absence of sponsors, the clear public interest, etc.), the related international literature highlights the inadequacy of applying the strict protection procedures of clinical research, particularly informed consent, to quality-improvement programs, and favors the adoption of different informative/consent procedures and, where possible, a responsible and informed participation of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>For the above mentioned reasons, it is evident that it is not feasible to request informed consent from the patients as, in this study, the target population is the clinical staff. However, in order to guarantee confidentiality to patients whose data could be used as indicators to verify the validity of the Program, certain procedures are recommended:</p><p>&#x02022; the ethics committee is required not only to express an opinion on the study, but also to carry out monitoring activities. More precisely, every 3 months the Scientific Coordinator will send to the Ethical Committee of the National Cancer Research Institute of Genoa and to the Ethical Committees of each trust involved in the trial a detailed progress report highlighting all variances, in particular with regards to the relations with the family. For any further clarification, each Ethical Committee can request the Scientific Coordinator's participation.</p><p>As far as ethical issues regarding the proper handling of data is concerned it is necessary to distinguish two different phases of the trial:</p><p>1. collection and elaboration of data in the patients' medical documentation</p><p>2. contact and interview with the caregivers</p><p>Regarding collection and elaboration of data from patients' medical documentation:</p><p>&#x02022; the processing of data included in medical documentation is considered of significant public interest, to that purpose, in agreement with Articles 20 and 21 of the Italian Confidentiality Laws, it is accessible to the National Health Service and other Public Health organizations for the planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of healthcare;</p><p>&#x02022; in theory the evaluation could be subject to informed consent of the terminal cancer patients (patients who might die of cancer). In fact, the patients involved in the Program evaluation, who are nearly always incapable of giving valid consent, are identified after death (as cancer deaths), regardless of whether they were hospitalized in a ward where it LCP-I Program was implemented;</p><p>&#x02022; in all cases, where the patients are competent and aware of their health status (parameters previously assessed independently in the LCP-I Program) and where there is considered no risk to the patient, the clinical ward staff will be trained to deliver information to the patient and to ask them the consent to the use of personal data. This procedure will be recorded in the medical records;</p><p>&#x02022; during the study and in subsequent publications, any personal data will be disaggregated and made anonymous.</p><p>Regarding contact with the caregivers, the initial contact will be made through a personal letter which includes detailed information and requests their permission to be contacted by telephone. The caregiver will be contacted by phone after at least 3 days and will be invited to participate in the interview. The interview will be conducted by specifically trained staff.</p><p>This procedure has been used successfully in the ISDOC survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], with very satisfactory results:</p><p>&#x02022; sampling of 2,000 cancer deaths in 30 Italian Local Healthcare Authorities' areas.</p><p>&#x02022; caregiver identification in 95% of cases (N = 1900)</p><p>&#x02022; realization of 1271 valid interviews (64% of the sample).</p><p>&#x02022; reasons for non-completion of the interviews: no caregiver identified (5%), refusal (20%), caregiver not contactable (8%), other (3%).</p><p>As described in a published article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the interviewers did not encounter particular resistance in the realization of the interviews. Many caregivers found the letter respectful of their circumstances and the information provided about the procedures and the objectives of the study relatively comprehensive. In only one case (out of 1900), a cancer patient's daughter complained that a letter, specifying the cause of her father's death, had been sent to her mother who had not been aware of the nature of her husband illness. Following this observation, the cause of death is not specified in the letter used in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, the cluster design of the study and the randomization of wards to receive or not LCP-I Program is necessary for a scientifically based assessment of the effectiveness of the Program. However, to ensure that all the wards involved can benefit from the improvement brought by the Program, unless it proves to be not effective, at the conclusion of the trial the implementation of the LCP-I Program will be proposed also to the control wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Approvals</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Research Institute of Genoa (Italy) on September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2009 (Reference number: CCP09.001).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although it is now widely shared that clinical practice should be, wherever possible, evidence-based, programs to improve the quality of care are often implemented without an evaluation of their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Assessing these interventions is a challenge for their complexity, due to the presence of different types of components, activities, interventions and outcomes to be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and for specificity of the context of development and application.</p><p>The "Medical Research Council's Framework for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions to Improve Health (MRC Framework) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] is a promising and innovative approach aimed at providing a robust methodological basis to the evaluation of complex interventions. The MRC Framework has been used to develop and evaluate different treatments, services or public health interventions, including programs to improve the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>As for as the evaluation of drugs, the MRC Framework is divided into five stages, from "pre-clinical" Phase to Phase IV. Each phase suggests the uses of appropriate quantitative and/or qualitative methodologies for the specific objectives of the phases, and requires a specific study design taking into account the theoretical basis, any evidence on the issue and the context's specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. More recently, it has been underlined that the MRC Framework is flexible and adaptable approach, and the five phases has not to be clearly separated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For example, "pre-clinical phase" and phases I and II may be part of a unique approach that includes the study and understanding of the problem and context, the construction of models of intervention and the feasibility of assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The LCP Program can be defined as a complex intervention to improve the quality of end-of-life care independently of diagnosis and place of death. The results from qualitative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and from experimental assessments in non-randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] seem to suggest that the LCP Program can improve significantly, and over long-term, the quality of end-of-life care delivery in hospitals and other care settings. According to the MRC Framework, published research on the LCP completed the first three phases, from preclinical phases to phase II.</p><p>This study can be interpreted as a Phase III trial according to the MRC framework. In this study, the effectiveness of a fully defined intervention is assessed by comparing the distribution of the endpoints in the experimental arm and in the control arm. Although not all dying patients will be supported by the LCP Program, the assessment is planned on the whole sample of patients deceased in the experimental ward and in the correspondent control ward.</p><p>Cluster trial are often used for assessing interventions directed at a hospital team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The validity of this protocol is supported by the results of a recent Cochrane Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] on the effectiveness of end-of-life pathways. The review did not find any randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trial or high quality controlled before and after studies, to include in the analysis. The authors concluded that there is a lack of evidence supporting such practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and recommend the use of cluster randomised trials as the most effective study design in evaluating this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MC is the principal investigator and the guarantor of this work.
