IGF-1 also serves as a growth factor for muscle. The impact of therapeutic targeting of IGF-1 on muscle mass is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We evaluated muscle mass at L3 in patients enrolled in a randomized phase II study of MK-0646 (M), a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1 protein, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC). Two different doses of M were tested, 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg. We used the Slice-o-matic (ver 4.3) software to segregate CT images into muscle and fat components and measured muscle area (cm<sup>2</sup>) at baseline and after 2 and 4&#x000a0;months of treatment. Patients received either gemcitabine with erlotinib (G&#x02009;+&#x02009;E), G&#x02009;+&#x02009;E&#x02009;+&#x02009;M, or G&#x02009;+&#x02009;M.

Of these, 42 received M with their chemo, and 11 had G&#x02009;+&#x02009;E only. After 2&#x000a0;months of treatment, both groups demonstrated decrease in muscle mass. G&#x02009;+&#x02009;E patients lost 5.6&#x000a0;% of muscle mass; M patients lost 9.1 and 8.6&#x000a0;% after treatment with 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53).

The family of insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGF-1R, IGF-2R) may play a role in the growth of these tumors. Binding of the IGF ligands (IGF-1 and IGF-2) to IGF-1R allows autophosphorylation of the receptor, which in turn allows docking of the insulin receptor substrates (IRS 1-4)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These in turn may activate both the MEK and PI-3 kinase/AKT pathways in pancreatic cancer cells which lead to proliferation of tumor. Conversely, inhibition of IGF-1 and IGF-2 binding to IGF-1R with a monoclonal antibody inhibits growth of a variety of tumor types, including pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For this reason, we began a therapeutic trial of one such inhibitor, MK-0646; the results of which have been presented in abstract form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Aside from its effect on cancer cells, there is a possibility that IGF-receptor inhibition may influence muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Transgenic mice that overexpress IGF develop muscle mass hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IGF-1 is believed to mediate exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy and injury-triggered regeneration in skeletal muscle, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and may increase skeletal muscle proliferation, cause differentiation of myoblasts, increase muscle protein synthesis, and decrease protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that exposure to MK-0646 as part of our therapeutic treatment protocol may promote muscle loss. We analyzed the change in muscle mass among patients treated with and without the IGF-receptor antagonist to determine if this is the case. We also determined whether different radiologic response to chemotherapy correlates with the degree of muscle loss, and whether muscle mass loss correlates with survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were recruited from December 2008 through June 2011. Individuals were considered eligible if they carried a diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma and had at least one measurable lesion. They could not have had prior treatment for metastatic disease and could not have had prior exposure to IGF-1R antagonists. Prior treatment with adjuvant therapy was allowed if at least 6&#x000a0;months had elapsed since the end of their initial treatment. All patients were at least 18&#x000a0;years of age, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0&#x02013;1 (with one exception for a patient with ECOG 2 PS), and adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function. This study was approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment arms</title><p>In the phase I portion of the study, all patients received gemcitabine at 1,000&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day&#x000a0;cycle. In arm A, gemcitabine was combined with MK-0646 (weekly without interruption) at either 5&#x000a0;mg/kg (level 1) or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg (level 2) doses. In arm B of the phase I portion of the study, the same doses were used, and erlotinib was added to both drugs at a dose of 100&#x000a0;mg daily.</p><p>In the phase II portion of the study, patients were assigned to one of three treatment arms. These included the following: (a) gemcitabine 1,000&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;+&#x02009;MK-0646 10&#x000a0;mg/kg, (b) gemcitabine&#x02009;+&#x02009;MK-0646&#x02009;+&#x02009;erlotinib 100&#x000a0;mg daily, and (c) gemcitabine plus erlotinib as a control arm.</p><p>Dose reductions for relevant toxicities were specified in the protocol. Patients were permitted to remain on study until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression was observed. We routinely performed baseline computerized tomography (CT) scans, followed by additional scans after every 8&#x000a0;weeks (56&#x000a0;days&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7) of treatment.</p><p>To analyze the change in muscle, we included patients treated on study who had baseline and 2-month CT scans as noted above. We excluded patients who only had CT scans after 1&#x000a0;month of therapy, and we excluded patients who crossed over to another arm during the first 2&#x000a0;months of therapy. For the purposes of this study, patients were divided into two treatment groups: those who received MK-0646 for at least the first 2&#x000a0;months on study (&#x0201c;MK&#x0201d; group) and those who received therapy without MK (&#x0201c;no MK&#x0201d; group). We furthered divided the MK group into those who received 10&#x000a0;mg and those who received 5&#x000a0;mg for some analyses. We also analyzed patients by response group: those with partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).</p><p>During treatment, glucocorticoids were prescribed for nausea on the day of chemotherapy administration. There were, otherwise, no specific requirements for steroid use, though physicians were free to prescribe them as they deemed necessary. No centralized recording of steroid use is available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Muscle and adipose tissue measures</title><p>Changes in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm<sup>2</sup>) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) as determined by a study author (DF or MK). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic software<sup>TM</sup>, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of &#x02212;29 to +150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2&#x000a0;months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined &#x0201c;meaningful loss&#x0201d; as greater than a 6&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1&#x000a0;kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The CT analysis was done by two authors (DF, MK) who had practiced using the software under the guidance of two experienced investigators with a track record of publication in using this software (CP, JL). As part of this training, three of the authors (DF, MK, JL) each interpreted a series of five images demonstrating satisfactory inter-observer agreement.</p><p>In addition to a radiologic response, we assessed patient characteristics, including age, sex, race, performance status, weight, and statin use at the time of initial presentation, as possible factors associated with changes in muscle area. Baseline laboratory data included CA 19-9 level, IGF-1 level, albumin, hemoglobin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte (N:L) ratio.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our primary purpose was to compare changes in muscle area from baseline to after 2&#x000a0;months of treatment with gemcitabine with MK-0646, with or without erlotinib (MK group), as compared to standard treatment with gemcitabine plus erlotinib (non-MK group) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We also determined changes in adipose tissue from baseline to 2&#x000a0;months. We used Wilcoxon signed rank tests to determine whether there was a significant change in muscle area measures from baseline for each treatment group (MK 10, MK 5, and non-MK) and for each response group (PR, SD, and PD). We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the percent change in muscle mass across the three treatment groups and across the three response groups. We compared all baseline patient characteristics across the three treatment groups using chi-square tests or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables.</p><p>We also determined if muscle loss was associated with overall survival and time to drop out among the different treatment and response groups. We analyzed survival as a function of &#x0201c;meaningful&#x0201d; muscle area loss, defined as loss of at least 6&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> of muscle area between the baseline and 2-month CT scans. We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare survival between MK- and non-MK-treated patients, and by the presence or absence of meaningful muscle area loss. We constructed Cox proportional hazard models for survival by meaningful muscle area loss, treatment groups, response groups, and baseline patients&#x02019; characteristics to determine their relationship with overall survival. Using variables associated with survival with a <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10 in univariate analysis, we constructed a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to determine the independent effect of muscle loss when adjusting for other factors associated with survival.</p><p>All analyses for this study were completed using Stata IC version 11.2 (Statcorp, College Station, Texas).

This trend did not reach statistical significance, which is not surprising given the small number of patients in this study, particularly in the control group.</p><p>A number of trends were observed that lend credence to the notion of IGF-1R inhibition as contributory to muscle loss. Each of the MK dose levels (5 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg) had an increased (albeit not significant) loss of muscle as compared to the non-MK-treated patients. This held true when divided into those patients with stable disease and those with progressive disease (again, not meeting criteria for statistical significance). The pattern did not hold for those patients who responded to treatment; however, only two patients in the non-MK group responded, limiting our ability to assess this group.</p><p>It is clear from our analysis that muscle loss does correlate with survival. However, as the survival of the MK patients (with increased muscle loss) was better than that of the non-MK patients, it would seem that the muscle mass difference was outweighed by benefit of the drug.</p><p>We found notable the fact that even those patients with partial responses lost muscle mass. This observation leads us to conclude that even patients who appear to be responding to treatment should be pushed toward isometric exercise and nutritional intervention in the hope of retaining muscle mass. In this retrospective review, we were unable to assess the impact of muscle mass on quality of life or individual symptoms. However, this would be a fruitful subject for further research.</p><p>Limitations to our study included a small sample size. As our study has recently resumed enrollment, subsequent analyses might yield more power to demonstrate differences in treatment groups. We are particularly limited by the relatively small control group (11 patients) relative to the treatment group (42 patients). Unfortunately, no new patients will be added to this arm of the study. Additionally, patients who fared particularly poorly might not have received follow-up imaging, skewing our results toward healthier patients who may have lost less muscle than those who dropped out early. Unfortunately, we have no way to control for this.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed that patients treated with anti-IGF-1 therapy did not lose significantly more muscle than the non-MK-treated patients, though there was a trend in this direction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was partly funded by a philanthropic donation from the Crain-Maling foundation.
