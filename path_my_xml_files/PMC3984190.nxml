adaptation of composite resin onlays in primary teeth previously treated with 1%
sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (pulp irrigant) using two different resin luting
agents. </p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Forty extracted sound primary molars had their crowns prepared in a standardized
machine and were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10): G1 (1% NaOCl

The onlays were made with Z250 composite resin on plaster models. After luting,
the tooth/restoration set was stored in 100% relative humidity at 37&#x000ba;C for
24 h and finished with Soflex discs. Caries Detector solution was applied at the
tooth/restoration interface for 5 s. The specimens were washed and four digital
photos of each tooth were then taken. The extents of the gaps were measured with
Image Tool 3.0 software. The percentage data were submitted to a Kruskal-Wallis
test (&#x003b1;=0.05). The Relative Risk test analyzed the chance of a gap
presence correlated to each group. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05) among the groups.
The relative risk test revealed that some groups were more apt to have a presence

restorations<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The presence of
an enamel gap is an important factor that predicts future failures in composite
restorations, and this occurs because of the composite resin polymerization shrinkage.
Shrinkage leads to the development of higher stresses when the composite is bonded to
the cavity walls<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Even indirect
restorations, which are expected to have minimal polymerization shrinkage due to cement
agents, experience this phenomenon<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>It is extremely important to recognize enamel gap. As the normal stresses at the
tooth/composite interface of a restoration increases from the enamel margins towards the
internal cavity angle<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, it can lead
to discoloration, microleakage and secondary caries<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The feature of a linearly measured gap seems to be a lack of
adhesion. Alonso, et al.<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> (2004)
detected marginal gaps in the dentin/resin interface using a stain composed of red acid
and propylene glycol (Caries Detector<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The detected gaps were
measured by a digital system that has presented reliable results. The gaps identified by
the digital system are easy to carry out and the results are valid when compared to a
scanning electronic microscopy analysis of the same gaps<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>It is widely believed that root-filled teeth are weakened and more susceptible to
fracture than vital ones, especially because there is a reduction of the inner cuspal
slopes that support the cuspal angles of the coronal tooth structure during endodontic
treatment<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Composite restorations are the best choice for sealing
weakened treated teeth, as the micromechanical retention obtained by the resin-dentin
interdiffusion zone (hybrid layer) is effective in strengthening the weakened tooth
after endodontic therapy<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Indirect composite restorations have several over direct ones, such as the replacement
of natural convexities of teeth, control of proximal contact points<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and polishing and
finishing possibilities. Because indirect restorations can be done outside the mouth,
these factors contribute to improve the treatment of pediatric patients and also
decrease the time spent chairside<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a better marginal fit can be obtained, especially in
the gingival walls of indirect restorations.</p><p>Primary teeth present structural and compositional differences from permanent teeth,
such as thinner dentin layer and the lower degrees of mineralization<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Secondary dentin secretion and pulpal
repair activity decreases with aging in primary teeth. These promote a favorable
condition for the carious process to reach the coronary pulp<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In these cases, an indirect composite restoration can be
a better treatment choice.</p><p>Because microorganisms penetrate from a coronal direction and might re-infect the root
canal system, a lack of adhesion between the final restoration and tooth structure may
reduce the prognosis of an endodontically treated tooth<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Thus, the quality of the coronal restoration is a
critical factor for the overall prognosis of the tooth after the root canal is
filled.</p><p>Several features interact cumulatively to influence the tooth gap at the interface
between cavity walls and composite restorations. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) irrigation
during endodontic therapy could affect the ability to create a high-quality adhesion of
restorative materials to the pulp chamber wall<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. According to Morris,
et al.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (2001), The oxidizing action
of NaOCl probably leads to the oxidation of some components in the dentin matrix that
may compromise the process of initiation due to polymerization of the resin system.
Borges, et al.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (2008) showed that 1%
NaOCl modified the inorganic molecular content. Insufficient polymerization of the
adhesive system, for example, could lead to gaps at the tooth/restoration interface.</p><p>Resin luting agents present different adhesive systems that mostly vary with regard to
solvent component<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Acetone and
ethanol solvents require moisturized dentin during the adhesion procedure, but it is not
specified in some instructions for use. Dentin overdrying can lead to the collapse of
the collagen fibril network, affecting negatively dentin adhesion<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Even in indirect restorations, there are signs that marginal defects occur despite the
use of luting agents<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Particularly in primary teeth, there is no study
evaluating the presence of gaps in cavities prepared in endodontically treated teeth.
Root canal filling in primary teeth has been done with several filler pastes that do not
set, such as zinc oxide and eugenol. Therefore, it is more dangerous if contamination
occurs in primary teeth when compared to filling materials used in permanent
teeth<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>The hypotheses of the present study are: (1) treatment with 1% NaOCl can increase the
enamel gaps of composite onlays in primary teeth and (2) there is a difference between
the two resin luting agents tested, which require adhesive systems with different
solvents and manufacturers' instructions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of FOP/UNICAMP (approval No.

<italic>Occlusal box</italic>: the isthmus width was approximately half of the
buccolingual distance without any beveling of the occlusal cavosurface margin. The depth
ranged according to the anatomy of the teeth. For first molars, the depth of pulpal wall
was 2.0 mm below the tallest cusp. For second molars, the depth of pulpal wall was 2.5
mm below the tallest cusp.</p><p>
<italic>Proximal box</italic>: the depth was determined according to the remaining
distance of each tooth with the polystyrene resin base due to the variation in
cervical-occlusal heights. The inner angles of the prepared teeth were rounded.</p><p>All teeth underwent additional reduction of the largest cusp: distolingual cusps of the
mandibular first molars, palatal cusp of the maxillary first molars, distolingual cusps
of the mandibular second molars and mesiopalatal cusps of the maxillary second
molars.</p><p>The treatment with 1% NaOCl in G1 and G3 was carried out to simulate irrigation during
the root canal therapy. Each tooth was placed in a plastic container while the solution
was simultaneously flushed out through a disposable pipette for 30 min and with the
Multi-Sonic-s ultrasound (Gnatus, Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, SP, Brazil). This was done to
simulate an irrigation section using ultrasound.</p><p>Impressions of the preparations were taken with heavy and light addition silicone
(Express; 3M/ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), and the casts were poured in plaster (Herostone;
Vigodent, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). Next, the casts were isolated with Isolant Gel
(KG Sorensen Ind. Com. Ltda., Barueri, SP, Brazil) and the indirect restorations
(onlays) were made with Z-250 composite resin (3M/ESPE; shade C4), using an incremental
technique beginning with the proximal box followed by the occlusal box. Each increment
was light-activated for 40 s using an Elipar Trilight curing unit (ESPE).</p><p>The bonding procedure on tooth surface was done according to the manufacturer's
instructions, which consisted of 37% phosphoric acid etching followed application of
Prime Bond 2.1 or Single </p><p>Bond for the luting agents En Force or Rely-X (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f01">Figure
1</xref>), respectively. The resin luting agents were inserted on the inner surfaces
of the onlays being cleaned with phosphoric acid for 20 s. The onlays were fixed by
finger pressure to simulate a clinical situation, and excess cement was removed with a
cutting instrument. Then, each surface (buccal, lingual, mesial, and distal) was
light-activated for 40 s. Finally, the restoration/tooth set was stored in 100% relative
humidity at 37&#x000ba;C for 24 h followed by a finishing procedure using Soflex discs
(3M/ESPE). The tooth preparations, the composite onlays and the bonding procedures were
done by the same operator.</p><p>After storage, Caries Detector<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Kuraray Co., Osaka, Japan) was
applied on the restoration margins for 5 s, followed by rinsing in tap water gentle air
drying<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Two black dots were
drawn 2 mm apart with a pen using a digital caliper rule to calibrate the measurement
used in the Image Tool 3.0 software (University of Texas, Health Science Center at San
Antonio, TX, USA). Two dots were drawn on each of the buccal, mesial, distal and lingual
surfaces. Then, with a Mavica FD 97 camera (Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan), digital color
photographs were taken of each tooth surface (buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial and
distal) from a fixed distance, at equal magnification and with equal light levels.</p><p>Each digital photograph (&#x000d7;40 magnification) of each surface was then evaluated in the
Image Tool software. The two black dots drawn on the tooth surfaces were used to
calibrate the spatial measurements. The command "calibrate spatial measurements" in the
Image Tool Software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3A</xref>) was used to
transform the measurements into mm. A line was drawn to join the two black dots after
the conversion into mm, and the number 2 was written into a specific box that required
an exact measurement value used as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3B</xref>). Afterwards, each measurement was automatically converted into mm. This
procedure was repeated for each photograph.</p><fig id="f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Sequence of gap measurements. A and B: Calibration of measurements to mm. C:

tooth/restoration margins, and the sum of those four surface lengths was determined as
the total length of the tooth/restoration interface. The same procedure was carried out
on the stained areas considered to show the presence of gaps, and the sum of the stained
area lengths of each tooth was considered as the total gap length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>A blinded, calibrated examiner measured all marginal gaps after obtaining reliable gap
lengths using 25% of the total sample. The statistical correlation results (Pearson's
correlation test) showed a 96% confidence. The gaps at the tooth/restoration margins
were determined. The data from each specimen were transformed into gap percentages in
relation to the total margin using the equations: <inline-formula><mml:math id="eq01"><mml:mstyle mathcolor="#000000" mathsize="12.0pt" mathvariant="normal"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Gap</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">dl</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Tl</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where dl is the stained length and Tl is the total
margin length. The gap percentages were subjected to a Kruskal Wallis test at 5%
significance level. Moreover, the Relative Risk test was used to analyze the possibility
of a gap presence. According to Kleinbaum, et al.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (1986), this test involves the division of the number of
specimens with gaps by the number of specimens without gaps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The gap percentage medians and quartiles of the groups are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>. The Relative Risks of gap presence of the

the evaluated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4</xref>). The bars
represent the quartiles and the vertical lines represent the median values for each
group. It can be observed that G3 (1% NaOCl irrigation+Rely X) and G4 (Rely X) had first
quartile values (25%) coinciding with zero, while G2 showed the longest distance to
zero. These findings indicate groups with a higher and lower quantity of the specimens
without a gap presence, respectively. G1 (1% NaOCl irrigation+EnForce) can be thought to
have an intermediate chance of having gaps compared to the other groups. G3 (1% NaOCl

group did not present any specimens with gaps.</p><p>The Relative Risk test did not show statistically significant differences among the

have different manufacturers' instructions and solvents, the presence of interfacial
gaps in the two resin luting agents was statistically similar.</p><p>There was no significant difference related to the length of the gap present in the
enamel margins of the restorations in all groups. There was also no significant
interaction between the substrate treatment and the resin luting agent. The percentage
of gaps found in this study was lower compared to the results of other studies<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, especially considering that gaps were
measured from the total margin lengths of the samples. Although the gap percentages were
low, they are still unfavorable percentages representing the first signs of a future
clinical failure of the restoration.</p><p>It is very important to identify the initial gaps in indirect composite restorations of
primary teeth because these are predictors of future composite failures, which start
from the margins<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Braun, et al.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>(2001) showed a correlation between marginal deterioration and
long-term failures. Moreover, the loss of integrity of restorations placed in
endodontically treated teeth is more frequently responsible for unsuccessful endodontic
treatment than failures in endodontic therapy <italic>per se</italic>. For this reason,
the success of root-filled teeth restored with direct or indirect composite resins
depends on a high-quality bond of the material to the dental structure.</p><p>The magnitude of the generated stress is the main cause of the initial gaps that form in
the composite restorations. This is influenced by three main factors: tooth cavity
preparation, material composition, and technique. The interplay among these factors
determines the exact manifestation of the shrinkage for a given restoration<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>First, cavity preparation influences the amount of the gap margin. It has been shown
that indirect composites better fit onlays with single cusp coverage and wide occlusal
isthmus than those with double cusp coverage and wide isthmus<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Second, monomer composition, filler content, degree of
conversion and the resulting polymer crosslinking of resin luting agents are all closely
related to the amount of polymerization shrinkage<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Both EnForce and Rely X have Bis-GMA molecules as the main
monomer, which has a high viscosity that is minimized by the high percentage of diluent
monomers (TEGDMA). However, this causes significant polymerization shrinkage.</p><p>Furthermore, the higher the elastic modulus, the higher the polymerization
stress<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. As such, the
bifunctional monomers Bis-GMA/TEGDMA result in a large number of double bonds
<italic>per</italic> a given unit of weight. They create a high degree of
crosslinking and produce a very rigid polymeric network, which contributes to an
increase in the elastic modulus of the resulting material. The similarity in the
compositions of the two resin luting agent suggests the same behavior related to
polymerization shrinkage and their close gap percentages, although the adhesive systems
present different solvents in their composition and manufacturers'
instructions<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The instructions
for Prime Bond 2.1, used before the application of En Force, did not include details
regarding how wet the dentin should be kept before primer application. This lack of
information regarding proper techniques may influence the result of a restoration. If
acetone is used as the solvent and if the dentin is excessively dried, the exposed
collagen network may collapse via etching. Conversely, it was verified that both
adhesive systems (Single Bond and Prime Bond 2.1), when used together with their resin
luting agents, failed to influence enamel gap formation in composite onlays, regardless
of the lack of moisture when Prime Bond 2.1 bond was used.</p><p>Finally, when the onlays were restored, they were fixed during light-activation using
finger pressure and no other force, which was designed to simulate a clinical situation.
Dietschi, et al.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (1993) showed that
even if thick enamel margins were available to maintain the marginal integrity, the
internal bond to the dentin surface would be disrupted when the position of the inlay
relative to the tooth was rigidly maintained during resin cement polymerization. The
authors stated that the decrease in the dentin leakage depended on the likelihood of the
indirect restoration and/or tooth to deform during cement polymerization.</p><p>In this study, the margin of the restoration was placed in enamel, although most of the
bonding areas were in dentin. Ozturk and Ozer<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (2004) stated that during endodontic treatment, the dentin in the
pulp chamber is not affected by mechanical instrumentation, whereas root dentin is.
Consequently, NaOCl action on dentin surface is considered regular. Marshall, et
al.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (2001) observed that 6.5%
NaOCl used for 30 min produced porosities and a large numbers of channels in the
mineralized dentin. No changes were found in the elasticity modulus and hardness of
dentin. In this study, because NaOCl was used at low concentrations, the slight
morphological alterations in the dentin and the enamel may not be associated with
changes in the mechanical properties. Thus, in this study, there was no difference among
the groups regarding the degree of marginal adaptation.</p><p>It may be observed that all groups showed a majority of restorations without any
marginal gaps. The possibility of marginal gap occurrence was 2.64 times higher for G2
(EnForce) when compared to G4 (Rely-X). G1 and G2 showed the same number of specimens
with gaps, indicating a relative risk of 1. Finally, G3 (NaOCl+Rely-X) did not present
any specimen with gaps; compared to G1 and G4, its relative risk was 0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). An interesting point was that no G3
restoration presented gaps. Considering that G3 received the NaOCl treatment, it can be
numerically shown that the resin luting agent Rely-X presents the best performance if a
tooth had been previously treated with an endodontic procedure.</p><p>These data are relevant because they show that even though there were no differences
concerning the gap percentage means among the groups, there were certain groups with a
higher chance of having unsuccessful specimens in their marginal adaptation. This
represents the individual restorations. The identification of the degree of success in
the marginal adaptation is as important as the recognition of unsuccessful restorations,
although the absence of an initial failure does not necessarily assure the long-term
success of the restoration.</p><p>Among the sites with marginal gaps, the highest gap incidence occurred at the cervical
margins of restorations regardless of the group, as observed by Soares, et al.<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (2003). This occurs because marginal gap
formation may be determined by the polymerization shrinkage of resin luting agents. In
addition, at the cervical margins of primary teeth, the enamel is usually thin,
aprismatic and less receptive to bonding than other enamel areas<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Thus, when the luting composite is
polymerized, it shrinks toward the superior bond margins and away from the weaker
margins at the cervical wall<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Endodontically treated primary teeth require additional attention because failure at the
composite/tooth interface may be more significant than even a deteriorated restoration.
Because primary tooth roots are filled with pastes like zinc oxide and eugenol or
calcium hydroxide, they are may result in infection and a failure in pulpal
therapy<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, treatment with 1% NaOCl did not influence the
early marginal adaptation; both resin luting agents caused similar degrees of marginal
gap formation. The substrate treatment (1% NaOCl) and the use of Rely-X were associated
with a higher likelihood of restorations without any initial marginal gaps.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>RCB</given-names></name><name><surname>Correr</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cunha</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name><name><surname>Borges</surname><given-names>AFS</given-names></name><name><surname>Puppin-Rontani</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinhoreti</surname><given-names>MAC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dye staining gap test: an alternative method for assessing marginal
