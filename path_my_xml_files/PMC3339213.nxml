Longer durations combined with frequent hospital visits would increase treatment costs and limit wider application. The high cost of treatment combined with the hassle of daily hospital visits makes treatment adherence difficult in cognitive retraining. Hence, there is a need to develop a cognitive retraining program which is easy to implement and inexpensive. A home-based cognitive retraining program may be the answer as it eliminates daily hospital visits, making it user friendly. The reduction in costs due to reduced staff costs in the hospital and the reduction of travel cost to the patient might enable a longer duration of treatment at a lower cost.</p><p>The present study was carried out with an aim to develop a cognitive retraining program targeting a range of cognitive functions known to be impaired in schizophrenia. It was also aimed to make this cognitive retraining program home based, with a minimum level of monitoring by a family member. Such a program would reduce the financial and personal burden of visiting the hospital frequently. The intervention program would then be a cost-effective treatment for schizophrenia. The efficacy of the program in first-episode schizophrenia patients was tested by comparing it with routine treatment given in our hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample</title><p>The sample consisted of 45 patients with an International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) diagnosis of schizophrenia in the first episode of illness. Based on the clinical history and clinical examination, diagnosis as per the ICD-10 criteria was made by the resident psychiatrist, and concurred by the consultant psychiatrist. Duration of illness was less than 2 years. Patients spoke English or Kannada or Hindi fluently, had adequate visual and hearing ability, and had minimum education up to 5<sup>th</sup> grade. Patients with a diagnosis of mental retardation, presence of neurosurgical conditions or neurological condition other than schizophrenia, and those who had undergone electroconvulsive therapy in the past 6 months were excluded. One member who was identified as patient's primary caregiver (parent/spouse/sibling/relative) living with the patient for at least the past 6 months and actively involved in taking care of the patient, not having any current psychiatric illness, was included in the study. The research study was approved by the National Institute's ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from the patients as well as the caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Assessment of patients</title><p>Psychopathology profile of patients was obtained using the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Disability in overall functioning was assessed using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule-II (WHODAS-II).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The neuropsychological tests administered were: Digit Vigilance test,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Color Trails test,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Triads test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] to assess attention; finger tapping test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] to assess motor speed; Digit Symbol Substitution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] to assess mental speed; Token test[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] to assess verbal comprehension; Animal Names test,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] verbal N-back &#x02013; Task,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Stroop test,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Tower of London,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] to assess various executive functions; Rey's auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] to assess verbal learning and memory and Rey Osterrieth complex figure test (CFT)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] to assess visuo-constructive ability and visual memory.</p><p>The scores on the neuropsychological tests were compared with norms appropriate to that of the subject's gender, age, and education. Indian norms for the tests in the neuropsychological battery have been developed based on literacy [illiterates, school educated (1st to 10th std), and college educated (11<sup>th</sup> std and above)], age [young adults (16&#x02013;30 years), middle-aged adults (31&#x02013;50 years), and older adults (51&#x02013;65 years)], and sex (males and females).

The Likert scoring method of 0&#x02013;1&#x02013;2&#x02013;3 with a threshold score of 39/40 was used. The AFD is a self-rating scale for assessment of family distress experienced due to an ill member in the family. The scale has a list of 25 different behaviors and option for allowing caregivers to mention any other behavior causing distress. The severity of distress was captured on a 5-point rating scale. The symptoms were grouped under four categories, viz., activity related, self-care related, aggression related, and depression related. The severity of distress was measured using a 5-point rating scale (0=no distress, 1=minimal distress, 2=moderate distress, 3=marked distress, and 4=intense distress).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Design</title><p>The study used a randomized controlled design. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either the treatment group or the control group. The experimental group received a 2-month home-based cognitive retraining program along with treatment as usual, which included drug treatment and psychoeducation. Control group received treatment as usual (drug treatment and psychoeducation). Both groups received three sessions of psychoeducation. The tests / tools were administered to patients and caregivers at baseline (prior to the intervention), post-assessment (after the intervention), and at 6-month follow-up (4 months after completion of the intervention).

The significant interaction effect has shown that addition of cognitive retraining to treatment as usual led to improvement in executive functions such as divided attention, planning, concept formation and set-shifting ability, following treatment. The large effect sizes indicate the improvement to be substantial. Further, the improvement sustained for 6 months even though treatment had ceased. The improved cognition in the treatment group cannot be attributed to practice on the neuropsychological tests as the control group also underwent the pre-, post- and follow-up assessments. Supplementing the interaction effect is the group effect which has shown better motor speed, verbal working memory, concept formation and set-shifting ability, verbal learning, and visuo-constructive ability. Since the two groups were comparable at baseline on the above functions, the significant group effect may be attributed to the effect of intervention.</p><p>Several factors could have played a role in the improvement observed. First, cognitive functions were targeted employing the bottom-up method. Basic cognitive functions such as attention and mental speed were targeted in the initial phase of the retraining program, followed by higher-order cognitive functions such as planning and set-shifting ability later in the program. Secondly, tasks were arranged in increasing level of task difficulty, thereby not taxing the patient unduly, and facilitated learning. Thirdly, improvement in executive functions may have had a cascading effect on improving other functions such as motor speed, verbal learning, and visuo-constructive ability. Fourthly, the very fact that patient was made to feel less &#x0201c;patient-like&#x0201d; by placing the responsibility of carrying out cognitive retraining by himself/herself with very minimal involvement by the caregiver may have enhanced motivation. Also, the gradual increase in difficulty would have helped to sustain motivation to perform the tasks. Medalia and Choi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] have highlighted the fact that motivation mediates adherence and improvement in cognitive functions via cognitive remediation programs.</p><p>The present study also found a reduction in negative symptoms as seen by the group effect similar to the findings by Wykes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The observed decrease in negative symptoms may be attributed to the improvement in executive functions. Negative symptoms are associated with poor executive functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] The present results found improvement in seven functions of which four (divided attention, concept formation and cognitive flexibility, verbal working memory, planning) were executive functions. Goal-directed behavior is improved by executive functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] It may be hypothesized that improved executive functions improved goal directedness which was reflected as reduced negative symptoms.</p><p>The additional improvements noted above, attributable to cognitive retraining, have not included further improvements of global outcome. Addition of cognitive retraining may have resulted in changes in global functioning which may not have been picked up during the interview and assessment carried out using the WHODAS.</p><p>Improvement in measures of psychological health and family distress did not differ significantly between the groups following intervention. The caregivers in the present sample had probably not reached the level of distress that is generally observed in chronic illness group. When a patient and caregiver visit hospital in the initial phase of the illness, the family has little knowledge of the causes, symptoms, and management of the illness. Tolerance will be high toward changes in patient's behavior and symptoms. It is known from previous studies that improved caregivers&#x02019; knowledge about the illness leads to decrease in relapse and rehospitalization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] The increased knowledge gained through psychoeducation may have improved the psychological health as well as resulted in decrease in perceived level of distress.</p><p>The present study had significant dropout of patients from recruitment period to follow-up assessment period. Patients who dropped out of treatment either started medical treatment elsewhere or refused to come for treatment. Refusal of treatment could reflect family members&#x02019; difficulty in accepting the diagnosis of the illness or avoidance of stigma attached with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or stigma associated with visiting a tertiary mental hospital where the study was carried out.</p><p>This study had several limitations such as small sample size, significant dropout, and absence of independent rater who was blind to the allocation of patients to the two groups. Using a quantitative method to measure even subtle changes in global functioning and occupational functioning could have added to the strength of the study. In spite of these limitations, the 2-month-long home-based cognitive retraining program has improved cognitive functions and decreased negative symptoms. Increasing the duration of the home-based retraining program and combining it with other social skills&#x02019; training program may improve cognition, clinical functioning, and overall functioning further.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
