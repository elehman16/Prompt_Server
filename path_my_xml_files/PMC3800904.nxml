All menstrual disorders are due to vitiation of apana vayu. Krishnabola (Aloe barbendis) is mentioned in Ayurvedic texts for the treatment of artavakshaya due to its artavjanak (emmenagogue) property. The aim of the study was to access the efficacy of Krishnabola in patients who were suffering from artavkshaya (Scanty menses, increased inter menstrual period, and decreased duration of menstruation) and on the functions of apanvayu.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>The artavjanak (emmenagogue) activity of the Krishnabola (Aloe Barbadensis) was studied in women who were suffering from Artavkshaya (Scanty menses, increased inter menstrual period, and decreased duration of menstruation). Clinical trial was carried out at Government Ayurved College, Nanded (M.S.) on 80 patients of aartavkshaya in two groups. In experimental group 100 mg of krishnabola powder was given orally with lukewarm water before meal twice a day to 40 patients and in control group placebo (Indian arrow root powder) was administered for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Then the effect on functions of apanvayu and duration of menstrual period, inter menstrual cycle period, amount of menstrual blood were observed. The data was analysed by statistical z-test. Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, Ashtanga Hridaya, Bhavprakash, Indian Materia Medica, Text book of Gynaecology were consulted for relevant information.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>1) Krishnabola increased the amount of menstrual blood (72%), period of menstruation and decreased inter menstrual period (69 %) as well as incidences of dysmenorrhoea (66%). 2) Krishnabola improved the functions of apanvayu.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The collected data points to the role of krishnabola (Aloe Barbadensis) in the management of artavkshaya. Being emmenagogue, krishnabola increased amount of menstrual blood, duration of menstruation and decreased inter menstrual period significantly. Statistical z test showed significant results.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
