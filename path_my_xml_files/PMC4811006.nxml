This dose&#x02013;response relationship might only hold true for those participants who are actively engaged in interventions. This Internet study investigated the role of engagement in a planning intervention to promote fruit and vegetable consumption in addition to testing the intervention effect on planning and behavior. A sample of 701 adults (mean = 38.71 years, 81% women) were randomly assigned either to a planning intervention (experimental group) or to one of 2 control conditions (untreated waiting list control group or placebo active control group). Moderated mediation analyses were carried out. Significant changes over time and time &#x000d7; group effects revealed the effectiveness of the intervention. The effect of the intervention (time 1) on changes in behavior (time 3; 1 month after the personal deadline study participants set for themselves to start implementing their plans) was mediated by changes in planning (time 2; 1 week the personal deadline). Effects of planning on behavior were documented only at a moderate level of intervention engagement. This indicates an inverse U-shaped dose&#x02013;response effect. Thus, examining participants&#x02019; intervention engagement allows for a more careful evaluation of why some interventions work and others do not.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>moderated mediation</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>intentions</kwd><kwd>planning</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-March 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The leading causes of morbidity and mortality in most countries are modifiable risk behaviors, such as physical inactivity or an unhealthy diet.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Developing effective behavior change interventions is therefore one of the key endeavors.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> One target behavior that is considered crucial for preventive health interventions is a diet consisting mainly of low-energy, nutrient-dense food such as fruits and vegetables.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, it is not clear how such recommendations can be communicated effectively to individuals and how the dose&#x02013;response relationships transpire. Thus, the main purpose of this article is to test this in a longitudinal online study.</p><sec id="section1-1559325816637515"><title>Behavior Change Interventions</title><p>Behavior change interventions are complex affairs comprising different components that can be clustered into 2 categories: techniques and implementation. Intervention techniques target constructs and variables, such as self-efficacy, change techniques, for example, model learning, and mode(s) of delivery, for example, puppets, video, brochures.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Theories of health behavior change provide guidance under which circumstances which variables should be addressed.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The intervention implementation process is composed of delivery fidelity (eg, compliance with protocol<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>), successful dissemination among the target population,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and intervention engagement.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>Often when evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention, researchers restrict their investigation to the techniques only<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and conclude that depending on the outcome of the intervention study, they addressed, more or less, the appropriate determinants of behavior change.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Examining factors concerning both the techniques and their implementation would allow for more sound conclusions as to why one intervention is more effective in modifying behavior than others. Thus, in the following, we will focus first on the techniques and second on their implementation.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1559325816637515"><title>Planning as the Target of Behavior Change Interventions</title><p>Behavior change interventions aim at modifying risk behaviors by addressing predictors of behavior change, and one such predictor is planning.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Through planning, individuals notice and create opportunities for engaging in intended behavior changes. As such, planning is a prospective self-regulatory strategy. In the Health Action Process Approach,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> 2 types of planning are defined. Action planning refers to the precise specification of the situation in which the behavior will be performed. Coping planning refers to the anticipation of barriers that may hinder behavior performance and subsequently identifying strategies that help the individual cope with said barriers.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Action planning and coping planning work best in combination because they operate simultaneously as additive mediating processes and interactive counterparts.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In practice, this finding should result in the implementation of combined planning interventions. The simultaneous influence of these 2 types of planning should be accounted for.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>For a wide range of behaviors, it has been demonstrated that interventions prompting planning lead to changes in behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The proposed mechanism here is that a planning intervention exerts its influence on changes in behavior via changes in behavioral predictors.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Planning involves linking situation parameters (when, where) to a predefined sequence of action (how). The mediating factors are cue accessibility and the strength of the cue&#x02013;response linkage.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Action planning and coping planning are both important components of volitional planning interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
</p><p>This mediation mechanism and, with that, the dose-response might differ in subgroups of participants (eg, the mediation might hold true for engaged individuals but not for unengaged one). This may account for some studies&#x02019; failure to support the usefulness of a planning intervention for behavior change.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The given explanation represents a case of moderated mediation.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> If a moderator variable is dichotomous (eg, gender), then mediation in one group (eg, in the group of women) and lack of mediation in the other (eg, in the group of men) reflect a moderated mediation. A moderated mediation can also be expressed as an interaction between the moderator and the predictor or between the moderator and the mediator, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Intervention engagement can be a putative moderator of the effect that a planning intervention exerts on changes in behavior via changes in planning.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1559325816637515"><title>Intervention Engagement as a Moderator</title><p>Over and above compliance with an assignment, the concept of engagement additionally comprises undivided attention (ie, the avoidance and disregard of distractions and the restraint from engagement in non&#x02013;task-related activities), effort (engagement in the narrowest sense, as it shows that individuals are not merely &#x0201c;going through the motions&#x0201d;), and, to some degree, immersion in a given task or a health behavior intervention. As such, it is more than just being physically present; it is to utilize the provided time for its designated purpose. A proxy for intervention engagement can be the time actively used when participating in an intervention, although this taps only one component of the engagement concept.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, the use of this term, conceptualization, and assessment methods have all been inconsistent in previous research.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In a review in children&#x02019;s mental health services, Lindsey et al<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> found 22 engagement practice elements&#x02014;such as accessible promotion and modeling&#x02014;and most of them with effect on adherence and cognitive preparation.

One of those few studies was the one by van den Berg and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The researchers evaluated an individualized training in terms of engagement and its interrelation with physical activity. Although clear evidence was found that more engagement was associated with more physical activity, it remained unclear which psychological processes actually explained the effect of engagement on behavior. As no other study could be found on this either, the current research was conducted to shed light into these mechanisms by testing an Internet-based planning intervention (experimental group [EG]) against a placebo active control group (ACG) and a nontreated waiting list control group (WLCG).</p><p>Engagement is expected to moderate the effect that a health behavior intervention exerts on changes in behavior via changes in planning because the intervention should only lead to changes in cognitions (eg, action planning and coping planning) if participants engage in it.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This represents a case of moderated mediation in which the moderator interacts with the predictor.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In other words, the efficacy of the intervention is expected to depend on its successful change in behavioral predictors such as planning (mediation process), and this, in turn, depends on sufficient intervention engagement (moderation).</p></sec><sec id="section4-1559325816637515"><title>Aims and Hypotheses</title><p>The aim was to examine whether the Internet-based planning intervention (EG) would produce significantly more intervention engagement in comparison to an untreated control group (a WLCG), only filling in the questionnaire, but equally engaged as a placebo-treated group (an ACG).

In this online study, N = 701 individuals were assigned to an untreated control group (WLCG), a placebo ACG, or an EG. Results showed changes over time and interactions between time and group clearly in favor of the EG. However, the novelty about this study lies in the analyses of the psychological mechanisms how an intervention translates into behavior change depending on potential mediators and moderators. Therefore, the 2 control groups (the WLCG and the ACG) were combined and compared with the EG.</p><p>So far, only little was known about the specific nonlinear mechanisms of how behavioral interventions translate into behavior change. In the present study, we aimed at adding to the understanding by explicitly investigating the mechanisms between the intervention and behavior change. Therefore, we experimentally manipulated action planning and coping planning to investigate whether the effect of the intervention on changes in fruit and vegetable consumption could be accounted for by changes in planning. Moreover, we examined the role of intervention engagement in the process of behavior change to discover whether this mediation mechanism varies for different levels of intervention engagement. In our approach, we aimed at integrating aspects of intervention techniques and intervention implementation. This allows for a more complex evaluation of a behavior change intervention and subsequently provides a possible explanation for previous ambivalent research findings concerning the role of planning in the behavior change process (cf,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>).</p><p>The effect of intervention on changes in fruit and vegetable consumption was fully mediated by changes in action planning and coping planning.

Moreover, engagement in the intervention emerged as a moderator of this effect in the way that intervention led to changes in action planning and coping planning, respectively, only if engagement in the intervention was at a moderate level (3.2 and 5 on the 1- to 6-point scale for action planning and 2.0 and 4.5 on the 1- to-6 point for coping planning).</p><p>Although previous research has suggested a positive linear relationship between engagement and intervention effects (cf,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>), results of this study point toward a nonlinear relationship. In particular, we found that the mediation mechanism only held true for medium levels of engagement. That is, when participants were too little or too highly engaged in the intervention, the effects of intervention on changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were not mediated via changes in action planning and coping planning, respectively. This result is in agreement with 2 studies that suggest a similar, inverted U-shaped relationship between number of plans and changes in behavior<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> or number of lifestyle recommendations and success rate of translating those recommendations into behavior.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The authors of the latter study concluded that this effect is due to the interventions enabling the necessary threshold of motivation to translate the recommendation into their lifestyle. Thereby, the compliance was increased with the intervention-based goals, while the intervention did not become too demanding. The previous and the current finding are arguing that cognitive demands increase with the number of recommendations to change or plans that are generated in an intervention. Although making plans is not equal to engagement, it may be seen as an indicator of effort and may explain why the mediation mechanism did not work for high levels of engagement.</p><p>Regarding engagement, too little is an indicator of not really participating. Two reasons may count for this: (1) the intervention might not be matched to the participant&#x02019;s need or (2) the participant did not have the resources for adequately participating because of other distractors. This was found in a meta-analysis by Rooke et al<sup><xref rid="bibr44-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> when analyzing computer-delivered interventions for alcohol and tobacco use. When individuals participated at home, the effects were smaller (<italic>d</italic> = 0.20) than if they participated in a research setting (in the laboratory with <italic>d</italic> = 0.25).</p><p>Too high engagement might also be associated with too high expectations, which then might turn into disappointment and lead to ineffective planning, for example, when participants are overly optimistic and do not feel a need for careful and deliberate planning. However, this should be investigated further in future research.</p><sec id="section24-1559325816637515"><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, only one possible aspect of self-regulation was focused on: planning as mediator between the intervention and its effect on behavior change. Research suggests, however, that other social cognitive variables, such as self-efficacy and social support, are also useful determinants of behavior change.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1559325816637515" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This is in line with our finding that only 5% of the variance in changes in fruit and vegetable consumption were explained. Subsequently, models accounting for additional predictors may be favored in future research.</p><p>Although recruitment was broad so as to obtain a representative sample, study participants were predominantly highly educated women. In addition, the time frame that individuals chose for attaining their goal (and inevitably, the time of their follow-up dates) might be confounded with the difficulty of their goal. Since only those participants who had already completed all 3 assessments were included in the study, this may have resulted in a sample that is skewed toward lower or easier goals. Although no significant differences regarding dropout within the 3 groups revealed, the results of this study should be generalized with caution, and replication should be attempted in a more representative sample. However, studying a mechanism within an intervention program does not require a nationally representative sample because a generalization to all Germans, for example, is not an aim of the study.</p><p>Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed with a self-report measure because the online format of the study did not allow for more objective measures. Unintentional or intentional misreporting (for example, due to social desirability) might have occurred. Therefore, in the analyses, we only investigated mechanisms and misreporting at the different measurement points might have leveled out. However, the recall of the behavior is just an approximation with some subjective deviations from the actual behavior. This has to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. In future studies, a validation procedure would be desired, for instance, by assessing objective measures additionally and computing the validity of the subjective data.</p><p>Although we used a computer-based approach, we were not able to measure additional objective data on engagement (such as login times) because the ethical agreements constrained us from saving such data. However, such an approach should be considered in the future because this would provide multiple further options.</p><p>In terms of the engagement construct, our focus was limited to the user experience, and we did not identify objective design characteristics (eg, gamification) or behavior change techniques (eg, process motivators) that generate engagement. Thus, not the determinants of online engagement but only their effect was at stake here.</p><p>When testing the psychological mechanisms, analyzing difference scores was the method of choice in this study, as we were interested in predicting change rather than discrete follow-up scores. Our assumption was that the intervention would generate changes in planning and that those changes in planning would subsequently lead to changes in dietary behaviors. Alternative procedures such as baseline-controlled follow-up scores or residualized change scores are also possible. Future studies should validate the present findings with more reliable measures such as objective assessments (instead of subjective reports), latent change scores and with other health behaviors such as physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="section25-1559325816637515"><title>Outlook</title><p>This study shows that the intervention effects were successfully translated via planning when moderate intervention engagement was present. The findings thereby demonstrate that the dose&#x02013;response of the intervention is dependent on the right dose of engagement: That means too little and too high engagement was not effective in improving action planning and coping planning to actually facilitating behavior change. Questions concerning the nature of intervention engagement should be addressed in the future: For example &#x0201c;What predicts engagement?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;How can we manipulate engagement to optimize intervention effects?&#x0201d; should be explored further. This requires an examination of the treatment design characteristics and the behavior change techniques that facilitate a motivating user experience. In future studies, the findings need to be replicated in other samples and settings, with longer follow-ups, analytical techniques and with other behaviors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Benjamin Sch&#x000fc;z, Paul Gellert, and Anna Ernsting for their valuable comments, as well as Amanda Whittal and Kureva Pritchard Matuku for their support in editing the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-1559325816637515"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-1559325816637515"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work, which lead to this article, was partially funded by a research grant from the German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministeriums f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, within the framework &#x0201c;Engagement-Learning-Competence Development: Innovation for a Modern Working World&#x0201d; [&#x0201c;Arbeiten-Lernen-Kompetenzen entwickeln.
