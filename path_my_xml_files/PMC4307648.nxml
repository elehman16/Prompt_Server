In a two-period food-interaction study, 12 subjects received HC-ER 20 mg after an overnight fast and a high-fat meal. In a three-period alcohol-interaction study, 30 naltrexone-blocked subjects received HC-ER 50 mg with a 0%, 20%, or 40% alcohol/orange juice solution after an overnight fast. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and its metabolites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposure to hydrocodone after HC-ER 20 mg was similar in the fed and fasted states, as assessed by area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time of dosing to time of last detectable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>; 316.14 versus 311.94 ng &#x000b7; h/mL); relative bioavailability (F<sub>rel</sub>) was 101.74%. Differences (fed versus fasted) in hydrocodone mean maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>; 28.86 versus 22.74 ng/mL) and median time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>; 6 versus 8 hours) were not clinically significant. Administration of 20% alcohol with HC-ER 50 mg did not increase systemic exposure relative to 0% alcohol (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> 878 versus 832 ng &#x000b7; h/mL; F<sub>rel</sub> 105%) or result in clinically meaningful changes in C<sub>max</sub> (51.8 versus 46.3 ng/mL) or t<sub>max</sub> (5.44 versus 6.16 hours). Administration with 40% alcohol increased AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> (1,008 ng &#x000b7; h/mL versus 832 ng &#x000b7; h/mL; F<sub>rel</sub> 120%) and C<sub>max</sub> (109 versus 46.3 ng/mL), and shortened t<sub>max</sub> (2.43 versus 6.16 hours). Adverse events occurred in 10.0%, 24.1%, and 66.7% of subjects after 0%, 20%, and 40% alcohol, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HC-ER can be administered without regard to meals. While there was no evidence of &#x0201c;dose-dumping&#x0201d; (an unintended, rapid release in a short time period of all or most of the hydrocodone from HC-ER), even with 40% alcohol, as with all opioids, alcohol should not be ingested while using HC-ER.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>food interaction</kwd><kwd>alcohol interaction</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>norhydrocodone</kwd><kwd>hydromorphone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pain is a public health problem in the USA, where it affects approximately 100 million adults.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In terms of medical treatment and lost productivity, chronic pain is conservatively estimated to cost the nation between $560 and $635 billion annually (more than that for cardiovascular disease [$309 billion] and cancer [$243 billion] combined), a total representing approximately $2,000 per year for every living person in the USA.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite shortcomings in data contributing to estimates of its prevalence, chronic pain<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> appears to be rising as the USA population ages, grows more obese, incurs and endures injuries and diseases, and re-enters the health care system through health care reform or because of new advances in pain management.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Hydrocodone (HC) has been used for decades in combination products, most commonly with acetaminophen (APAP).

Subjects received the alternative treatments during the second and third treatment periods, with subjects assigned to treatment sequence according to a randomization code. Treatment periods were separated by 4&#x02013;5 days; all treatments were given after an overnight fast. To protect these opioid-na&#x000ef;ve subjects from potential opioid-related adverse events, a 50 mg dose of naltrexone (purchased commercially) was administered approximately 12 hours (with a light snack) and 2 hours (fasted) prior to HC-ER administration and 10 hours (with a light snack) after HC-ER administration in each treatment period. Subjects were confined to the clinical research facility starting on the day before dosing and during the 48-hour pharmacokinetic sampling period after dosing in each period. Subjects were contacted by phone on day 18 of the final study period for follow-up and adverse event recording.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Men and women in good health were eligible for both studies.

Following solid-phase extraction of HC, hydromorphone, and internal deuterated standards, samples were reconstituted in trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, and loaded onto a liquid chromatography system equipped with a Sciex mass spectrometer. HC and hydromorphone were determined by multiple reaction monitoring transitions m/z 300&#x02192;199 and m/z 286&#x02192;185, respectively. Deuterated HC and hydromorphone were determined by multiple reaction monitoring transitions m/z 303&#x02192;199 and m/z 289&#x02192;185, respectively. The LC-MS/MS was performed using a PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The quantifiable range was 2.0&#x02013;160 ng/mL for HC (precision 2.15%&#x02013;4.45%) and 0.25&#x02013;50 ng/mL for hydromorphone (precision 2.84%&#x02013;13.11%).</p><p>In the alcohol-interaction study, blood samples were taken prior to administration of HC-ER and over 48 hours (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.50, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours) following administration in each period.

The most frequent adverse events were headache (3.3% versus 13.8% versus 23.3%), vomiting (3.3% versus 3.4% versus 33.3%), dizziness (0% versus 3.4% versus 20.0%), nausea (0% versus 0% versus 16.7%), and abdominal pain (3.3% versus 3.4% versus 10.0%).</p><p>There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECGs in any subject in either study, and no deaths, serious adverse events, or other significant adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>HC-ER is the first single-entity HC product available and offers an alternative to chronic use of immediate-release HC/APAP products, thereby reducing the risks of APAP-induced liver injury. It is effective when administered twice daily in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Like other ER formulations of drugs, HC-ER is designed to deliver drug over longer periods of time compared with immediate-release formulations, and also like other ER drug formulations, the dose of HC contained in HC-ER (in the range of 10&#x02013;50 mg per capsule) is higher than in corresponding immediate-release HC/APAP formulations (in the range of 5&#x02013;10 mg).<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> If the ER mechanism for any drug fails, releasing all or a substantial portion of the drug rapidly (ie, &#x0201c;dose-dumping&#x0201d;), serious or fatal adverse events could occur. The present studies indicated no evidence of dose-dumping of HC from the HC-ER formulation, even when the highest dose available (50 mg) was coingested with 40% alcohol. Nevertheless, plasma levels of HC were increased by coingestion of HC-ER with 40% alcohol, confirming that, as with all opioids, alcohol should not be ingested while using HC-ER due to the increased risk of central nervous system depression.</p><p>The present studies indicated that HC-ER can be administered without regard to meals. This can be of benefit to patients with chronic pain who, in order to maintain a consistent level of HC, need not take meals into consideration when taking HC-ER. In the food-interaction study, there was no increase in systemic exposure (as assessed by AUC) to HC after administration of 20 mg HC-ER in the presence or absence of food. C<sub>max</sub> was slightly higher under fed conditions. While the mechanism of this increase was not elucidated in the study, a high-fat meal can delay gastric emptying,<xref rid="b15-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the higher C<sub>max</sub> value may be the result of increased absorption of the immediate-release component of ER formulations. Others have also reported that, for a different ER formulation of HC, AUC in the fed and fasted state met bioequivalence criteria but that C<sub>max</sub> was 40%&#x02013;45% higher under fed conditions.<xref rid="b16-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Likewise, food has been shown to increase the C<sub>max</sub> of oxymorphone when administered in ER oxymorphone formulations,<xref rid="b17-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and it is recommended that oxymorphone ER be given either one hour before or 2 hours after eating.<xref rid="b17-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In our food-interaction study, the difference in HC C<sub>max</sub> in the fed state compared with the fasted state was modest, and there was no evidence of dose-dumping after administration of HC-ER in either condition. In addition, the type and frequency of adverse events were similar under both conditions. While the overall incidence of adverse events was high in the food-interaction study (100% under both conditions), the dose of HC-ER employed in the study (20 mg) was twice the recommended starting dose (10 mg) for HC-ER in opioid-na&#x000ef;ve and opioid-nontolerant patients, in whom dose titration is recommended in order to minimize side effects.<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, the subjects in the food-interaction study did not receive an opioid antagonist to block potential adverse events. Overall, given that individualized dosing is recommended for HC-ER,<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the slight increase in C<sub>max</sub> with food is not considered to be clinically important.</p><p>The dose of HC-ER used in the alcohol-interaction study was 50 mg, which was higher than that used in the food-interaction study (20 mg), and is the highest dose of HC-ER available.<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the alcohol-interaction study, administration of 240 mL of 20% alcohol taken immediately with the HC-ER dose did not result in any increase in systemic exposure or evidence of dose-dumping relative to 0% alcohol. This amount of alcohol is approximately equivalent to three &#x0201c;shots&#x0201d; (ie, 1.5 fl oz or 44 mL per shot; 132 mL total) of 80-proof (ie, 40%) vodka, taken on an empty stomach. In contrast, ingestion of 240 mL of 40% alcohol (equivalent to 5&#x02013;6 shots [220&#x02013;264 mL] of 80-proof vodka on an empty stomach) increased the HC C<sub>max</sub> relative to 0% alcohol and to 20% alcohol. The rate of absorption of HC from HC-ER was also increased, as evidenced by the concomitant decrease in t<sub>max</sub>. As with all opioids, alcohol should not be ingested while using HC-ER due to the potential for increased plasma levels of HC and the risk of central nervous system depression.</p><p>The incidence of adverse events was also highest in the alcohol-interaction study after subjects ingested HC-ER with 40% alcohol. Since subjects received naltrexone in the alcohol-interaction study, opioid-related side effects were not anticipated. Instead, vomiting was the most frequent adverse event observed with the combination of HC-ER and 40% alcohol. This may be due to the interaction of naltrexone with alcohol, and has been observed in other studies where the two have been coadministered.<xref rid="b19-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The mechanism behind the increased absorption of HC was not determined in this study but is likely to be due to partial early release of HC from the formulation&#x02019;s sustained release microparticles in the stomach induced by the 40% alcohol. Increased absorption following coingestion with alcohol has been observed with other ER opioid formulations,<xref rid="b17-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b19-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and a comparison of alcohol interaction data for HC-ER and other marketed ER opioid products is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cpaa-7-001">Table 3</xref>. For HC-ER, the overall mean C<sub>max</sub> ratio (2.3-fold increase) and maximum increase (3.9-fold increase) observed in any individual for 40% alcohol versus 0% alcohol treatments<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> were within the range of increases observed for other currently marketed ER opioid products.<xref rid="b17-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While others have reported no substantial differences in mean C<sub>max</sub> with concomitant administration of 40% alcohol and a different ER formulation of HC,<xref rid="b25-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the data to date have been presented only in preliminary form.</p><p>Hydromorphone formed by the metabolism of hydrocodone via cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 has been implicated as a contributor to the analgesic effect of hydrocodone.<xref rid="b26-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This speculation is based in part on the 7-fold to 43-fold higher affinity for the opioid &#x003bc; receptor exhibited by hydromorphone compared with the parent compound.<xref rid="b13-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b27-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, Kaplan et al showed that inhibition of CYP2D6 had no effect on objective and subjective responses to hydrocodone in volunteers who were either poor or extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, leading them to conclude that hepatic metabolism of hydrocodone had no influence on its effect.<xref rid="b28-cpaa-7-001" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Based on the low relative exposure to hydromorphone compared with hydrocodone observed in the present studies, it appears unlikely that hydromorphone would contribute to the analgesic efficacy of HC-ER. Our studies were single-dose studies conducted in populations largely consisting of white subjects and thus extrapolation to other races may be limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the lack of differences in AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and the relatively small differences in C<sub>max</sub>, HC-ER can be administered without regard to meals. There was no evidence of &#x0201c;dose-dumping&#x0201d; (ie, an unintended, rapid release in a short period of time of the entire amount or a significant fraction of HC from HC-ER), even with 40% alcohol. Nevertheless, as with all opioids, alcohol should not be ingested while using HC-ER due to the potential for increased plasma levels of HC and risk of central nervous system depression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Elan Corporation for sponsoring the food-interaction study.
