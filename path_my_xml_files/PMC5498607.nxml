Behavioural interventions alone have shown little efficacy, indicating limited success in modulating neuroplasticity, especially in brains with neural atypicalities. Even in healthy adults, weeks of cognitive training alone led to inconsistent generalisable training gains, or &#x0201c;transfer effects&#x0201d; to non-trained materials. Meanwhile, transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a painless and more direct neuromodulation method was shown to further promote cognitive training and transfer effects in healthy adults without harmful effects. It is unknown whether tRNS on the atypically developing brain might promote greater learning and transfer outcomes than training alone. Here, we show that tRNS over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFCs) improved learning and performance of children with mathematical learning disabilities (MLD) during arithmetic training compared to those who received sham (placebo) tRNS. Training gains correlated positively with improvement on a standardized mathematical diagnostic test, and this effect was strengthened by tRNS. These findings mirror those in healthy adults, and encourage replications using larger cohorts. Overall, this study offers insights into the concept of combining tRNS and cognitive training for improving learning and cognition of children with learning disabilities.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">While 2 to 3 children in every classroom with learning disabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> are predicted to endure negative socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, few behavioural interventions are effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Given the limited success of behavioural interventions in modulating plasticity of the atypically developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, exploration of innovative approaches is timely.</p><p id="Par3">Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a form of transcranial electrical stimulation that involves the application of random noise oscillations above selected brain regions to modulate cortical plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Its application in adults has been considered safe and painless within recommended guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. One of the proposed mechanisms of tRNS is the increase of neuronal excitability via stochastic resonance, whereby weak neural signal detection in the central nervous system is enhanced when &#x02018;noise&#x02019; is added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. While tRNS during cognitive training has shown to improve learning of healthy adults with effects that lasted for months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, its practical implications in the real-world (i.e., training and transfer effects on everyday tasks in non-laboratory settings) remain unexplored. In addition, its potential for remediating neural atypicalities in developing brains, which are associated with a greater degree of neuroplasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but not empirically tested.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we compared the effects of combining tRNS during cognitive training and cognitive training alone on the learning of children with MLD. We targeted MLD, as it is under-researched compared to learning disabilities with similar prevalence and socioeconomic impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We used tRNS, as growing evidence suggests that it promotes steeper learning and training within the numerical domain in healthy adults compared to cognitive training alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, tRNS effects were more pronounced with increased arithmetic difficulty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, a condition akin to the daily struggles of children with MLD. We applied tRNS over children&#x02019;s bilateral dlPFCs (F3 and F4 based on the International 10&#x02013;20 system mapped on a wireless cap, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), shown to be implicated in mathematical learning in neuroimaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and tRNS studies on healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To examine the practical relevance of tRNS effects, we conducted our study in a school specialized for learning disabilities, and used training and transfer tasks that reflect real-world learning. Children were diagnosed by their school as having MLD based on persistent underachievement in mathematical performance given their age, cognitive abilities and educational experiences (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The current cognitive training was on an adaptive number line game. Children moved their body from side-to-side to map the location of a given number on a virtual number line, and registered their responses by raising both of their hands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Our training featured number line mapping, a key predictor of mathematical achievement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which correlates with arithmetic processing even in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Its difficulty levels were automatically adjusted based on children&#x02019;s performance. Children received feedback on their response in each trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). They were pseudo-randomly assigned to receive either &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; or sham tRNS throughout training based on their mathematical performance and WM, which were assessed at school before the start of the experiment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We collected data on children&#x02019;s performance during training, and on cognitive tasks [Mathematical Assessment for Learning and Teaching, (MALT) and working memory (WM)] before and after training. We also recorded their experiences of tRNS using a questionnaire at the end of the study. Based on previous studies on young healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that compared to training alone, tRNS during cognitive training would (1) improve the learning of children with MLD and (2) increase transfer effects to a real-life task.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Transcranial random noise stimulation coupled with cognitive training to improve learning of children with mathematical learning disabilities at school (<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of a child moving from side-to-side to map a number on a number line while receiving transcranial random noise stimulation from a wireless brain stimulator.

Children were selected from the same school, which was the only school that agreed to participate in our research at this stage given the lack of any records on the use and safety of tRNS for paediatric population. Children were diagnosed as having specific MLD by Fairley House School (London), a specialised school for children with specific learning needs. We trained children in the same room to control for any variance attributed to different learning environments. They were pseudo-randomly assigned to sham and active tRNS groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We obtained informed consent from parents/guardians, and children gave their assent to participate in this study. This study received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central-Hampshire B (11/SC/0401). All methods were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cognitive training</title><p id="Par6">Children moved their bodies from side-to-side to map numbers on a virtual number line &#x0feff;presented on an interactive whiteboard. They registered their responses by raising both hands in front of a time-of-flight camera (Kinect<sup>TM</sup>) that detected body movements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Our training integrates bodily movements, as spatial-numerical and embodied learning have been suggested to promote better training effects in children than training without embodiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The game was adaptive, and challenged children with a range of difficulty levels depending on their performance. It featured number mapping of a range of difficulty levels (defined by the range of the number line; 0&#x02013;5, 0&#x02013;10, 0&#x02013;50, 0&#x02013;100, 0&#x02013;500, 0&#x02013;1000, and 0&#x02013;1500) and a range of precision levels (7%, 6%, 5% and 4%) within each difficulty level. Three consecutive correct answers promoted the next trial to a more difficult level/precision level, while three consecutive incorrect answers demoted the next trial to an easier level/precision level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This game yielded three main measures: accuracy (precision of number mapping), response times (RT) and the level of each trial attempted. Children were instructed to move their body from side-to-side to locate the position of the number prompted on the center of the screen above the virtual number line, and to raise both their hands to register their answer. They were asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as they could for each trial. As the game included 7 difficulty levels and 4 precision levels, there were 28 levels in total. Children trained on this game for 9 days, 20&#x02009;minutes each at school for 2 days per week, over the course of 5 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)</title><p id="Par7">Children in the active tRNS group received 0.75&#x02009;mA of tRNS (0.1&#x02013;500&#x02009;Hz) to their bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFCs) via two saline-soaked, 25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> circular sponges, attached under designated electrode positions (F3, F4) of a wireless tRNS cap that followed the International 10&#x02013;20 system (Neuroelectrics Inc., Barcelona). The dlPFC was chosen, as the bilateral dlPFCs have been implicated in numerical processing in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and tRNS to the dlPFC during arithmetic training has shown promising results in healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. TRNS was applied for 20&#x02009;minutes per session as in previous tRNS protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and studies on paediatrics using another form of tES, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We ran our study for 5 weeks in total, having considered the practical limitations of collecting data from school; term time, school timetable, and commitment from teachers to accommodate our study requirements (children catching up with lessons after taking part in our training). A light, battery-operated device attached to the back of the child-sized cap delivered electrical current for 20&#x02009;minutes throughout each training session. As there were no prior studies using tRNS in children, we followed the recommendation of applying at least half of that administered to adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; we applied 75% of 1mA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, shown to be well tolerated in adults without adverse effects. This dosage is estimated to equal that of 1 to 1.5&#x02009;mA in adults, based on previous modeling of tDCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This decision was made after considering the parameters that would influence current distribution and density at the site of stimulation such as thinner scalp, less cerebrospinal fluid, and smaller head size of the paediatric population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A similar dosage using tDCS was well tolerated by children, and was not associated with adverse effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Despite stronger results with stimulation on consecutive days shown in a previous study on adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, stimulation was applied during training twice a week, as a cautious approach to prevent and minimise any potential adverse effect of tRNS on paediatric population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, which are unknown at this stage. Children in the control group who did not received tRNS (no stimulation at all) wore the wireless cap to control for any placebo effects associated with wearing the tRNS cap.

MALT is commonly used by schools to monitor the performance of their students. Children were given 45&#x02009;minutes to solve as many mathematical problems as they could, using pencil and paper. MALT was administered before and immediately after the 9 days of training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Working memory</title><p id="Par9">Given the link between mathematical achievement and working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and findings of a previous study using tDCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we assessed children&#x02019;s verbal and visuospatial working memory capacity using digit span and Corsi blocks respectively. We also examined performance on these indices to monitor for any changes associated with training effects, as well as any potential cognitive side effects linked with stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the digit span task, children listened to a series of digits read aloud by the experimenter and were asked to repeat the sequence. The first trial consisted of 2 digits, and the span increased by one digit with every 2 trials. In the Corsi blocks task, children observed the experimenter tapped a sequence on a series of blocks, and were asked to repeat the tapped sequence. Similar to the digit span task, the first sequence consisted of 2 blocks, and the tap sequence increased by one block with every 2 trials. Each task was terminated by 2 consecutive incorrect trials.

This trend resembles that of a previous study on healthy adults that showed active tRNS over bilateral dlPFCs improved arithmetic performance compared to sham tRNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Similar to findings of cognitive training involving healthy children in another cognitive domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, the greater the training outcome, the more children improved in their mathematics performance. Notably, this transfer appear to be modulated by tRNS, consistent with accumulating evidence suggesting that tRNS during training increases the transfer of numerical training gains to related materials amongst healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

Given the link between training gains and standardised diagnostic tool, these findings may offer implications for special education.</p><p id="Par36">Of potential value for future replications, our study offers lessons on the practical difficulties and sample size constrains common to early-stage innovative clinical and translational research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. At the time of our study, the stimulation software was not developed with a double-blinding function. With limited resources, it was not feasible to conduct a double-blind study, as the sole experimenter was required for study design, participant recruitment, selection, and testing with the support of the school&#x02019;s occupational therapist. However, the current data is unlikely to have been biased by the experimenter for three reasons. First, training was computerized and therefore limited the involvement of the experimenter. Second, observed behavioural changes did not occur at the beginning of training but rather, towards the end. Third, the observed improvement was not general; it was specific to maths, and was not observed in working memory performance. Given the novelty of tRNS for paediatric use and hence, the lack of safety records and scientific precedent of its application (especially in a cognitive training context, where tRNS is applied for longer, i.e., more than a single session), the lack of collaborations with other schools prevented the recruitment of a larger sample size at this stage. This contributed to the practical difficulties of power-based sample size planning, common to novel experimental approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that neglecting such practical difficulties in early-stage research may pose barrier to innovation and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As part of our effort to reduce error variance, we controlled for several parameters across groups in our study and conducted recruitment and training in the same school (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Given the exploratory nature of the current study, these preliminary evidence encourage further replications using larger samples with greater power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">Overall, the current study contributes insights into the novel concept of combining tRNS and cognitive training for mitigating developmental disorders. This approach addresses the ethical dilemma of depriving a considerable population of children of potentially improved cognitive abilities, which could have important individual and socioeconomic implications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These experimental data is a first step towards addressing current debates that lacked empirical evidence, while raising open questions that are fundamental to understanding the workings and potential of brain stimulation use on children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Addressing these questions would require systematic replications involving randomised double-blinded controlled studies on larger samples, different educational/cultural systems, physiological data on the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and children with other atypical developmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Cognisant of the growth in public interest and do-it-yourself (DIY) application of brain stimulation for cognitive enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, we emphasize that the current early-stage findings serve as impetus for further scientific investigations, but not support or justification for tRNS application outside the experimental context. While we did not find any evidence that would raise safety concerns, children in our sample were carefully selected and strictly assessed for their eligibility to receive brain stimulation. Randomised-controlled studies with larger sample sizes that are more likely to be achieved by multi-site collaborations, would be more sensitive to detect any side effects attributed to other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The potential and value of tRNS as a tool for understanding and intervening with atypical neurodevelopmental conditions such as learning disabilities warrants further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
