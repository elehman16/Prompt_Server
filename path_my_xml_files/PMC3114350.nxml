In humans, prospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) show that the age at introduction of solid food, such as gluten-containing foods or cereals, affects the development of islet autoimmunity in children who are genetically susceptible to type 1 diabetes.

Random assignment was performed independently using the minimization method and included stratification for HLA genotype, a family member with type 1 diabetes, and the sex of the participating child to achieve balance between both groups.

The study found that 30% of families reported that they did not adhere to the gluten introduction protocol for their randomization group. Nevertheless, late gluten introduction, whether by randomization group or as reported by families, did not increase the risk for tTGCAs and did not affect growth, suggesting that it is relatively safe. Although the study was not powered to examine efficacy other than for major differences between intervention and control groups, the number of islet autoantibody&#x02013;positive children and the number of cases of diabetes in the late-exposure group and the control group were very similar. These data suggest that delaying gluten exposure until the age of 12 months is safe but will not substantially reduce the prevalence of islet autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children.</p><p>Previous observations showed an increased risk of islet autoimmunity when gluten-containing cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) or any cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) were introduced during the first 3 months of life in children with increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. Because Germany and many other countries recommend introducing gluten at 6 months of age, we were unable to design a study to formally compare intervention with 3 months versus later gluten introduction. Hence, our design was to extend the gluten-free exposure to 12 months of age. Recruitment was not problematic, with the majority of eligible families consenting to participate in the intervention. Retention, despite the intensive follow-up of the protocol, also was high (80%). Families were well instructed as to the foods that contain gluten. In addition, study members were in contact with families weekly to discuss issues related to feeding during the study. However, randomization was not blinded, and ~30% of families did not adhere to the protocol for their assigned randomization group. Over half of the lack of compliance was attributed to families opting for a delayed gluten introduction, potentially as a result of the perceived positive effects of intervention over control. Thus, dietary intervention in early infancy appears feasible but will likely be affected by a relatively high rate of noncompliance, unless blinding of diet is possible.</p><p>Safety was a potential issue in the current study because previous reports had suggested a link between delayed gluten introduction and an increase in celiac disease incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, and in contrast to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the DAISY (Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young) study found that delaying gluten introduction to later than age 7 months was associated with an increase in the risk for tTGCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and islet autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Our current study found no increase in tTGCA risk in children of the late-exposure group also when the analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis. Indeed, although not significant, the risk of tTGCAs in children within the late-exposure group was around one-third that of children in the control group. Growth also was unaffected by the intervention. Thus, we conclude that delay of gluten to the diet is safe and we cannot confirm previous findings suggesting that it will increase the risk for celiac disease.</p><p>We found no evidence of a benefit with respect to reducing the risk for islet autoantibodies. Similar to the TRIGR (Trial to Reduce Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in the Genetically at Risk) pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), the BABYDIET study was not powered for efficacy. The power of the study was ~40% to detect a 50% reduction in the probability of islet autoantibodies. Increasing the power to 80% would require at least three times the number of participants, and in view of the difficulty with compliance, it appears justified to have conducted a pilot feasibility study first. Nevertheless, even with the limited power of the study, we do not recommend altering current pediatric guidelines with respect to the introduction of gluten into the diet of children who are genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes.</p></sec>
