Patients from the RCT were permitted to enrol in the OLM study and, if possible, were transitioned into the OLM study at the end of treatment visit of the RCT. Episodes of HE precipitated by gastrointestinal haemorrhage requiring &#x02265;2 units of blood by transfusion, by medication use, by renal failure requiring dialysis or by injury to the central nervous system were not considered previous HE episodes to enable patients to meet eligibility criteria for either study.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Each patient was required to have the support of a caregiver for the entire duration of the study. The caregiver assisted with attending scheduled and unscheduled study visits, monitored any changes in the patient's health or HE status, reminded the patient to take study medication and reminded the patient to complete daily diary entries.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Details on the designs of the RCT and OLM study have been previously published.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Briefly, the RCT was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier, NCT00298038), and patients were randomly assigned to receive either rifaximin (Xifaxan; Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA) 550&#x000a0;mg twice daily or placebo for 6&#x000a0;months. The OLM study was a multicenter study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier, NCT00686920) in which patients received rifaximin 550&#x000a0;mg twice daily for &#x02265;24&#x000a0;months.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Participants in the OLM study were either newly enrolled or continued from the RCT, and included patients who had received placebo during the RCT. Concomitant therapy with lactulose was optional during both studies.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The protocols for the RCT and OLM study were approved by the institutional review boards of each center, and all patients or their legally authorised representatives provided written informed consent.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Clinic visits during the RCT occurred on days 7 and 14 and every 2&#x000a0;weeks thereafter through day 168 (end of treatment period), and patients were monitored by telephone during weeks without clinic visits. Clinic visits during the OLM study occurred at months 1 and 3, and then every 3&#x000a0;months thereafter until the end of treatment, with additional telephone contacts at week 2 and every 6&#x000a0;weeks after month 3. In both protocols, if a subject developed signs or symptoms of HE between clinical visits, the site conducted an unscheduled visit to evaluate the subject. Also, the investigator was required to make every effort to determine when the onset of recurrent HE symptoms first developed, which could have included, for example, a retrospective review of medical records from a treating physician and/or a discussion with the caregiver or patient regarding the symptoms experienced. Efficacy end points analysed included the rate of breakthrough episodes of HE and HE-related hospitalisations. Breakthrough overt HE was defined as an increase in Conn score to &#x02265;2, an increase of 1 grade each for both Conn score and asterixis score for patients who had entered with a Conn score of 0, or an increase in Conn score to &#x02265;3 for patients who had entered the OLM with a Conn score of 2. Safety assessments included monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and concomitant medications. Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters to day 168 (or end of treatment) in the RCT and OLM study were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted for patients who were treated with placebo in the RCT and during the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment for those who crossed over to rifaximin treatment in the OLM study. Demographical and baseline disease characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. Data are mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;s.d. unless otherwise noted. The Cox proportional hazards model was used, with a two-sided test and a significance level of 0.05, to compare the time to breakthrough episode during placebo treatment in the RCT with timing during rifaximin treatment in the OLM study. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methods were used to estimate the percentage of patients maintaining HE remission over time. Person-years of exposure (PYE) for rifaximin was calculated as total exposure in days &#x000f7; 365.25. Rate of AEs was calculated as number of patients with an event &#x000f7; PYE, in which PYE reflected exposure up until the AE occurrence and, therefore, may have differed from the PYE for the entire patient group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>A total of 299 patients were randomised to receive rifaximin (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>140) or placebo (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>159) in the 6-month RCT. Of the 159 patients who received placebo in the RCT, 82 patients were enrolled in the OLM study and crossed over to rifaximin treatment (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). The 82 patients in this crossover group were predominantly male (62.2%) and white (90.2%), with a mean age of 55.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.2&#x000a0;years. At baseline of the RCT phase, 69.5% of patients had experienced two breakthrough HE episodes in the previous 6&#x000a0;months, 22% had experienced three episodes and 8.5% had experienced &#x0003e;3 episodes. The mean time since first diagnosis of HE was 18.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;19.6&#x000a0;months. Comparing baseline disease characteristics during the two treatments, mean MELD scores were similar at baseline in both the RCT and OLM study (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).

Evaluating patients who crossed over from placebo to rifaximin therapy minimised patient heterogeneity during analyses, as each patient acted as his or her own control.</p><p>The current analysis confirmed and expanded upon results from the RCT and OLM study by demonstrating that patients who switched from placebo to rifaximin treatment in the OLM study experienced a significant protective effect against HE recurrence. More than 65% of the patients who experienced an overt HE episode during placebo treatment in the RCT were protected from a recurrent episode during the first 6&#x000a0;months of rifaximin therapy in the OLM study. It is intriguing that the NNT of 3 observed in this analysis is similar to what was reported in the RCT (NNT of 4).<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This is encouraging, because it indicates that the efficacy of rifaximin to prevent HE was maintained and is translatable to conditions outside of a rigorous, randomised and controlled trial. Prospective studies in independent populations during routine clinical practice are, nevertheless, important for confirming these findings. Also noteworthy is that 16% of patients had a recurrence of HE during both placebo and rifaximin treatment. It is not clear from the data why these particular patients were pre-disposed to breakthrough HE episodes, but it shows that patients with HE, despite treatment, may still need continued care to receive prompt medical treatment if HE episodes recur.</p><p>Similarly, there was a trend towards a lower rate of HE-related hospitalisations in these patients during the first 6&#x000a0;months of the OLM study compared with placebo administration during the RCT. While not reaching statistical significance in this analysis, it should be noted that Mullen et&#x000a0;al. reported a marked reduction in the rate of HE-related hospitalisations, relative to historical placebo controls, when investigating long-term (&#x02265;2&#x000a0;year) outcomes in the entire population (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;392) exposed to rifaximin.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>This study design and findings are analogous to a retrospective study that compared incidence of HE-related hospitalisations in patients with HE who were treated with lactulose for &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months followed by rifaximin for &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months, and demonstrated that rifaximin treatment was associated with a lower frequency and shorter duration of hospitalisations.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Consistent with these findings, a case&#x02013;control study in a group of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis demonstrated an independent association between long-term administration (up to 5&#x000a0;years) of rifaximin and a lower risk of developing HE, variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The safety profile and rates of AEs observed in this patient population were similar to what was previously reported for patients in the RCT and long-term OLM study,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and rifaximin appears to be suitable for maintenance therapy in patients with cirrhosis and a history of HE. The favourable safety profile of rifaximin may be attributed to its minimal systemic absorption, gut-targeted local action and low risk for development of bacterial antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The ability of the patients to serve as their own controls to compare rates of HE breakthrough events, HE-related hospitalisations and AEs before and after initiation of rifaximin therapy is a strength of this study. The trend towards reduction in hospitalisations is a critical issue in patients with cirrhosis, given the high costs as well as risk for nosocomial infections.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The <italic>post hoc</italic> nature of the analyses, as well as the open-label and, thus, unblinded administration of rifaximin in the OLM, are study limitations. In addition, the less frequently scheduled contacts with study personnel in the OLM relative to the RCT may have compromised the ability to detect breakthrough HE episodes in the OLM period. It should be emphasised, however, that as a part of the inclusion criteria, caregivers were required to be available and to provide ongoing patient support during the entire duration of the study. Any changes in mental status prompted an unscheduled visit to the study site. Importantly, the majority of breakthrough HE episodes in both treatment periods (59% in the RCT vs. 86% in the OLM, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10 by Fisher's exact test) were diagnosed by retrospective review rather than in-person assessment of the patient. Finally, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curve describing the time to first breakthrough HE episode for rifaximin-treated patients in the OLM was nearly superimposable to that obtained for the rifaximin-treated patients in the original RCT.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Taken together, these findings suggest that the less frequently scheduled visits in the OLM did not contribute appreciably to the present findings.</p><p>In conclusion, findings from this study lend further support to the repeatability and durability of rifaximin treatment effects. This analysis, although limited in certain regards, reinforces the potential benefits of daily rifaximin therapy in maintaining HE remission for patients with cirrhosis and a history of recurrent HE.</p></sec><sec><title>Authorship</title><p><italic>Guarantor of the article</italic>: WP Forbes.</p><p><italic>Author contributions</italic>: JS Bajaj conceptualised the sub-analysis and critically reviewed and edited the manuscript.
