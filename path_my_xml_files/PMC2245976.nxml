Patients were told to follow their daily activities and not using any medications for these 24 hours. Twenty four hour urine of all cases was collected from 8 AM to 8 AM next day, and patients were instructed to collect all of their urines even at night. Twenty four hour urinary sodium and creatinine excretion were measured in all patients. Coronary risk factors, weight, and routine dietary intake of all patients were recorded. <italic>Low salt diet was defined as sodium intake below 3 gr/day, moderate salt intake as sodium intake of 3&#x02013;7 gr/day, and high salt diet as more than 7 gr/day of sodium intake </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Based on this classification and qualitative assessment of weekly diet intake, patients were divided to three classes of low, medium, and high sodium intake. Those who took salty food and bread with salty appetizers (based on sodium content of each food on their labels or instructions) were classified as high sodium users. Patients were selected randomly from outpatient clinic of Shiraz University from among those who referred with mild to moderate hypertension, and were not on any antihypertension medications. Control group were also selected randomly from among healthy subjects referring for annual check ups after matching for age &#x00026; sex. No added salt/DASH diet was completely explained to all cases. After six weeks, weight, 24 hour holter of blood pressure and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion were measured again in both groups under the same conditions.</p><p>This study was approved by vise chancellor for research and ethics committee of Shiraz University of medical sciences and all patients filled the written consent before enrollment.</p><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.

For better comparison urinary sodium excretion was compared as median and range between two groups, pre intervention urinary sodium excretion median was 132 meq/dl (35&#x02013;200) for cases and 216 meq/dl (210&#x02013;274) for control group(p:0.42), and post intervention urinary sodium excretion was 110 meq/dl (50&#x02013;174) for cases and 200 meq/dl (178&#x02013;279) for control group (p:0.01). Thirty five percent of patients reached the urinary sodium excretion level less than 100 meq/dl in 24 hours after 6 weeks of taking the diet (prior to diet 8%, after diet 35%, P:0.0001) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Decrease in systolic pressure at night to more than 15% (night dipping of pressure) was not statistically significantly increased after taking 6 weeks of 'no added salt diet'(P:0.241, SE:2.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite significant effect on systolic and diastolic pressures during the day and at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], 'no added salt diet' could only decrease the urinary sodium excretion of 35% of patients to the pretreatment determined level of less than 100 meq/dl in 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This may be due to high intake of salt in the general population diet. Our culture dictates use of tasty and salty food and bread which could not be eliminated from hypertensive patient's diet and consequently would increase urinary sodium excretion even after 6 weeks of strict attachment to 'no added salt diet'. This could be noticed by high urinary sodium excretion in 24 hour urine of patients before enrollment (mean urinary sodium excretion of 163.2 eqg &#x000b1; 48.99) and this fact that 78% of patients received medium to large amount of dietary sodium intake based on qualitative evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This could be rationally explained the modest effect of 'no added salt diet' in general population, because many sources of salt intake, for example bread, convenience, and fast foods which are rich sources of sodium intake, could not be eliminated from the diet as much as the patients and those who take care of them tried.</p><p>However, despite modest effect on sodium restriction, 'no added salt diet' can effectively decrease both systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the day and at night time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which means even modest decrease in salt intake by simple advice, limit the use of salty foods and do not use salt on table, could significantly decrease pressures both in men and women (mean day systolic pressure decrease of 9.8 mmhg in males and 5.9 mmhg in females which was not statistically significant in male and female population) (P: 0.138, SF: 2.6).</p><p>There is much evidence that a reduction in dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. However, few have looked at the effect of 'no added salt diet' and modest salt intake on total restriction of sodium intake with especial attention to very exact surrogate of urinary sodium excretion. Our study demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake from regular level of 10 &#x02013; 12 g per day to the recommended level of 5 &#x02013; 6 g per day lowers blood pressure by 12.1/6.8 mmHg during the day and 11.1/5.9 mmhg at night. This decrease in systolic and diastolic pressures with salt reduction in 'no added salt diet' would be predicted to reduce stroke by more than one third, ischemic heart disease by one quarter, and heart failure by just over one quarter in hypertensive population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the fall in systolic blood pressure with salt reduction is greater than the fall in diastolic pressure; therefore, there is a fall in pulse pressure. Pulse pressure is a surrogate marker of artery stiffness, which has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. So our study suggests that 'no added salt diet' may improve arterial distensibility, too.</p><p>These results provide strong support for universal salt reduction in all hypertensive individuals irrespective of modest effect of 'no added salt diet'.</p><p>Hypertensive patients whose blood pressures drop at night, so-called night dippers, have less cardiovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our study night dipping rate did not increase after 6 weeks of 'no added salt diet', this suggests that night dipping may be a genetic factor and could not be enhanced by 'no added salt diet' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of diet on night dipping of blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Concerning its ease of application and significant effect, 'no added salt diet 'can be recommended to all patients with hypertension.
