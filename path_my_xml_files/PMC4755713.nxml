<article-title>Efficacy and Safety of Pafuramidine Maleate versus Pentamidine for Treatment of First Stage Sleeping Sickness in a Randomised, Comparator-Controlled, International Phase 3 Clinical Trial</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec id="sec001"><title>Background</title><p>Sleeping sickness (human African <italic>trypanosomiasis</italic> [HAT]) is caused by protozoan parasites and characterized by a chronic progressive course, which may last up to several years before death. We conducted two Phase 2 studies to determine the efficacy and safety of oral pafuramidine in African patients with first stage HAT.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Phase 2a study was an open-label, non-controlled, proof-of-concept study where 32 patients were treated with 100 mg of pafuramidine orally twice a day (BID) for 5 days at two <italic>trypanosomiasis</italic> reference centers (Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC]) between August 2001 and November 2004. The Phase 2b study compared pafuramidine in 41 patients versus standard pentamidine therapy in 40 patients. The Phase 2b study was open-label, parallel-group, controlled, randomized, and conducted at two sites in the DRC between April 2003 and February 2007. The Phase 2b study was then amended to add an open-label sequence (Phase 2b-2), where 30 patients received pafuramidine for 10 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was parasitologic cure at 24 hours (Phase 2a) or 3 months (Phase 2b) after treatment completion. The primary safety outcome was the rate of occurrence of World Health Organization Toxicity Scale Grade 3 or higher adverse events. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings/Conclusion</title><p>Pafuramidine for the treatment of first stage HAT was comparable in efficacy to pentamidine after 10 days of dosing. The cure rates 3 months post-treatment were 79% in the 5-day pafuramidine, 100% in the 7-day pentamidine, and 93% in the 10-day pafuramidine groups. In Phase 2b, the percentage of patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event was notably higher after pentamidine treatment (93%) than pafuramidine treatment for 5 days (25%) and 10 days (57%). These results support continuation of the development program for pafuramidine into Phase 3.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Sleeping sickness (human African <italic>trypanosomiasis</italic> [HAT]) is caused by parasites, and has a chronic progressive course that may last from several months to several years before death occurs. The present studies were done to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral pafuramidine versus intramuscular pentamidine (the standard treatment), in patients with first stage HAT. The results indicated that, several months after treatment, pafuramidine administered for 10 days was as effective as pentamidine administered for 7 days, and it had a better safety profile than pentamidine. With further study, pafuramidine could be a promising alternative for patients with first stage HAT. In addition, the design of the studies can be used a guide for future studies for identification and delivery of treatment to affected individuals in rural Africa.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this trial was provided by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">http://www.gatesfoundation.org/</ext-link>) to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)/Grant No. 38381.

It is caused by the protozoan parasites <italic>Trypanosoma brucei (T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>.<italic>) gambiense</italic> (the West African form of the disease) and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> (the East African form of the disease). <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> is found in 24 countries in west and central Africa and currently accounts for over 98% of reported cases of sleeping sickness [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sleeping sickness due to <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> is characterized by a chronic progressive course, which may last from several months to several years before death occurs. The disease has two defined stages. The first stage is characterized by trypanosomes in the hemolymphatic system, which multiply in subcutaneous tissues, blood, and lymph. First stage symptoms entail bouts of fever, headaches, joint pains and itching. In the first stage, a person can be infected for months or even years without major signs or symptoms of the disease. When more evident symptoms emerge, the patient is often already in an advanced disease stage where the central nervous system is affected (second stage). The second (or neurological) stage begins once parasites penetrate the central nervous system, where their presence initiates deterioration in neurological function, including disruption of sleep/wake patterns that lend the name &#x0201c;sleeping sickness&#x0201d; to this stage of the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>After resurgence of the disease in the 1990s, the number of annual cases has subsequently dropped to less than 10,000 in recent years [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although the global incidence of HAT seems to be declining, several non-governmental organizations have cautioned that HAT still remains a &#x0201c;hidden epidemic&#x0201d; in regions impacted by civil war, such as the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), southern Sudan, and the Central African Republic [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The socioeconomic burden on a household with an individual with HAT is high; between 1.5 and 10 months of household income can be lost, even when the diagnostics and antitrypanosomal drugs are provided free of charge. The extraordinary burden that HAT places on affected households and communities is often not very visible in national or regional health data because of its focal nature, and the disease often falls very heavily on a few locations [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The majority of current HAT research is focused on the second stage of the disease, which requires drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier. The organo-arsenic compound melarsoprol has until very recently been the most widely used drug for treatment of second stage HAT, but because of its toxicity (encephalopathic syndrome, associated with 5&#x02013;10% mortality), it is being progressively replaced by nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The nifurtimox-eflornithine combination was placed on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of essential medicines and has been increasingly used [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, several new molecules have also shown promise for the treatment of second stage HAT. The most developmentally advanced of these compounds is fexinidazole, which has completed a Phase 1 clinical study and is now in Phase II/III evaluation [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].Two diamidine analogues [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and a benzoxaborole compound [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have also exhibited promising activity (short <italic>in vitro</italic> time to kill and no cross-resistance) in animal models of second stage HAT.</p><p>An effective, safe drug for stage 1 HAT that can be easily administered in rural African settings is critically needed. There is no vaccine for <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> HAT and only two drugs are approved for treatment of stage 1 disease: pentamidine (in the field only used for <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic>) and suramin (only for only for <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>rhodesiense</italic>). In expatriate patients, pentamidine is currently the treatment of choice since is it generally well tolerated, whereas suramin can cause undesirable effects in the urinary tract in addition to allergic reactions [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pentamidine is administered by the intramuscular route and has a reported treatment failure rate after a course of five injections of approximately 7% [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite this encouraging efficacy profile, treatment with pentamidine has limitations. It requires injection, which hampers its use in rural treatment facilities.

Pafuramidine is potentially a significant improvement over pentamidine, the drug currently used to treat first stage HAT.

Screening for <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> was done using the card agglutination test for trypanosomes [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All patients were tested for malaria and filaria in thick blood smears and, if indicated, malaria treatment was given before study enrolment; filariasis therapy was administered after study treatment.</p><p>All patients who had palpable lymph nodes underwent puncture at the screening or baseline visit. The aspirate was assessed microscopically for trypanosomes and if the result was negative, a blood sample was examined by hematocrit centrifugation and miniature anion exchange centrifugation technique. Lumbar puncture was performed in all positive cases detected by either method and the disease stage was determined by microscopic examination of CSF for trypanosomes and by WBC counts. Other screening and baseline evaluations included demographic and medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, and physical examination including the Coma Scale. In all studies, baseline ECGs were performed and evaluated by a cardiologist to confirm patient inclusion.</p><p>Clinical supplies of pafuramidine were provided to the sites in bottles (50 gel caps of 100 mg) labelled to indicate study drug, strength, expiration date, protocol number, and other information according to local regulations. Pentamidine was provided locally as pentamidine isethionate for injection in single-dose vials at 200 mg per vial. Study drugs were stored at ambient temperature.</p><p>During the treatment periods in all studies, routine safety assessments included examinations for possible treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examinations, hematology tests (hemoglobin and leukocyte count), and chemistry profile (serum glucose, creatinine, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea, and C reactive protein).</p><p>In the Phase 2a study, patients were administered 100 mg of pafuramidine orally BID (morning and evening) for 5 days. In addition to the safety assessments previously mentioned, prothrombin time was also evaluated. For PK analyses, blood plasma levels were collected just before dosing and at several time points after the last dose. The 6-day post-dose observation period included additional ECGs after the last dose of study drug on Day 6; lymph node puncture and lumbar puncture on Day 7 (24 hours after last treatment, which is the primary endpoint); plasma samples for PK analyses; and a CSF sample for PK analysis on Day 7. Follow-up visits to evaluate treatment outcomes continued for 24 months, with lymph node punctures at Months 3, 6, 12, and 24 and lumbar punctures at Months 12 and 24.</p><p>In the Phase 2b study, patients received either pafuramidine 100 mg administered orally BID for 5 days or pentamidine intramuscular injections (4 mg/kg, once a day [QD]) for 7 days. Patients in both treatment groups stayed in the hospital for 7 days. In addition to the previously mentioned routine safety assessments, female patients in this study underwent pregnancy tests at baseline and end of treatment. A lymph node and lumbar puncture were also done at Day 7 (end of treatment). For patients in the substudy, blood samples for PK analyses were taken after the last dose on Day 6 and 7; ECGs were repeated on Days 1, 3, 7, and 9; and hematology and chemistry tests were repeated at Day 9. Follow-up visits to evaluate treatment outcomes continued for a period of 24 months, with lymph node, lumbar punctures, and a CSF sample at Month 3, 6, 12, and 24.</p><p>As part of Phase 2 amendment 2, patients received 100 mg of pafuramidine BID for 10 days with a total hospitalization time of 14 days. Study procedures in Phase 2b-2 were identical to Phase 2b, except the post-treatment procedures were done at Days 12 and 14. Follow-up visits to evaluate treatment outcomes also continued for a period of 24 months, with lymph node and lumbar punctures and a CSF sample as noted above.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the parasitological cure rate 24 hours after completion of treatment in Phase 2a (Day 7), and 3 months after completion of treatment in both Phase 2b studies. The primary determinants of parasitological cure were the absence of parasites in blood, lymph nodes, and CSF, as well as &#x0003c;5 mm<sup>-3</sup> WBCs in the CSF 24 hours (Phase 2a) or 3 months (Phase 2b) after the last dose of pafuramidine. Parasitological cure/treatment failure was assessed after treatment by searching for the presence of parasites in blood and lymph by hematocrit centrifugation [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and miniature anion exchange centrifugation technique [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>A &#x0201c;relapse&#x0201d; was any recurrence of trypanosomes or surrogate signs during the follow-up period. Relapses included both confirmed and suspected relapses. For a confirmed relapse, trypanosomes were observed in blood, lymph, or CSF at any follow-up examination. For a suspected relapse, the WBC count increased to more than 50 cells mm<sup>-3</sup> or the WBC count was 6 to 49 cells mm<sup>-3</sup> and the patient had clear symptoms attributed to relapse (somnolence, long-lasting headache, and recurrent fever).</p><p>A &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d; was a non-response to the study drug at the end of treatment. For a confirmed treatment failure, trypanosomes were found in blood, lymph, or CSF at post-treatment or any follow-up examination. A suspected treatment failure was reported if there was either 1) at least a fourfold increase in the serum titers of at least two of the applied tests compared to the post-treatment values or the preceding follow-up values, followed by a test repetition 1 month thereafter or 2) at least a fourfold increase in the CSF titers in the two applied tests compared to the post-treatment values or the preceding follow-up values, or an increase of WBC in the CSF above 20 mm<sup>3</sup> followed by a test repetition 1 month thereafter in the absence of another likely diagnosis. Patients with treatment failures were treated (according to the national guidelines) with either pentamidine or melarsoprol. There was no discrimination between treatment failures and reinfections.</p><p>The primary outcome measure for the safety analysis in all studies was the rate of occurrence of WHO Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events. The term &#x0201c;adverse event&#x0201d; could include any of the following events that developed or increased in severity during the course of the study: 1) any signs or symptoms whether thought to be related or unrelated to the condition under study; 2) any clinically significant laboratory abnormality; or 3) any abnormality detected during physical examination. Adverse events were graded by the investigator according to the WHO Toxicity Scale (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = potentially life threatening). Adverse events were assessed at every study visit and were classified according to the terms found in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).</p><p>A serious adverse event was defined as any event that suggested a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. A serious adverse event included any event that: 1) is fatal; 2) is life threatening; 3) is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 4) requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; 5) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 6) is an important medical event, based upon appropriate medical judgment that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes defined as serious.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Changes to outcomes</title><p>In the Phase 2 trial, every resurgence of parasite during the follow up and independent of the timing was considered as treatment failure. Based on consultation with the WHO for an upcoming Phase 3 trial, treatment failures (parasites detected at the 24-hour lumbar puncture performed after treatment) were distinguished from relapses (re-emergence of parasites at any time later during follow up). In the overall analysis both, treatment failures and relapses were considered failures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Sample Size</title><p>For the Phase 2a study, the sample size of 30 evaluable patients was considered to be sufficient to meet the primary objective because this size was comparable to a typical Phase 1 pilot study.</p><p>Based on a non-inferiority approach, calculation of the Phase 2b sample size assumed a 2% relapse rate in the pentamidine control group and a maximally accepted relapse rate of 10% in the pafuramidine treatment group. To achieve a power of 90% to refute the null hypothesis, in the event that the relapse rate of the new drug was equal to that of the standard (also 2%), 147 evaluable patients in each group were planned with a target enrolment of 175 patients in each group. A dropout rate of 15% was expected by the first follow-up examination at 3 months post-treatment.</p><p>The decision to continue the study in Phase 2b-2 with 30 evaluable patients was made based on assumption of a set rate of treatment failures (parasite-positive analyses 24 hours after treatment) and a binomial distribution for the number of relapses, and calculation of the probability to have N or more relapses. It was appropriate to make the nominal significance level smaller than 0.05 in order to keep the overall Type 1 error rate (the probability to incorrectly discard the treatment tested as not effective) at 0.05 [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, with a sample size of 30 and an assumed relapse rate of 1%, occurrence of 2 or more relapses had a 4% probability.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Stopping Guidelines and Interim Analysis</title><p>No interim analysis was planned or conducted. There was no formal stopping rule for the Phase 2a and 2b trials. In case of accumulation of unexpected severe adverse events, the study director and the sponsor's medical director could have decided, after consultation with the advisory board chairperson, the investigator, and the country coordinator of the national HAT programs of Angola (ICCT), whether the trial needed to be stopped. In case of a major protocol violation by the investigator, the sponsor could have stopped the trial.</p><p>For Phase 2b-2, the decision to continue the trial was based on accepting (or assuming) a set rate of refractory cases (ie, a patient was parasite positive 24 hours after treatment) and a binomial distribution for the number of relapses.

All events of headache were considered to be related to trypanosomiasis and its treatment. No other Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were reported.</p><p>There were 2 serious adverse events in the Phase 2b studies. One patient who received pafuramidine for 5 days died 85 days after the last dose of the study drug. He was considered to have probable second stage disease with rapid progression, and death due to encephalopathic syndrome occurred during melarsoprol (rescue) treatment. One patient who received pentamidine was lost to follow-up after the 3-month evaluation and was subsequently reported to have died of causes not likely to be related to trypanosomiasis.</p><p>Overall, pafuramidine was well tolerated in all Phase 2 studies, and the rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between the 5- and 10-day treatment groups. In the Phase 2b study, elevated ALT and AST values were more frequent in patients who received pentamidine 4 mg/kg QD for 7 days (71% and 85%, respectively) than in patients who received either pafuramidine 100 mg BID for 5 days (3% and 10%, respectively) or 10 days (10% and 17%, respectively).</p><p>Despite protocol-directed contraceptive measures, 2 pregnancies occurred during the treatment period, (1 in Phase 2a and 1 in Phase 2b-2). The courses of the pregnancies were normal and there were no abnormalities reported at birth. These children were repeatedly checked in the treatment center until the end of the study and reported to be in overall good health with normal development.</p><p>The ECGs from patients enrolled in these studies are included in a separately published study on cardiac alterations in HAT [<xref rid="pntd.0004362.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results of the analyses suggested that a prolonged QTc interval, repolarization changes, and low voltage were significantly more frequent in first and second stage HAT patients compared with healthy individuals, which did not change during treatment with pafuramidine or pentamidine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>These were the first clinical studies in the field of trypanosomiasis conducted in the centers in Angola and the DRC with local teams that were previously inexperienced in clinical studies. However, they were fully compliant with Good Clinical Practice and regulatory standards.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The results reported here demonstrate the efficacy of 5-day pafuramidine for treatment of <italic>T</italic>.<italic>b gambiense</italic> HAT with a 93% cure rate 24 hours post-treatment. Moreover, the parasitological cure rate 3 months after treatment was comparable in the pentamidine 7-day group (100%) and the 10-day pafuramidine treatment group (93%). The cure rate at 6, 12, and 24 months remained comparable between the pentamidine 7-day group (97%, 94%, and 97%, respectively) and the pafuramidine 10-day group (84%, 84%, and 90%, respectively). No treatment failures were observed directly after treatment in the pafuramidine 10-day group.</p><p>Pafuramidine was well-tolerated in a treatment regimen of 100 mg given orally BID for 10 days, and the toxicity appeared to be less than that observed for pentamidine 4 mg/kg QD given intramuscularly for 7 days. The efficacy (comparable to pentamidine) and safety (better tolerated than pentamidine) results obtained with the extended 10-day dosing regimen of pafuramidine support the continued clinical development of this drug.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Generalizability</title><p>From the perspective of study design, it is noteworthy that the 3-month surrogate endpoint for efficacy used in the Phase 2b study effectively predicted the clinical outcomes determined at the 24-month evaluation. Given that this 3-month endpoint was implemented based on the progression of clinical efficacy observed in the Phase 2a study (with a primary endpoint at 24 hours post-treatment), the overall results represent one form of adaptive design for a series of studies within a clinical development program.</p><p>The conduct of the studies also established an organization and infrastructure that greatly facilitated the implementation of the subsequent Phase 3 study, eg, capacity building, improvement of laboratory infrastructure, investment in and deployment of high quality laboratory equipment, introduction of improved diagnostic methods, and improved experience in Independent Ethics Committee set-up and support.</p><p>As noted, the conduct of these studies required large-scale screening, which was supported by national HAT programs of Angola (ICCT) and DRC (PNLTHA). The success of the screening, in addition to the robust number of individuals who underwent screening, should contribute to improvement of HAT control in Angola and the DRC. The completion of the Phase 2 studies not only established the parameters for the design of a subsequent Phase 3 study, but also provided a model for future studies of HAT in these and similar populations, and a blueprint for the identification and delivery of treatment to affected individuals in rural Africa.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Registration</title><p>Both clinical trials were registered in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (Phase 2a study, NCT00802594; Phase 2b and 2b-2, NCT00803933).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004362.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004362.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by Larry W.
