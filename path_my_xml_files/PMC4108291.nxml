<italic>Background</italic>. Several stimulation parameters can influence the
neurophysiological and behavioral effects of paired associative stimulation (PAS), a
neurostimulation paradigm that repeatedly pairs a peripheral electrical with a central
cortical (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]) stimulus. This also appears to be the
case when PAS is applied to the pharyngeal motor cortex (MI), with some variability in
excitatory responses, questioning its translation into a useful therapy for patients with
brain injury. <italic>Objective</italic>. To investigate whether repeated PAS in both
&#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; could enhance cortical excitability in pharyngeal MI more
robustly. <italic>Methods</italic>. Based on their responses after single PAS, healthy
participants were stratified into 2 groups of &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; and
underwent 2 periods (60 minutes inter-PAS interval) of active and sham PAS in a randomized
order. Neurophysiological measurements with single TMS pulses from pharyngeal motor
representation were collected up to 90 minutes after the second PAS period.
<italic>Results</italic>. Repeated PAS increased cortical excitability up to 95% at 60
minutes following the second PAS in both the &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonresponders.&#x0201d; Moreover,
cortical excitability in the &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; was significantly different after repeated
PAS compared with single and sham application (<italic>P</italic> = .02;
<italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;2.2). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Double dose PAS switched
&#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;responders.&#x0201d; These results are important for PAS application to
dysphagic stroke patients who do not initially respond to a single application.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>swallowing</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>paired associative</kwd><kwd>neurostimulation repetition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1545968312469837"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysphagia is a major complication following acute neurological and more chronic
neurodegenerative disorders,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> resulting in increased risk of death, pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition.
Rehabilitation-based interventions have been proposed, and therapeutic protocols have been
formed with the scope of targeting cortical and subcortical brain areas that are recruited
during the highly coordinated sensorimotor activity of swallowing. These paradigms are based
on knowledge from in vivo animal and human studies with electrophysiological methods,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>Recently, paired associative stimulation (PAS) paradigms have been developed and
investigated on both neurophysiological and behavioral measures of swallowing performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In this paradigm, pairing a peripheral (pharyngeal electrical stimulation, PES) with
a central cortical (TMS) stimulus to the pharyngeal motor cortex (MI) resulted in an
increase of cortical excitability of corticomotor projections to the pharyngeal muscles,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> followed by beneficial behavioral changes. Moreover, following a single application
of PAS to the unaffected hemisphere of chronic stroke patients, cortical excitability was
increased bilaterally. This was accompanied also by significant functional changes in
swallowing physiology and a reduction in the incidence of penetration and/or aspiration of
material into the trachea.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>However, the effective application of PAS to a dysphagic stroke population may be
confounded by several other parameters such as the heterogeneity in responses because of
different lesion loci and volumes as well as genetic factors proposed to be influential in
the responsiveness to neurostimulation.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Other potential reported parameters for differences in responses have been the
inherent intrinsic neuronal activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> time of day for the intervention delivery,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> attentional state,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and cortical thickness in primary sensorimotor cortex.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
</p><p>This variability in responsiveness has been observed in the literature for the limbs of
both in healthy participants<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and in stroke patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the latter patient population study<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> with 9 hemiparetic stroke patients, functional improvements in motor performance were
found, while the group&#x02019;s variability in responses did not allow for significant changes in
neurophysiological measurements. Although this has not been the case for our studies in
dysphagic stroke patients,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> further investigation into other parameters of this neurostimulation paradigm is
imperative, since such knowledge will guide us to address the robustness of PAS for
swallowing rehabilitation. In point of fact, one controlled study in 5 healthy subjects
showed that lithium (a mainstream medication for bipolar disorders) reversed the cortical
excitability of &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; after excitatory PAS into that similar to &#x0201c;responders.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p><p>Therefore, we investigated the variability in the excitatory responses following the
application of the neurorehabilitation paradigm, PAS, in healthy volunteers. Following this
initial study, we investigated whether repetitive dosing of PAS could address the
variability in responses at the neurophysiological level.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1545968312469837"><title>Participants and Methods</title><p>No major illnesses were reported by the 18 healthy participants (4 men; age, 39 &#x000b1; 3 years

30 paired pulses in total. For the sham intervention, the coil was held tangentially to
the skull at a 90&#x000b0; angle to sagittal plane, and no PES was delivered through the catheter

apart and received 10 minutes of PAS (PAS<sub>10min</sub>) or sham (PAS<sub>Sham</sub>) in
a randomized manner using block randomization (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire, UK).
Measurements of cortical excitability for each hemispheric site (10 pulses at rMT + 20%
MSO at stronger pharyngeal, weaker pharyngeal, and thenar representation) were made at
baseline and at each of the postintervention follow-up time points (immediately, 30, 60,
and 90 minutes) on each visit. During these periods, participants were advised to withhold
from any swallowing, coughing, talking, or moving their hands or arms. The lead researcher
performed the recordings and the analysis but was blinded to the interventions, delivered
by a separate researcher who was blinded to the analysis. Participants&#x02019; data were kept
unidentifiable.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1545968312469837"><title>Protocol 2: Effects of Repeated PAS Over Pharyngeal MI in Responders and

minimize interindividual variability. Interindividual factors such as age and sex were
therefore equalized. Changes in excitability over time were compared (excluding baseline)
using a generalized linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA; SPSS

paradigm that enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), then the application of a second
LTP-like PAS intervention resulted in cortical depression. The results from that study fall
within the well-described theory of Bienenstock&#x02013;Cooper&#x02013;Munro,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which tries to elucidate the way that neuronal systems reach homeostasis and balance
inhibitory and facilitatory interactions over a period of time, originally observed in
visual cortical neurons. In contrast, our data have shown that the effect of the first
PAS<sub>10min</sub> application resulting in LTP-like plasticity in pharyngeal motor
cortex was further enhanced after a second facilitatory PAS<sub>10min</sub> application.
This finding requires further consideration.</p><p>There are likely to be a number of explanations for the difference in the results in the
swallowing model. First, the existence of the &#x0201c;ceiling effect,&#x0201d; the extent to which cortical
excitability can be further increased, has not been examined for the swallowing motor
system. Second, the effect of &#x0201c;saturation&#x0201d; of the cortical capacity for synaptic efficacy
and LTP<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> has also not been investigated in detail for swallowing. However, previous PAS
studies showed that 30 minutes of stimulation did not produce significant changes compared
with shorter durations.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The inter-PAS interval is also an important parameter to consider for the modulatory
effects of PAS to MI. In the study by M&#x000fc;ller et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the inter-PAS interval was 30 minutes, shorter than the 60-minute inter-PAS interval
in our protocol. Furthermore, we have previously shown that the effects of single PAS
targeting pharyngeal MI can last up to 90 minutes.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In this context, evidence from the use of transcranial direct current stimulation in
the limb MI has shown that when the repeated application falls within the excitatory window
of the initial input, the after effects are increased.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In addition, the interval between the pairs of peripheral and cortical stimulation is
critically important: Literature by others<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> has suggested that with different intervals between pairs, different mechanisms
contribute to the effects of PAS.</p><p>Moreover, at this stage of research, it is still unclear as to whether the changes in
cortical excitability are because of changes in the efficacy of the synaptic connections or
changes in neuronal excitability. Cortical and subcortical brain areas are activated in an
interconnected network during swallowing. Whether the change in cortical excitability
following the first application of PAS would spread to connected brain regions of the
swallowing network resulting in a further increase after the application of repeat PAS is
uncertain. Further studies with neuroimaging techniques may help determine this and would be
of importance for the applications of neurorehabilitation to the corticobulbar network for
swallowing.</p><p>More recently, it has been shown that PAS effects in limb MI can be remotely influenced by
cerebellar stimulation. Modulation of cerebellar activity using transcranial direct current
stimulation was able to abolish the excitatory effects of PAS in the motor cortex.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These findings suggest that combining neurostimulation inputs is both modality and
region specific, which supports the contention that pharyngeal motor cortex neurostimulation
might behave differently in other regions, when PAS is applied.</p><p>Nonetheless, our study also raises the possibility that delivering initial PAS as a form of
conditioning changed the threshold for synapses to engage in &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; (producing an
&#x0201c;imbalance&#x0201d; in activity), and the repeat PAS has enabled these &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; synapses to be
strengthened more easily. However, in vivo studies to validate this assumption are difficult
to perform, given that the measurement of excitability is not directly equal to synaptic activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Nevertheless, such suggestion could hold considerate value for the rehabilitation of
swallowing disorders, if we take into consideration that LTP induced by targeted PAS, such
as in our study, has similarities with LTP resulting from motor training and learning,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> the latter being important in the case of dysphagia rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>In conclusion, we report evidence that subjects who do not respond to an initial
application of excitatory stimulation (PAS<sub>10min</sub>) can show an increase in MEP
responses after a repeated excitatory PAS<sub>10min</sub>; these effects being larger than
when compared with a single application. This has implication for PAS application to
dysphagic stroke patients who may not respond to single doses of stimulation and provides
the example for other neuromodulatory interventions under investigation for customized
approaches when applied to the swallowing neural network. Future utilization of the repeated
approach in stroke patients with dysphagia and neuroimaging studies seem warranted, since
PAS appears to hold promise as a powerful neurorehabilitation paradigm for dysphagia
rehabilitation after stroke. Double PAS could therefore drive cortical plasticity during the
critical period of plasticity in the weeks following a stroke and may substantially enhance
traditional therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1545968312469837" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
