However, these symptoms can also signal the onset of surgical site infection and alveoli osteitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin and preemptive therapy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the reduction of postinflammatory complications, surgical site infection, and alveolar osteitis following the third molar surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>A total of 135 patients were randomized into three equal groups: Group A (preemptive therapy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) with preoperative dose of 875/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid followed by 500/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 12 hourly for 5 days, Group B (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid prophylaxis) with a single preoperative dose of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg tablets, and Group C (levofloxacin prophylaxis) with a single preoperative dose of levofloxacin 1000 mg tablets. All patients had ostectomy using surgical handpiece and burs and received same analgesics (tabs ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hourly for 3 days).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>No case of surgical site infection or alveoli osteitis was recorded in the study groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups with regard to pain, mouth opening, postoperative facial dimension, and body temperature.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as a single preoperative bolus should be adequate for the prevention of postoperative wound infection and alveoli osteitis following the third molar extraction as there is no need for an extension of the antibiotic. Moreover, levofloxacin can be utilized as prophylaxis in patients undergoing mandibular third molar extraction if such patients are allergic to penicillins.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>K<sc>EYWORDS</sc></title><kwd>Antibiotics</kwd><kwd>complications</kwd><kwd>third molar surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Extraction of the impacted third molar is one of the most common minor oral surgical procedures carried out in oral surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is classified as a clean-contaminated surgery with infection rates reported to be between 1.2% and 27%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Pain, swelling, and trismus occur as immediate physiologic sequelae of the third molar surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These clinical features can also signal the onset of alveolar osteitis and surgical site infection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Other complications are permanent nerve damage[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and difficulty in swallowing.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The use of systemic antibiotic following the third molar surgery in healthy individuals for the purpose of preventing postinflammatory complications is still controversial.

The indication for extractions included chronic/recurrent pericoronitis, grossly carious third molars with associated infective pathologies such as pockets, periapical granuloma, and cysts. In our setting, placebo-controlled studies are not permitted due to ethical concerns. However, in a recently published Cochrane review on the use of antibiotics following mandibular third molar extraction, it was concluded that carrying out a placebo-controlled study in diseased gums (pericoronitis, carious lesions, and periapical granulomas/cysts) is unethical and therefore the use of antibiotics in these group of patients is justified.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In sub-Saharan Africa, it is important to note that most of the indications for third molar extractions are chronic infections or infection-related cases that may justify the use of prophylactic antibiotic after the third molar extraction.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>A very crucial point in the debate about prophylactic antibiotics in the third molar surgery for these cases is the timing of antibiotic administration. In the past, three different approaches were compared with either placebo or control groups in several clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The first approach included the administration of antibiotic before surgery, which is maintained postoperatively for several days.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The second approach, otherwise known as preemptive treatment, involved the administration of antibiotics before or immediately after surgery and maintained for several days.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The third option (perioperative) included the administration of antibiotics preoperatively as a single bolus antibiotic therapy. This may serve as the only antibiotic given, or an additional second course may be administered few hours after surgery.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the three options of antibiotic administration were compared, and there was no record of wound infection among the three groups of subjects studied. In other words, there was no difference in infection rate between the patients who received prophylactic single-dose and extended amoxicillin/clavulanic acid after the third molar surgery and between the patients who received single-dose levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. This observation was corroborated by other related studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In a study to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-operative amoxicillin in the prevention of postoperative complications in patients undergoing third molar surgery, Jose <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recorded no infection among the patients who received prophylactic amoxicillin and extended amoxicillin. However, they recorded postoperative wound infection in five patients who received placebo. Similarly, Olusanya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] compared prophylaxis versus preemptive amoxicillin and metronidazole in the prevention of postoperative complications after the third molar surgery in 84 subjects and concluded that single bolus antibiotics prophylaxis should be adequate for most cases of third molar surgery based on the fact that the degree of postoperative wound infection, pain, swelling, and trismus was similar in both groups that were studied.</p><p>Some other studies[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have compared other forms of antibiotics apart from penicillins in the prevention of postoperative complications following the third molar surgery and have recorded similar infection rates as with the use of penicillins. Although, there was no difference in infection rate between group of subjects who received single bolus levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the present study, however, Limeres <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in their study of 100 subjects concluded that moxifloxacin (fluoroquinolones) shortens the period of postoperative recovery in terms of oral function and return to work better than amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination.</p><p>There was no record of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) among subjects in the three groups. These findings are consistent with the results of previous, related studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In a study by Halpern and Dodson,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] &#x0201c;does prophylactic administration of systemic antibiotics prevent postoperative inflammatory complications after third molar surgery&#x0201d; they observed that no subject met the case definition for alveoli osteitis out of the 118 subjects that had their third molars extracted compared with placebo. Alveolar osteitis is considered a healing disturbance related to some risk factors, and in some studies, it has been included as a complication of infection.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Surgical trauma appears to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of alveolar osteitis and subjects aged 18 years or older are more prone.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] However, this complication was not observed in this study. The relatively short operative times in this study could help to explain, at least in part, the absence of such complications, because the dry socket is commonly associated with prolonged trauma to the hard tissues. The mean duration of the procedure in this study was 24.1 &#x000b1; 15.8 in Group A, 19.5 &#x000b1; 12.1 in Group B, while in Group C mean duration of the procedure was 22.0 &#x000b1; 13.2 min [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>It is also important to highlight the low pain levels in this study. Although differences in the mean level of pain were observed among the three groups during the first 7 days, the mean scores did not reach a score 40 on a 100 mm scale in any of the groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. According to the criteria used by Monaco <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] this pain intensity should be considered very mild in the context of postoperative complications. The same applies to temperature as no statistically significant differences were found and the mean value never exceeded 37&#x000b0;C in any of the three groups. The administration of ibuprofen that has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects could explain, at least in part, the temperatures not greater than 37&#x000b0;C compared with that in other studies, in which fever occurred in some of the subjects.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>No subject presented with extraction socket infection when levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as a single bolus preoperative prophylaxis and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as a single preoperative bolus and extended regimens were used after the third molar surgery with associated pathologies. Moreover, no subject presented with alveoli osteitis when levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as single preoperative bolus was used following the third molar removal with associated pathologies. Therefore, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as a single preoperative bolus should be adequate for the prevention of postoperative wound infection and alveoli osteitis following the third molar extraction as there is no need for extension of the antibiotic also, levofloxacin can be utilized as prophylaxis in patients undergoing mandibular third molar extraction, especially if such patients are allergic to amoxicillin.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
