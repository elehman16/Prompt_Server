The incidence of the disease is increasing and is highest in women from least deprived areas. It is estimated that around 42% of the disease in post-menopausal women could be prevented by increased physical activity and reductions in alcohol intake and body fatness. Breast cancer control endeavours focus on national screening programmes but these do not include communications or interventions for risk reduction.</p><p>This study aimed to assess the feasibility of delivery, indicative effects and acceptability of a lifestyle intervention programme initiated within the NHS Scottish Breast Screening Programme (NHSSBSP).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 1:1 randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the 3&#x000a0;month ActWell programme (focussing on body weight, physical activity and alcohol) versus usual care conducted in two NHSSBSP sites between June 2013 and January 2014. Feasibility assessments included recruitment, retention, and fidelity to protocol. Indicative outcomes were measured at baseline and 3&#x000a0;month follow-up (body weight, waist circumference, eating and alcohol habits and physical activity). At study end, a questionnaire assessed participant satisfaction and qualitative interviews elicited women&#x02019;s, coaches, and radiographers&#x02019; experiences. Statistical analysis used Chi squared tests for comparisons in proportions and paired t tests for comparisons of means. Linear regression analyses were performed, adjusted for baseline values, with group allocation as a fixed effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A pre-set recruitment target of 80 women was achieved within 12&#x000a0;weeks and 65 (81%) participants (29 intervention, 36 control) completed 3&#x000a0;month assessments.

Women meeting the World Cancer Research Fund prevention guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] show a 60% reduction in breast cancer compared to women meeting none [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, observational studies show that breast cancer risk is lowered with intentional weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative intervention demonstrated that a 1% difference in body weight between intervention and control groups was associated with a 9% difference in breast cancer incidence after 8&#x000a0;years, suggesting even modest reductions in weight are beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Data from audits of bariatric surgery show that large weight losses are associated with large reductions in incidence of female cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At any BMI, weight gain in adult life is associated with greater risk of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with recent data suggesting that increases in adiposity between age 25 and post menopausal age are associated with a 33% increase risk in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A gain of 2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;kg after age 50&#x000a0;years is associated with a 30% increase in breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In Scotland, there are few initiatives directed at motivating change in diet and physical activity in women aged over 50&#x000a0;years despite recent data from the Scottish Health Survey (2012) reporting that 70% of women aged 55 to 74&#x000a0;years have a BMI &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, 42% of women do not achieve the recommendation of 150&#x000a0;minutes of physical activity per week. In 2012, 35% of Scottish women exceeded the recommended maximum weekly alcohol drinking levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Around 75% of Scottish women aged 50 to 70&#x000a0;years have accepted invitations to attend the NHS breast screening programme (NHSSBSP) and over 175,000 women are seen annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fisher <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have reported that most women attending screening clinics are interested in receiving lifestyle advice but this finding requires further exploration. The NHSSBSP provides a unique opportunity for delivering an intervention aimed at breast cancer risk reduction which is consistent with the concept of the NHS as a health promoting service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the absence of guidance may produce a &#x02018;health certificate effect&#x02019; meaning patients receiving negative results (e.g. no cancer) may feel there is no need to modify their lifestyle. Failure to advocate lifestyle change in a breast cancer screening setting could endorse poor health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the promotion of lifestyle advice within screening settings has been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This issue may be particularly relevant for body weight, where the lack of guidance to visibly obese patients may signal lack of medical concern.</p><p>This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering a lifestyle intervention initiated within the breast cancer screening setting, in order to inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) for weight management in post-menopausal women and consider the findings for health promotion in this setting. Feasibility and indicative outcomes will be reported in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Feasibility study design</title><p>This was a two-arm, feasibility study for a randomised trial conducted in two NHSSBSP settings. Following baseline measurement and assessment of eligibility, women were randomised to the intervention group (starting ActWell immediately) or the control group (offered lifestyle coaching at study end). We also conducted qualitative interviews with intervention group women, lifestyle coaches and radiographers to elicit their experiences of the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>The study was carried out in NHS Tayside and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Basic screening by mammography can take place either at a static breast screening unit (often hospital based) or on a mobile breast screening unit (mobile van). Approximately 5% of women screened are invited to recall clinics for further investigation because their basic screening mammogram shows some abnormalities or because other signs or symptoms were noted when they attended for basic screening. Breast screening colleagues advised against recruitment in mobile units (small space with little room for additional discussion) and the two other screening settings were explored.</p><p>In routine screening the protocol for recruitment comprised a letter from the clinical director of the local NHSSBSP endorsing the study plus a brief information sheet given to screening participants by clinic reception staff. This was followed by verbal endorsement and an invitation to join the study by radiographers at the end of mammographic screening. Clinic staff passed on contact details of interested women to the research team. The radiographer endorsement was timed to take around 1.5&#x000a0;minutes and was developed in conjunction with NHSSBSP staff.</p><p>Women attending recall clinics were sent a recruitment pack by post after receiving negative results. They received an endorsement letter, a brief information sheet and pre-paid reply slip and were contacted by the researchers on receipt of a positive reply slip.</p><p>Interested women were contacted and telephone-screened by the research team and if eligible [exclusion criteria: BMI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, reported contra-indicators to physical activity (e.g. recent post operation) or reported contra-indication to weight management (e.g. currently following a recovery programme for weight gain)] were sent a full participant information sheet and an invitation to complete baseline measures. Written informed consent was obtained at the baseline visit prior to assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p>This was a feasibility study to test practical aspects (implementation, acceptability and feasibility) of study design and to help inform the calculation of effect sizes required for subsequent definitive RCT. With this in mind, we estimated that 80 women could be recruited, randomised (40 intervention and 40 control) and followed for three months and that this would provide sufficient data on programme implementation acceptability and feasibility to be able to make a decision as to whether moving to a full-scale trial was appropriate. For example, the acceptability of the intervention would be measured with precision of +/&#x02212;12% given n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40. More global outcomes such as overall recruitment would have a precision +/&#x02212; 9% given n&#x02009;=&#x02009;80. Although the study was not formally designed to test hypotheses, with 40 in each group, binary measures such as meeting a target would nevertheless have power of 80% to detect differences of 25% or more.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measures</title><p>Assessments were undertaken on two occasions namely at baseline (prior to intervention allocation) and at follow-up (after the 3&#x000a0;month intervention period).</p><p>At baseline the following data was collected by a researcher (independent of intervention delivery)<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics -age, marital status, ethnicity, educational achievement, employment status, socio-economic status (SIMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), smoking status, reproductive history and family history of breast cancer.

Two measurements were taken post exhalation and the mean recorded.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p>Blood pressure was measured using a Microlife BP 3BTO digital blood pressure monitor after the participant had been seated for 5&#x000a0;minutes. Two readings, or three if noted to be elevated, &#x02265;1&#x000a0;minute apart, were taken and the mean reported.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In addition, a researcher administered questionnaire was used to record the following measures:</p><p>Diet &#x02013; using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education (DINE), a food frequency questionnaire of 19 groups of foods which account for about 70% of the fat and fibre in the typical UK diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Foods are grouped by nutrient content and dietary use and a score proportional to the fat or fibre content of a standard portion size, weighted by frequency of consumption is calculated. A fibre score of less than 30 (&#x02018;low&#x02019;) is equivalent to a fibre intake of 20&#x000a0;g/day or less, whilst over 40 (&#x02018;high&#x02019;) is equivalent to an intake of more than 30&#x000a0;g/day. A fat score of less than 30 is equivalent to a fat intake of 83&#x000a0;g/day or less (&#x0003c;35% of total energy intake for an average woman). An unsaturated fat score of up to 5 considered &#x02018;low&#x02019;&#x02009;, and 10 or more considered &#x02018;high&#x02019;.</p><p>Alcohol &#x02013; using 7&#x000a0;day alcohol recall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Units of alcohol consumed per week and number of alcohol free days per week were calculated.</p><p>Physical activity and sitting time &#x02013; using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Participants were asked to record how many days over the preceding seven days they had performed walking (in bouts of at least 10&#x000a0;minutes), moderate-intensity activities and vigorous-intensity activities and for how long. MET-minutes/week were then calculated according to the standard protocol (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Sitting time was also noted.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Consumable and travel costs had to be checked against budget allocation, approved by the Principal Investigator (ASA) and paid via a single budget code enabling fine tracking of monthly and total costs. Intervention delivery costs were accounted for by Lifestyle coach salaries which were claimed on an hourly basis, checked by ASA in terms of travel time and the delivery time recorded (start and finish time) for each intervention participant.</p><p>Fidelity of the intervention was rated by a research assistant independent to the study using recordings from coaching sessions. To select intervention participants for recording a face to face interview, random numbers were generated from 1&#x02013;40 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/">http://www.random.org/</ext-link>). The same process was repeated to select which participants to record a telephone interview with, and a new random number (1&#x02013;6) was generated to select which of their scheduled phone calls to record.</p><p>A random sample of nine face to face interviews were transcribed and for each component of the intervention, a list of topics to be covered was prepared and fidelity to the intervention protocol was scored using a pre-prepared marking grid, e.g. introduction (10 items), weight management (10 items), physical activity (20 items) and diet (17 items). A similar procedure was used to rate the fidelity of the follow-up telephone calls.</p><p>To investigate participant acceptability, we asked 1 in 4 women who agreed to being contacted again to take part in semi-structured interviews which investigated their experience of the programme, which elements they found most helpful and which unhelpful and how they were able to incorporate changes into their everyday life. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with both lifestyle coaches and 2 paired interviews with 4 radiographers about their experience. In addition, programme acceptability questionnaires (with stamped addressed envelopes) were given to all participants after follow-up visits were completed. The questionnaire comprised ten questions each with a 5 point scale ranging from &#x02018;very unhelpful&#x02019; to &#x02018;very helpful&#x02019;. Intervention participants were also asked to rate the helpfulness of intervention components (13 items).</p><p>Staff acceptability was investigated by semi-structured interviews with lifestyle coaches and radiographers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p>A randomised group allocation list was generated using nQUERY Advisor: 1:1, stratified by site and using mixed block size. Following baseline measures, women were randomly allocated by the study administrator to the intervention or control group.

Intervention participants were scheduled for a one hour lifestyle coaching session (face-to-face) and up to six fortnightly follow up telephone consultations for three months from one of two lifestyle coaches. Coaches were recruited who had a background of counselling and experience of advising on physical activity and dietary change. They were then trained in house by the programme developers over a 4&#x000a0;day period on study background and rationale, principles of weight management, study blinding, motivational interviewing techniques protocol delivery and relevant note taking. They were provided with individual participant folders and a structured programme for delivery including relevant note taking exercises pertinent to individual participant circumstances and specific goal setting challenges. Test coaching sessions were undertaken prior to actual study delivery.</p><p>An intervention information pack and pedometer based walking programme was provided (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The sessions took place in the research institutions (not screening clinics).</p><p>The face to face session was designed to be interactive and included a 10&#x000a0;minute walk and talk session (measured university corridors), self-identification of BMI from standard charts and measurement of one standard unit of alcohol using a wine coloured liquid. Intervention participants were invited to bring a support person to the meeting.</p><p>Women received personalised help to learn the impact of lifestyle behaviours on breast cancer risk and how to make any necessary changes in their lives, set personal goals, tips on how to make changes habitual by talking through their personal routines, and relapse strategies for times of deviation.</p><p>Motivational interviewing techniques explored self-assessed confidence to change and self-perceived benefits. Behavioural techniques, known to be effective in changing physical activity and diet, were used by the lifestyle coaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These focussed on goal setting, action and coping plans and implementation intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The lifestyle coach assisted in goal setting to ensure goals were challenging and achievable. Goals were set for three domains of action (diet, physical activity and weight) through discussion with participants. All goals were developed from current behaviours and modest and practical changes identified according to personal lifestyles.</p><p>The importance of recording and self-monitoring pedometer data, diet and drink logs and weekly body weight was emphasised. These parameters also formed the basis for the intervention phone calls which aimed to be 15&#x000a0;minutes in duration and checked wellbeing, progress on implementation intentions, self-monitoring behaviours and reviewed individual actions. The phone call appointment was scheduled at each meeting with emphasis on recording and reporting, but coaches indicated that flexibility was possible given work and vacation schedules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative data analysis was undertaken using SPSS (Version 21.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics allowed characterisation of the cohort. For indicative outcomes, Chi squared tests were used for comparisons in proportions and paired t tests for comparisons of means. Linear regression analyses were performed, adjusted for baseline values, with group allocation as a fixed effect. In the case of missing values, a Baseline Observation Carried Forward Analysis was undertaken for the primary outcome (weight change).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>The interview data were audio-recorded with participant consent and transcribed <italic>verbatim</italic>. NVivo software (Version 9, QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) was used to assist data coding and organisation. Transcripts were analysed thematically using the Framework Approach, a case and theme based approach that allows themes to be presented in a matrix with cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For participants, the themes coded were based on their experiences of the programme in relation to recruitment, why they took part, and what aspects of the programme they felt worked for them. For coaches and radiographers the themes were based on the extent to which they felt able to deliver the programme as intended.</p><p>The study received ethical approval from the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service REC reference no. 12/ES/0087.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p>In the routine screening clinics 966 recruitment packs were handed out by reception staff over a 7&#x000a0;week period (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Both highlighted the usefulness of the information pack and the benefits of doing face-to-face meetings prior to telephone contact. They also mentioned difficulties arranging the counselling phone calls and the time this took.</p><p>Two paired interviews with radiography staff in Dundee and Glasgow were undertaken. Radiographers highlighted that they did not feel equipped to explain the programme to women and some did not feel it appropriate for them to take on the role of programme endorsement or give assistance with recruitment. The radiographers&#x02019; reported fidelity to their prescribed role was low. They said time was the biggest problem, resulting in staff feeling under pressure and incapable of elaborating on the ActWell programme or answering questions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has demonstrated the feasibility of recruiting and retaining women in a lifestyle intervention trial initiated through the breast screening setting with indications of a favourable effect on body weight and related outcomes at 12&#x000a0;weeks and participant acceptability.</p><p>We acknowledge that the current study is not a fully powered trial but results are encouraging and warrant further investigation in a fully powered trial of longer duration. Our recent fully powered weight loss trial initiated in a colorectal cancer screening setting achieved similar weight loss (2.10&#x000a0;kg (CI &#x02212;2.57&#x000a0;kg &#x02013; 1.63&#x000a0;kg) at 12&#x000a0;weeks, but with further monthly support for 9&#x000a0;months achieved weight loss of 3.50&#x000a0;kg (SD 4.91) at one year, highlighting the importance of offering longer intervention support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is notable that in the current study the women interviewed had a very positive experience of the ActWell programme.</p><p>In addition, it is important to remember that that lifestyle interventions in the screening setting will only reach people who choose to participate in such programmes. In many cases, this means people from areas of low social deprivation and with better access to affordable health care. However, the study participants included those from a wide range of social backgrounds. It is notable that almost half reported a family history of breast cancer and this may be a cue for interest in prevention opportunities.</p><p>One of the strengths of the study is utilising an existing and relevant recruitment setting but it is clear that further work is needed to optimise this opportunity. Within the two screening settings explored it is notable that the best recruitment was attained in routine clinics when women had received the recruitment pack AND the study was endorsed by the radiographer. However, it was clear that the radiographers did not feel comfortable with giving endorsement and asking about women&#x02019;s interest in the programme (demonstrated by qualitative interviews and the finding that only 230 of 966 women were recorded as being asked about the study). It is recognised that there are challenges in discussing interventions which include weight management. Staff may be uneasy about confronting patients with the issue of body size, especially if their training has not included guidance on how to broach the topic or effective intervention techniques, or if staff have personal weight problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of wide engagement and excellent response when radiographers were involved in endorsement and recruitment mean that routes to minimize study burden by radiographers are desirable (and may be aided involving the wider screening team staff). Our recruitment at recall clinics using a mailed approach (due to high anxiety exhibited during the recall clinics visit) was lower than routine clinics although better than that reported by Evans <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] of 12.5% (40/340) for high risk women entering a lifestyle study, and 6.3% entered a randomised study of two weight loss programmes. The reasons for the lower recruitment than the current response are unclear but may relate to the content of the ActWELL programme which clearly embraced positive aspects of physical activity, diet and behavioural support offering a much wider lifestyle approach than highlighting weight loss per se.</p><p>Despite reporting a family history of breast cancer, several commented in the follow up interviews that they had been unaware of the association between excess body weight, physical activity and modest alcohol intake with breast cancer risk. This highlights a gap in women&#x02019;s awareness of breast cancer risk reduction and serves as a reminder of the under developed potential of screening clinics for health promotion opportunities.</p><p>A recent review of critical research gaps and translational priorities for the successful prevention and treatment of breast cancer has highlighted the need for more research on how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. While there may be many "teachable moments" that could be used to assess and initiate changes in physical inactivity, body weight and alcohol by health professionals (to complement public health campaigns), there is little evidence that lifestyle is routinely discussed within breast cancer screening settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (although these have been delivered in the colorectal cancer screening setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). Effective interventions delivered in this setting also offer an important opportunity to contribute to the reduction of the overall burden of lifestyle related diseases. To our knowledge this is the first lifestyle intervention delivered and evaluated within a national breast screening programme.</p><p>In terms of implications for policy and practice our overall study retention was reasonable and outcomes were good at three months but further research is needed to consider how to improve retention and sustain change beyond this time frame. Our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] on lifestyle in a screening setting showed a loss to follow up of 4% at 12&#x000a0;weeks (similar to the control group in the current study), followed by total loss of 7% at 12&#x000a0;months. We believe the self-monitoring and feedback from counsellors through minimal but regular contact (telephone calls) over a 12&#x000a0;month period supported retention. In terms of real life implementation, two year routine breast screening appointments could provide a potential opportunity to help women monitor weight with feedback from within a supportive healthcare setting for sustaining long term behaviour change.</p><p>Why there was higher loss to follow-up in the intervention group of the current study is unclear. We did not have ethical approval to write to women who had dropped out and although we did have approval to telephone them, we were unable to contact them. We do not, therefore, have their reasons for dropping out. It may that some women tried the intervention, found it wasn&#x02019;t for them and then ceased contact with the study, a situation that clearly doesn&#x02019;t affect the control group. This was seen for men in the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) lifestyle change trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] where retention at 12-weeks was 88% in the intervention group and 93% in the control group, with men in the intervention group generally dropping out because they decided the intervention was not for them. The difference in retention between groups in the FFIT study was modest but was 17% in the current study, though the difference didn&#x02019;t reach statistical significance. In a small feasibility study such as the current one, a few extra participants staying in or dropping out can make relatively large difference to the percentages (FFIT involved 747 men; this study 80 women) so we need to be careful in how we interpret the absolute difference in retention between groups. However, for the current study our conclusion must be that differential loss to follow-up is a potential risk for a future trial, that this may be due to the nature of the intervention and that any future trial will need to take steps to avoid loss to follow-up in both groups but especially the intervention group.</p><p>In addition, it is important to consider how a successful intervention might be delivered in the non&#x02013;trial setting given the paucity of NHS staff trained in lifestyle interventions and issues of cost effectiveness. These are similar challenges to those of smoking cessation which have been addressed in many clinical settings by ready access to a NHS smoking cessation counsellor (in addition to offering community group support etc.). This approach also deserves consideration with respect to weight management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is feasible to deliver a minimal contact lifestyle programme for women in conjunction with the NHSSBSP with positive indicative effects on body weight, physical inactivity, alcohol intake and participant acceptably measures.
