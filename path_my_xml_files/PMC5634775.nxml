Joint symptoms of pain, stiffness, and achiness (arthralgia) are commonly reported side effects of AI treatment, affecting an estimated 33%&#x02013;74% of breast cancer patients on AI therapy seen in clinical practice, and rated moderate to severe by as many as 70% of women who report them [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>].

There is a need to identify effective, easy&#x02010;to&#x02010;use, sustainable, and safe alternative or adjunctive approaches to AIAA management, so that they are able to remain on AI therapy while having as pain&#x02010;free a life as possible.</p><p>We investigated whether an evidence&#x02010;based walking program developed by Callahan and colleagues, which is effective in reducing joint symptoms in adults with arthritis (Arthritis Foundation's Walk With Ease [WWE]) [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>], could have similar benefits for women experiencing AIAA. We have reported elsewhere about our adaptation of the WWE program for breast cancer survivors on AI therapy through interviews and pilot testing (WWE&#x02010;Breast Cancer [WWE&#x02010;BC]) [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>].

The specific focus of our study is breast cancer survivors reporting moderate to severe AIAA. Primary outcomes were patient&#x02010;reported and included the following: (a) engagement in walking (minutes per week), (b) joint pain/symptoms, and (c) adherence to AI therapy. Secondary outcomes were as follows: (a) self&#x02010;efficacy to engage in physical activity and manage joint pain/symptoms, (b) psychosocial measures of quality of life, and (c) satisfaction with WWE&#x02010;BC. We also report feasibility (recruitment), tolerability (retention), and safety (adverse events).</p></sec><sec id="onco12206-sec-0006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="onco12206-sec-0007"><title>Participants</title><p>The study sample was identified through a review of the appointment schedule for women being seen in breast cancer clinics at a university&#x02010;affiliated tertiary care hospital. The recruitment period was February 2014 through August 2015. Oncology providers of patients identified as potential study participants were approached to ascertain the patient's appropriateness for the intervention study and current status of AI treatment compliance. To be eligible for the study, patients had to be adherent to their AI prescription for at least 4 weeks, age 21 or older, and not undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment during the study period. Patients approved by their provider were then screened in person by study staff. To identify patients with moderate to severe AIAA, eligibility was limited to patients who scored 3 or higher on a 5&#x02010;point scale inquiring about joint pain, stiffness, or achiness intensity &#x0201c;at its worst&#x0201d; in the past 7 days (PROMIS Pain Intensity&#x02014;Short Form 3a) [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>]. Patients were also asked how many days a week they engaged in physical activity for exercise or pleasure and how many minutes per day they did so. For study eligibility, patients had to be exercising below the guideline&#x02010;recommended level of 150 minutes per week [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>]. Patients who met both pain and physical activity criteria were then invited to review informed consent forms and provide written consent to participate in the study. The intervention study protocol was approved by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Protocol Review Committee and the UNC Institutional Review Board.

Participants received a copy of the Arthritis Foundation's Walk With Ease workbook [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>] with strategies for starting and sustaining a daily walking program.

There was no contact with study participants during the 6&#x02010;week intervention period. The WLC group was asked to await further contact from the research team at 6 weeks after study enrollment/baseline, at which time they received the same materials and instructions as the Intervention group and were encouraged to walk 150 minutes per week.</p></sec><sec id="onco12206-sec-0009"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>At baseline, consented patients received a printed questionnaire with a self&#x02010;addressed stamped return envelope and were asked to mail in the completed questionnaire within 1 week of recruitment. Up to three email and telephone follow&#x02010;ups were conducted weekly to encourage baseline retention in the study through the completion of the baseline questionnaire. At 6 weeks from baseline, the Intervention group was mailed a 6&#x02010;week questionnaire with a self&#x02010;addressed stamped envelope for returning the questionnaire. The questionnaire included &#x0201c;Program Satisfaction&#x0201d; questions and a request to include their walking diary in the return envelope. At this 6&#x02010;week time point, WLC participants were also mailed the 6&#x02010;week questionnaire, but without the satisfaction questions. At that time, the WLC participants were provided instructions and materials and encouraged to start the walking program. Six weeks later, the WLC group received a second 6&#x02010;week questionnaire that included the satisfaction questions and a request to return the walking diary in the self&#x02010;addressed stamped envelope provided by the study team.

During recruitment, three participants who were randomized to receive the intervention were inadvertently assigned to the WLC group instead, and three others who were randomized to the WLC group were inadvertently assigned to receive the intervention. One of the mis&#x02010;randomized WLC participants did not complete the 6&#x02010;week follow&#x02010;up questionnaire, leaving 5 mis&#x02010;randomized study participants. The mis&#x02010;randomizations were unintentional and were found to be non&#x02010;differential when comparing baseline demographic characteristics with those who were correctly randomized. Further, the mis&#x02010;randomized participants still received a protocol&#x02010;defined regimen (the walking intervention). We therefore decided to go forward with the ITT analyses, with all participants analyzed according to the group to which they were assigned regardless of the inadvertent randomization errors.</p><p>Baseline descriptive statistics were computed for participant demographic characteristics, joint symptom, psychosocial and efficacy measures, and other items inquiring about breast cancer diagnosis and treatments, AI adherence, self&#x02010;reported health, and physical activity using means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. Independent chi&#x02010;square tests and Student's <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare categorical and continuous participant characteristics, respectively.</p><p>For longitudinal analyses, least squares mean estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals at baseline and 6&#x02010;week follow&#x02010;up for the Intervention and WLC groups separately. Differences in mean psychosocial responses from the baseline to the 6&#x02010;weeks follow&#x02010;up were then compared between two groups. Adjusted means were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, postintervention follow&#x02010;up (6 weeks), and at the end of the study (6&#x02010;months follow&#x02010;up) for the total sample and the differences between the end of intervention (6 weeks for Intervention group and 12 weeks for WLC group) and 6&#x02010;months follow&#x02010;up in both groups. Covariates included age, race, education, body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and breast cancer stage. We used mixed models to account for any autocorrelation within individual study participants.</p><p>As estimates for a future power calculation for larger sample randomized controlled trials, we calculated effect size expressed as Cohen's <italic>d</italic> [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>] as the difference between the mean change scores from baseline to 6 weeks for the Intervention and WLC groups divided by the pooled baseline SD with adjustment for small sample size [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>]. To interpret effect sizes, we used Cohen's &#x0201c;rules of thumb&#x0201d;: small&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20, medium&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50, and large&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80 [21].</p><p>As a proof of concept study, statistical significance was not our highest priority.

Study participants significantly increased their walking minutes per week during the 6&#x02010;week walking period, and walking was associated with significant improvements in WOMAC Stiffness, Difficulty with Activities of Daily Living/Function scales, WOMAC Total score, and perceived helplessness in managing their joint symptoms (RAI). When the 10 study participants with stage IV breast cancer were excluded from the analysis, the FACT&#x02010;G measures showed even greater improvement for Intervention compared with WLC postintervention.</p><p>These findings are promising and warrant further exploration in a large&#x02010;sample trial. Our findings corroborate those reported in an earlier pilot study of WWE&#x02010;BC that assessed the feasibility of the home&#x02010;based walking program in breast cancer survivors age 65 and older, which suggested intervention benefits for reducing joint stiffness [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>]. At 6&#x02010;months follow&#x02010;up, the minutes/week that participants walked declined to preintervention levels and a return to baseline values was seen for most psychosocial and efficacy measures. However, it is notable that WOMAC Stiffness, Difficulty/Function, and Total scores remained at the improved levels seen immediately postintervention.</p><p>Our findings join a small but growing number of studies evaluating the potential benefits of physical activity in managing AIAA. Of these studies, the largest to date, by Irwin and colleagues, was a randomized controlled trial in breast cancer survivors reporting less than 90 minutes a week of aerobic exercise, no strength training, and scoring &#x02265;3 for worst joint pain (scale 0&#x02013;10) [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>]. Participants in that study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;121) were randomized to usual care or an exercise intervention that included twice&#x02010;weekly supervised resistance training and home&#x02010;based aerobic exercise, with increasing intensity over time. At end of intervention (12 months), the intervention group reported at 29% decrease in &#x0201c;worst&#x0201d; joint pain scores, while the usual care group reported a 3% increase (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). Similarly, pain severity and pain interference scores declined significantly in the intervention compared with usual care group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001). The authors did not find a dose&#x02010;response effect of exercise; more exercise was not associated with greater improvement in joint symptoms. Other small scale studies of exercise to reduce AIAA have explored aquatic exercise [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>], Nordic walking [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>], and an 8&#x02010;week home&#x02010;based aerobic and resistance exercise program [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>], and all have reported promising benefits. Recent meta&#x02010;analyses of AIAA management interventions rated the overall evidence regarding exercise to reduce AIAA as moderate and that further studies are needed [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>].</p><p>A strength of our study is that, similar to the Irwin study [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>], [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>], it is focused specifically on women experiencing moderate to severe AIAA. This subset of breast cancer survivors is in greatest need of effective ways to manage their joint symptoms, because they are at risk of suboptimal adherence and discontinuation and poor quality of life. A further strength is that we used a simple, scalable intervention that is evidence&#x02010;based in reducing arthritis and joint symptoms [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>] and offers web&#x02010;based support for adults wanting to pursue a more active lifestyle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/tools-resources/walk-with-ease">http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/tools-resources/walk-with-ease</ext-link>/) [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>]. Our findings suggest that almost any level of increased physical activity may reduce AIAA and that home&#x02010;based physical activity can be done at a time, place, and pace to accommodate the wide variety of lifestyles of breast cancer survivors. And, while our study was focused on women with moderate to severe joint symptoms, survivors experiencing milder AIAA symptoms may experience similar benefits.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. We have noted earlier that there was some unintentional mis&#x02010;randomization; however, sensitivity analysis did not change the overall results of our study. The findings were the same regardless of whether the analysis was according to original random assignment or mis&#x02010;randomization. Our final sample is over&#x02010;represented with women with more than a high school education; however, the proportion of nonwhite women (28% Intervention and 23% WLC) is representative of the racial mix of the state where the study was conducted. Recruitment was challenging in light of the dual requirements for moderate to severe joint symptoms and below guideline recommended levels of physical activity. As we screened survivors for study eligibility, many women reported high levels of exercise despite substantial joint pain. We did not collect information on the type or intensity of exercise that these women engaged in, only the number of minutes per week. As in all behavioral intervention studies, there is always the self&#x02010;selection bias of women who are willing and able to participate in this type of study, which affects generalizability to the general population of female breast cancer survivors.</p><p>A second limitation was the shortness of our intervention period&#x02014;6 weeks, as tested in the original WWE study [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>]; a longer intervention period may have produced stronger and more lasting benefits for reducing joint symptoms and deserves further investigation in a large sample trial. A future study might also include intermittent contact with study participants to encourage their engagement in walking, such as contacts via telephone, text messages, or email. Further, although we screened for new or recently&#x02010;intensified joint symptoms, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the joint symptom improvements were at least partially for arthritis pain and stiffness, which are common in postmenopausal women.</p></sec><sec id="onco12206-sec-0019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Further studies are warranted; however, the combined evidence of diverse studies cited above suggests that physical activity can be offered to women on AI therapy as a safe alternative or adjunct to medications for the management of AIAA. Guidelines in general recommend 150 minutes a week for adults diagnosed with cancer [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>], and this level of physical activity could be an appropriate target for breast cancer survivors seeking to manage their AIAA. Our interviews with breast cancer survivors suggest that the message of exercise for the management of AIAA would be well&#x02010;received at the time AI therapy is initiated, rather than waiting until joint symptoms have started or intensified [<xref rid="onco12206-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>]. The breast cancer diagnosis can present a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; where patient&#x02010;oncology provider conversations about physical activity can focus on physical well&#x02010;being and mental health as well as the potential for symptom self&#x02010;management.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="onco12206-sec-0020"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We greatly appreciate and thank the oncology providers and breast cancer survivors for their participation and support for this study.
