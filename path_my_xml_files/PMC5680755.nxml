The P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker ticagrelor (TIC) has greater antiplatelet effect than the previously used members of this class, such as clopidogrel. In healthy volunteers, TIC is sufficient to cause strong platelet inhibition, with little additional effect from ASP. Omission of ASP may improve the safety of antiplatelet regimes by reducing bleeding. However, the effect of single antiplatelet treatment with TIC, compared to DAPT with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP, has not been studied in detail in patients with coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">To compare TIC with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP, we have initiated a single centre, open-label randomised controlled trial (TEMPLATE study) in adults receiving DAPT following PCI with a sample size of 110 patients. Patients are invited to join the study when, as part of standard care, they are due to switch from DAPT (ASP&#x02009;+&#x02009;any P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker) to single antiplatelet treatment with ASP alone after 6&#x02013;12 months. Patients are randomised to receive either TIC or TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP for 4&#x000a0;weeks. All patients then revert to standard care with ASP alone. Blood samples and clinical data are collected at three study visits: at baseline during treatment with ASP&#x02009;+&#x02009;any P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker (visit 1); approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks after visit 1 during treatment with either TIC or TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP (visit 2); and approximately 8&#x000a0;weeks after visit 1 when treatment has reverted to ASP alone (visit 3). The primary outcome is the extent of platelet inhibition, measured by light transmission aggregation, flow cytometry, flow chamber and plasma biomarker tests. The primary analysis will compare the extent of platelet inhibition between the TIC and TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP groups at visit 2, adjusted for baseline platelet reactivity. Secondary analyses will compare the extent of platelet inhibition at visit 2 with that at visit 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This is the first study to compare in detail the extent of platelet inhibition in patients who are receiving TIC compared with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP.

The rationale for this treatment is that most adverse cardiac events that occur in these settings result from the formation of abnormal platelet aggregates causing coronary artery or stent thrombosis. Inhibition of platelets by simultaneously targeting both the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> pathway (with ASP) and the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor pathway (with a P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker) results in strong platelet inhibition and helps prevent aggregate formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The intensity of antiplatelet treatment is typically reduced at 6&#x02013;12 months following ACS or PCI by switching patients from DAPT to single-agent treatment with ASP alone. This ensures strong platelet inhibition in the highest risk period after ACS or PCI and minimises the long-term bleeding risk associated with DAPT.</p><p id="Par29">When used in combination with ASP, clopidogrel (CLOP; the first widely used P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker) reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiac events compared to single antiplatelet treatment with ASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, approximately 30% of individuals display incomplete inhibition of the platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor pathway with CLOP, resulting in reduced efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These limitations have been circumvented by the development of strong P2Y<sub>12</sub> blockers such as ticagrelor (TIC), which give greater and more consistent inhibition of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor pathway compared with CLOP. Accordingly, TIC in combination with ASP is associated with fewer major adverse cardiac events than CLOP in combination with ASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">More recent observations made in experimental models of platelet inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and in observational studies of healthy volunteers receiving antiplatelet treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggest that strong P2Y<sub>12</sub> blockers such as TIC used alone result in a consistent and full platelet inhibition, and that little further platelet inhibition is achieved by the addition of ASP. In response to these findings, it has been proposed that medication with strong P2Y<sub>12</sub> blockers without additional ASP may be sufficient to achieve full therapeutic antiplatelet effect in clinical settings in which DAPT is currently standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Avoidance of ASP may also confer safety benefits because ASP is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding due to its local effect on gastric mucosa, unrelated to the antiplatelet effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Single antiplatelet treatment with TIC is currently being evaluated in the GLOBAL LEADERS study, which is a large, international, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of TIC versus TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP following PCI and coronary stent insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the main endpoints of this trial are all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction and bleeding. The GLOBAL LEADERS study does not include a detailed laboratory evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effect of the two different treatment regimes on platelet inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par32">The main aim of the TEMPLATE study is to determine the extent of platelet inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease achieved with single antiplatelet treatment with TIC compared with DAPT with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP.

Clinicians, research nurses, trial coordinators, pharmacists and patients will be aware of the allocation. As the trial is open label, no code-breaking procedure is required. Since the costs associated with production of a placebo medication were prohibitively high, we adopted a pragmatic open-label design in which the study patients, their clinicians, research nurse and trials coordinator will not be blinded to treatment allocation. We do not anticipate this to have a significant impact on trial results.

We estimate that approximately 1200 (80%) will complete the prescribed duration of treatment of 6&#x02013;12 months. Based on previous observational studies at the BHI, we conservatively estimate that the overall recruitment and completion rate will be approximately 10% of eligible patients. Therefore, we predict that 110 patients will occur in 14&#x02013;16 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par66">The laboratory test results will be expressed as continuous variables. The results for the primary comparison of the maximum amplitude of the LTA response to TRAP 6 between the TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP and TIC groups will be analysed using linear mixed regression. The baseline (visit 1) and post-intervention values (visit 2) will be modelled jointly in preference to the pre-randomisation value being modelled as a covariate to avoid the necessity either to exclude cases with missing pre-intervention measures or to impute missing pre-intervention values. The secondary outcome measures will be compared similarly.</p><p id="Par67">The study will also enable the extent of platelet inhibition to be described within subjects over time as their treatment changes (i.e. from visit 1 to visit 2 to visit 3).</p><p id="Par68">Comparative analyses will be on the basis of intention to treat and mean differences will be quantified with 95% confidence intervals. The width of the individual confidence intervals for the secondary outcomes will be adjusted for the number of tests carried out (Bonferroni correction).</p><p id="Par69">The primary analysis will take place when follow-up and laboratory analyses are complete for all recruited patients. No interim or subgroup analyses are planned other than those outlined above. Safety data will be reviewed regularly by the trial management group who meet at frequent intervals to discuss trial progress. During these meetings the rate of adverse events in the study population will be monitored against the anticipated rate of events that are expected for the target population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Research approval</title><p id="Par70">Research ethics approval and clinical trial authorisation were granted in October 2014 by the South-Central Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (reference 14/SC/1309) and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (EUDRACT No. 2013-002734-20) respectively. The trial is managed by the Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit Bristol (CTEU Bristol) and sponsored by the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/research-innovation/">www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/research-innovation/</ext-link>). Trial governance is through the sponsor&#x02019;s standard operating procedures. The trial is registered as ISRCTN84335288 and conforms to SPIRIT guidelines (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: SPIRIT checklist).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Changes to the protocol since first approved</title><p id="Par71">There have been three substantial amendments made to the protocol since it was first approved. The first amendment was approved in May 2015 and incorporated minor clarifications in addition to the new recommendations from the European Society of Cardiologists. These recommendations led to a change in duration of standard DAPT specified in the protocol, from 12&#x000a0;months to between 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after PCI and insertion of a drug-eluting stent; this change increased the pool of eligible patients.</p><p id="Par72">The second amendment to the protocol was approved in August 2015, removing the plan to establish a Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC). This change was made because, on review of the study design, it became apparent that the study would not benefit from a DMSC. Instead, the safety data are being reviewed closely by the trial management group and the Steering Committee for Cardiovascular Studies, a subgroup of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust Cardiovascular Research Board.</p><p id="Par73">The third amendment was approved in September 2016. This amendment widened the inclusion criteria from receiving ASP&#x02009;+&#x02009;CLOP for 6&#x02013;12 months to receiving ASP&#x02009;+&#x02009;any P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker for 6&#x02013;12 months. This widening of the inclusion criteria was made to enhance study enrolment because shortly after starting the study, the institutional standard care changed from using CLOP as the preferred P2Y<sub>12</sub> blocker, to other P2Y<sub>12</sub> blockers for some patient subgroups. After this amendment, the enrolment rate increased to that predicted in the original study design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par74">The TEMPLATE study design will enable unbiased comparison of the effects of TIC versus TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP on platelet activity in patients with coronary artery disease. It will also enable a longitudinal comparison of the effects TIC and TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP with the effects of ASP alone in the same patients. The laboratory tests selected for this study will enable measurement of functional platelet responses to a panel of activating agonists using LTA, flow cytometry and flow chamber tests, selected to measure the extent of inhibition of the multiple platelet activation pathways. We will also measure the extent of baseline platelet activity by testing unstimulated platelets by flow cytometry and with the soluble platelet activation biomarker tests. Together, these data will provide a comprehensive description of the overall pharmacodynamic effects of the different antiplatelet treatments. This information has not been reported previously in cohorts of patients with coronary artery disease receiving TIC or TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP. To our knowledge, there are no similar previous studies in this patient group that have evaluated the pharmacodynamic effect of monotherapy with other P2Y<sub>12</sub> blockers, including CLOP.</p><p id="Par75">The TEMPLATE study design allows the information to be obtained in a low-risk setting. We are enrolling patients at the point in the standard clinical care pathway when there is a transition from DAPT to single-antiplatelet treatment with ASP, typically at 6 to 12&#x000a0;months after the PCI procedure. This is after the interval of greatest risk of major adverse cardiac events and abnormal bleeding following PCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the duration of exposure to the study treatment (i.e. either TIC or TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP) is only 4&#x000a0;weeks, which will minimise the likelihood of adverse events attributable to the study drugs. The short overall study participation of 8&#x000a0;weeks during which there are only three study visits should facilitate study delivery and minimise patient drop-out.</p><p id="Par76">The main benefit of the TEMPLATE study is that the findings will provide evidence to either support or refute the hypothesis that TIC monotherapy enables platelet inhibition to the same extent as dual therapy with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP. This is significant clinically because abnormal bleeding is a major complication of all antiplatelet therapy, but particularly of ASP which adversely affects gastric mucosa, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. If the findings of the TEMPLATE study indicate no difference in platelet inhibition between the TIC treatment group and the TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP treatment group, then this would support avoidance of ASP in this patient group, potentially conferring a safety advantage. This is also part of the rationale of the large-scale GLOBAL LEADERS randomised controlled trail (NCT01813435) of 16,000 participants in which the study group receive TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP for 1&#x000a0;month after PCI and coronary stent insertion followed by TIC monotherapy for a further 23&#x000a0;months. The control group is DAPT with TIC&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP or CLOP&#x02009;+&#x02009;ASP for 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The outcomes of the GLOBAL LEADERS study are all-cause mortality or non-fatal new Q-wave myocardial infarction (composite primary outcome) and bleeding (secondary outcome), but do not include pharmacodynamic measures of the effect of the different antiplatelet regimes. We anticipate that reporting of TEMPLATE study results in a peer-reviewed publication will precede reporting of the GLOBAL LEADERS study results and that our results will assist interpretation and help inform future treatment guidelines.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Study status</title><p id="Par77">The trial opened to recruitment in December 2015 with the first patient recruited in January 2016.
