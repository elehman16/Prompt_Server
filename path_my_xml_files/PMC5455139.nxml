We utilize an incentivized, two-person &#x0201c;Preemptive Strike Game&#x0201d; (PSG) to explore how the subjective perception of great power interdependence shapes defensive aggression against persons from rival great powers. In Study 1, college students from the United States (<italic>N</italic> = 115), China (<italic>N</italic> = 106), and Japan (<italic>N</italic> = 99) made PSG decisions facing each other. This natural experiment revealed that Chinese and Japanese participants (a) made more preemptive attacks against each other and Americans than against their compatriots, and that (b) greater preexisting perceptions of bilateral competition increased intergroup attack rates. In Study 2, adult Americans (<italic>N</italic> = 127) watched real CNN expert interviews portraying United States&#x02013;China economic interdependence as more positive or negative. This randomized experiment revealed that the more positive portrayal reduced preemptive American strikes against Chinese (but not Japanese), while the more negative portrayal amplified American anger about China&#x02019;s rise, increasing preemptive attacks against Chinese. We also found, however, that preemptive strikes were primarily defensive and not offensive. Interventions to reduce defensive aggression and promote great power peace are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>great power conflict</kwd><kwd>social interdependence</kwd><kwd>preemptive strikes</kwd><kwd>international relations</kwd><kwd>political psychology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x0201c;<italic>The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction &#x02013; and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves&#x02026;</italic>&#x0201d;</p><p><italic>The National Security Strategy of the United States</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">National Security Council, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The specter of great power conflict hovers over the 21st Century. The rise of China as a regional and global power has unsettled other great powers. In East Asia, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has argued that Sino-Japanese relations today parallel Imperial Germany&#x02019;s early 20th Century challenge to Great Britain, which precipitated World War I (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Perlezjan, 2014</xref>). United States President Donald Trump and his foreign and economic policy team (e.g., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Navarro, 2015</xref>) appear to maintain similarly sinister views of China&#x02019;s rise. American scholars, meanwhile, fret that a possible United States&#x02013;China power transition increases the risk of another United States&#x02013;China war (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison, 2015</xref>). For their part, influential Chinese pundits (e.g., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yan, 2015</xref>) trumpet a zero-sum view of great power relations today.</p><p>Spread through the mass media, such pessimistic depictions of great power relations today create a psychological context that undermines international cooperation. Specifically, when people are led to believe that great power relations are inherently competitive, they are more likely to expect people from rival countries to be hostile, and take preemptive action to defend themselves.</p><p>This psychology of preemptive strikes is consequential. There is little reason to believe that elite foreign policy makers are immune to it. Political elites, furthermore, must be responsive to the psychological states of their national publics to maintain the legitimacy of their governments. And elites are not the only people who can kindle conflict. Great power war can be sparked by small-scale conflicts initiated by a local military commander&#x02019;s overreaction to perceived threat. Regrettably, however, there does not appear to be much research examining the psychological drivers of preemptive violence in the context of real-world international affairs. In the current study, we investigate this issue by conducting micro-level behavioral experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Security Dilemma, Preemptive Strikes, and Great Power Conflict</title><p>Great power relations are central to the study of international relations (IR). Regrettably, mainstream IR theories largely dismiss the possibility of great power cooperation. For power transition theorists (e.g., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Organksi and Kugler, 1980</xref>), both Imperial Germany and China today are best understood as &#x0201c;revisionist&#x0201d; rising powers on a warpath. They argue that in a Hobbesian, dog-eat-dog world, great power competition leads inevitably to conflict. For &#x0201c;security dilemma&#x0201d; theorists (e.g., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jervis, 1978</xref>), great power relations are not necessarily zero-sum, but are nonetheless fraught with danger. States may act to defensively &#x0201c;balance&#x0201d; against perceived threats by building their militaries or making alliances. But other states will tend to fear such policies, leading them to take similar &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; measures. This can lead to arms races, spirals of insecurity, and &#x0201c;tragic&#x0201d; wars like World War I that no one wanted.</p><p>Supporting the idea of the security dilemma, recent evolutionary and psychological research strongly suggests that humans are motivated to defend themselves against attack (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rusch, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">De Dreu et al., 2016</xref>). Such defensive aggression can be anticipatory (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yamagishi and Mifune, 2016</xref>). For instance, in our interpersonal relationships, we sometimes strike preemptively to eliminate the risk of being harmed (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Simunovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Halevy, 2017</xref>). For instance, a person may break up with a partner they prefer to stay with purely out of fear that their partner will break up with them first. In such a situation, there are no winners.</p><p>Preemptive strikes are also a defensive tactic in intergroup relations (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>), and specifically IR. &#x0201c;If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long,&#x0201d; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bush (2002)</xref> warned United States Army cadets in 2002. Americans must &#x0201c;be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives.&#x0201d; The Bush Doctrine of preemptive strikes contributed to the United States decision to invade Iraq in 2003 to eliminate the perceived threat of Saddam Hussein&#x02019;s weapons of mass destruction (WMD; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Record, 2003</xref>), which were never proven to have existed. Similarly, defensive preemptive aggression is a likely cause of future United States&#x02013;China, China-Japan, and other great power conflict in the 21st century.</p><p>Will China&#x02019;s rise and/or a security dilemma precipitate great power conflict in the 21st century? With their structural and distal focus, power transition and security dilemma theories in IR tell us little about the micro-level psychological mechanisms of defensive fear that may act as the proximate cause of great power wars. And while experimental psychological research on intergroup aggression is better equipped to make causal arguments about the drivers of individual behavior, it has largely relied upon artificial groups (i.e., minimal groups; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Tajfel, 1970</xref>), seldom examining real-world conflicts. This project seeks to fill this research gap, exploring the psychological drivers of the defensive aggression that can lead to great power war in the 21st Century.</p></sec><sec><title>Perceived Outcome Interdependence and Defensive Preemptive Aggression</title><p>To explore the psychological drivers of preemptive strikes between persons from rival countries, we build on social interdependence theory (e.g., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deutsch, 1985</xref>; for a review, see <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 2003</xref>). It maintains that how people perceive socially interdependent situations shapes their choices to cooperate or compete (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Halevy et al., 2012a</xref>). When people in an interdependent relationship believe that their interests and goals are aligned (positive outcome interdependence), they may have more benign expectations of each other and be more willing to cooperate; when they believe that their interests and goals are discordant (negative outcome interdependence), they may have more malicious expectations about each other and be more inclined to compete. Importantly, great power relations often involve &#x0201c;mixed-motive&#x0201d; situations (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Komorita and Parks, 1995</xref>) where both parties have motivations to both cooperate <italic>and</italic> compete (see also <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Halevy et al., 2006</xref>). War or peace thus critically depends upon how the citizens and leaders of great powers perceive their interdependence.</p><p>Extant behavioral and psychological research on preemptive strikes at the interpersonal level has revealed that greater perceived risk of being attacked <italic>increases</italic> the frequency of preemptive attacks, while the feeling of hope <italic>decreases</italic> strike rates (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Halevy, 2017</xref>). At the intergroup level, preemptive strikes even occur between artificial groups (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>; cf. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mifune et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with the tendency for people to maintain schema-based outgroup mistrust, expecting them to be more competitive, dishonest, and even hostile than individuals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Insko and Schopler, 1998</xref>). We suspect that the subjective perception of intergroup relations plays a critical role in evaluating the likelihood and severity of out-group threat, and subsequent decisions to engage in preemptive defensive aggression. In two studies based on a two-person, incentivized decision task, the Preemptive Strike Game (PSG; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Simunovic et al., 2013</xref>), we explore how perceived great power relations shape defensive preemptive aggression between citizens of those great powers.</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1</title><p>We designed a three-country natural experiment to examine preemptive strikes between American (<italic>N</italic> = 115), Chinese (<italic>N</italic> = 106), and Japanese college students (<italic>N</italic> = 99). We predicted that preemptive strikes would be more pronounced in the intergroup than intragroup context (<italic>hypothesis 1</italic>), and that preexisting subjective perceptions of the nature of bilateral great power interdependence (positive/cooperative vs. negative/competitive) would shape the frequency of preemptive strikes against participants from the other nations (<italic>hypothesis 2</italic>). We also hypothesized that preexisting national stereotypes would drive aggression (<italic>hypothesis 3</italic>). According to the stereotype content model (SCM; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fiske et al., 2007</xref>), the degree of threat posed by another social group is assessed based upon its perceived intentions (warmth) and strength (competence). These socially conditioned stereotypes, therefore, should also shape the frequency of preemptive strikes. Lastly, we implemented further measures to explore whether any preemptive strikes taken were more defensively or offensively driven.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from an American (Mid-Atlantic region), a Chinese (Southeastern region), and two Japanese (Tokyo area) universities. They were undergraduates enrolled in psychology courses, participated voluntarily (with written consent), and received monetary compensation. Sample sizes were decided prior to data collection, based on prior power analyses (small to medium effect sizes expected; power &#x02265; 0.80) and funding.</p><p>One hundred and twenty-one American participants completed our experiment. Six were excluded for failing to understand the PSG rules (they failed to recall the correct pay-off rules in the post-PSG questionnaire). One hundred and fifteen American participants (52% male) were therefore included in the final analyses. Their ages ranged from 18 to 29 (<italic>M</italic> = 18.99 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22), and they came from 13 U.S. States.</p><p>One hundred and twenty-one Chinese participants completed our experiment. Fifteen were excluded for failing to understand the PSG rules. As a result, 106 Chinese participants (34% male) were included in the final analyses. Their ages ranged from 18 to 25 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.52 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.04), and they came from 17 Chinese provinces.</p><p>One hundred and two Japanese participants completed our experiment. Three were excluded for failing to understand the PSG rules. Ninety-nine Japanese participants (50% male) were therefore included in the final analyses. Their ages ranged from 18 to 23 (<italic>M</italic> = 19.19 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31), and they came from 27 Japanese counties.</p><p>Importantly, gender did not shape preemptive strike rates (<italic>ps</italic> &#x0003e; 0.250) in any country; the disparity of gender composition in the three national samples should not, therefore, affect our key findings. We also compared results with or without excluding participants who had not understood the task; the major findings remained robust.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Procedures</title><p>Participants completed a survey online 1 week prior to the PSG experiment. It assessed their preexisting perceptions about the two bilateral relationships that included their own country, their preexisting national stereotypes of the American, Chinese, and Japanese people, as well as other personality and demographic variables of interest. One week later, participants came to the laboratory and completed the PSG experiment. They also filled out a post-experiment survey tapping into the drivers of their PSG decisions. The original survey and experimental materials were written in English and translated into Chinese and Japanese by bilingual researchers.</p><sec><title>Pre-PSG Survey</title><sec><title>Preexisting perceptions of bilateral relations</title><p>Participants were asked to report how they viewed bilateral relations between their own country and the other two countries. Items included perceived competition (&#x0201c;<italic>Do you see the following bilateral relations as more competitive or cooperative?</italic>&#x0201d; 1 = <italic>Very competitive</italic>, 7 = <italic>Very cooperative</italic>), likelihood of future military conflict (&#x0201c;<italic>How likely is a military conflict between [your country] and the following countries in the next 10 years?</italic>&#x0201d; 1 = <italic>Very unlikely</italic>, 7 = <italic>Very likely</italic>), and optimism about future bilateral relations (&#x0201c;<italic>Do you feel more pessimistic or optimistic about the future of the following bilateral relations?</italic>&#x0201d; 1 = <italic>Very pessimistic</italic>, 7 = <italic>Very optimistic</italic>). Perceived competition was reverse coded such that higher scores indicate greater competition between the two countries.</p></sec><sec><title>National stereotypes</title><p>Participants reported their general impressions of people from the United States, China, and Japan, including perceived warmth and competence. Specifically, participants rated to what extent Americans, Chinese, and Japanese possess 6 traits on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>Not at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>Very much</italic>). Trait adjectives, validated in previous research (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), assessing warmth included <italic>likeable</italic>, <italic>friendly</italic>, and <italic>nice</italic>; adjectives assessing competence included <italic>competent</italic>, <italic>intelligent</italic>, and <italic>capable</italic>. Adjective order was randomized. Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for each measure ranged from 0.84 to 0.90 in the American sample, from 0.81 to 0.89 in the Chinese sample, and from 0.66 to 0.88 in the Japanese sample (only the alpha for the perceived warmth of Japanese people themselves was below 0.70). Average scores across the adjectives for warmth and competence were therefore calculated.</p><p>Bivariate correlations between warmth and competence for each national target ranged from 0.24 to 0.53 in the American sample, from 0.51 to 0.58 in the Chinese sample, and from 0.24 to 0.33 in the Japanese sample. These correlations were small to moderate, suggesting that warmth and competence were related but distinct.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>PSG Lab Experiment</title><p>We used Qualtrics survey software to program and administer the experiment in all three languages and countries. Participants completed PSG tasks privately in cubicles. Upon arrival, they received cash for participation (United States: 4 dollars; China: 14 yuan; Japan: 300 yen).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup> Participants were also informed that they might receive additional cash rewards depending upon their PSG decisions.</p><sec><title>Red-button PSG</title><p>In this key decision task, two paired participants make decisions on separate computers. Within 30-s, each decides whether to click a red button in the center of their computer screen or not. Their decisions have monetary consequences: if neither participant clicks the button, each receives the maximum cash reward (United States: 14 dollars; China: 46 yuan; Japan: 1,000 yen). Otherwise, the participant who clicks first pays a small cost (United States: receive 12 of 14 dollars; China: receive 41 of 46 yuan; Japan: receive 900 of 1,000 yen), while the other receives nothing, suffering a great monetary loss. Importantly, once the red button is clicked, any later clicks lose their effect; so retaliation is not possible. As a result, clicking the red button is an act of preemptive aggression, which may reflect either a defensive desire to eliminate a perceived threat to one&#x02019;s material well-being, or an offensive desire to harm the other participant.</p><p>Following a practice session, each participant made red-button decisions three times, facing a different participant from the United States, China, and Japan. The sequence was counterbalanced. In each round, a 5-s countdown (preparation time) was given before the 30-s countdown to make the red-button decision. No personal information was disclosed about either participant, except for their nationalities, indicated with a national flag (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Due to their different locations and time zones, decisions were not made in real-time, and no immediate outcome feedback was provided after each round. After all data were collected, we randomly paired participants&#x02019; decisions in a random round to calculate their cash rewards. Our procedure ensured the anonymity of participants&#x02019; decisions.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>A stimulus for a PSG decision: the United States&#x02013;China PSG.

Unlike the red button, clicking the blue button incurs a small and identical cost to <italic>both</italic> participants (United States: lose 2 dollars, receive 12 dollars; China: lose 5 yuan, receive 41 yuan; Japan: lose 100 yen, receive 900 yen), rather than primarily harming the other participant. Switching to the blue button therefore indicates defensive aggression, whereas sticking to the red button indicates offensive aggression (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Simunovic et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Decisions in this red-blue-button PSG also had monetary consequences; switching to clicking the blue button could change the final payoffs for both participants. For instance, if a participant who clicked the red button first in the red-button PSG later decides to click the blue button instead, both participants in this round would receive identical payoffs, with no one losing everything. In short, we paid participants cash rewards considering the results of this follow-up red-blue-button PSG. Participants made the red-blue-button decisions for each of the three rounds in which they previously clicked the red button.</p><p>For more details about the two PSG tasks, including the original instructions in each language, please see the Supplemental Materials.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Post-PSG Survey</title><p>After making all PSG decisions, participants answered additional survey questions and completed extra decision tasks.</p><sec><title>Expectations about the other participant&#x02019;s red-button decision</title><p>In strategic interaction, the decision to cooperate or compete in situations involving a possible conflict of interest is strongly influenced by expectations about what the other player will do (for a review, see <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Balliet and Van Lange, 2013</xref>). To better understand the proximal drivers of preemptive strikes, we also asked participants to indicate what percentage of the American, Chinese, and Japanese participants they expected to click the red button when playing the red-button PSG against them.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothetical unilateral PSG</title><p>In addition to the incentivized, red-blue-button PSG, we also implemented a hypothetical PSG to assess each participant&#x02019;s inclinations to engage in offensive aggression against specific others.

The payoff rules were same as the red-button PSG: clicking the red button incurs a small loss to oneself but causes the other participant to lose everything. Each participant indicated how likely he or she would be to click the button facing an American, a Chinese person, and a Japanese person.

Importantly, we also found that preemptive strikes were driven more by defensive than offensive aggression. A proximal and defensive driver of intergroup preemptive strikes appears to be the expectation of the outgroup member&#x02019;s imminent aggression. As &#x0201c;security dilemma&#x0201d; theorists suggest, fear can lead to war (see also <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the American college students in our sample did not exhibit the intergroup bias that we predicted. It could be that our sample of East Coast American students were more individualistic, liberal, and motivated not to appear racist than our Chinese and Japanese students were (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Henrich et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, our American students may view great power relations as more indeterminate than their Chinese and Japanese counterparts. In Study 1, only American students&#x02019; optimism about the two bilateral relationships reduced intergroup preemptive strike rates, consistent with the role of hope in mitigating preemptive aggression between individuals (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Halevy, 2017</xref>), as well as promoting conflict resolution between rival countries (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen-Chen et al., 2014</xref>). However, such rosy findings may not apply to older and more conservative Americans who may perceive great power relations to be more contentious.</p><p>In the next study, we address the issue of range restriction of age and ideologies in our American student sample. Additionally, Study 1&#x02019;s natural experiment design prevents a deeper exploration of causal mechanisms.

On the other hand, levels of trust in the Chinese people and government did not mediate the main effect of the CNN media manipulation on strike rates; anger appeared to play a more important role in driving intergroup preemptive aggression than did mistrust in the context of media framing and United States&#x02013;China relations.

The &#x0201c;Thucydides Trap&#x0201d; refers to the idea that the growth of Athenian power itself made war with Sparta inevitable&#x02014;and is likely to be repeated by great powers like the United States and China today (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison, 2015</xref>). However, peaceful power transitions such as that from Great Britain to the United States in the 20th century strongly suggest that shifts in the <italic>objective</italic> balance of power itself do not make great power conflict inevitable (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lebow and Valentino, 2009</xref>). Instead, this paper argues that the <italic>subjective</italic> perception of negative outcome interdependence is a critical psychological trigger of great power conflict. Across two experiments, we provide the first behavioral evidence that negative perceptions of great power interdependence promote preemptive strikes against citizens from rival countries. Perceived bilateral competition appears to increase the expectation of outgroup aggression, creating the psychological micro foundation for intergroup preemptive aggression.</p><p>Importantly, we also found that intergroup preemptive strikes were primarily defensive, even between groups of people who have been socialized to view their bilateral relations negatively (e.g., between Chinese and Japanese) and to hold prejudiced feelings toward one another. This finding is consistent with previous research both at the interpersonal level (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Simunovic et al., 2013</xref>) and at the intergroup level (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>). Humans are motivated more for ingroup defense than for unprovoked outgroup aggression (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">De Dreu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yamagishi and Mifune, 2016</xref>), and tend to avoid zero-sum competition against outgroups (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Halevy et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>). Great power conflict is therefore not inevitable, as long as mutual fear and mistrust are restrained.</p><p>We did, however, observe remarkably high rates of intergroup preemptive strikes (compared to intragroup preemptive strikes) across both experiments. High intergroup strike rates have not occurred in extant PSG experiments involving artificial groups (cf. <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;hm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mifune et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the sociopolitical context is a critical driver of intergroup preemptive strike rates. Specifically, compared to when they faced Americans, Chinese and Japanese participants in our PSGs were more likely to attack each other and stick to offensive aggression&#x02014;even when given the opportunity to act purely defensively. This highlights how socialization in China and Japan today about their past conflicts and current bilateral relations, and mutual prejudices (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2016</xref>) have increased the likelihood of another Sino-Japanese conflict (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cociani, 2016</xref>). Geographic proximity and greater contacts between these two East Asian powers make the prospect of preemptive strikes between them even more dangerous.</p><sec><title>Theoretic and Policy Implications</title><p>Using the PSG to study the psychological drivers of the security dilemma in great power relations is an example of applying psychological theories (e.g., of conflict, decision making, emotion, and social interdependence) and methods (the PSG, natural and randomized experiments) to the political science subfield of IR. Specifically, while describing the distal structural factors that can lead even benign great powers to defensively back themselves into tragic wars that no one wanted, like World War I, power transition and security dilemma theorists in IR have not explored the proximate psychological triggers (e.g., the perception of social interdependence, the expectation of outgroup offense, and anger) of defensive aggression. This interdisciplinary project begins to fill this gap in our understanding of the micro-level drivers of great power conflict. This project is therefore an example of how social psychology can inform scholarship in other disciplines, and make an applied contribution to the prospects for peace.</p><p>Our findings suggest that escaping the &#x0201c;Thucydides Trap&#x0201d; and avoiding preemptive conflict between great powers depends in part upon how Americans, Chinese, and Japanese are socialized (e.g., via education and the media) to feel about each other as people (stereotypes), and to view their bilateral relationships (perceived outcome interdependence). Regrettably, anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that media coverage in the United States, Japan, and China today paints a Hobbesian picture of great power competition&#x02014;not cooperation. Our results also suggest that the Chinese and Japanese educational systems may do the same, socializing Chinese and Japanese to view each other with suspicion.</p><p>Our results thus suggest a critical intervention: combatting stereotypes and promoting more balanced socialization about shared pasts and current bilateral relations. For instance, educational reforms and greater media coverage of positive outcome interdependence between great powers, such as of successful bilateral cooperation and the mutual benefits of trade, would mitigate against preemptive strikes, increasing the probability of great power peace.</p><p>China&#x02019;s rise has led to widespread comparisons to Imperial Germany&#x02019;s rise a century ago, which prompted a &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; arms race and frenzied alliance building&#x02014;a &#x0201c;security dilemma&#x0201d; contributing to the tragic outbreak of World War I. East Asia today already exhibits strong signs of a similarly &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; brew of maritime arms races and alliance politics. The security dilemma addresses distal structural drivers of war, however; it does not examine the more proximal psychological drivers of conflict, or specific forms of aggression like preemptive strikes.</p><p>With Donald Trump&#x02019;s election as President of the United States, in terms of leadership, similarities with the situation prior to World War I have increased. Trump, like Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, appears obsessed with respect both for himself personally and for his country. And given his zero-sum view of deal-making and the world more broadly (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Matthews, 2016</xref>), President Trump appears far more likely than former President Barack Obama to preemptively attack a small rival state like North Korea or even a rival great power like China. In January 2017, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set its Doomsday Clock the closest it has been to midnight since 1953, arguing that &#x0201c;the president&#x02019;s intemperate statements&#x02026; have already made a bad international security situation worse&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hennigan and Wilkinson, 2017</xref>). Should they similarly perceive an intemperate and &#x0201c;zero-sum Trump,&#x0201d; Chinese, North Korean, and other foreign leaders may themselves become more inclined toward preemptive strikes. In a nuclear world, the lunacy of even &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; preemptive aggression makes a better understanding of its causes imperative.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>Our participants were university students (study 1) and ordinary adults (study 2). It is likely that the psychological mechanisms that we uncovered also apply to the political elites who make foreign policy decisions and the military officers who make local combat decisions. They are, after all, fellow citizens socialized within the same national polities. However, there are also other psychological triggers that may shape the preemptive strike decisions that politicians and military personnel make. For instance, politicians may be more driven by partisanship than ordinary citizens. Similarly, honor and reputation may shape the decisions of military personnel more than ordinary citizens.</p><p>Another limitation is that the current study investigates preemptive defensive aggression in a simple two-person situation. Interstate interactions are complex processes influenced by both macro-level (structural) and micro-level (psychological) factors. Moreover, decision-making in groups has psychological characteristics (e.g., ambiguous responsibility) that cannot be reduced to individual decision-making. Previous research has indicated that collective group decision making induces greater competition than individual decisions (for a meta-analytic review, see <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wildschut et al., 2003</xref>). It is thus likely that decisions to engage in preemptive strikes made in group contexts involve different dynamics than does preemptive aggression between individual members of different groups.</p><p>We explored the expected rate of outgroup aggression as a proximal driver of preemptive strike rates. However, these expectations did not fully account for the occurrence of preemptive aggression. Across both studies, participants&#x02019; preemptive strike rates were often <italic>less frequent</italic> than expected rates of outgroup aggression. It is thus likely that pro-social motivations, such as fairness (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fehr and Fischbacher, 2002</xref>) and morality (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Schl&#x000f6;sser et al., 2015</xref>), reduced aggression. On the other hand, in some contexts (e.g., in Study 1&#x02019;s Japan-China PSG) participants struck more frequently than their expected rates of outgroup attacks. The specific intergroup context may make people overreact to potential threat, or use it as an excuse to engage in what is actually offensive aggression. Future studies should continue exploring dispositional and situational factors that motivate or mitigate preemptive strikes.</p><p>Study 1 revealed cross-cultural differences in the drivers of preemptive strikes (e.g., the facets of perceived bilateral relations and the dimensions of social stereotypes). Ample evidence has shown that cultural contexts, such as values and norms (e.g., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gelfand and Realo, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jing and Bond, 2015</xref>), moderate human cooperation and competition. Future research should unpack cultural differences more systematically to better understand preemptive aggression in IR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Note</title><p>Parts of an earlier version of this work were presented at the 23rd International Congress of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology in Nagoya, Japan (July, 2016), and at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology in Warsaw, Poland (July, 2016).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of APA Ethical Guidelines for Human Research with written informed consent from all subjects.
