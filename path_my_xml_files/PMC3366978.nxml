Here we explored the feasibility of a new brain self-regulation technique that integrates psychological and neurobiological approaches through neurofeedback with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a proof-of-concept study, eight patients with depression learned to upregulate brain areas involved in the generation of positive emotions (such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and insula) during four neurofeedback sessions. Their clinical symptoms, as assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS), improved significantly. A control group that underwent a training procedure with the same cognitive strategies but without neurofeedback did not improve clinically. Randomised blinded clinical trials are now needed to exclude possible placebo effects and to determine whether fMRI-based neurofeedback might become a useful adjunct to current therapies for depression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Depression is the mental disorder with the largest impact on public health. Up to 20&#x00025; of the population suffers from a depressive episode at some point in their lives <xref rid="pone.0038115-Kessler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and major depressive disorder (MDD) is a main source of disability for adults of working age in industrialized countries. At least 30&#x00025; of patients with MDD do not respond to standard pharmacological and/or psychological treatments <xref rid="pone.0038115-Rush1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and a considerable number of those who do respond initially go on to develop a chronic relapsing-remitting disorder. These patients with no or only a partial response to standard treatments often enter a vicious circle of psychosocial decline with further deterioration of their mood and level of functioning. To prevent relapses new therapeutic strategies have to be developed that aid the restructuring of cognitive schemas and might even prevent the formation and crystallization of dysfunctional thought patterns during early phases of depression.</p><p>Over the last two decades, several new treatment techniques have been developed that were at least partly motivated by neuroimaging findings. These invasive <xref rid="pone.0038115-Mayberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques <xref rid="pone.0038115-George1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> target the neural circuits believed to be involved in the maintenance of dysfunctional cognitive patterns and to change their activity in response to treatment <xref rid="pone.0038115-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Linden1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although two new stimulation techniques (Vagus Nerve Stimulation, VNS; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, TMS) have received FDA approval, one of them requires a surgical procedure (VNS) and the other (TMS) has had mixed clinical effects <xref rid="pone.0038115-George1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Moreover, even the most effective stimulation technique&#x02013;electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&#x02013;has only relatively short-lived effects <xref rid="pone.0038115-Merkl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The alternative, or complementary approach of teaching patients strategies that would eventually become self-sustainable has traditionally been the domain of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although CBT has recently been linked with neuroimaging to assess its neural effects <xref rid="pone.0038115-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Linden1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, neuroimaging findings have not directly been integrated in the therapeutic process.</p><p>Here we report a proof of concept study for a neuroimaging-based technique that tries to achieve such integration by combining concepts from brain stimulation, cognitive restructuring and emotion regulation research. This technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback, entails training patients to regulate their emotion circuits themselves through neurofeedback. The continuously updated neurofeedback signal shows the activity level in the targeted area, thereby providing patients with online information about their success in regulating their own brain activity.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that healthy participants <xref rid="pone.0038115-Caria1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038115-Weiskopf1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and patients with schizophrenia <xref rid="pone.0038115-Ruiz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> can learn self-regulation of brain areas involved in emotion processing through real-time feedback of local fMRI signals, and successful self-regulation was associated with altered appraisal of aversive stimuli <xref rid="pone.0038115-Caria2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The first clinical application of fMRI-based neurofeedback in patients with chronic pain has been promising. In this study, successful self-regulation of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area involved in the affective processing of pain, was associated with a reduction in pain ratings <xref rid="pone.0038115-deCharms1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the present study we localized areas responsive to positively valenced visual stimuli adapted from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) <xref rid="pone.0038115-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Johnston2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and then trained patients with unipolar depression to upregulate the activity in this target region over four sessions. We hypothesized that the combination of the physiological upregulation and the reinforced training of positive thought patterns would lead to an improvement of mood, which would not be seen in a control group that engaged in an emotion regulation protocol without neurofeedback.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression (Recurrent Depressive Disorder: 296.3) and no co-morbid DSM-IV pathology were recruited from outpatient clinics into the experimental (neurofeedback: NF) group. We subsequently recruited a control group to undergo an imagery (IM) procedure outside the scanner to control for non-specific effects of study participation and emotional imagery. Both groups were approached by their clinicians about their interest in participating in a research study exploring the effects of new treatments for depression. A psychiatrist (S.L.) confirmed each patient&#x02019;s diagnosis using a clinical interview based on the Structured Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). All participants were recruited from the same clinics and had to adhere to identical criteria, and the two groups did not differ in mean age (NF&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48.38 years; IM: 48.5 years; <italic>t</italic>(14)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.18, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.99), duration of illness (NF&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19.25 years, IM&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19.15 years; <italic>t</italic>(14)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.19, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.99), or handedness (one left-handed individual in each group), but there were three females in the IM group and only males in the NF group. All patients had been on a stable dose of antidepressant medication for at least six weeks preceding the intervention. The groups were comparable in terms of their drug treatment. Six NF patients were treated with antidepressants (AD) only; one, with AD and lithium; and one, with an AD and an antipsychotic. Seven IM patients were treated with an AD only; and one with an AD and lithium.

accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients gave informed written consent before taking part in the study. The study received approval from the ethics committees of the School of Psychology, Bangor University, and the North West Wales NHS Trust. Patients received a monetary compensation of &#x000a3;10 per hour for their time and effort. All patients were debriefed about their individual strategies and about potential distress upon completion of the post-intervention assessments. Because it employed an experimental rather than clinical trial design the study was not registered in a public trials database.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>General Procedure</title><p>All patients completed an initial testing session that included the clinical interview, an assessment of their depression with the HDRS, their reward sensitivity (Behavioural Inhibition System and Behavioural Activation System (BIS/BAS) <xref rid="pone.0038115-Carver1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>), and their metacognitive dispositions (Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ) <xref rid="pone.0038115-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and Thought Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ) <xref rid="pone.0038115-Luciano1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). The first experimental session immediately followed. Each session started and ended with an assessment of the patient&#x02019;s current mood using the Profile of Mood States (POMS <xref rid="pone.0038115-McNair1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) and the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS <xref rid="pone.0038115-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Immediately following the pre-intervention assessment, the patients in the NF group underwent the fMRI-neurofeedback procedure and the IM group performed the matched imagery. The second, third, and fourth experimental sessions were given at 1&#x02013;2 weekly intervals during a period of 4&#x02013;6 weeks. Immediately after the fourth session, the HDRS was administered again.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Description of Psychometric Tests</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Measures of depression and current mood state</title><p>The main outcome measure of clinical effects was the 17-item HDRS, which is a clinical rating scale that captures core components of the depressive syndrome and a standard measure of treatment outcome. We administered the full 21-item HDRS through a standardized interview by a board-certified psychiatrist (one of co-authors D.L., D.H., R.T., or S.L.). The sequential group allocation we had to implement made it impossible to blind the psychiatrists. We also assessed effects on current mood state with the POMS and PANAS before and after each session. On the POMS Standard Form <xref rid="pone.0038115-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, patients circle the number that correspond to their current mood state (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;a little&#x0201d;, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;moderately&#x0201d;, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;quite a bit&#x0201d;, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d;) on sixty-five items. The higher the score that is obtained on this test, the greater the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) that is experienced, and a drop in TMD was expected after each neurofeedback session. The POMS has satisfactory test-retest reliability, and internal consistency is satisfactory <xref rid="pone.0038115-Nyenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The PANAS is a self-report scale that consists of 20 items that state 10 positive and 10 negative feelings or emotions, which have to be scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;very slightly or not at all&#x0201d;, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;a little&#x0201d;, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;moderately&#x0201d;, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;quite a bit&#x0201d;, 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d;). It was expected that the scores on the positive scale would increase after a neurofeedback session and those on the negative scale would decrease. It has high internal consistency and high factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity <xref rid="pone.0038115-McNair1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Measures of reward sensitivity and thought control</title><p>The BIS/BAS questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0038115-Carver1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> consists of 24 statements that belong to one of the four scales: BIS, BAS reward responsiveness, BAS drive or BAS fun seeking. The participants scored these statements on a scale from 1 to 4 (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;very false for me&#x0201d;, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;somewhat false for me&#x0201d;, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;somewhat true for me, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; &#x0201c;very true for me&#x0201d;). This questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the experiment to obtain an indication of control over motivational behaviour. A high score on the BIS scale is associated with sensitivity to signals of punishment which causes the inhibition of goal achievement. High scores on the BAS scales on the other hand imply sensitivity to signals of reward, which leads to a reinforcement of goal-directed behaviour. The BIS/BAS scales have good internal reliability and factor validity <xref rid="pone.0038115-Heubeck1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The TCQ consists of 30 sentences which describe a certain strategy that can be adopted when one experiences an unpleasant or unwanted thought and measures five factors: reappraisal, distraction, punishment, social control and worry. For each strategy patients marked whether they &#x0201c;never&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;often&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;almost always&#x0201d; engaged in that particular strategy upon experiencing intrusive thoughts. A high score on the TCQ implies that the respondent adopts more adaptive strategies to control his or her thoughts. It has an acceptable test-retest reliability <xref rid="pone.0038115-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The TCAQ is composed of 25 statements that give an indication of how well patients are in suppressing unwanted thoughts <xref rid="pone.0038115-Luciano1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Patients rated these statements on a 5-point Likert scale (&#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;neutral or don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;). A higher score on the TCAQ is associated with a greater perceived control over one&#x02019;s intrusive thoughts. The TCAQ has high internal consistency and retest reliability <xref rid="pone.0038115-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We obtained these measures to ensure that any group differences in clinical outcome were not produced by baseline differences in reward sensitivity or perceived self-control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>FMRI Procedure (NF group)</title><p>Patients in the NF group were trained to upregulate brain areas responsive to positive emotions using a procedure modeled on our previous work with healthy participants <xref rid="pone.0038115-Johnston2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A target area was identified by the contrast between responses to positive and neutral images in a localizer scan to ensure that an area involved in positive emotion processing was selected. In the localizer scan, we assessed brain responses to positive, negative and neutral pictures by presenting four pictures of the same emotion category in blocks of 6 s (1.5 s per picture), alternating with a fixation baseline of 12 s. We presented 12 blocks per category in pseudorandom order. We used pictures from the IAPS <xref rid="pone.0038115-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with negative (mean normative ratings for valence 2.8 [SD.42], arousal 5.63 [SD.55]), positive (valence 6.90 [.55], arousal 6.00 [.74]) and neutral valence (valence 5.45 [.56], arousal 3.44 [.47]). Pictures showed, for example, scenes of danger or disgust in the negative category, and scenes of romance including mild erotica or exciting sports in the positive category. After the localizer scan, patients were trained to upregulate the target area during three neurofeedback scans lasting ca. 7 minutes each per session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038115-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Patients were informed about the general function of the target area but were not given any specific instructions about strategy. The task we set for them was to increase activity in the target area by as much and as consistently as possible.</p><fig id="pone-0038115-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038115.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Neurofeedback protocol.</title><p>During the neurofeedback runs (3 in each of the 4 sessions), participants alternated between 20 s periods of rest and 20 s periods where they had to upregulate activity in the target area.

Patients were instructed to keep head movement to a minimum and fixate the middle of the picture/thermometer display during visual presentation, avoiding eye movements.</p><p>For the neurofeedback, a continuous signal from the target area (updated every TR and thus every 2 seconds) was displayed using the picture of a thermometer whose dial indicated the amplitude of the fMRI signal in the target area. Changes in the amplitude were indicated as the percent of signal change, calculated using the current signal intensity value and comparing it with the average value determined from the rest period immediately preceding each upregulation block. The scaling of the thermometer was in steps of 0.05&#x00025;, with a maximum value of 0.5&#x00025; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038115-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). A change of background colour every 20 s indicated to participants whether their task was to regulate (green background) or rest (yellow background). The online GLM was computed with one predictor for the regulation state, convolved with a haemodynamic reference function. The top one-third (defined by the t value for the contrast between the regulation predictor and baseline) of the voxels from the target region was used to compute the feedback signal. For runs in which participants failed to upregulate the target area during the regulation periods (negative percent signal change), another target area was selected for the next run, using the cluster with the strongest activation for the regulation predictor. This adjustment in the target area was necessary in 15/32 (47.9&#x00025;) of the sessions after the first NF run, and in 4 sessions after the second run. The reasons for this approach were two-fold. First, the adjustment of ROIs aided the shaping of mental strategies in the desired direction. Shaping is a common concept in the operant learning of a highly demanding task <xref rid="pone.0038115-Weiskopf1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

For example, the happy memories that they reported as successful strategies included holidays, thoughts about their family being happy, and imagery of beautiful scenes from nature. Some patients attained good self-regulation of the target areas through mental simulation of future successes, and one patient successfully used imagery of an out-of-body experience. Conversely, during rest periods, the patients reported trying to &#x0201c;empty their thoughts&#x0201d; and to meditate. Patients in the IM group were instructed to engage in similar strategies as those reported by the NF patients. At debriefing, they confirmed that they had used these strategies. No patient reported any distress arising from the procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, four sessions of non-invasive fMRI-neurofeedback reduced the symptoms of depression with an effect size similar to those obtained with deep brain stimulation (DBS) <xref rid="pone.0038115-Mayberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although the mental strategies of positive thoughts, memories, and imagery may have played a considerable part in this improvement, the neurofeedback procedure was crucial as evidenced by the absence of any clinical improvement in the control group. This effect of the neurofeedback intervention can be a result of several factors, including the self-regulation of emotion networks, but also non-specific effects of reward experience and scanner environment. These potential confounds and strategies for overcoming them in future studies will be discussed below. The lack of improvement in the control group may seem surprising at first, considering the often reported placebo responses in drug trials. However, enrolment in drug trials raises very different expectations to a brief emotion regulation intervention, and control or waiting list groups of psychotherapy trials often show no improvement at all <xref rid="pone.0038115-Selmi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition to the feasibility of the technique in patients with depression, which is important in light of the often reported motivational deficits in this patient group, this study thus shows encouraging clinical effects, which need to be corroborated in clinical trials.</p><p>The significant interactions between Session on the one hand and baseline TMD and PANAS on the other hand showed that within-session improvements on the POMS and PANAS are influenced by the improvement over time, which can result in ceiling effects. However, none of these factors interacted with Group and thus different sensitivity to the mood measures does not seem to have influenced the key results of our study. Whereas groups did not differ in the immediate mood effect as measured with the POMS, a questionnaire that does not capture the full syndrome of depression, only the NF group improved significantly on the HDRS, which captures more sustained clinical effects, after treatment. This suggests that the neurofeedback procedure mainly enhanced the consolidation of the patients&#x02019; improved control over their mood states. This interpretation would conform to a recent report that emotion regulation without neurofeedback resulted in immediate but not sustained effects at the neural level in patients with major depression <xref rid="pone.0038115-Erk1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The finding that patients who became better at up-regulating their target area also improved more on the HDRS supports this finding. The non-significant correlation between up-regulation improvement and POMS or PANAS was as expected as improvement on these scales leveled off after large improvements during early sessions and was also seen in the control group. One attractive interpretation of our results in the context of current cognitive models of depression is that the NF patients managed to activate positive cognitive schemas that were otherwise dormant <xref rid="pone.0038115-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The interplay of cognitive and operant strategies is also reflected in the pattern of areas that were activated or deactivated regardless of the specific target area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038115-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038115-t003">Table 3</xref>). The activation of cognitive control areas in the prefrontal cortex and of the hippocampal complex would be compatible with the active selection of the appropriate autobiographical strategy for positive mood induction and cognitive appraisal of emotions, whereas activation of the ventral striatum, which increased during the later sessions, has been associated with both operant learning and rewarding experiences <xref rid="pone.0038115-Maia1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The deactivation of the TPJ (equivalent to higher activation during the rest epochs) is compatible with the role of this area in the &#x0201c;default mode network&#x0201d; and its deactivation during attention-demanding processes <xref rid="pone.0038115-Gusnard1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The focal pattern of activation and deactivations during the upregulation blocks also makes it unlikely that the increasing activation of the target area was achieved by some non-specific physiological artifact. Nevertheless, to completely rule out this possibility, online monitoring of peripheral physiological parameters should have been conducted and future studies should incorporate these measures. The feasibility of fMRI-neurofeedback under online control for potential movement <xref rid="pone.0038115-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> or physiological changes <xref rid="pone.0038115-Zotev1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> has been demonstrated. Because the control group was not scanned we do not know whether their execution of the imagery procedure involved similar patterns of brain activation. However, in a study with a similar design (albeit only one session) in healthy individuals where both groups were scanned we found clear differences in the training effects on the activation of the emotion network <xref rid="pone.0038115-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is also worth noting that the initial target area identified for positive affective stimuli varied across sessions for the same participant, although it was mostly located in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex or the insula. Without a scanned control group we cannot say whether this reflects a changing emotion regulation during the neurofeedback procedure <xref rid="pone.0038115-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> or whether it merely indicates normal variability in the brain&#x02019;s response to emotional stimuli over time <xref rid="pone.0038115-Hamann1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We do not believe that the activation patterns found for emotion regulation in the present study primarily reflect patients&#x02019; medication because the few studies investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation in unmedicated depressed patients obtained comparable results. Medication-free patients have shown increased activity in the insula and frontal regions and decreased activity in temporal and parietal regions during an emotion reappraisal task <xref rid="pone.0038115-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Heller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and decreased DLPFC activity on an emotional information processing task <xref rid="pone.0038115-Siegle1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Conceptually, fMRI-based neurofeedback combines the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with those of physical brain stimulation. Compared to electromagnetic brain stimulation techniques, it has the advantage of enhancing the patient&#x02019;s self-efficacy <xref rid="pone.0038115-Bandura1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, which is an important principle in cognitive restructuring. Neurofeedback combines biological and cognitive treatment principles in a way that differentiates it both from traditional biofeedback <xref rid="pone.0038115-deCharms2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and cognitive therapy and may therefore be particularly useful for patients who have not responded to or are reluctant to engage in psychological therapies. The feedback element and success control could constitute an incentive for patients who are not sufficiently motivated for standard psychotherapies. Another attraction of the fMRI-neurofeedback technique lies in its adaptability to individual target areas that may differ across individuals and time. However, in order to stabilize long-term benefits, homework assignments or booster sessions might be usefully added to the present protocol.</p><p>The present study was a proof of concept of the feasibility of neurofeedback and its potential clinical benefits in depression. One limitation of the present study was the absence of blinding and randomization, and randomized controlled trials are needed to corroborate the clinical benefits. Lack of randomization and sequential group allocation can induce demographic or procedural biases, which can only be partly controlled for by including them as confounds in a covariance analysis. Yet patients assigned to the NF or IM group were recruited via the exact same resources and showed no meaningful differences in demographics apart from the uneven gender distribution, which needs to be addressed in future studies in order to assess whether the effect generalizes to female patients. Moreover, the testing of both groups overlapped in time period and both groups engaged in a task that required the same mental strategies and time commitment.</p><p>It might be useful to use Quality of Life scales and self-reported clinical scales to capture the patients&#x02019; response to treatment without the potential biases of unblinded assessments. However, by their very nature, procedures with a strong cognitive component are impossible to execute in a completely blinded design. A potential effect of task setting, if any, would hamper the performance of patients in the NF group who carried out the task in a noisy and highly confined space. The clinical and functional improvement suggests that the effects of neurofeedback can overcome these suboptimal circumstances, thereby strengthening the plausibility of neurofeedback for alleviating depression. It could be argued that the exposure to a technologically advanced method may have boosted confidence in the neurofeedback method or otherwise created a placebo effect, thereby decreasing the HDRS scores of the experimental group only, although there is no reported evidence for clinical improvements from scanning alone <xref rid="pone.0038115-Ruh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Yet future studies need to keep task setting more similar between groups, especially with regard to the use of highly technical equipment. A &#x0201c;sham&#x0201d; feedback procedure that presents on average similar success signals as in the active group but is not contingent on actual brain regulation is a possibility, but it cannot be excluded that patients will notice the non-contingency of the feedback. In our recent fMRI-neurofeedback study in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease we did rule out non-specific effects of the scanner environment on functional improvement <xref rid="pone.0038115-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. All previous studies incorporating a control group did not find an effect of sham feedback either <xref rid="pone.0038115-Caria1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Caria2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-deCharms1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038115-Caria3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038115-Zotev1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is certainly possible, though, that the experience of successful self-regulation of brain activity, quite independent of the target area, produces beneficial clinical effects. This possibility needs to be addressed in future studies employing different target systems in the brain. Another neurofeedback variable that needs to be carefully considered in future trials is block duration. The significant difference between positive emotion up-regulation and rest suggests that a block length of 20 s was appropriate for our study, yet future studies might benefit from employing longer block durations in order to give patients more time to disengage from the mental processes utilized for upregulation.</p><p>Our study differed from most other neurofeedback studies in that we flexibly adjusted the target area for subsequent runs based on areas that were upregulated in the previous run. This procedure was intended to support the shaping of learned responses because of the limitation of scanning time and the need to minimize patient frustration. However, this procedure may also have made it more difficult for patients to find the optimal up-regulation strategy and may overestimate the within session learning effect. Another limitation is that we cannot isolate the effective mechanism or mechanisms of the neurofeedback procedure from the present study. Although our data suggest that neurofeedback of emotion networks is more effective than emotion regulation without brain signals, we cannot determine the relative contribution of the general experience of gaining control about brain activation and the specific areas modulated. This issue could be addressed in a further study using another target system in the brain in a control group.</p><p>FMRI-based neurofeedback is a holistic approach that overcomes bio-psychological dualisms. It is therefore perfectly compatible with current models of depression and other complex mental disorders. It can be used to help patients and researchers understand the neural and cognitive processes that underlie depression. Most importantly, however, if the clinical benefits are replicated in clinical trials it may prove to be the first therapeutic application of functional imaging in the field of mental health. We can expect that knowledge about the contribution of dysfunctional brain circuits to psychiatric symptoms will continue to accumulate, which opens up the possibility of developing therapeutic imaging protocols similar to the present one for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p>In this proof of concept study we demonstrate that patients with depression can learn self-control of emotion-related brain areas through fMRI-based neurofeedback. This procedure had clinical benefits compared to a control group, which engaged in emotional imagery outside the scanner, but further formal testing in randomized trials with blinded assessments is needed in order to assess the clinical efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work was supported by the Wales Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience with funds from the Welsh Assembly Government and by the Medical Research Council (grant reference G1100629/1).
