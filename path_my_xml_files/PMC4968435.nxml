The aim of the present study was to utilize sensitive high-throughput transcriptome analyses to investigate potential unfavorable effects of oxidized fish oil (PV: 18 meq/kg; AV: 9) compared to high-quality fish oil (PV: 4 meq/kg; AV: 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> In a double-blinded randomized controlled study for seven weeks, 35 healthy subjects were assigned to 8 g of either oxidized fish oil or high quality fish oil.

Furthermore, gene sets related to oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease were not differently regulated between the groups.

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), including n-3 fatty acids in marine oils, are susceptible to oxidation, and consequently, lipid oxidation products are generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For several years, the voluntary monographs by the Global Organization for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) Omega-3s (GOED) have served as the quality standard of the industry, giving recommendations for the content of lipid oxidation products, such as a maximum peroxide value (PV) of 5&#x000a0;meq/kg (milliequivalents per kilogram) and a maximum anisidine value (AV) of 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other monographs exists, such as the European pharmacopeia recommending a PV at 5 or 10&#x000a0;meq/kg and an AV at 30 or 15, depending on the content of marine n-3s. The quality of the FO, in terms of the oxidative status, can be camouflaged by encapsulation, additives, and flavorings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and a variation in the oxidative status of n-3 supplements and vegetable oils has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Concerns related to a regular consumption of oxidized marine oils and negative health effects have been raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14"> 14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15"> 15</xref>]. If lipid oxidation products from the diet are absorbed in humans, these highly reactive compounds may cause oxidative damage to macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrate, DNA, and lipids thereby altering their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Highly reactive lipid compounds may also act as signaling molecules that alter gene functions and thereby influence health via cellular sensing mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Cell studies have indicated that lipid oxidation products are involved in pathophysiological processes due to their reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and oxidized n-3 fatty acids have been shown to increase the antioxidant defense system and to enhance endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some animal studies show serious biological effects from the intake of oxidized lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but there are few studies investigating the intake of oxidized lipids in concentrations more similar to daily life. However, mice fed on a high-fat diet containing weakly oxidized n-3 fatty acids for 8&#x000a0;weeks increased the plasma level of n-3 oxidation products and inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The intake of oxidized vegetable oils has been shown to increase the postprandial level of plasma lipid oxidation products and markers related to coronary vascular disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Discrepancies exist, and we have previously reported that the intake of oxidized fish oil for 7&#x000a0;weeks did not change the plasma levels of peroxidation products of LCPUFAs, serum level of oxidized LDL-cholesterol, or selected markers of oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"> 28</xref>]. However, lipid oxidation generates a variety of reactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and no single biomarker reflects the total in vivo lipid oxidation and oxidative stress status. In addition, the circulating oxidative stress markers may not be sensitive enough to reflect a local change in the cellular oxidative stress status. Other approaches including more sensitive techniques to accurately measure the influence of lipid oxidation products at a molecular level are therefore required.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses examine the mRNA transcript level in a given cell population and reflect the genes that are actively expressed at a given time. Changes in the transcriptome profile occur prior to changes in protein levels. Transcriptomics has therefore shown to be a valuable and sensitive technique measuring early changes related to a dietary challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"> 30</xref>]. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) include monocytes and lymphocytes. In the circulation, PBMCs are exposed to environmental factors and metabolic tissues and may therefore reflect systemic health. It is well known that dietary factors modulate the gene expression in PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the same intervention trials as presented here, we have previously shown that the intake of high-quality FO modulated the transcriptional profile in human PBMCs and changes in the gene transcripts related to cell cycle, apoptosis, and ER stress were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The potential of transcriptome analyses to detect early changes caused by a nutritional challenge encourages us to further investigate whether the intake of oxidized fish oil (oxFO) could alter the gene expression profile in PBMCs compared to high-quality FO in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>The intervention study took place at Akershus University College, Norway, between September and December 2009.

Within-group analyses revealed a more prominent effect after intake of high-quality FO as more gene transcripts were changed from the baseline than within the oxFO group. The current study is to our knowledge the first to investigate effects at a molecular level after the intake of oxFO using high-throughput sensitive transcriptome analyses.</p><p>The intake of lipid oxidation products may disturb the normal redox state of the cell, alter normal cell function and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"> 16</xref>], and ultimately lead to modulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In a previous study with mice, the intake of moderately oxidized n-3 PUFA for 8&#x000a0;weeks induced oxidative stress in the intestine and enhanced plasma inflammatory markers and gene expression analyses showed an increase in the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2) mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We have previously not been able to detect changes in markers of oxidative stress such as urinary 8-iso-PGF2a, plasma a-tocopherol, plasma 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal and plasma 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal or glutathione, CAT activity, and GPx activity in erythrocytes or inflammatory markers in the same study after intake of oxFO compared to high-quality FO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"> 28</xref>]. Furthermore, the intake of oxFO, containing lipid oxidation products, did not alter biological processes or gene sets related to oxidative stress when compared to fish oil in the current study.</p><p>When the groups were analyzed separately, the mRNA level of BAK1 was significantly increased from baseline within the oxFO group. The BAK1 protein is localized to the mitochondria and functions to induce apoptosis. This protein also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 after exposure to cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the increased BAK1 mRNA level could be caused by the intake of lipid oxidation products in the oxFO group. BAK and BAX were recently shown to be involved in eicosanoid metabolism independent of apoptotic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The increase in BAK1 mRNA may therefore be related to the eicosanoid precursor EPA and DHA, presented in equal amounts in the two fish oils. BAK1 mRNA was also increased from the baseline within the FO group, although not significantly (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), and biological processes related to apoptosis were regulated within both fish oil groups.</p><p>Biological processes related to translation elongation, translation, and apoptosis were enriched within both groups, while biological processes related to cell cycle was only enriched within the oxFO group. However, we have previously shown that the intake of high-quality FO regulated gene transcripts related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and ER stress when compared to the intake of high-oleic sunflower oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our data is in accordance with Bouwens et al.&#x02019;s, who also demonstrated that the expression of genes involved in pathways related to processes such as transcription, translation, and cell cycle were regulated in PBMCs after the intake of FO (1.8&#x000a0;g/day EPA+DHA) for 26&#x000a0;weeks in elderly subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, processes related to the translation, apoptosis, and cell cycle may be modulated after the intake of fish oil independent of oxidative status. These processes and pathways are involved in normal cellular functions and may ultimately influence whole body health. We did not detect any regulated pathways or processes related to lipid metabolism, antioxidant defense, and inflammation as previously reported after n-3 supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This could be explained by the inclusion of healthy subjects in the current study, and the results may be different in subjects with elevated levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, or serum lipids.</p><p>CD55 was downregulated from the baseline within both groups and independent of the oxidative status of the fish oils. CD55 is part of the complement system and has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. CD55 deficiency has also been shown to protect apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> micefrom atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The downregulation of CD55 mRNA by fish oil may thus be one of the mechanisms by which fish oil can exert its beneficial effect.</p><p>The changes in the oxidative status of the oil as measured by increased PV and AV occur prior to a measurable reduction in the concentration of fatty acids. Thus, the oxidized and the non-oxidized FO contained an equal amount of fatty acids, including n-3 fatty acids (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The similar transcriptome profile may therefore be explained by the similar fatty acid profile of the FOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as they originated from the same batch.</p><p>Conflicting results related to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases by marine LCPUFAs have recently been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It has been suggested that the oxidation of the marine oils may be responsible for the lack of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent study investigating the effect of omega-3 supplements with different oxidation level on circulating lipid parameters showed a reduction in plasma triglycerides independent of the oxidative status of the fish oil. However, a beneficial effect on plasma total cholesterol was only evident in the group consuming less oxidized fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In the current study, a more prominent effect was evident after the intake of FO as 11 gene transcripts were significantly (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1) changed from baseline whereas 3 within the oxFO group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Whether this is related to the oxidative status of the fish oils is currently not known and needs further investigations.</p><p>The present study was originally designed to investigate the effect of oxFO on the circulating markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and plasma lipids compared to high-quality FO, and the power of the study was calculated based on the relative change in plasma n-3 compared to the high-oleic sunflower oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We cannot rule out the possibility that the current study lacks the power to detect differences between the two FO groups when it comes to the transcriptome profile. However, transcriptome analyses in PBMCs represent a sensitive high-throughput method to detect changes caused by diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To increase the power in the current study, we included analyses where genes were grouped based on involvement in the same biological process, pathway, or network.</p><p>The strengths of the present study are that the study design was performed as a blinded randomized controlled trial with high compliance, as described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The transcriptome analyses have been performed with an exploratory approach where the identification of regulated gene transcripts, biological processes, and networks was done with several data analysis strategies. The major limitation is the relatively low daily dose of oxidized lipids (PV/AV) administered and the relatively short intervention period. The study group included healthy subjects, and we cannot rule out that by using another study group more susceptible to the intake of oxFO, this would have led to different results. There is also a chance that other cellular compartments or tissues such as the intestine may have been affected by the intake of oxFO in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By using a transcriptome approach, we aimed to investigate the effects at the molecular level prior to changes in circulating markers. The results demonstrate that the short-term consumption of oxidized fish oil in healthy subjects did not alter the transcriptome profile in PBMCs compared to the intake of high-quality FO. Whether these results are applicable for other oxidized marine oils, longer interventions, or valid in subjects with elevated levels of inflammation and oxidative stress needs to be addressed.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12263_2016_530_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Significantly changed gene transcripts (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) between the oxFO and FO groups determined by a moderated <italic>t</italic> test (Limma), by comparing the relative change from the baseline to 7&#x000a0;weeks of intervention. <italic>oxFO</italic> oxidized fish oil, <italic>FO</italic> fish oil, <italic>FC</italic> fold change from baseline, <italic>FDR</italic> false discovery rate.
