Guaran&#x000e0; seed extracts however over the last few decades became increasingly popular worldwide mainly for their stimulant and thermogenic actions, as ingredients in many herbal formulas, energy drinks, and protein bars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Several studies addressed the stimulant, cognitive and behavioral effects of guaran&#x000e0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In particular, various double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in human subjects showed that guaran&#x000e0; acutely improves some parameters of cognitive performance without effects on mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], enhances secondary memory performance and increases alert and some content mood ratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], increases speed and accuracy of performing rapid visual information processing tasks and attenuates mental fatigue associated with extended task performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. At least one controlled study however failed to report any effects on psychomotor speed and accuracy, memory, visuomotor performance, planning and problem solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Conflicting results have been reported also in the few studies which addressed the effects of guaran&#x000e0; after long-term administration. Indeed, in two recent randomised, cross-over, placebo-controlled studies in breast cancer patients, guarana was effective in reducing fatigue during systemic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] but had no effect on radiation-induced fatigue and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, in a double-blind study it was reported that long-term administration of guaran&#x000e0; had no significant effects on the cognition of normal, elderly volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Commercial products currently available on the market usually contain guaran&#x000e1; extracts which are concentrated and standardized to the caffeine content. Commonly recommended dosages correspond to 20&#x02013;30 mg of caffeine per day while usually no instructions are provided about optimal duration of use. Indeed, guaran&#x000e0; is generally regarded as safe by the Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These products are usually marketed with claims of effectiveness, but the weight of the evidence is very small for most of them. A recent survey found that guaran&#x000e0; is among the most common herbal ingredients sold over the Internet even for use as legal alternatives to illicit drugs of abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additional concern comes from the observation that potential uses suggested in websites include mood enhancement as well as treatment of depression, together with the suggestion that guaran&#x000e0; may increase feelings of well-being. To our best knowledge however no evidence exists so far which might support those claims, except for a report showing, after acute administration of guaran&#x000e0;, increased alert ratings and improved content ratings measured by use of the Bond-Lader mood scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Guaran&#x000e0; contains large amounts of caffeine, as well as trace amounts of theophylline and theobromine, which are believed to contribute significantly to guaran&#x000e0; effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Indeed moderate intake of caffeine has been associated with less depressive symptoms, although its effects on mood never received thorough investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Considering the increasing popularity of guaran&#x000e0;-containing products and the paucity of evidence regarding their actual effectiveness, we decided to assess in healthy subjects the effects on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood of a commercially available guaran&#x000e0; preparation used according to the labeled dosages and instructions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-seven volunteers (9 female and 18 male, age (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) 25.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4 years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol evaluating the effects on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood of the intake for five consecutive days of a guaran&#x000e0; extract at 360 mg &#x000d7; 3 daily just after breakfast, according to labelled advice All the subjects enrolled successfully concluded the study, regularly taking all the capsules in the two treatment periods and participating to all the 4 evaluation sessions.

Results provide no evidence for any major effects of guaran&#x000e0; on the psychological tests employed. The only significant difference in favour of guaran&#x000e0; was found in female subjects and it was limited to just one of the six areas of psychological well-being (namely, self-acceptance), thus it cannot be excluded that it represents just a random finding. Given the null results reported, it is important to consider whether the study was adequately powered to detect significant effects if they existed. Power analysis of the results show that the least hypothetical differences between the effects of guaran&#x000e0; and placebo which could be detected in our study were in the range 2.1-2.8 for PWB scales and 2.2 for the SAS scale, while they were in the range 8.6-11.6 for the Bond&#x02013;Lader scales. Least hypothetical differences are therefore very small for the PWB scales and for the SA scale.

For the SAS scale total scores range from 20&#x02013;80 and clinically relevant intervals are: 20&#x02013;44 normal, 45&#x02013;59 mild to moderate anxiety, 60&#x02013;74 marked to severe anxiety, 75&#x02013;80 extreme anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intervals are therefore nearly seven-fold higher than the least detectable differences in the present study, thus it is unlikely that any significant effects could have been overlooked. As for the Bond Lader scales, least detectable differences in our study were in the range 8.6-11.6. The Bond Lader scales were used in at least one previous study showing positive results with guaran&#x000e0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]: after acute administration of guaran&#x000e0; to 26 healthy subjects (18 females, 8 males) there were statistically significant increases of alert and content ratings, the size being in both cases on average around 6&#x02013;7 units, a difference which could have been overlooked in our setting. Nonetheless, according to our results the average differences observed between placebo and guaran&#x000e0; in either alert, content and calm were in the range 1.3-3.3, therefore unlikely to be clinically relevant and in any case half or less those found in the study by Haskell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It should be noted that also Kennedy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] examined the effects of a single dose of guaran&#x000e0; extract on mood using the Bond-Lader scales. They reported no signifcant effects, however they also provided no figures and it is therefore not possible to compare those results with the present findings.</p><p>Studies investigating the neurobehavioural effects of guaran&#x000e0; in humans so far considered mainly the acute effects. Kennedy and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] used 75 mg of a dried ethanolic extract of guaran&#x000e0; and found positive effects on some tasks of the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerised assessment and on the Serial subtraction task, and in particular improvements to speed of attention, secondary memory, serial subtractions and speed of sentence verification, but no effects on the Bond-Lader mood scales. The same group in a subsequent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] showed that 222 mg of guaran&#x000e0; (containing 40 mg caffeine) added to vitamin/mineral effervescent tablets improved task performance, in comparison to placebo, in terms of both increased speed and accuracy of performing the Rapid Visual Information Processing and attenuated mental fatigue associated with extended task performance. Haskell and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] used a standardized guaran&#x000e0; extract containing 11-12% caffeine and found positive effects on secondary memory performance in the CDR computerised assessment with 37.5 and 75 mg, on alert ratings of the Bond-Lader mood scales with 300 mg and on content ratings with 37.5, 75, 150 and 300 mg. Fernandes Galdur&#x000f3;z and de Ara&#x000fa;jo Carlini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], who failed to report any effects with guaran&#x000e0;, evaluated 1000 mg guaran&#x000e0; containing 21 mg caffeine on tests of psychomotor speed and accuracy (letter cancellation), working memory (digit span and digit symbol substitution), memory (free recall and learned material) and the Mosaic test (involving visuomotor performance, planning and problem solving). No effect was also found on anxiety and quality of sleep.</p><p>Just a few studies addressed the effects of guaran&#x000e0; after prolonged administration. The study by de Oliveira Campos and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] examined the effects of 50&#x000a0;mg guaran&#x000e0; by mouth twice daily for 21 days in 75 breast cancer patients receiving systemic chemotherapy using a double-blinded procedure and found positive results on several fatigue scales with no worsening of sleep quality or anxiety or depression. In another double-blinded, cross-over study, da Costa Miranda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] randomized 36 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy to either guaran&#x000e0; 75 mg daily for 28 days or to placebo and found no effect on radiation-induced fatigue and depression. Fernandes Galdur&#x000f3;z and de Ara&#x000fa;jo Carlini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] administered 1 g of powdered guaran&#x000e0; (containing 2.1% caffeine) per day for five months to normal, elderly volunteers who were evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 5 months. Evaluations included the Mini-Mental State as screening for dementia, the Digital Span to assess immediate memory, the Free Recall for recent memory, Digital Symbol for psychomotor activity and concentration, Cancellation tests for vigilance and attention, the Mosaic test for visual and spatial organization, the Rave-Progressive Matrices for general abilities, and in addition quality of sleep and anxiety were assessed. No significant effects were detected on any of the functions tested and in addition no subjects reported any rise in libido or improved sexual performance.</p><p>Based upon available literature, it appears therefore that guaran&#x000e0; has been investigated mainly as a stimulant, in agreement with its chemical composition, while the possible effects of guaran&#x000e0; on mood have been only occasionally considered. So far only Haskell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported some positive results on mood, while Kennedy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] failed to observe any significant effects. Nonetheless, in both cases single doses of guaran&#x000e0; were studied and short-term effects were reported.</p><p>Guaran&#x000e0;-containing products are usually recommended for regular use: this is the main reason why our study was concerned with the effects of guaran&#x000e0; regularly taken according to the labeled dosages and instruction over several days. The results of our study, which found no effect of guaran&#x000e0; on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood, are in line with previous studies reporting no activity of guaran&#x000e0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We decided to assess the effects of guaran&#x000e0; on psychological well-being since the possible increase of &#x0201c;feelings of well-being&#x0201d; is among the most common claims for guaran&#x000e0;-containing products in particular on the Internet, where guaran&#x000e0; is one of the most popular herbal ingredients sought for the purpose of increasing alertness and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], however to our knowledge no scientific studies existed so far which addressed this issue. In our study we used a guaran&#x000e0; extract commercially available and standardized to 2.5% caffeine. Enrolled subjects took a total of 1080 mg/day, according to labelled commercial instructions and corresponding to 27 mg caffeine per day. Likely explanations for lack of effects and apparent discrepancies with other studies (e.g. Haskell and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] who found positive effects on some ratings of the Bond-Lader mood scales) include the possibility that the selected tasks were insensitive to the levels of treatment used, or the testing regimens were not adequate to observe the effects of guaran&#x000e0;. Indeed, caffeine is one of the main chemicals in guaran&#x000e0; seeds, its content being usually 4-8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The half-life of caffeine however is about 5 h (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), therefore any acute effects are likely to disappear in a short time, while the supposed long-term benefits of frequent caffeine consumption (e.g. reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and liver cancer) possibly require years of more or less regular intake (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]): it cannot be excluded that the same applies to the possible effects of caffeine on mood, which so far never received thorough investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the present study failed to observe any significant effect of a 5-day treatment with a commercial preparation of guaran&#x000e0; on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood in healthy subjects. A number of adverse events are reported with the use of herbal food supplements containing guaran&#x000e0;, including irritability, heart palpitations, anxiety and other central nervous system events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], especially in children, adolescents, and young adults with seizures, diabetes, cardiac abnormalities, or mood and behavioral disorders or those who take certain medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Also in view of the weak evidence available regarding the actual effectiveness of commercial products containing guaran&#x000e0;, caution shoud be always used and advised to potential users. Considering the increasing popularity of products containing guaran&#x000e0; &#x02013; as well as a number of other traditional herbs &#x02013; and sold as dietary supplements for health and fitness purposes, controlled studies are strongly warranted to assess their benefits in comparison to the labelled claims.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>We enrolled 27 volunteers (9 female and 18 male, age (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) 25.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.4 years). Subjects taking part in the study were acquaintances of the students attending the Course in Motorial Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Insubria (Varese, I). All the subjects reported good health, were not cigarette smokers and did not report use of over-the-counter, medication (including hormonal contraceptive methods) and/or illicit drugs in the previous three months. Participants were told that the study aimed at the evaluation of the effects of mood of a commerncial product containing guaran&#x000e0; used according to the commercial advice and that, to this end, they would have received during distinct 5-day periods in random sequence capsules containing guaran&#x000e0; or corn starch. All the participants provided written informed consent and the study was performed according to ethical guidelines for research on humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Study products</title><p>We used a commercial guaran&#x000e0; extract kindly provided by Anderson Research (Cassino, FR, Italy; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anderson-research.com">http://www.anderson-research.com</ext-link>). The extract contained caffeine 2.5% (w/w) and was prepared in 360 mg capsules. According to labelled instructions, 3 capsules/day should be taken, with no recommendations regarding duration of use. Placebo capsules contained 360 mg of cornstarch.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the effects on psychological well-being, anxiety and mood of the intake for five consecutive days of a guaran&#x000e0; extract at 360 mg&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 daily just after breakfast, according to labelled advice.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Each participant was required to attend a total of 4 evaluation sessions (pretreatment, treatment 1, washout, treatment 2), which comprised completion of the psychological well-being scales (PWB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the self-rating anxiety state scale (SAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the Bond&#x02013;Lader Visual Analogue Scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Testing took place during the morning between 9:00am and 11:00am in a room of the laboratories, and subjects were visually isolated from each other during the whole session. The pretreatment session (day 1) was identical to the others and was devised to eliminate practice effects and to familiarize participants with the evaluation procedures. Participants were then randomized to guaran&#x000e0; or placebo and received 15 capsules and the instructions about how to take them each day (3 capsules/day immediately after breakfast with half glass of water) for five consecutive days (days 2&#x02013;6). Then participants underwent the second evaluation session (day 7, treatment 1) and then a washout period of additional five days (days 8&#x02013;12), which was followed by an evaluation session (day 13, washout) and by a second 5-day period of treatment (days 14&#x02013;18, crossover: placebo or guaran&#x000e0; according to what they received in the first period). The day after the end of the second treatment period (day 19) participants underwent the final evaluation session (treatment 2). Evaluation sessions following treatment periods always included a standard interview about any possible adverse events.</p><p>Subjects were blind to treatments. Random allocation to guaran&#x000e0; or placebo was accomplished by use of a random number calculator (QuickCalcs, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">http://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). During the first period of treatment 9 subjects received guaran&#x000e0; and 15 received placebo, and were subsequently switched to placebo and guaran&#x000e0;, respectively, during the second period. Before each period of treatment, each subject received 15 capsules (either guaran&#x000e0; or placebo, 3 per day for 5 consecutive days) and was asked to bring back any remaining capsules on the day of the evaluation, to check for compliance. Capsules were handed together with the brochure of the commercial product containing guaran&#x000e0;, to expose subjects to standard information provided when the product is normally purchased.</p><p>During the study, subjects were asked to abstain from alcoholic and caffeine-containing beverages, except for a maximum of 4 cups of coffee (italian &#x0201c;espresso&#x0201d;) per day, and to abstain also from coffee in the morning of the weekly testing session. No other dietary restrictions were imposed.</p></sec><sec><title>Psychological well-being (PWB) scales</title><p>The long form (84 questions) of the PWB scales developed by Carol D. Ryff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was used. The scales consist of series of statements reflecting the six areas of psychological well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Respondents rate statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement. Responses are totaled for each of the six categories (about half of the responses are reverse scored). For each category, a high score indicates that the respondent masters that area in life, while a low score shows that the respondent struggles to feel comfortable with that particular concept. PWB scales have been recently validated for use in the italian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS)</title><p>The SAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] was used to quantify the level of anxiety. The scale is a 20-item self-report assessment device including measures of state and trait anxiety. Respondent is asked to indicate how much each statement applies to her or him. Each question is scored on a Likert-type scale of 1&#x02013;4 (based on the following replies: &#x0201c;a little of the time,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;some of the time,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;good part of the time,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;most of the time&#x0201d;). Overall assessment is done by total score, after reverse scoring some of the responses. The total scores range from 20&#x02013;80: 20&#x02013;44 normal, 45&#x02013;59 mild to moderate anxiety, 60&#x02013;74 marked to severe anxiety, 75&#x02013;80 extreme anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Bond&#x02013;lader visual analogue scales (VAS)</title><p>The Bond&#x02013;Lader VAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], consisting of sixteen 100-mm visual analogue scales anchored by antonyms (e.g. Alert&#x02013;Drowsy, Lethargic&#x02013;Energetic, etc.), were used to assess subjective mood. The scales reflect three key mood factors: &#x0201c;alert&#x0201d; (alert-drowsy, attentive-dreamy, lethargic-energetic, muzzy-clearheaded, coordinated-clumsy, mentally slow-quick witted, strong-feeble, interested-bored, incompetent-proficient), &#x0201c;calm&#x0201d; (calm-excited, tense-relaxed) and &#x0201c;content&#x0201d; (contented-discontented, troubled-tranquil, happy-sad, antagonistic-friendly, withdrawn-sociable). Scores for each item represent the number of mm from the negative antonym. Item scores were summed and averaged to create total scores for each respective factor. Factor scores had a potential range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing highly alert, calm or content. A pen-and-paper version was used and participants were asked to mark each line between the antonyms indicating how they felt at the present time.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are presented as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD) with n indicating the number of observations. Statistical significance of the differences between sessions were evaluated by means of One-Way ANOVA for repeated measures with Tukey&#x02019;s correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance of the differences was also assessed according to gender and to the median score obtained for each scale after placebo, to test for any difference between lower- and higher-scoring subjects.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Mac (GraphPad Software). Sample size calculations could not be performed in advance, since there is no general consensus about the smallest average differences which would be scientifically important for each of the scales employed. The power of the study to detect the least hypothetical difference between the effects of guaran&#x000e0; and placebo was therefore determined for each test after completion of the study.
