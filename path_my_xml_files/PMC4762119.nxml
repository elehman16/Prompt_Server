The treatment is aimed at preventing and treating dehydration, promoting weight gain after rehydration, and reducing the duration and severity of diarrhoea. Effective and inexpensive interventions that could add to the effect of oral rehydration therapy are of interest. Recently, in many European countries, gelatine tannate is being widely marketed for treating acute gastroenteritis. Gelatine tannate is a complex of tannic acid, which possesses astringent and anti-inflammatory properties, and a protective gelatine. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of gelatine tannate for treating acute gastroenteritis in children and only scant evidence to support the use of gelatine tannate in adults. We aim to assess the efficacy of gelatine tannate for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This will be a blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. Children younger than 5&#x02005;years of age with acute gastroenteritis defined as a change in stool consistency to loose or liquid form (according to the Bristol Stool Form scale or Amsterdam Stool Form scale) and/or an increase in the frequency of evacuations (typically &#x02265;3 in 24&#x02005;h), lasting for no longer than 5&#x02005;days, will be recruited. A total of 158 children will be randomised to receive either gelatine tannate (children younger than 3&#x02005;years of age will receive 250&#x02005;mg, 4&#x02005;times/day, and those older than 3&#x02005;years of age will receive 500&#x02005;mg, 4&#x02005;times/day) or matching placebo for 5&#x02005;days.

Breast feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes, including milk. Considering the burden of acute gastroenteritis both to children and the healthcare system, effective and inexpensive interventions that could add to the effect of oral rehydration therapy are of interest. Currently, effective interventions that may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea include administration of specific probiotics such as <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG or <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>, diosmectite or racecadotril.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Recently, in many European countries, gelatine tannate is being marketed for treating acute gastroenteritis. Gelatine tannate consists of tannic acid suspended in a gelatine solution. Gelatine tannate has a stable structure both in the acidic environment of the stomach as well as in a basic and neutral environment such as in the small intestine and colon.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Little is known about the specific mechanisms by which gelatine tannate may act against gastrointestinal infection. It is known, however, that it forms a biofilm, which mechanically protects the gastrointestinal mucosa and causes precipitation of proinflammatory proteins such as mucoproteins in the intestinal mucosa.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, it inhibits the growth of bacteria such as <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> and in vitro mycobacterial <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> The action of anti-inflammatory tannate also involves blocking inflammatory agents in the gastrointestinal mucosa.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Only limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of gelatine tannate. In 2009, Esteban Carretero <italic>et al</italic> published a study (n=211, mean age 2.5&#x000b1;2.4&#x02005;years, no randomisation, no blinding, unbalanced baseline characteristics) that evaluated the effectiveness of gelatine tannate in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. Children received oral rehydration solution (ORS) alone or ORS in combination with gelatine tannate (dose was not specified). During the 12&#x02005;h observation period, a significant reduction in the number of loose stools was found in the group receiving ORS and gelatine tannate versus the group receiving ORS alone. Both groups had similar weight gains, stool consistency, comparative risks of diarrhoea with blood, peritonitis, and sepsis, vomiting intensity, and degrees of dehydration in the 12&#x02005;h of observation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In 2012, Allegrini and Costantini performed a blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in the adult population (n=40, mean age 43&#x000b1;13&#x02005;years). In the group receiving gelatine tannate (500&#x02005;mg, 6 times/day, for 2 consecutive days) compared with the placebo group, a statistically significant decrease in both the daily number of watery stools and severity of abdominal pain for the first 48&#x02005;h of the intervention was found. There were no clinically relevant adverse events.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>A 2014 systematic review evaluated the efficacy of gelatine tannate in treating acute gastroenteritis in children and adults.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The two studies aforementioned were included. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of gelatine tannate on the primary outcome measures for the review such as stool output, duration of diarrhoea, need for admission to the hospital, duration of hospital stay, and (in children) weight gain after rehydration. The review concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of gelatine tannate for treating acute gastroenteritis in children and only sparse evidence to support the use of gelatine tannate in adults.</p><p>Currently, the total evidence to support the use of gelatine tannate for treating acute gastroenteritis in children or adults is very limited. According to the current (2014) European guidelines,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> gelatine tannate is not recommended for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Trial objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The main objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and safety of gelatine tannate in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children.
