However, the events rate in the subsequent years tended to be lower in the abluminal biodegradable polymer group.</p><p>Other studies have also shown noninferiority of biodegradable polymer based DES for angiographic outcomes at 9 to 12 months follow-up. Our results corroborate with data from LEADERS,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> ISAR-TEST,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> CREATE,<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> EVOLVE,<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> and BIOFLOW trials.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> The results therefore confirm the efficacy of biodegradable polymer DESs against the first-generation permanent-polymer DES. The abluminal biodegradable polymer SES as compared with durable polymer SES tended to reduce annual cumulative rate of MACE, TVR, cardiac death, MI, and ST than durable polymer SES in 5 years follow-up. However, the differences were not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.05). Nevertheless, abluminal biodegradable polymer SES showed superiority in longer term safety, by reducing cumulative pursue rates of MACE, TVR, and ST in 5 years. Cordimax stent has polylactide-co-polyglycolide copolymer (75:25 ratio), which degrades into carbon dioxide and water after the drug (sirolimus) is released.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> These polymers and their degradation products are more biocompatible and less prone to hypersensitivity reactions. Although our study was not powered for clinical outcomes, our results are consistent with other studies and a meta-analysis suggesting better long-term outcomes with biodegradable polymer DES. <sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our study had relatively lower incidence of MACE, TVR, and ST in both groups.
