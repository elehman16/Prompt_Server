Fifty eyes of 50 POAG patients were divided into 3 groups based on preoperative IOP range. NPGS was done with polymethylmethacrylate implants made from haptics of intraocular lenses. All patients were followed up after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Preoperative IOP range was from 25.62 &#x000b1; 1.72 to 41.66 &#x000b1; 1.15 mmHg. Postoperative success was defined as IOP &#x0003c;21 mmHg at 1 month in the absence of additional antiglaucoma medication or other treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>A significant reduction in IOP was observed postsurgery in all three groups, changing from a preoperative mean of 25.62 &#x000b1; 1.72 mmHg, 34.38 &#x000b1; 2.27 mmHg, and 41.66 &#x000b1; 1.15 mmHg to a postoperative mean of 13.27 &#x000b1; 2.13 mmHg, 16.50 &#x000b1; 2.74 mmHg, and 17.66 &#x000b1; 1.52 mmHg, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) at 12 months. No significant difference was seen with change in position of the implant, i.e., convexity facing limbus or fornix. No intraoperative complications were observed. The main postoperative complication was failure of filtration in 1 case (3.44%) from Group 1, 5 cases (27.78%) from Group 2, and all 3 cases (100%) from Group 3 at 1 month postoperatively. Thus, 9 eyes (41%) required postoperative antiglaucoma medications following which the IOP was controlled.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>NPGS with Acry-C implants is a safe and cost-effective (&#x0003c;1 US dollar) procedure for control of IOP in POAG patients especially those with moderately elevated IOPs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acry C implants</kwd><kwd>cost-effective</kwd><kwd>noninvasive</kwd><kwd>self-engineered</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma, a serious sight-threatening optic neuropathy, is marked among ophthalmic disorders by the variability of its presentations and the variability of the array of treatment options available.

Superficial scleral flap &#x02013; 5 mm &#x000d7; 5 mm scleral flap of 40% depth is dissected up to clear cornea followed by a second 3 &#x000d7; 3 mm deep scleral flap of 90% depth of sclera using a crescent blade. At the level of the scleral spur, the Schlemm's canal is deroofed and a corneoscleral lake is formed to facilitate the diffusion of the aqueous humor. The deep scleral flap is excised along its base 0.5 mm anterior to Schwalbe's line to create the deep sclerectomy space. Scleral pockets are made on both lateral sides of the deep groove.</p><p>The Acry C plant is a nonabsorbable C-shaped implant which is made by cutting one of the haptics of the polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens regularly used for cataract surgery. Thus, a 3&#x02013;4 mm curved inert implant is created and can be directly placed in the scleral pockets for fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Superficial scleral flap and conjunctival flap are sutured using 10-0 nylon sutures.</p><p>The purpose of placing this implant in the deep scleral groove is to prevent the common complication of fibrosis to keep the space patent that often follows NPGS resulting in failure of filtration and ineffective control of IOP.</p><p>The implant is placed either with its convexity toward the fornix or the limbus, the position remaining constant, i.e. in the deep scleral groove. The implant does not need to be sutured to ensure it stays in the scleral pockets of the groove. In our study, 25 (50%) implants were placed with convexity toward the limbus and the rest were placed with convexity toward the fornix and the results compared.</p><p>All statistical analyses in this study were done using STEM and the statistical method used was the Chi-square test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> gives age-wise and sex-wise distribution of patients in all three groups along with direction of placement of implants.

Ravinet <italic>et al</italic>., 2004[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in their study diagnosed surgery-related complication including positive Seidel test, hyphema, choroidal detachment, and iris incarceration. Ates <italic>et al</italic>., 2001[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in their study showed no anterior segment complications, and as a complication, one case of self-limited shallow choroidal detachment was seen. Bonilla <italic>et al</italic>., 2012[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] noted the only intraoperative complication was the microperforation of trabeculodescemetic membrane in four patients. Drolsum 2003[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in their study noted that there were no complications related to hypotony or other significant complications. Thus, the safety of this procedure as compared to other similar procedures is evident.</p><p>Another very important consideration is the cost-effectiveness of the Acry C plant. Tan and Hitchings 2001[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] state that in deep sclerotomy, the adjunctive implant is priced at approximately &#x02264;120. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 2005[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have documented that cost of NPTS remains a serious concern. Guedes <italic>et al</italic>., 2011[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that cost of nonpenetrating deep sclerotomy cost between US $305.25 to US $390.09 depending on the severity of glaucoma.</p><p>Thus, in comparison to the above expenses, the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implant is considerably inexpensive since it has to be constructed from a PMMA lens which is freely available at low costs. The cost of the implant was estimated to be between Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 i.e., $1&#x02013;$2.</p><p>One other aspect the study considered was the position of the implant in the deep scleral groove, and no significant difference was seen in postoperative results based on whether the convexity of the implant was toward the limbus or the fornix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>NPGS with implant is an effective modality for control and maintenance of IOP in patients with POAG with its greatest efficacy being in patients with a preoperative IOP between 20 and 30 mmHg. With the exception of failure of filtration seen in few (9%) cases, no major complications were noted related either to the surgery or the implant. The procedure is thus cost-effective without a compromise in safety. However, further wider and long-term research in this area is required.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"
