A phase 2b program was designed to evaluate a broader dose range of ABT-126 as monotherapy in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. The program consisted of a double-blind, placebo and active controlled study of ABT-126 (dose range 25&#x02013;75 mg) and an open-label extension study (75 mg).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The randomized double-blind study enrolled 438 subjects (Mini-Mental Status Examination score of 10&#x02013;24, inclusive) not currently taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. Subjects received 24 weeks of ABT-126 25 mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;77), ABT-126 50 mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;108), ABT-126 75 mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;73), donepezil 10 mg QD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;76), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;104). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale&#x02014;Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) total score. Subjects completing the double-blind study could enroll in the 28-week open-label extension study. Adverse events (AEs) and other safety parameters were monitored in both studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 367 patients (83.8 %) completed the double-blind study and 349 (79.7 %) entered the open-label study. Compared with placebo, donepezil significantly improved ADAS-Cog 11-item total scores from baseline to week 24 (&#x02212;2.29&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.95; one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). No ABT-126 dose demonstrated a statistically significant improvement vs placebo at week 24 in the ADAS-Cog total score: ABT-126 25 mg, &#x02212;0.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.94 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.309); ABT-126 50 mg, &#x02212;0.87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.85 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.153); and ABT-126 75 mg, &#x02212;1.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.94 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.127). Rates of serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were similar across treatment groups. The most frequently reported AEs in both studies were constipation, fall, and headache. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in other parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the double-blind trial, donepezil significantly improved ADAS-Cog scores but no statistically significant improvement was seen with any ABT-126 dose.

The few available marketed products, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, provide transient and modest improvements in cognition. Even when disease-modifying treatments are available to slow the course of the degenerative process, a need will remain for symptomatic treatments for patients with mild-to-moderate dementia.</p><p>A novel approach to symptomatic treatment for AD is modulation of the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), acetylcholine-gated cation channels found in areas of the brain that are important for learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Activation of &#x003b1;7 nAChRs leads to an influx of calcium and activation of second messenger systems, and ultimately a release of a number of other neurotransmitters important for cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The mechanism of action of &#x003b1;7 nAChR agonists is expected to differ from marketed compounds such as AChEIs that inhibit the enzyme which degrades acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, resulting in an increased effect from acetylcholine at all receptor subtypes. By eliminating the dose-limiting toxicity associated with AChEIs acting at muscarinic and other nAChR subtypes that are not procognitive yet mediate untoward side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the efficacy and side-effect profiles of &#x003b1;7 nAChR agonists may differ from AChEIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several &#x003b1;7 nAChR partial agonists have shown potential in the treatment of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] but either the procognitive effects were not reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or the trials are currently on clinical hold, apparently due to safety concerns related to gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>ABT-126 is a potent &#x003b1;7 nAChR agonist that displayed high affinity (Ki&#x02009;=&#x02009;12&#x02013;14 nM) at human, rat, and mouse &#x003b1;7 nAChRs in nonclinical studies. The in-vitro selectivity profile of ABT-126 was evaluated in a battery of radioligand binding assays (Cerep, France) that contained representatives of G-protein-coupled receptors and ligand/voltage-sensitive ion channels. In these assays, ABT-126 10 &#x003bc;M showed little binding, with the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor. ABT-126 had a Ki value of 140 nM (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) at the 5-HT3 receptor, approximately 10-fold greater than the Ki value for displacement of &#x003b1;7 binding. In several animal models of cognition pertinent to AD, administration of ABT-126 resulted in signals of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABT-126 were evaluated in single-dose and multiple-dose phase 1 studies that included healthy adults, healthy older subjects, clinically stable subjects with schizophrenia, and subjects with AD. Doses up to 150 mg once daily (QD) or up to 40 mg twice a day were generally well tolerated (unpublished data).</p><p>In a previously completed randomized, double-blind, phase 2a proof-of-concept study, 274 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were treated for 12 weeks with 5 mg or 25 mg of ABT-126 QD, placebo, or donepezil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The change from baseline to the final evaluation in the 11-item Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale&#x02014;Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] total score was the primary endpoint. The ABT-126 25 mg dose showed some procognitive effect (ADAS-Cog least squares (LS) mean (standard error) difference from placebo &#x02212;1.19 (0.90); one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.095) which was numerically less effective than that seen with donepezil treatment (&#x02212;1.43 (0.90); one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057). The 5 mg dose of ABT-126 had an effect similar to placebo. There was no imbalance in adverse events (AEs) across treatment groups or other safety signals that would preclude further investigation.</p><p>A plateau of ABT-126 efficacy could not be characterized based on the exposure&#x02013;response analysis of the phase 2a study with a limited dose range of 5&#x02013;25 mg, suggesting that testing of higher ABT-126 doses was needed to definitively characterize the procognitive potential. Additional toxicology and phase 1 data enabled testing higher doses. Therefore, this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled phase 2b study was designed to evaluate a higher dose range of ABT-126 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg QD in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD.</p><p>An adaptive design was chosen to achieve study objectives using a smaller sample size than a more traditional parallel group design. The study consisted of two parts, each with its own objectives. The objective of Part 1 was to efficiently characterize the dose&#x02013;response relationship of ABT-126 using a response-adaptive randomization methodology. The objective of Part 2 was to provide additional safety data and efficacy data for less sensitive outcome measures (e.g., quality of life measurements) for the dose selected in Part 1. This efficient design had adequate power to characterize the dose&#x02013;response relationship on the primary outcome measures (ADAS-Cog) with a smaller sample size in Part 1. Results from the double-blind 24-week trial and its 28-week open-label extension study are reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were 55&#x02013;90 years of age and diagnosed with mild-to-moderate AD, defined as meeting National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD. Other key inclusion criteria were a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] score of 10&#x02013;24 (inclusive), a Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10, and a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] total score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;4 at screening.

Written informed consent was obtained from each subject and caregiver prior to study participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and treatment</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Double-blind study</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled phase 2b study conducted to evaluate a range of ABT-126 doses as monotherapy in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. The study consisted of two parts, each 24 weeks in duration with its own goals and randomization scheme. Part 1 of the study was designed to investigate the dose&#x02013;response relationship for three doses of ABT-126 on the primary endpoint, the 11-item ADAS-Cog total score. A donepezil arm was included in Part 1 to permit comparisons of treatment effects of ABT-126 with a positive control and, ultimately, to verify assay sensitivity of the design and conduct of the study. The selected dose from Part 1 was continued into Part 2 to provide additional safety and efficacy data on other less sensitive outcome measures.</p><p>In Part 1, subjects were randomized to placebo, ABT-126 25 mg, ABT-126 50 mg, ABT-126 75 mg, or donepezil, identical in appearance. The first 100 subjects were randomized with equal probability to the five treatment arms. Subsequently, the randomization ratio for the three ABT-126 dose groups changed using a response-adaptive randomization design in which interim efficacy data were utilized to change ABT-126 treatment allocation probabilities from the initial 1:1:1 to favor the more efficacious ABT-126 dose group(s). A detailed description of the adaptive randomization is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p><p>For Part 2, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) selected a dose for further evaluation based on the efficacy and safety profile displayed in Part 1. In Part 2 subjects were randomized 1:1 to the selected ABT-126 dose or placebo. This allowed for a larger sample size for the selected dose group and the placebo group to evaluate the effect on secondary measures such as the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC) and Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Cooperative Study&#x02014;Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) that were expected to have lower effect sizes than the ADAS-Cog. Part 2 randomization was to continue until 100 subjects (total from Parts 1 and 2) were randomized to the selected ABT-126 dose group. In both parts, subjects were assigned to treatment using an interactive voice response/interactive Web-based system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessments in the double-blind study</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Efficacy</title><p>In the double-blind study, baseline was defined as the last assessment taken on or before the day &#x02212;1 study visit.

In Part 2, 88 additional subjects were enrolled, 40 to ABT-126 50 mg and 48 to placebo, resulting in a total of 104 subjects in the placebo group and 108 in the 50 mg group.</p><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

A total of 183 subjects (52.4 %) completed the study and 166 subjects (47.6 %) discontinued the study prematurely&#x02014;129 discontinuations (77.7 %) were due to the termination of the study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thirteen subjects (3.7 %) discontinued prematurely due to an AE.</p><p>Participating in the open-label study were 210 females (60.2 %) and 139 males (39.8 %), with a mean age of 74.1 years; 90.0 % were white. The baseline mean (SD) MMSE total score was 19.7 (5.00). All subjects took at least one dose of ABT-126 75 mg. Twelve subjects (3.4 %) had decreased to ABT-126 50 mg QD, and one subject increased back to ABT-126 75 mg QD.</p><p>During the open-label study 167 subjects (47.9 %) reported at least one AE. The most frequently reported AEs were constipation (4.9 %), fall (4.3 %), headache (3.2 %), agitation (2.3 %), irritability (2.3 %), and nausea (2.0 %; Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Approximately 90 % of the AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity, and 18 subjects (10.8 %) experienced a severe AE. A total of 66 subjects (18.9 %) had an AE assessed by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug.</p><p>SAEs were experienced by 17 subjects (4.9 %). Convulsion (three subjects, 0.9 %) and femoral neck fracture (two subjects, 0.6 %) were the only SAEs reported by&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 subjects. One SAE of convulsion was considered as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug.</p><p>There were four deaths during the study: myocardial infarction (open-label extension day 172); advanced age (open-label extension day 7); cerebral infarction, brain edema, brain stem syndrome, and pulmonary edema (open-label extension day 40); and arterial thrombosis and gastrointestinal necrosis (open-label extension day 21). All events leading to the deaths were considered by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug. Similar to the double-blind study, no clinically significant trends were identified in laboratory results, vital signs, ECG findings, CSDD total scores, and C-SSRS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized double-blind trial of multiple doses of ABT-126, none of the ABT-126 groups had statistically significant improvement compared with placebo from baseline to week 24 on the ADAS-Cog 11-item total score. The ABT-126 50 mg and ABT-126 75 mg dose groups showed statistically significant improvements over placebo on the ADCS-ADL and CIBIC-Plus, respectively, but the improvement was numerically lower than that observed with donepezil. Similarly, some subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the ADAS-Cog (e.g., MMSE&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;19, age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;75), but in all cases the magnitude of the treatment effects observed was smaller than that observed with donepezil. Treatment with donepezil led to statistically significant improvements on the ADAS-Cog 11 item total score, the CIBIC-Plus, and the ADCS-ADL. The results observed for the donepezil group are consistent with previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and suggest that the design of the study and its conduct were sufficient to achieve assay sensitivity for these measures.</p><p>The discrepant efficacy results for the ABT-126 75 mg dose observed on the cognition measure and the secondary measures were unexpected. These results do not appear to be due to lack of assay sensitivity on the ADAS-Cog, since the donepezil group demonstrated an improvement consistent with previous trials, and suggests that the results for the ADCS-ADL and CIBIC-Plus do not constitute true signals of efficacy for ABT-126.</p><p>No serious safety signals were identified for ABT-126 monotherapy in subjects with mild-to-moderate AD in either the double-blind or extension studies. The overall rates of AEs and SAEs were similar across treatment groups in the double-blind study and led to few subjects discontinuing from the study. There were no consistent clinically meaningful changes in laboratory, vital sign, or ECG values in either study.</p><p>Constipation was the only AE that occurred in a statistically significant higher percentage of subjects treated with ABT-126 compared with placebo in the double-blind study (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019) and was reported in 17 subjects in the open-label study. Compared with placebo, a statistically significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with ABT-126 50 mg had gastrointestinal disorders considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033). This finding was likely influenced by AEs of constipation. The emergence of constipation as the most frequent AE in the double-blind study, occurring at an incidence that was statistically higher than placebo, is consistent with information reported by Forum Pharmaceuticals for their &#x003b1;7 agonist, encenicline, in mild-to-moderate AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because of structural similarities between the &#x003b1;7 nAChR subunit and the 5HT-3 receptor, &#x003b1;7 agonists can bind to the 5-HT3 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. ABT-126 shows a 10-fold higher affinity for &#x003b1;7 nAChR relative to the 5-HT3 receptor, whereas encenicline has approximately equal affinity for each receptor type, raising the possibility that off-target binding to the 5-HT3 receptor binding leads to constipation.</p><p>This study utilized a novel study design that consisted of an adaptive randomization to efficiently explore the dose&#x02013;response relationship across three doses of ABT-126 compared with placebo and donepezil (Part 1) and permitted additional exploration of the efficacy and safety of the selected dose compared with placebo (Part 2). If the study had been powered to evaluate each dose arm for both primary and secondary measures in a traditional parallel-group design, the sample size would have increased to at least 100 subjects per arm for a total of 500 subjects. The sample size savings in Part 1 of the trial with adaptive randomization are related to the slope of the dose&#x02013;response curve, with steeper slopes resulting in differential allocation to the selected dose and shallower slopes resulting in allocation that is roughly proportionate across dose groups. In this trial, the dose&#x02013;response relationship exhibited by ABT-126 did not result in disproportionate sample size allocation; thus, the potential sample size savings based on this feature were not recognized. In simulations of other types of dose&#x02013;response curves, such as no effect or an effect with ABT-126 75 mg that was much greater than placebo or the active control, a sample size saving of 227 or 150, respectively, could have been realized for the entire study compared with the parallel design with 500 subjects. In addition, had the decision been made not to proceed to Part 2 of the study, the total sample size could have been further reduced by 88 subjects. To our knowledge, this study is the first adaptive randomization design to include comparisons with both a placebo and an active control. Inclusion of an active control can be especially helpful for decision-making, because it allows the futility and success algorithms to stipulate decisions relative to each.</p><p>The decision to include adaptive design elements in a clinical trial needs to be made both with an evaluation of the potential benefits and an appreciation for the added complexity inherent in these trials. Designing the randomization scheme and implementing the Interactive Voice Response System takes longer for an adaptive trial than for conventional trial designs. Ongoing data cleaning, frequent interim evaluations and DMC meetings, and updates to the Interactive Voice Response System are some of the required activities. Overall, adaptive randomization is most valuable in dose&#x02013;response studies with a high number of dose arms. Potential advantages (such as a lower sample size) need to be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine suitability for a particular study.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that, consistent with clinical practice at the time of study execution, the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria were used for the diagnosis of AD in study subjects and there was no confirmation of the presence of cerebral amyloid. Based on neuropathological analysis of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and on recent clinical trial results showing that approximately 30 % of subjects selected with these criteria have negative positron emission tomography scans for amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we expect that some subjects in this trial would also be amyloid negative and would likely not have dementia due to AD. Subjects with other causes of cognitive impairment may not progress over time, contributing to a lack of decline in the placebo group and increasing the difficulty of eliciting a treatment response. In this trial, the placebo decline on the ADAS-Cog was larger in the moderate AD subgroup, likely reflecting both a higher percentage of subjects that are amyloid positive and a greater degree of sensitivity for the ADAS-Cog to detect changes in this subgroup, and it was this subgroup that demonstrated small but statistically significant treatment effects. Subgroup analyses investigating treatment effects by MMSE score, age, gender, country, and apolipoprotein E status were limited by the number of subjects included in each subgroup.</p><p>In parallel with execution of this monotherapy trial, a second trial investigating the efficacy and safety of ABT-126 as an add-on treatment to AChEIs was also conducted. In that trial, 25 mg or 75 mg ABT-126 failed to demonstrate statistically significant improvement relative to placebo. There was some evidence in that trial for a potential treatment effect in the subjects with mild AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This contrasts with the subgroup analysis presented here for the monotherapy trial where some evidence for efficacy was observed in the moderate AD subpopulation. Taken together, these data suggest that further exploration of efficacy in either of these subgroups is not warranted.</p><p>Overall, the data from the phase 2b program for ABT-126 as monotherapy or add-on therapy in mild-to-moderate AD do not support further development of this compound. With the two phase 3 studies of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR partial agonist encenicline (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01969123 and NCT01969136) being placed on clinical hold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the future development of other agents in this class is uncertain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ABT-126 did not result in statistically significant improvement in the primary measure of cognition at any dose. The results obtained with donepezil treatment indicate that the design and conduct of the study were sufficient to detect a meaningful treatment difference. Significant improvement in secondary measures of daily function and global improvement were seen with ABT-126 50 mg and ABT-126 75 mg, but the magnitude of the effect did not support further development of ABT-126 for the monotherapy treatment of mild-to-moderate AD. Overall there were no serious safety signals identified for ABT-126 in subjects with AD.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional files</title><p>
