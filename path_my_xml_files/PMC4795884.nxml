Pain perceived as arising in the arm caused by the irritation of cervical spinal nerves or its roots is considered as radicular pain and termed as radiculopathy, and 1 out of 1000 individuals suffer from cervical radiculopathy.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Radicular pain is commonly managed by pharmacologic management, physical therapy and rehabilitation measures, interventional techniques and surgical treatments. The gold slandered is that conservative management is more effective than surgical management.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Manual Physical Therapy is a part of conservative management and effective in managing pain, joint restrictions and disability, while applied in combination with therapeutic exercises.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the Cervical traction combined with exercise therapy has the additional effects in reducing pain, and function, while managing neck pain conservatively by manual physical therapy.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The soft cervical collar, rest for three to six weeks, physiotherapy accompanied by home exercises for six weeks is more beneficial in managing acute radicular pain as compared to wait and see strategy.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>It is also evident that Manual traction techniques combined with cervical mobilization improves pain and manages disability in patients with cervical radiculopathy as compared with mobilization alone.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Literature supports the effectiveness of traction techniques, but the effectiveness of different types of traction and parameters related to its applicability is still to be more elaborated by research. The current study was designed to determine the Effects of Mechanical versus Manual Traction combined with segmental mobilization and exercise therapy in of Patients with Cervical Radiculopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized control trial was conducted at department of physical therapy and rehabilitation, Rathore Hospital Faisalabad, from February to July 2015. Inclusion criteria were both male and female patients with cervical spine involvement, evident radicular symptoms, and age ranged between 20-70 years. Patients with history of trauma, neck pain without radiculopathy, aged less than 20 and more than 70 were excluded. The total of 72 patients with cervical radiculopathy were screened out as per the inclusion criteria, 42 were randomly selected and placed into two groups by toss and trial method, and only 36 patients completed the study, while 6 dropped out.

The outcomes were assessed by numeric Pain rating scale (NPRS) for pain and neck disability index (NDI) for function.

Mechanical traction was applied in supine position by manually adjusted mechanical traction equipment, with 10 second pull and 5 second rest for 10 minutes in single session in group A. The traction force was equal to 10-15% of body weight of each patient and calculated prior to intervention. Manual traction was applied in supine position at 25 degree neck flexion with 10 second pull and 5 second rest for 10 times in single session in group B. Followed C-3 to C-7 segments was mobilized by central posterior anterior (CPA) glide in prone position at and each glide was sustained by 5 seconds for 10 reputations per session in both groups. Active Range of motion, stretching and isometric strengthening home exercise program was advised to all patients in both groups. The outcomes of the study were assessed by NRS and NDI at the baseline, and after completion of 06 weeks exercise program at 3 days per week.

Statistical results of both the groups were significant (p-values less than 0.05), while clinically the mechanical traction shows added improvement in pain and function. The reason is probably the traction force managed by the traction machine is uniform throughout the session while the traction force applied manually is difficult to keep it uniform due fluctuations in muscle activity, which is natural.</p><p>Langevin and colleagues conducted a randomized control trial on compared the 2 Manual Therapy and Exercise Protocols for Cervical Radiculopathy. The objective was to compare a rehabilitation program with the idea to increase the size of the intervertebral foramen (IVF) of the involved nerve root to a rehabilitation program that doesn&#x02019;t include any specific techniques thought to increase the size of the IVF in patients presenting with cervical radiculopathy. The outcomes were assessed by NDI, shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, NPRS evaluated at baseline, at the end of the 4-week program (week 4), and 4 weeks later (week 8). They concluded that manual therapy techniques and therapeutic exercises are effective in reducing pain and functional limitations caused by cervical radiculopathy.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Fritz and colleagues carried out a randomized control trial with the title exercise only, exercise combined with mechanical traction, or exercise with over-door traction for patients with cervical radiculopathy, with or Without Consideration of Status on a Previously Described Sub grouping Rule. The objective was to investigate the effectiveness of cervical traction along with exercise for targeted subgroups of patients with neck pain. The outcomes were assessed by NDI at baseline 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. They concluded combination mechanical traction and exercise for patients with cervical radiculopathy enhance function and reduce pain.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Cleland and group conducted a case series on 11 patients and the objective was to examine the outcomes of a consecutive series of patients coming to physical therapy with cervical radiculopathy and managed with the use of manual physical therapy techniques, cervical traction, and strengthening exercises program. The outcomes were measured by NPRS, NDI, Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and global rating of change (GROC) at the time of discharge from therapy and at a 6-month follow-up session.
