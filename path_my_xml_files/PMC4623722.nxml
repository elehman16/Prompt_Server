neuropathy configure the main complications of the lower limbs<sup>(1-2)</sup>. These
changes along with the decrease of tissue elasticity and reduction in the range of joint
motion during step may lead to an increase in the concentration of distribution of body
weight in some regions of plantar surface of foot <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>Accordingly, these three clinical conditions - peripheral arteriopathy, peripheral
neuropathy and increased foot plantar pressure - together, may result in skin breakdown
and development of injuries <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The plantar changes
should, therefore, be target of care by health professionals, either to prevent possible
injuries, or to control those already existing <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>The nurses, as result of their constant interaction with the diseased population, plays
a key role at various healthcare levels <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Besides
being responsible for care providing, the nurse operates in the identification and
monitoring of people with diabetes, as well as controlling disease complications <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>During the nursing consultation of the person with type 2 diabetes mellitus, presence of
skin changes and hair distribution, circulation changes, decreased sensitivity and
temperature of plantar surface of foot, as well as evaluation of previous history of the
disease must be investigated <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. At the same time,
the nurse needs to implement actions aiming to humanize care and that are effective for
improving the condition of feet <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>In this trend, the complementary and integrative practices emerge as strategies for the
promotion, prevention, treatment and recovery of health <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Among these therapies, foot reflexology stands out as a method that, by
means of pressure on specific points in the feet, aims to stimulate the body's balance
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>In Brazil, the therapy of reflex points became widely known in 1996, when Elizabeth
Graham, a South African reflexologist, taught a course on reflexology for nurses and
nursing teaching staff <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. From that moment, even
though in an incipient way, studies on foot reflexology in nursing started and, although
the use of this therapy in healthcare is still recent, the research findings indicate
that it could be used to improve assistance <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>According to the reflex theory, organs, glands and other parts of the body are linked to
specific points in the hands and feet <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The
therapy provision in the hands, besides allowing the self-administration, can be
performed in any place and position, since physical and mental comfort are ensured <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. It is argued, however, that this method should be
performed preferably on the feet, receiving the designation of foot
reflexology<sup>(6.8)</sup>, since in the feet, reflexes are stimulated naturally by
staying a long time under the pressure of the body weight and, because this region is
better protected, becoming more sensitive to stimuli <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>The location of the reflex points in the plantar region, in general, reproduces the
human anatomy <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The top of the hallux corresponds
to the head region. Along the medial border of the foot it is represented the spine.
Similarly, the right foot corresponds to the right side of the body and the left foot to
the left side <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>Because it aims the body's balance, it is believed that the therapy acts by pressure on
the corresponding reflex area, stimulating it when it is hypoactive and calming it when
it is hyperactive<sup>(9-10)</sup>. Thus, the foot reflexology may have implications in
various clinical conditions. It is necessary, however, scientific evidence certifying
the use of the method in healthcare <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>Based on the increasing impairment of the lower limbs and because type 2 diabetes
mellitus is considered one of the major epidemics of the 21st century, it is observed
the need to seek therapies that may be used in care and improvement of life quality of
people with this disease <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Therefore, the aim
of this study was to evaluate the effect of foot reflexology on feet impairment of
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled and blind clinical trial <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. The target population consisted of people diagnosed with type 2
diabetes mellitus, for at least five years, aged 18 years or more, and registered in the
System of Registration and Monitoring of Hypertensive Diabetics of two primary
healthcare services of a municipality in the southern region of the state of Minas
Gerais. As exclusion criteria, it was considered: presence of ulcers in the feet;
amputations of the lower limbs; uncontrolled systemic arterial hypertension; thrombosis;
deficits in cognitive abilities; and previous treatment using reflexology.</p><p>For the calculation of the sample size, a pilot test was conducted with 12 volunteers
who met the eligibility criteria. For this, it was used the statistical software
GPower(r) 3.0.10 <italic>(Franz Faut, Universit&#x000e4;t Kiel Germany, 2008)</italic>, with a
power effect of 0.80 and effect size of 0.68 (&#x003b1;=0.05) and, in this way, it was found
that it would be necessary the allocation of 26 participants in each group.</p><p>Accordingly, an active search was carried out at primary care services that have
integrated the study and it was found that 214 people who were enrolled in the System of
Registration and Monitoring of Hypertensive Diabetics had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, for at least five years. Of these, 161 had at least one exclusion criterion.
Thus, 53 people who met the proposed eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in
the study integrate the research. Participants were stratified according to age group
(18-40 years old, 4164 years old and 65 years old or more), gender (male and female) and
time since the diagnosis of diabetes (from five to 12 years, from 13 to 19 years and 20
years or more); then they were randomized into two groups: Treated and Control.</p><p>The Treated Group consisted of 26 participants who received guidelines on foot self-care
and 12 sessions of foot reflexology, while the Control Group had 27 participants who
received guidelines on selfcare feet. During follow-up, five participants from the
Treated Group and three from the Control Group gave up of participating in the research.
Consequently, at the end of the study, data from 45 patients were analyzed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart Consort. Alfenas, MG, Brazil, 2014.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0104-1169-rlae-23-04-00603-gf01"/></fig>
</p><p>To ensure the blinding, the study included an interventionist enabled for application of
foot reflexology and a trained evaluator to carry out the analysis of the feet. The
evaluator did not know to which group each participant belonged.</p><p>There were three analyzes of feet impairment: initial evaluation, before any
intervention, 2nd assessment, after the sixth session of foot reflexology, and 3rd
evaluation, after the twelfth session. In order to monitor the environment for the
procedures standardization, the analysis was performed at a specific place.</p><p>For the evaluations, it was applied the instrument for assessing tissue integrity of the
feet of people with diabetes mellitus. This instrument allows the analysis isolated of
feet impairment from indicators related to skin and hair, blood circulation, tissue
sensitivity and temperature and, according to its authors, it was validated by seven
expert nurses, showing an excellent concordance level <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The scores range from "1", which qualifies feet as extremely impaired, to
"5", when there is no impairment.</p><p>To examine skin and hair, the evaluator paid attention to the presence of tissue damage,
hair growth on the skin/hairiness, elasticity/turgor, hydration, perspiration, texture,
thickness, color, color after lifting the lower limbs to 30 centimeters height and
pigmentation. The blood circulation was evaluated by observing the tissue perfusion,
tibial and pedal pulses, and presence of edema and varicose veins. To evaluate the
sensitivity, the Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom Score was applied to investigate the
presence of neuropathic symptoms, followed by the 10-g monofilament test, which is
considered a suitable survey to assess tactile sensitivity of people with diabetes
mellitus<sup>(4,14)</sup>. The tissue temperature of the plantar region was measured
using a surface thermometer.</p><p>All participants received, after the initial assessment performed at their homes,
guidelines on feet self-care, disclosed in the Primary Care Notebook: Diabetes </p><p>Mellitus <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>The tested intervention, foot reflexology, was implemented at the homes of participants
of the Treated Group, since locomotion to a specific location could cause dropouts.
Three therapy sessions a week were performed, totaling 12 sessions over a period of 30
days. These occurred in a systematic way and with previous scheduling, keeping fixed
days and hours, in an attempt to reduce possible interference of daily living
habits.</p><p>The application of foot reflexology followed the assumptions of Eunice Ingham, the first
reflexologist to map the feet regarding the points which had effects on the rest of the
body <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. According to Ingham, the pressure on
reflex points can be applied in any environment, since it offers convenience <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Accordingly, in this study, it was decided to
perform the therapy in the bed of the participants, positioned supine.</p><p>There is no sequence to be followed for the application of foot reflexology, but no
reflection point can be forgotten, since the goal is to balance the entire body by
stimulating the areas that correspond to the human body <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, in order to maintain uniformity and standardization of the
technique, the left foot was massaged first and then the right one and an order of
pressure points has been established, first the points located on the toes, then the
points located in the lateral and medial portions and, finally, in the plantar surface
of feet.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the collected data was carried out using the R software,
version 2.15.3 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. For the analysis, it was used
the tests: Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney test and regression
analyzes, considering a significance level of 5% (P value &#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>This study is part of a wider project, which was registered in the Brazilian Registry of
Clinical Trials (RBR8zk8sz) and has been previously approved by the Ethics Committee
(CAAE: 07183512.1.00005142). Before data collection, all participants signed an Informed
Consent Form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>It was found that in the Treated Group, 65% of participants were female with an average
age of 63 years old, average weight of 73.2 kg and average height of 1.63 meters. In the
Control Group, 62% were women, whose average age was 60 years old, average weight of </p><p>76.6 kg and average height of 1.62 meters. Regarding these variables and those related
to race, marital status, education, occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical
activity, presence of other chronic disease or presence of acute disease and type of
treatment for diabetes mellitus, significant differences were observed between the
groups.</p><p>When assessing feet impairment, both indicators related to skin and hair, as well as
blood circulation, tissue sensitivity and temperature, it was observed that initially
(before any intervention), participants of the Treated Group and Control Group showed
similar impairment scores. However, after the implemented interventions, participants
who received reflexology exhibited behavior different of the participants in the Control
Group, with better scores in some indicators related to skin and hair.</p><p>Regarding the hair growth/hairiness, elasticity/ turgor, hydration, perspiration,
texture and integrity of the skin/skin peeling, six sessions of foot reflexology were
enough to improve significantly the impairment scores of participants who integrated the
Treated Group, and this condition was maintained throughout the study. Therefore, it was
inferred that in relation to these indicators, the Treated Group showed an increased
chance of unchanged results (score "5" of impairment) over time, while in the Control
Group this result was not observed ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table
1</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the indicators of feet impairment related to blood circulation, Treated
Group and Control Group remained, in the three assessments, with an average score of
"4", slightly impaired, with no significant difference between the groups throughout the
study ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>By verifying the effect of foot reflexology in the indicators related to sensitivity,
both Treated Group and Control Group had an average score of "3" at the beginning of the
research, and feet were qualified with moderate impairment. Although participants showed
a score increase throughout the study, there were no significant differences between
participants of Treated Group and Control Group ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table
3</xref>).</p><p>However, in the analysis of tissue temperature, all participants had feet qualified as
extremely impaired, with an average score of "1", and with no significant difference
between groups ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>). During the data
collection period, there were no changes, since the groups continued to show the same
impairment score for this indicator. </p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion </title><p>In this study, by evaluating the effects of foot reflexology on feet impairment of
people with diabetes mellitus, it was noted that the therapy had no effect in some
indicators of feet impairment related to skin and hair, considering a significance level
of 5 % (P value&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Some researchers state that cutaneous stimulation can contribute for the balance of the
body, either at physiological or metabolic level<sup>(16-17)</sup>. Accordingly, by
exerting some pressure on the tissue surface, it is possible to trigger systemic
reactions <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have shown the effect of the pressure on reflex points in heart rate,
blood pressure and reduction of pain and anxiety<sup>(18-22)</sup>. However, no evidence
proving the implications of foot reflexology in the feet of healthy people and those
with chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, were found in the scientific
literature.</p><p>It is known that cutaneous stimulation, when exerted in the plantar surface, stimulates
limbs vascularization and provides oxygen to the cells responsible for keeping the skin
moist, hydrated, with coloring, hairiness, texture and eutrophic
thickness<sup>(16,23)</sup>, which explains the effect, in this study, of reflex
therapy in some indicators related to skin and hair. Associated to this, it is believed
that foot massage contributes to venous return and cooperates with the excretion of
toxins present in the blood by stimulating the lymphatic system <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>However, so that changes occur at certain skin characteristics such as thickness, it is
necessary the regeneration of the cells that make up the epidermis <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>and, since this process is controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic
factors such as collagen density of the body, exposure to sunlight and daily living
habits, generally, it may take days or months <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.
Thus, it is clear that 12 sessions of foot reflexology implemented over a period of 30
days were insufficient to produce an effect on skin thickness.</p><p>The blood circulation, one of the responsible for pigmentation and temperature of the
body surface, depends on a number of factors so that the blood transportation is
possible <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Heart, arteries, arterioles, venules
and veins must be anatomically and physiologically preserved so that the perfusion of
peripheral tissues occurs effectively <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In this
way, the systemic circulation should be target of evaluation making possible to adjust
the duration and the amount of therapy sessions implemented according to the
cardiovascular condition <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. In this study,
however, there was no evaluation of the cardiac function at a systemic level. Since the
person with diabetes is more prone to development of cardiovascular disorders <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, it was found that the number of therapy sessions
were insufficient to intervene in the systemic circulation, and thus be effective in the
indicators of feet impairment related to color, pigmentation, blood circulation and
tissue temperature of feet.</p><p>After years of diabetes mellitus finding, peripheral, motor and autonomous nervous
system, are commonly affected, either alone or diffusely, causing irreversible
neurological changes <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The majority of
participants in this study reported diagnosis of diabetes for 10 years and in such
cases, it is believed that there was an </p><p>increase of peripheral nerve damage<sup>(1,3)</sup>. Therefore, the lack of effects of
foot reflexology on the indicator related to sensitivity of the feet is justified by the
fact that possibly the participants already had some impairment of sensory innervation
of the plantar surface and the therapy could not work repairing this sensitivity,
because it is an unrecoverable complication <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>It is known that thermal regulation is mediated by blood vessels and peripheral nerves,
with influence of internal and external factors <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Hence, the impairment of the blood circulation and sensitivity in the
feet of the participants explains the low tissue temperature in Treated Group and
Control Group.</p><p>In this study, the number of sessions of foot reflexology as well as the absence of
daily follow up of factors influencing blood circulation, tissue sensitivity and
temperature were considered as a limitation of the research. Thus, it is noteworthy that
in order to verify the implications of the intervention on these indicators, conduction
of studies providing a larger number of sessions of the tested therapy would be
necessary. It is also recommended conducting research with a larger sample, which allows
the detection of small differences between Treated Group and Control Group.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, either as coadjutant to conventional treatment or as
first-line therapy, when inserted in nursing care, foot reflexology can contribute to
improving the scores of some indicators of feet impairment of people with diabetes
mellitus.</p><p>In this context, to provide legal support to nurses in the execution of integrative
practices, such as reflexology, the Federal Nursing Council supported the Regulatory
Opinion number 004/95, which consolidates the integrative therapies as a specialty
and/or qualification of nurses <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study participants who received foot reflexology showed better scores in a few
indicators of feet impairment related to skin and hair, when compared to Control Group.
In this respect, it was verified improvement in hair growth/hairiness,
elasticity/turgor, hydration, perspiration, texture and integrity of the skin/skin
peeling. In the other indicators related to skin and hair and those related to blood
flow and tissue temperature, however, no significant differences were observed between
groups. </p><p>Accordingly, in this study, it was observed that reflex therapy showed some beneficial
effect, making it a viable practice that deserves investment. Therefore, studies are
needed to ensure and certify the application of foot reflexology in feet impairment of
people with diabetes mellitus, ensuring their use in nursing care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from master's thesis "Effects of reflexology no commitment of feet of
