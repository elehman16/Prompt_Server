In recent years, due to a wide use of antibiotics, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, as well as the promotion of mechanical ventilation therapy with artificial airway and the prolongation of critical patients hospitalization and survival duration, the incidence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia has increased significantly. In order to observe a potential therapeutic effect of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia in children and to seek the effective treatment, we analyzed 27 cases of children with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia diagnosed by bacteriology.

In recent years, the epidemiological features of PA infection have prominently shown in two aspects. Firstly, a nosocomial infection, particularly as incidence of lung infections is continuously increasing. There are number of large-scale epidemiological surveys, the most representative of which is the &#x0201c;Chinese CHINET Surveillance of bacterial resistance&#x0201d; showing the seriousness of PA infection in China. Statistics have shown that in 2012, the PA isolation rate in the comprehensive teaching hospitals accounted for the first five among all isolation rates [<xref rid="b2-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The result of the Chinese hospital-acquired bacterial resistance analysis (CARES), for which 13 teaching hospitals have participated, has shown that in 2009 and 2011, PA also ranked No. 4 among all isolated bacteria [<xref rid="b3-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The national nosocomial infection research data of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown that the incidence of PA pneumonia has been increasing year by year [<xref rid="b4-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Secondly, the high resistance rate of PA remains. Global antimicrobial resistance monitoring data (SENTRY) has ranked PA in the top of few among the hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) pathogens, while resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobial drugs has been increasing year by year [<xref rid="b5-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PA is one of the most common multidrug-resistant (MDR) and potentially drug-resistant (PDR) pathogens, of which the resistance mechanism involves many aspects [<xref rid="b6-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]: (1) producing inactivated enzyme (2) membrane permeability decreasing (3) target changing (4) bacterial biofilm formation and (5) other resistance mechanisms. In a clinic, a treatment of PA lower respiratory tract infection is facing more and more difficulties, especially in children. The results of this study has shown that when macrolide antibiotic were used in a combination with cefoperazone/sulbactam in the treatment of children with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia, clinical efficiency was significantly higher than that of the control group with statistical significance. There are only limited reports in literature showing the use of macrolide antibiotic in a treatment of children with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia. Another clinical study of treatment of extensive burns with PDRPA infections has displayed that [<xref rid="b7-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] macrolide antibiotics combined with &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor antibiotics can effectively control this infection. An application of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia in children can be considered as a potential therapeutic method for the resistance mechanisms of PA. Bacterium attaches to an inert surface, then reproduces and secretes polysaccharide matrix and fiber protein complexes, which adhere and wrap the bacteria to form the membrane-like material that refers to the biofilm. Bacteria can survive through the form of biofilms to evade cytotoxicity of immune and antimicrobial drugs. Currently, what is more recognized is that 14-membered and 15-membered ring macrolide antibiotics (although have no antagonism against PA) can inhibit a formation of biofilm, while regulate immunity and enhance phagocytes. Among these macrolide antibiotics, the red ADM, clarithromycin, azithromycin and roxithromycin can effectively inhibit the formation of biofilm, which can be used together with the anti-PA drug to treat the PA biofilm-related infections. The 16-membered ring macrolide antibiotics such as midecamycin, josamycin, acetyl spiramycin are invalid for the biofilm formation. In addition to 14-membered and 15-membered ring macrolide antibiotics, quinolones also play a certain role in inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation, however, due to the fact that fluoroquinolones may affect cartilage development, they have only little clinical use in children [<xref rid="b8-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The results of this study showed that, although bacterial clearance rate of the observation group was higher than that of the control group, it was not statistically significant. This may suggest, that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could not be cleared easily. Moreover our results suggest that a goal of clinical treatment should be to improve clinical performance and should not take the PA&#x02019;s clearance as a sign to discontinue antimicrobial agents. In addition, there are reports in a literature [<xref rid="b9-med-2015-0082" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showing that macrolide antibiotics were used in patients with chronic lung disease, such as bronchiectasis, congenital bronchial lung cysts, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diffuse pan-bronchiolitis.. The clinical efficacy of long course of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections was satisfactory and bacterial clearance rate was high, of which the efficacy and bacterial eradication rate of six months were higher. As for pediatric clinics, long course of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections needs to be further explored. The results of this study showed that adverse reaction rate of the observation group was slightly higher than that of the control group, but it was not statistically significant. The adverse reactions of the observation group were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, which may be related to the gastrointestinal reactions of macrolide antibiotics in children. The adverse reactions disappeared with an increase of adjuvant treatment. In summary, these studies suggest that, a combination of macrolide antibiotics with cefoperazone/sulbactam in the treatment of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia in children can be an effective and safe clinical method.</p></sec><sec><title>5 Conclusions</title><p>The combined application with macrolide antibiotics to treat <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> pneumonia in children can be considered as a more effective clinical method.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the earmarked fund (CARS-22-ZJ0504) from
