However, there is little research into the most effective and acceptable ways of helping women manage their symptoms of anxiety and stress during pregnancy. Research indicates the necessity to consider the unique needs and concerns of perinatal populations to ensure treatment engagement, highlighting the need to develop specialised treatments which could be integrated within routine antenatal healthcare services. This trial aims to develop a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, with a focus on embedding the delivery of the treatment within routine antenatal care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a two-phase feasibility trial. In phase 1 we will develop and pilot a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, blended with group support, to be led by midwives. This intervention will draw on cognitive behavioural principles and wider learning from existing interventions that have been used to reduce anxiety in expectant mothers. The intervention will then be tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial in phase 2. The following outcomes will be assessed: (1) number of participants meeting eligibility criteria, (2) number of participants consenting to the study, (3) number of participants randomised, (4) number of sessions completed by those in the intervention arm, and (5) number of participants completing the post-intervention outcome measures. Secondary outcomes comprise: detailed feedback on acceptability, which will guide further development of the intervention; and outcome data on symptoms of maternal and paternal anxiety and depression, maternal quality of life, quality of couple relationship, mother-child bonding, infant temperament and infant sleep.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide important data to inform the design of a future full-scale randomised controlled trial of a brief intervention for anxiety during pregnancy. This will include information on its acceptability and feasibility regarding implementation within current antenatal services, which will inform whether ultimately this provision could be rolled out widely in healthcare settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN95282830">ISRCTN95282830</ext-link>.

Furthermore, antenatal anxiety is a strong predictor of postnatal anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is now a substantial body of evidence from observational cohort studies demonstrating that elevated anxiety in mothers during pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of a range of short- and long-term adverse outcomes in their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and poorer obstetric outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These include higher rates of preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and effects on child outcomes such as difficult temperament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], increased sleep problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], poorer cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and higher rates of emotional and behavioural problems in early childhood that often persist into later development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>National guidelines in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the United States of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] have recently stressed the crucial importance of identifying and offering treatment for antenatal anxiety and depression. These guidelines have recommended screening for all women as a routine part of antenatal care, along with timely access to appropriate services for assessment and psychological intervention in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These recommendations were made despite the lack of evidence to guide the direction of treatment for women who have anxiety during pregnancy and the absence of systematic research examining the impact of treating antenatal anxiety on maternal and infant outcomes. This missing link is critical, as the potential opportunity for preventive intervention is large, given the substantial neural, cognitive and socio-emotional developments that occur in the fetal period and the first years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and potential for recurrent problems in the mother.</p><p>It is, therefore, crucial that effective and cost-effective treatments are developed for antenatal anxiety. Recent research strongly suggests that perinatal populations have unique concerns, and that considering the specific needs of perinatal populations is essential to ensure treatment engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Any treatment for antenatal anxiety must, therefore, be acceptable and relevant to pregnant women, addressing their specific anxieties and unique circumstances and needs during this period. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been subject to rigorous evaluation and has a strong evidence base for the effective treatment of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], including in a guided self-help format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but a specific literature investigating the utility of CBT approaches for treating anxiety during pregnancy is largely lacking at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. One of very few interventions that have been further developed and evaluated for antenatal mood difficulties is <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This is a guided self-help intervention designed to help expectant parents prepare for parenthood, which has been developed by Milgrom, Ericksen and colleagues in Australia. This has been tested in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and showed promising results, with significant reductions in symptoms of both anxiety and depression at postnatal follow-up compared to routine care.</p><p>Recent research has also highlighted the impact that partners have on child development and family functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and the importance of social support during pregnancy, since this is associated with lower maternal antenatal and postnatal depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. More recent policy documents have indicated that pregnancy is an important opportunity to engage partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and have recommended the inclusion of fathers in care and intervention from the antenatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], suggesting that interventions for maternal mental health in the perinatal period should also consider the potential inclusion of partners.</p><p>The advantages of intervening in the antenatal period to reduce maternal anxiety are threefold: first, the psychological treatment is delivered in a context in which mothers are already experiencing a high level of contact with healthcare services and frequently attend routine antenatal classes; second, antenatal treatment could reduce the possible negative effects of antenatal anxiety on fetal development; and third, given the associations between antenatal anxiety and postnatal depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], antenatal intervention offers the potential to prevent some episodes of postnatal depression and anxiety and so to improve maternal wellbeing, as well as reduce the developmental risk to the child of exposure to maternal postnatal depression and anxiety.</p><p>Our research proposes the development and testing of an intervention tailored specifically for use with pregnant women experiencing antenatal anxiety, based on CBT principles and incorporating key learning from the <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic> team, for use in a group format led by midwives, in the context of UK antenatal services. Embedding the intervention in routine antenatal care in a brief midwife-led group format means that it has the potential to be a cost-effective mode of delivery and one that is robust to changing healthcare environments, requiring less time and input from midwives than an individual psychological approach and being widely available to women experiencing difficulties with anxiety. It therefore has the potential to improve outcomes for a wide range of pregnant women and their infants, thereby reducing the overall population burden of anxiety during pregnancy. Given the existing national guidelines, the results of the proposed trial could be crucial in informing the development of clinical services.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>Following the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing and testing complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a midwife-led group intervention to reduce levels of anxiety in pregnant women. The objective of phase 1 is to develop an intervention, based on the principles outlined above, for use in the UK in a group setting led by midwives. The objective of phase 2 is to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the group intervention with treatment as usual. Outcomes will assess: the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and data collection methods; the acceptability of intervention materials and delivery; likely recruitment and retention rates; and estimates of the range of effect sizes. We will use this information to inform a fully powered RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study consists of two phases. Phase 1 is a development stage in which a brief intervention for anxiety will be developed, adapted for pregnancy, drawing on core CBT principles and learning from the team that developed the <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic> intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We will develop an intervention for delivery in group format, to be led by midwives and embedded into antenatal care in the UK. In an initial pilot group we will gather detailed feedback about the intervention content and delivery, and will use this information to inform further treatment adaptations. A mixed-methodology design will be used. If a manualised intervention can be successfully developed and delivered to a pilot group in a way that is acceptable to them, and/or modified to take any key suggestions and concerns into account, we will continue to phase 2.</p><p>In phase 2, we will conduct a pilot RCT comparing the group intervention for antenatal anxiety (intervention group) with treatment as usual (control group). This protocol follows Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) guidelines for reporting clinical trial protocols.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>Participants will be recruited through UK National Health Service (NHS) antenatal scanning clinics at their 12-week scan in London and the South West of England. The intervention will be delivered to participants in these locations as a part of antenatal services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant inclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible participants will be pregnant women who have not had any children, entering their second trimester, aged 18 and over. Women will be invited to participate if they score in the top quartile of scores on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] at screening. The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report screening measure for anxiety symptoms, which is widely-used in clinical practice and research.</p><p>Partners of women who consent to take part in the study will also be invited to participate. Fully informed consent will be obtained from potential participants for each stage of the research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant exclusion criteria</title><p>Potential participants will be excluded if: they have insufficient understanding of English to complete the intervention or outcome measures; they have a significant illness or disability that would make it difficult for them to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment procedure</title><p>After completing the screening questionnaire for anxiety (GAD-7; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) and a small number of demographic questions in the antenatal scanning clinic, women who meet eligibility criteria will be sent information on the full study and a consent form. A researcher will follow up with a phone call and, if the individual is willing to take part, will guide them through the consent form. The participant will be directed to send back the signed consent form via mail or online, after which the researcher will provide the participant with the option to complete the baseline questionnaires via mail or online. Upon completion and receipt of the baseline measures, participants will be randomised (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Women&#x02019;s partners who agree to participate in the study will be consented separately.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram of progress through the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1274_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>All participants will be offered a &#x000a3;10 voucher at three time points in the study as an expression of gratitude for their participation and will be reimbursed any travel expenses incurred.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation</title><p>In phase 2, participants will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to either the intervention group or the treatment as usual group using a sealed envelope method, managed by a staff member in a separate research group. Participants will be informed of their group allocation by a researcher over the telephone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size</title><p>In line with guidelines for pilot RCTs, no formal power calculation has been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A sample size of 30 participants per arm is recommended for feasibility studies as providing sufficient data to gain an accurate estimation of the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and to provide a reasonable range of estimates of the sample size required for a definitive RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Thus, 30 participants will receive the intervention (in four groups of approximately 7&#x02013;8 participants each, plus participants&#x02019; partners where possible) and 30 will receive treatment as usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention</title><p>The research will adapt and build on existing interventions utilising CBT principles. One such intervention, <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic>, is a workbook-based, psychoeducational intervention that focuses on making the transition into parenthood and on the emotional, social and psychological issues that can arise during pregnancy and early parenthood. The <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic> intervention aims to help expectant parents develop effective coping and parenting skills. In addition, it provides specific information about anxiety, stress and mood problems and incorporates fundamental elements of CBT, which addresses maladaptive cognitions and behaviours. In a clinical trial in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] it was shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.58), stress (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.59) and depression (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) in women at postnatal follow-up. The workbook incorporates nine sections and women in the Australian trial additionally received weekly telephone support from trained psychologists or postgraduate psychology trainees.</p><p>The planned intervention will be developed for optimal efficacy, feasibility and acceptability with a broad population of pregnant women experiencing a range of anxiety symptoms of differing severity, with the aim of reducing the overall population burden of antenatal anxiety.</p><p>The proposed format will be a manualised brief intervention, blended with group support. We plan to deliver three group sessions in the antenatal period, led by a trained midwife and psychology supporter, with each session lasting approximately 90&#x000a0;minutes. Sessions will be held at 3-week intervals, which is designed to maintain participant engagement but also allow participants enough time to try out practical strategies between sessions. As a further measure to support participants and maintain engagement, the midwife and psychologist delivering the groups will also send a weekly email to each participant to remind them to practise the skills from the previous group session and to ask whether they have any questions about the material. This can be stepped up to a telephone call if there is no response from a participant or if a telephone call is requested by the participant. Telephone calls will be limited to a maximum of 15&#x000a0;minutes in length, unless clinical imperative dictates otherwise.</p><p>The three group sessions are designed to address specific antenatal anxieties, and will support participants in developing key practical skills. A group mode of delivery has strong potential to be more cost-effective and sustainable and less time-consuming for midwives than individual support, and will also enable mutual support and interaction between group members, thereby fitting well with the existing models of antenatal care. Furthermore, it could be easily integrated into current routine NHS antenatal services and would, therefore, be widely available and accessible to a broad range of pregnant women. The specific parameters of the intervention and its delivery will be finalised in light of the pilot work undertaken in phase 1 of the research programme, but the aim is to base the three group sessions on a number of key themes, including psychoeducation on anxiety during pregnancy, problem-solving, communication and other strategies and techniques to help with managing anxiety and stress including self-care and compassion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Focus of midwife-led group support sessions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1274_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>In the first two sessions, participants will be split into separate groups for part of the session: one group for pregnant women and the other for partners. This will allow pregnant women to work on specific skills to help with their anxiety, whilst partners will work on skills and approaches to support their pregnant partner. The remainder of each session, and the entire third session, will be delivered to the group as a whole, to allow couples to develop coping strategies together. At the end of the three group sessions support moves to be more self-led and participants will be given the full <italic>Towards Parenthood</italic> workbook to work through. There will also be a follow-up session for participants at approximately 8&#x000a0;weeks postnatally. This will be an informal session which will give participants a chance to meet again and to check in with the midwives.</p><p>All women in the intervention arm will continue to receive their usual care during pregnancy, and will have access to the usually available range of interventions for antenatal anxiety and other physical and mental health problems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control: treatment as usual</title><p>Women randomised to the control group will continue to receive their usual care for antenatal anxiety. Although there is currently no standard model of care for antenatal anxiety, this may include care provided by their general practitioner (GP), midwife, health visitor, local Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service or community mental health team. The care received by women in the trial will be actively monitored by the research group, using the Adult Service Use Scale (AD-SUS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Assessments and outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Feasibility and acceptability</title><p>The main study outcomes will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study design. The primary outcome will be feasibility of recruitment and data collection, examined through assessing the following: (1) number of participants meeting eligibility criteria, (2) number of participants consenting to the study, (3) number of participants randomised, (4) number of sessions completed by those in the intervention arm, and (5) number of participants completing the post-intervention outcome measures. Furthermore, we will record reasons for study withdrawal, non-participation and non-attendance of intervention sessions.</p><p>Detailed feedback will be gathered from all participants and the midwife and psychologist delivering the intervention, in order to assess the acceptability of the intervention and trial methods. Feedback will be gained from participants allocated to the intervention arm through brief questionnaires at the end of each group session and a more detailed post-intervention feedback questionnaire. Semi-structured acceptability interviews will be conducted with a purposeful sample of participants from both study arms at post-intervention assessment. Open-ended questions will be asked about participants&#x02019; impressions of the intervention and group delivery; the relevance and suitability of the intervention content; perceived benefit of the intervention; problems or difficulties experienced with the sessions, and recommendations for changes or developments to the intervention; their experience of being a part of the study; and their impressions of current routine antenatal care. Interviews are designed to last approximately 30&#x02013;60 minutes and will be conducted face-to-face. Qualitative data analysis will be conducted following the interviews.</p><p>Fidelity to the intervention manual will be examined using video and audio tapes of intervention sessions. A random sample of 10&#x000a0;% of therapy tapes will be assessed for fidelity by two of the investigators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data collection</title><p>At each assessment point, questionnaires will either be posted to participants and returned via post, or participants will be provided with a link to a website where they can complete the measures online.
