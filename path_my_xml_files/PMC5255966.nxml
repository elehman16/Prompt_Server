Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). As many as 1.4 million persons in the US and 2.2 million persons in Europe suffer from IBD. However, there are reports of increasing incidence and prevalence from other areas of the world such as southern or central Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Clinically patients suffering from IBD display features of fever, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite, weight loss and sometimes microbial growth in the intestine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, antibiotics and antidiarrhoels are conventionally prescribed for treating IBD. Surgery is recommended in resistant and severe cases of complications. The patients complain of severe side effects and relapse and the cost of hospitalization adds to the misery. Alternatively, poly herbal formulations are also used for the treatment of IBD. Typically, herbal formulations comprising plants or plant extracts of <italic>Bombax malabaricum</italic>, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> gel, <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic>, <italic>liquorice</italic>, <italic>Commiphora wightii</italic>, <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic>, <italic>Thinopyrum intermedium</italic> juice, <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic>, <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>, <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic>, <italic>Allium sativum</italic>, <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> etc., are in use.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Despite their widespread use, polyherbal formulations face problems in standardization and quality control due to use of multiple ingredients, inconsistency of finished formulations, overlapping of chemical and chromatographic profiles, stability of formulations, difficulty in developing standards along with safety issues.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In view of these issues, it becomes difficult to say exactly as to which plant is responsible for the efficacy and which plant is responsible for the side effects.

By reducing dose of Allopathic drugs, side effects can be minimised. The results from this study may offer insights for the development of novel, effective and satisfactory herbal formulations.</p><p>In our patient population, more prevalence was observed in 31-40 and 51-60 years of age and 60% patients out of total 30 patients having UC were males. The epidemiological data and theories behind the pathophysiology of IBD reported were found to be correlating with our clinical study. Kelvin Thia in 2008[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Cosnes Jacques in 2011[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that the peak age for UC is 30&#x02013;40 years with slight male predominance. 30% of patients enrolled for the study had the habit of smoking. The treatment with test drug reduced the high scores for signs and symptoms for ulcerative colitis in all smokers as well as nonsmokers. The strongest environmental risk factor for IBD is tobacco smoking but in 1998, Zijistra[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that current smoking is protective against UC.</p><p>In our study 80% patients inspite of leading active lifestyle were suffering from UC which probably could be due to their stressful jobs, insecurity, higher workload, financial stress and a lackadaisical attitude towards personal health. People leading active life with outdoor activities have not been found to suffer from UC.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our studies, 70% patients were experiencing stress due to financial problems, overwork and poor health. Higher mortality from IBD has been reported in managerial, clerical, and sales positions, which typically involve sedentary and indoor work. All the treatments in the present study reduced mucus in stools. Stress increases the risk of developing IBD. Stress causes neuroendocrine response which decreases the mucus secretion and thereby weakens the mucosal barrier and increases the permeability. An impaired colonic mucosal barrier leading to increased intestinal permeability has been demonstrated in patients with UC. Local leaks due to apoptosis of colonic epithelium and highly permeable ulcerous lesions comprise the primary lesion in mild UC.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>All the patients of our study, vegetarian or non-vegetarian, were regular consumers of street food. They had complaints of intermittent diarrhea and constipation along with flatulence. They expelled mucus and blood in their feces and suffered gastrointestinal infections. These symptoms were reduced after the treatment with test drug. The scores were significantly different before and after the treatment. IBD is most prevalent in developed regions. It is postulated that this is the result of &#x0201c;westernization&#x0201d; of lifestyle, such as changes in diet, smoking and variances in exposure to sunlight, pollution, and industrial chemicals.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Higher intake of fatty acids, sucrose, and fast food increases the risk of IBD.</p><p>Most of the patients had complaints of loose motions or watery diarrhea before treatment. All the patients showed positive result for occult blood test done in stool samples which reversed significantly in all the treatment groups. Rise in hemoglobin levels of the patients after the trial treatments could be due to decreased blood loss through feces. The clinical studies conducted in 30 patients of ulcerative colitis, irrespective of their etiology showed a marked reduction in the frequency and consistency score of the stools after the test drug treatment. Patients suffering from several years with chronic diarrhea responded positively to the trial treatments. Patients treated with monoherbal tablets alone showed maximal reduction in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bowel frequency per day and had better stool consistency scores and the results were better than Mesalamine treated patients. The treatment reduced the colonic inflammation as evident from ESR value. Patients with UC have also demonstrated decreased colonic mucin. An <italic>in-vitro</italic> study demonstrated a possible interaction between bacterial peptides and the mucosa in UC, resulting in depletion of mucus secretion by goblet cells[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and excessive mucus expulsion in stool after colonic damage. Microbes are considered as antigens which lead to activation of intestinal immune system and epithelial cells. Release of various inflammatory mediators cause local mucosal damage.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Blood is almost always present in stools of IBD patients. Medical therapy leading to remission improves gut barrier integrity. Thus, the results were similar to our pre-clinical studies in which the methanolic extract of <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> showed beneficial effects and reduced stool consistency scores.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, patients were found to have stool infection on the day of enrollment for study. Treatment with Monoherbal tablet alone and in combination with Mesalazine significantly reduced the stool infection while Mesalamine alone could not resolve the infection. This property of controlling infection in monoherbal treatment will be an additional benefit over Mesalamine alone. Gastrointestinal infections such as amoebic dysentery are the major and most frequent problems found in IBD patients. Traditionally <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> has been useful in amoebic dysentery and diarrhea. <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> showed promising activity against experimental amoebiasis in rats and hamsters,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The fruit extract (50% ethanolic) showed antiprotozoal effect against <italic>Enta. histolytica</italic> strain STA and <italic>Trypanosoma evansi</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Clinical tests with connessine, which is the important alkaloid of <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> showed anti amoebic activity with intestinal and hepatic amoebiasis patients. All the treatments significantly reduced the cumulative scores for abdominal pain, diarrhea, stool consistency and bowel frequency/day in all the patients irrespective of their smoking habit, type of stress, age, food habits or chronicity of symptoms. In the context of these reports and the observations obtained in our study, we can conclude that the monoherbal test formulation alone and in combination with Mesalamine showed significant improvement in combating the clinical symptomatology of IBD.</p><p>Patients treated with monoherbal therapy and combination therapy did not report any side effects, relapse or complications while 50% patients treated with Mesalamine exhibited relapse of the symptoms such as diarrhea and flatulence after drug withdrawal. The most common problem existing with Aminosalicylates class of drugs prescribed quite often for the treatment of IBD is relapse on stoppage of treatment even after the regression of the symptoms. Any therapy which provides relief from symptoms and treats the disease at basic level and improves the quality of life of patients suffering from distressing disease like IBD would be easily acceptable. Thus, the monoherbal preparation had a low overall cost of treatment along with benefits of similar efficacy, safety and less chances of relapse when compared to available conventional treatments like salicylates, steroids, antidiarrheals etc., Thus, the efficacy observed in ulcerative colitis patients treated with monoherbal formulation containing extracts of <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> and the group treated with both herbal and Mesalamine was found to be better than the group treated with Mesalamine alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The clinical study supports the efficacy of investigational drug <italic>Holarrhena antidysenterica</italic> extract in resolving chronic ulcerative colitis with fewer chances of relapse and side effects. &#x0201c;Monoherbal&#x0201d; therapies may be used if found safe and effective as it will be easier to analyze the constituents as well as the mechanism of action. The results obtained in the present study can be used to conduct Phase II and III clinical trials with larger sample size and determine the problems associated with the management of IBD.</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><title>Annexures</title><p>Annexure I: Scoring pattern</p><p>
