Presence of high quantity of collagen III in the tissue obtained from cases operated for hernia and poor staining in those operated for other than hernia indicates that there is an intrinsic and inherent weakness in the tissue which makes the individual more prone for developing hernia that is primary, incisional or recurrent hernias. The staining and quantitative assessment has proved that ventral, recurrent and primary inguinal hernias are not just caused because of a primary defect but an acquired disorder with respect to collagen distribution.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>By MS Ramaiah Medical College, Ethical Committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Sources of funding</title><p>Personal.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Both authors equally helped in collecting data and gathering information about the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>No.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Guarantor</title><p>DR.
