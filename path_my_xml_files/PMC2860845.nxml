Although there have been advances in treatment options that have reduced pill burden and frequency of dosing, the need for daily dosing poses challenges for long term adherence. While newer formulations of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have reduced certain toxicities, other significant complications remain and continued exposure has revealed new toxicities.<xref rid="pone.0010307-McComsey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Long term toxicities can affect adherence as well as the effectiveness of treatment.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Parruti1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Several significant international and domestic initiatives have greatly expanded ART in resource limited settings. Further reductions in the cost of ARVs could increase the reach of such programs. Recently, guidance has shifted to earlier initiation of ART and ART has been suggested as a prevention strategy.<xref rid="pone.0010307-1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-Granich1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> ART approaches that reduce cost and toxicity while potentially increasing adherence could significantly enhance the feasibility of the implementation of such strategies on a large scale.</p><p>Researchers have previously evaluated several approaches of structured treatment interruptions to enhance adherence and reduce toxicity and cost.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Ananworanich1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010307-Papasavvas1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> It is now clear that long cycle interruptions of ART that allow a rebound of plasma HIV RNA are not clinically beneficial. The SMART and TRIVICAN trials showed significant increases in death and opportunistic infections with long cycles of treatment interruptions, consistent with previous trials showing virologic and immunologic failure with such strategies.<xref rid="pone.0010307-ElSadr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010307-Danel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> In sharp contrast, short cycle interruptions are designed specifically to maintain suppression of plasma HIV RNA below the limit of assay detection. In pilot studies conducted in the United States of short cycle interruptions designed to maintain suppression of plasma HIV RNA below the limit of detection, we observed that 7 days on and 7 days off ARV maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA below the limit of detection and reduced certain laboratory markers of toxicity with certain regimens.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Dybul1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-Dybul2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> However, strict adherence to the 7 day cycles was essential for the success of such an approach. Because of the potential difficulty for certain individuals to maintain strict adherence to such cycles, we reasoned that more &#x0201c;user-friendly&#x0201d; short cycle ARV interruption approaches could have greater implementation feasibility and clinical relevance. Based on these findings, we initiated a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial of two short cycle intermittent ART regimens (7 days on and 7 days off and 5 days on and 2 days off) compared to continuous ART. Because of the potential applicability of those strategies to resource limited settings, the study was conducted in Uganda. The 5 days on 2 days off regimen was based on the known kinetics of the rebound of plasma HIV RNA following a discontinuation of ART and the potential clinical applicability of a regimen that allowed treatment interruptions on weekends which could allow for novel approaches such as directly observed therapy (DOT) in certain settings such as schools and the workplace and could be useful in expanding the use of ART earlier in the course of disease.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Frost1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>

A confirmatory HIV test was required prior to enrollment. Participants were required to be receiving at least 3 ARVs including a protease inhibitor or the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz. Patients receiving a nevirapine-based regime were required to switch to a protease inhibitor or efavirenz if they were randomized to the interrupted arm. Nine patients in the 5 days on/2 days off arm and 7 participants in the 7 days on/7 days off arm were on nevirapine and switched to efavirenz for study enrollment. Stavudine was dosed by weight, participants weighing &#x0003e;60 kg received 40 mg, those weighing &#x0003c;60 kg received 30 mg. All participants paid for their ARVs, consistent with standard practice at the JCRC. It should be noted that at the time the study was initiated, large international programs to support the cost of ART had not begun. Such programming was not available until a large number of patients had already been enrolled. It was the decision of the investigators and the review boards that changing the payment practices mid-study could bias the results. Trial oversight was provided by and independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).

The primary endpoint was ART treatment failure determined by a plasma HIV RNA level equal to or greater than 10,000 copies on any one evaluation, a plasma HIV RNA level equal to or greater than 1,000 copies on two consecutive measurements, a plasma HIV RNA level greater than 400 copies/ml at the end of the study, a CD4&#x0002b; cell count decrease of greater than 30 percent from baseline on 2 consecutive measurements, death attributed to study participation or occurrence of an opportunistic infection. The primary endpoint was changed during the study by the protocol team from &#x0003c;50 copies/ml to &#x0003c;400 copies/ml (end of study) to eliminate the inclusion of low-level viral blips. Patients who experienced treatment failure received standard clinical care in Uganda including switching of ARV regimen, where appropriate. They were followed until 30 days after their plasma viremia and/or CD4&#x0002b; cell count returned to baseline if they changed therapy or for 30 days from the time of treatment failure if they decided not to change therapy. Laboratory safety monitoring and HIV viral load measurements (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor v1.5 &#x02013; Roche, Switzerland ) were performed on site at the JCRC. HIV genotyping (Trugene HIV-1 Genotyping Kit, Visible Genetics &#x02013; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Tarrytown, NY) was performed off-site at SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Frederick, Maryland.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection and follow-up</title><p>Participants were evaluated for standard clinical, virologic, immunologic, and adherence parameters at weeks 2 and 4 following enrollment (interrupted arms only, not included in outcome analysis) and every 6 weeks thereafter including toxicity monitoring (renal toxicity, ALT and AST were evaluated every 12 weeks and lipid profiles were done every 6 months). Lipodystropy, peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis were determined by the treating physician's assessment, clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmation (serum lactate). All laboratory evaluations were provided to the participants free of charge. Intervening visits were scheduled based on clinical standard of care or relevant failure parameters. All evaluations except the end of study evaluation were performed at the end of the off drug period in the intermittent arm. Adherence to ART was measured using patient maintained study calendars which were recorded at all study visits, adherence rates based on self-reported diaries were then calculated based on the percentage of drugs taken.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interim monitoring of safety and efficacy</title><p>An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed all safety data and treatment failures on a bi-annual basis and at least yearly after 50&#x00025; of participants were enrolled in each treatment arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 57 individuals in each treatment group (52 plus 5 allowed for attrition) was determined for a 95&#x00025; non-failure rate in each study group with a non-inferiority margin of 15&#x00025;, an alpha (type I error) of 0.025 and 81&#x00025; power using the Farrington and Manning method.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Farrington1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> The non-inferiority of the 5 days on/2 days off ART arm to continuous ART arm was assessed by constructing the upper limit of a 97.5&#x00025; confidence interval for the difference in proportions, continuous ART minus 5 days on/2 days off, of those successfully completing the study.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Anonymous1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>

The data were normalized for comparison between groups by reporting data as events per 100 person years. Among the 40 participants receiving continuous stavudine, 5 cases of lactic acidosis as determined by clinical findings and arterial blood levels of lactate occurred (resulting in one death), with an incidence of 11.4/100 person years, whereas no occurrences of lactic acidosis occurred among 44 participants receiving intermittent ART that included stavudine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). A reduction in lipodystrophy was also observed with 5 cases in the continuous treatment arm (incidence 11.4/100 person-years) compared with 1 case in the intermittent treatment arm (incidence 1.8/100 person-years) (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.13). The rate of lipodystrophy in the continuous arm was 6.2 times the rate in the 5 days on and 2 days off arm (95&#x00025; confidence interval {CI}: 0.7, 293).

The data are consistent with the results of a pilot study that was begun in the United States after this randomized, controlled trial was underway and with a recent report of significantly increased risk of failure with interruptions beyond 2 days.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-Parienti1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Our findings are also consistent with those of the FOTO study which found that participants on a 5 day on/2 day off interruption strategy receiving tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz maintained virologic suppression at 24 weeks.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> The primary endpoint, ART treatment failure, was reached by a lower percentage of participants in the intermittent arm than the continuous treatment arm by 73 weeks of study follow-up. The early termination of the 7 days on/7 days off arm due to a high failure rate was consistent with another trial reported after the present study was begun.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Ananworanich2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> It is important to point out that failures that have been reported in treatment interruption studies have invariably been associated with a rebound in plasma viremia during the period of intermittent discontinuation of ARVs.<xref rid="pone.0010307-ElSadr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-ElSadr2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Such rebounds are generally associated with the emergence of drug resistance and the depletion of CD4&#x0002b; T cells.<xref rid="pone.0010307-ElSadr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010307-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> We chose the 5 days on/2 days off regimen of treatment interruption to study because previous experience with the kinetics of plasma rebound following interruption of ART strongly indicates that plasma viremia that had been suppressed below the level of detection (&#x0003c;50 copies per ml) by ART does not generally rebound during the 2 day drug-interruption period.</p><p>Although the trial was not powered to show superiority, it was interesting that there were nearly twice as many failures in the continuous arm compared to the 5 days on/2 days off arm (11 and 6, respectively). The adherence data collected indicated high levels of adherence in each arm. However, 2 of 5 participants with virologic failure in the continuous arm evaluated for drug resistance had wild-type virus, suggesting poor adherence. Those results are compatible with the possibility that scheduled interruptions promote adherence during the on-drug period. All participants in the 5 days on/2 days off arm developed genetic mutations consistent with resistance to both lamivudine and efavirenz while 3 of 5 participants in the continuous arm developed mutations consistent with resistance to efavirenz and only 1 developed resistance to lamivudine with a second participant developing lamivudine resistance at a later follow-up visit. Our study was not powered to specifically look at differences in genotypic resistance patterns and also used self-reported adherence, known to be an imperfect measure, limiting our ability to draw any firm conclusions from these findings.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>
</p><p>There was evidence of reduced toxicities associated with intermittent ART. This was particularly striking among the subset of participants receiving stavudine containing ART which is commonly used in resource limited settings despite efforts to replace it with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We observed a marked reduction in the rate of lactic acidosis among participants receiving intermittent stavudine with no cases detected in this group compared to 5 cases in the continuous treatment arm. A similar although not statistically significant reduction in lipodystrophy was also observed among participants receiving intermittent stavudine in our study. This finding is consistent with reports that mitochondrial toxicity associated with stavudine appears to be at least partially dose dependent.<xref rid="pone.0010307-McComsey2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> Of note, lipodystrophy was physician defined which could result in measurement bias. If larger clinical trials validate reductions in debilitating and fatal adverse reactions observed in this trial, short cycle structured treatment interruptions could have particular relevance for earlier initiation of ART and ART as a viable prevention strategy.</p><p>Immunologic responses to ART were robust in both intermittent and continuous treatment arms. Although there was a significantly greater increase in CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts between arms for patients followed more than 52 weeks, the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. Larger trials would be needed to validate those results and to determine their clinical significance. Consistent with recent publications from other resource limited settings, immunologic failure was not observed despite several episodes of virologic failure.<xref rid="pone.0010307-Mee1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0010307-Reynolds2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Of note, none of the participants in this study who had developed virologic failure and genetic mutations associated with ARV resistance would have been detected by the current WHO guidelines for determining ARV failure and changing to second line regimens based on immunologic criteria alone, highlighting the role of virologic evaluations to determine treatment failure.<xref rid="pone.0010307-World1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>
</p><p>The present study has several limitations. It was not powered to evaluate superiority or long term outcomes including death. The protocol included only subjects on efavirenz in the intermittent arms due to the concern of nevirapine resistance. Because nevirapine is extensively used in low and middle income countries this might limit the applicability of our findings. The continuous treatment arm had a higher than expected failure rate than used in the original statistical design which could impact on the overall conclusion of non-inferiority. The methodology used to measure adherence relied on participant diaries which may not reflect the true adherence levels of the different treatment arms in the study. Finally, the patient population at the JCRC tended to be of higher socioeconomic status during the time of the study and thus, most were able to pay for their ART. A larger trial will be needed to more fully address short cycle intermittent therapy among patients representing a wide range of demographies.</p><p>Since 5 days on/2 days off intermittent therapy has been shown to be as least as effective as continuous therapy, this strategy could have particular importance for programs of directly observed therapy (DOT) for difficult to treat populations including children and adolescents attending school 5 days a week. It could also be relevant for workplace programs. The possibility of decreased toxicity could be relevant as treatment guidelines shift to initiating ART earlier in the course of disease. Drug treatment costs could also be 29 percent lower with a 5 days on/2 days off treatment regimen. Finally, as guidance shifts to earlier initiation of ART, a less expensive, &#x0201c;user-friendly&#x0201d; approach with reduced toxicity could be significant for scale-up of those strategies, particularly in the developing world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0010307.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.08 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0010307.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0010307.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0010307.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the staff at the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala, Uganda and the study participants for their participation in this study and John Weddle for assistance with the figures included in the manuscript.
