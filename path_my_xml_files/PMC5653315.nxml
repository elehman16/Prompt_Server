In the U.S., Black women have an 80% higher uterine cancer mortality rate than white women <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The 5-year survival rate of endometrial cancer patients is 64% for non-Hispanic Black women compared with 86% among non-Hispanic white women <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Several factors likely account for these disparities including socioeconomic status, stage-at-diagnosis, tumor characteristics, barriers to access to care, and treatment decisions <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Higher rates of comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, may also have a role. Compared to their white counterparts, African American (AA) patients with endometrial cancer are more likely to be obese or morbidly obese <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, AA women who have been diagnosed and treated for uterine cancer have a higher risk of diabetes and impaired quality of life than whites <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Black-white differences in uterine cancer survival suggest that there are unmet needs among these survivors.</p><p id="p0015">A small number of intervention studies have examined the feasibility and efficacy of lifestyle interventions aimed at increasing physical activity or improving nutritional status among uterine cancer survivors <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. One additional study focused on both endometrial and breast cancer patients <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, none of the studies specifically targeted AA or used interventions that were culturally tailored for African American women. Basen-Engquist et al. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> conducted a study in which one hundred post-treatment Stage I&#x02013;IIIa endometrial cancer survivors participated; only seven of the women (7%) were non-Hispanic African American. Von Gruenigen et al. <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> conducted a randomized controlled trial in early stage endometrial cancer patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45), and all but one of the participants were white. In the SUCCEED Trial, of the 75 overweight and obese endometrial cancer survivors in Cleveland, Ohio randomized to a 6-month lifestyle intervention or usual care group, only 5 of the women (6.7%) were African American <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Additional research is needed to examine the effects of life-style interventions among African American uterine cancer survivors. Engaging in behaviors such as physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, eating a healthy diet (e.g., a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables), and learning stress-reduction techniques offers cancer survivors control over their health and may lessen their fear of disease recurrence or progression <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This pilot study will help to fill in current gaps in the evidence base on uterine cancer survivorship among African American women.</p><p id="p0025">We hypothesize that: 1) the lifestyle intervention will correspond with a statistically significant increase in daily/weekly physical activity from baseline to six months, mediated by a decrease in perceptions of exercise barriers and improvements in physical activity knowledge and awareness 2) the lifestyle intervention will be associated with a statistically significant improvement in quality of life in pre/post-test comparisons, and that this quality of life improvement will be mediated by improvements in nutritional status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study development</title><p id="p0030">In this community-engaged research study, input has been sought from the Augusta University College of Nursing Community Advisory Board (CAB), which is primarily comprised of African American women who live in Augusta and the surrounding area. The other partner in this project is the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the Georgia Cancer Center at AU. These members offered input and guidance about recruitment of research participants and planning for the 12-week intervention including appropriate locations for the 12-week intervention, appropriate time and day for the weekly sessions, and the best approach for formatting physical activity sessions. The CAB will continue to provide input throughout the planning and conduct of this study and the dissemination of the results. This will help ensure that the intervention is culturally appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study population</title><p id="p0035">The Gynecological Oncology Program is part of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) at Augusta University. The program provides patient services for women across the Central Savannah Regional Area (CSRA). Gynecologic oncologists will be screening potential participants who meet the following eligibility criteria: African American; stages I or II uterine cancer survivors; at least 3-month time lapse since most recent cancer treatment; BMI &#x0003e;18.5 (those not underweight); medical clearance for physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Recruitment</title><p id="p0040">Prior to participant recruitment, the study will receive approval from the Augusta University IRB. Because research indicates that cancer survivors often develop recurrent or secondary malignancies and other obesity-related disorders, gyn-oncologists at Augusta University Medical Center will identify eligible patients during routine follow up visits post uterine cancer treatment. The gyn-oncology medical staff will explain the research and ascertain patient interest. Potential participants will be asked to sign a release form allowing their contact information to be provided to the research team. Participants will be mailed a letter with additional information about the study and a detailed consent form, followed by a telephone call. During the call, we will use a telephone screening protocol based on the Physical Activity Readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csep.ca/forms" id="intref0010">www.csep.ca/forms</ext-link>). Research team members will contact potential participants to determine eligibility, further discuss the research, answer any questions, and schedule a baseline interview. We anticipate that our participants will have comorbidities. Therefore, to increase external validity and to avoid excluding individuals who would benefit from the intervention, those participants that answer &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; to any questions on the PAR-Q will not be excluded, but will require medical provider clearance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Theoretical framework</title><p id="p0045">The intervention will incorporate elements of the Health Belief Model (HBM), such as educational information about modifiable causes of cancer and other chronic diseases (e.g., the potential benefits of weight loss through healthy eating, caloric restriction, limiting alcohol intake, and physical activity) <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We will use the Health Belief Model as the guiding principles for the intervention. The HBM posits that a person's beliefs about a health concern, such as cancer recurrence, their perceived benefits of an action (e.g., adopting a healthy diet, engaging in physical activity, avoiding alcohol and tobacco) barriers to action, and self-efficacy explain engagement in health promoting behavior <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The HBM suggests that a stimulus or cue to action must be present to trigger health-promoting behavior. The lifestyle intervention will also incorporate elements of social cognitive theory <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> including goal setting, self-reporting of dietary intake self-monitoring of minutes of physical activity per day, and reinforcement of positive behaviors. Self-monitoring is strongly associated with behavior change <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The intervention will provide several triggers to promote healthy behaviors, and participants will be able to track minutes of daily physical activity. To increase self-efficacy, the intervention will provide information about practical steps that can be taken to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight including menu suggestions. Other topics that will be discussed incorporate portion sizes, meal planning, food labels, grocery shopping, eating out in social situations, and improving overall diet quality. The sessions will include instructions for setting individualized goals, tracking progress, and receiving feedback. The intervention will allow users to set a weight loss goal and to self-monitor daily dietary intake toward achieving that goal and serve as a cue for action.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Intervention development</title><p id="p0050">The intervention developed for this study will incorporate existing physical activity, and nutrition interventions that have been developed for uterine cancer survivors <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and African American and white breast cancer survivors <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To pretest draft intervention materials, we will hold two focus group sessions with 8&#x02013;10 AA uterine cancer survivors per group. We will present the draft materials to the focus group participants to solicit their feedback and input on improving the materials, including the ease and time required for completion of questionnaires. This will help to ensure that the materials are acceptable to the target population, persuasive, and more likely to be effective in changing behaviors. Members of the CAB will also be asked to review draft intervention materials in order to solicit their ideas about how to improve them.</p><p id="p0055">Education and skills development to increase physical activity will be adapted from intervention materials used in previous studies of uterine cancer survivors and African American breast cancer survivors (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). During the 12-weekly group sessions, participants will have opportunities for facilitated physical activities. The goal will be to provide fitness instruction and safe and appropriate opportunities for exercising. These sessions will include a warm-up, 25&#x000a0;min of dance fitness, 20&#x000a0;min of resistance training using body weight and elastic exercise bands, a cool-down, and stretching. The exercise routine and musical playlist will be modified based on participant feedback and instructor assessment. Participants will be provided with options for decreased intensity of physical activity to accommodate individual differences. Participants will be encouraged to try several of the exercises at home and to engage in moderate intensity physical activity, like walking at least 90&#x000a0;min per week in between the weekly group sessions. Longer-term changes in everyday activities such as walking, jogging, swimming, and climbing stairs rather than taking elevators will also be encouraged.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of educational intervention.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Summary of Educational Intervention</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Goal setting<break/>Diet record<break/>Physical activity record<break/>Uterine cancer educational information<break/>Time management (barriers to action)<break/>Triggers/cues to action<break/>Culturally tailored recipes (barriers to action)<break/>Menu suggestions<break/>Meal planning<break/>Food labels<break/>Grocery shopping<break/>Dietary information<break/>Portion sizes<break/>Eating out in social situations (barriers to action)<break/>Health messaging on importance of healthy diet/physical activity (benefits to action)<break/>Use of Fitbit watch to monitor physical activity</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0060">In addition to providing users with culturally-tailored healthy recipes and menu suggestions, the intervention will provide information about the importance meeting nutritional requirements by selecting foods from all the food groups with an emphasis on reducing intake of simple sugars and concentrated fats. Guidelines provided by the American Cancer Society (ACS) for nutrition and physical activity for cancer survivors will be incorporated <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The intervention will also utilize information, and graphics from the USDA's ChooseMyPlate program will be used as a guide to provide practical information to help consumers build healthier diets with user-friendly nutrition information <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p id="p0065">Physical activity guidelines will be followed that were developed by HHS and ACS. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans emphasize that all adults should avoid inactivity <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Some physical activity is better than none, and adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150&#x000a0;min (2&#x000a0;h and 30&#x000a0;min) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75&#x000a0;min (1&#x000a0;h and 15&#x000a0;min) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10&#x000a0;min, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The intervention developed and evaluated in this pilot study will focus on moderate intensity physical activity and will include health messages about the importance of routine physical activity for weight management and the potential health benefits.</p><p id="p0070">Participants will receive a 12-week technology&#x02013;based intervention that will use wrist-worn Fitbit Blaze PA monitoring devices (San Francisco, CA) paired with accompanying Fitbit app and web interface (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Data will be collected from participants at the time of the baseline visit and at 6-months. Participants will be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire at both time points. The baseline and 6-month follow-up visit study questionnaires will be self-administered and take about 60&#x000a0;min to complete. Members of the research team will be available to respond to any questions that the participants may have and to help ensure that each questionnaires is complete and has legible written responses. Before obtaining the informed consent, we will thoroughly explain the study procedures, emphasize importance of follow-up. Other strategies to improve participant retention include sending birthday and holiday cards, encouragement to contact study staff to address any barrier to compliance with the study, reminder calls, and convenient times for visits. One participant will also be eligible to win a small door prize ($10 value) at each weekly session. This study anticipates that at least 75% of participants in the lifestyle intervention will complete the intervention sessions that focus on nutritional status and physical activity.</p><p id="p0140">All data collected as part of the proposed study will be carefully monitored for completeness. The quality of the data will be maximized through pre-coded responses and computerized internal consistency checks and range checks of specified values.

Initially, cross-tabulations of the data will be performed using SAS. Both chi-square and Fisher's exact tests will be used to examine the statistical significance of observed associations. Recruitment patterns will be examined by socioeconomic level (household income, education), age, and time since completion of medical and surgical therapy for uterine cancer. The number of intervention sessions attended will be examined along with participant use of the Fitbit watch to monitor physical activity and track food and beverage consumption. After cross-tabulations and exploratory analyses of the survey data are completed, characteristics of the participants will be examined, including self-reported age, education, annual household income, marital status, number of people in the household, health literacy; weight, BMI, quality of life, self-reported behaviors (consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, saturated fats, added sugars, and refined grains; alcohol consumption, time spent in past week in moderate-intensity physical activity), and self-efficacy in cancer risk reduction through lifestyle changes. Paired t-tests will be used to determine the statistical significance of changes in weight, BMI, quality of life; knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about cancer recurrence risk reduction through lifestyle changes; and behavioral survey items between baseline and follow-up. Linear models will be used to compare changes in these variables between baseline and 6 months while controlling for potential confounding variables. The dependent variable in the linear model to test the first hypothesis (the lifestyle intervention will correspond with a statistically significant increase in daily/weekly physical activity from baseline to six months, mediated by a decrease in perceptions of exercise barriers and improvements in physical activity knowledge and awareness) will be measured using data from Fitbit output in physical activity minutes/day and minutes/week. While controlling for participant demographics and changes in nutrition and body composition, primary predictor variables will include changes in the pre-post-test survey at baseline and six months, to include physical activity attitudes, perceived exercise ability and exercise barriers. The second hypothesis (the lifestyle intervention will be associated with a statistically significant improvement in quality of life in pre/post-test comparisons, and that this quality of life improvement will be mediated by improvements in nutritional status) will be tested in a linear model using the change in the Quality of Life domain scores (dependent variable) at baseline and six months, with change in nutritional status (ASA24 scores) as a primary predictor, while controlling for physical activity outcomes and changes in body composition.</p><sec id="sec2.8.1"><label>2.8.1</label><title>Sample size and power analysis</title><p id="p0150">The targeted sample size for this pilot study was based upon our prior experience with similar studies and upon our review of the literature on similar studies that targeted white uterine cancer survivors and African American breast cancer survivors. In the study by Von Gruenigen et al. <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, weight in kg was 115.4 (SD 29.4) at baseline and 112.1 (SD 29.4) at 12-months on average in the intervention group, for a 3.5&#x000a0;kg decrease in weight.

In the study by Basen-Engquist et al. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, exercise increased from 13.64&#x000a0;min per week (SD 12.48) at baseline to 15.88&#x000a0;min per week (SD 10.64) at 6-months on average in the intervention group, for an increase of 2.24&#x000a0;min per week. Using a two-sided alpha value of 0.05, and a type II error rate of 0.2, and assuming that the SD of the change in physical activity (minutes per week) is about 5&#x02013;6, we estimated that a sample size of 50 survivors would allow for detecting an increase in physical activity of about 2.2&#x000a0;min per week. We acknowledge that the sample size may not be large enough to detect statistically significant differences in some of the outcomes of interest. The study will provide important information about the feasibility of participant recruitment and feasibility of a culturally tailored, lifestyle intervention for African American uterine cancer survivors, and pave the way for a future larger-scale trial with a randomized design.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8.2"><label>2.8.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0155">Some inaccuracies in self-reported dietary information are likely.

The CAB, which is primarily comprised of AA women, support uterine cancer survivorship as a priority heath need of the target population. Therefore, we will continue to engage the CAB to guide us on effective recruitment strategies and on the development of a culturally-appropriate intervention. This study will enroll patients from a large academic medical center, where the greatest number of uterine cancer survivors are seen. We anticipate that because of the trust relationship between the women and their gyn-oncologists that the physicians will be instrumental to our meeting the recruitment goal. We recognize that unlike survivors of other cancers (breast, colon) AA survivors of uterine cancer may be apprehensive about discussing their cancer experience among unfamiliar people. We hope that over time the shared experience of uterine cancer survivorship among the group of women will create a bond that reduces possible apprehension regarding study participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0215">None declared.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0220">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or non-for-profit sectors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allard</surname><given-names>J.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>G.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Race disparities between black and white women in the incidence, treatment, and prognosis of endometrial cancer</article-title><source>Cancer control J.
