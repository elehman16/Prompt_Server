It was a prospective, open labeled, randomized, parallel group study of 6months&#x02019; duration. Patients enrolled were steroid naive persistent asthmatics of varying severity above 12 years of age, and were directly randomized (computer assisted random sampling) to the study without run in period.</p><p>American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] were followed for the spirometric procedure. The patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) less than 80% with post bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> improvement &#x02265;12% and 200 ml were included. Patients were excluded if they used oral steroids in the past 6 months, suffering from any significant co-morbidities, acute infective exacerbations in the past 4 weeks and were pregnant or lactating. Ethics approval for the study protocol was obtained from Institutional Ethics Committee of the study site, and all patients signed a written informed consent before entering into the study.</p><p>Enrolled patients randomly received equipotent dosages of the three ICS FP-125 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g or BDP-200 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g or BUD-200 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g through a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) device without a spacer, according to their disease severity based on GINA guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The patients were checked for the pMDI techniques at baseline and at every follow-up until the end of the study because they were not allowed to use spacers to attain uniformity among all patients. Patients who never used an MDI previously were initially trained for the standard techniques of inhalation.</p><p>A checklist was developed containing ten steps, based on the standard procedure involved, in order to assess the proper use of pMDIs without spacer. Patients were assessed individually for the appropriate use of pMDI. Difficult steps were identified for each patient and were educated. Training was given using placebo inhaler after carefully observing the performance of each step by the patient. The inhalational techniques were checked at subsequent follow-ups to reinforce the appropriateness.</p><p>Clinical evaluation, SGRQ, spirometry, and BDI-TDI[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] were assessed at baseline and during follow-up visits at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days. Long acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist-salmeterol 100 mcg/day pMDI in two divided doses was used in all patients (GINA II, III, and IV) to attain uniformity in treatment. Salbutamol 200 mcg pMDI was used as a rescue medication throughout the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analyzed by using Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS) version: 13.0.

The significant improvements in treatment groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA using post hoc-bonferroni that compared means of SGRQ scores and lung functions during individual follow-ups.

Subsequently, the three ICS were comparable except at the end of study where FP was found to be better than BDP, but not BUD. In patients with severe persistent asthma, no statistically significant difference could be demonstrated between three groups, throughout the study period, though there was clinically significant improvement in favor of FP in all three domains of the SGRQ, both on day 15 and at the end of study.</p><p>BDP-treated patients with mild and moderate persistent asthma, showed an unexpected decline at end of study in overall QoL scores, as observed in activity and impact domains, which may be due to acute exacerbations that were observed in patients receiving BDP just before the last follow-up. Compared to BUD and FP, the BDP-treated group documented 19 acute exacerbations between visit-7 and visit-8 (end). This was reflected in HRQoL scores, but not in lung functions or dyspnea assessments possibly the reason was that the SGRQ assessed HRQoL in the previous month, while lung functions were currently measured during visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Dyspnea Impairment</title><p>As a standard measure for dyspnea, BDI-TDI is capable of evaluating dyspnea caused by the magnitude of exertion that evokes dyspnea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] The time taken to reach a change of 1 unit in TDI is an important outcome measure in asthma. Fluticasone showed an early response (&#x02265;1 unit from BDI) in dyspnea reduction in asthma patients within 15&#x02013;30 days of treatment. This response of FP was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at 15<sup>th</sup> day compared to BDP but not to BUD (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Patients of BUD and BDP groups showed a clinically significant (&#x02265;1 unit from BDI) dyspnea reduction only after 45 days of treatment. This might have reflected in the early response in QoL scores noted for fluticasone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study demonstrated that SGRQ and BDI-TDI are useful outcome measures in asthma studies and are able to measure dimensions not measured by pulmonary function tests that help to identify subtle differences between drugs. All the three ICS showed improvement in lung functions and QoL scores. The early response in quality of life improvement with fluticasone was observed in patients with moderate and severe persistent asthma. More studies comparing different disease-specific instruments such as AQLQ and SGRQ are necessary to identify the ideal HRQoL measure in asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank The University Grants Commission, Govt. of India for the financial support.
