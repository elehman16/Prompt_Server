ACT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention combining acceptance and mindfulness processes with commitment and behavior-change processes. ACT enjoys modest empirical support in treating depression and has also shown promising results in secondary prevention of depression. The experimental cognitive bias modification (ABM) procedure has been shown to reduce surrogate markers of depression vulnerability in patients in remission from depression. The aim of the current project is to investigate if the effect of group-based ACT on reducing residual depressive symptoms can be enhanced by preceding it with ABM. Also, assessment of the relationship between conceptually relevant therapeutic processes and outcome will be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">An invitation to participate in this project was extended to 120 individuals within a larger sample who had just completed a separate randomized, multisite, clinical trial (referred to hereafter as Phase 1) in which they received either ABM (<italic>n</italic> = 60) or a control condition without bias modification (<italic>n</italic> = 60). This larger Phase-1 sample consisted of 220 persons with a history of at least two episodes of major depression who were currently in remission or not fulfilling the criteria of major depression. After its inclusion, Phase-1 participants from the S&#x000f8;rlandet site (<italic>n</italic> = 120) were also recruited for this study in which they received an 8-week group-based ACT intervention.

The World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease Study ranked depression as the single most burdensome disease in the world in terms of total disability-adjusted years among people in the middle years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although many new approaches to treating depression have been developed, efficacy for both pharmacological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] is still unsatisfying.</p><p id="Par26">Depression is also a highly recurrent disorder. More than 75% of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience more than one episode, often relapsing within 2 years of recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] has identified secondary prevention as a key goal in the long-term management of depression. Its high recurrence rate suggests specific vulnerability factors that increase risk for developing repeated episodes of MDD. Preventive strategies that identify and ameliorate these factors ostensibly could reduce risk of subsequent episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena of depression and its efficacious treatment, multiple perspectives and angles may be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a recent article, Beck and Bredemeier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] proposed a more unified model of depression, integrating clinical, cognitive, biological and evolutionary perspectives for treating and preventing depression. Consistent with this recommendation, this project evaluates the impact in reducing residual symptoms in depression of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) following Attention Bias Modification (ABM). ACT has been recognized as an efficacious treatment for depression and has also shown promising results in the secondary prevention of depression (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). The experimental cognitive bias modification (ABM) procedure has been shown to reduce surrogate markers of depression vulnerability in patients in remission from depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The current project is an offshoot of a larger randomized controlled, double-blinded clinical trial (i.e., Phase 1) with an outpatient population with a history of depression (NCT02658682). The original NCT investigated symptom changes after 2 weeks of ABM training. The current trial will investigate the effect on reducing residual symptoms in depression of preceding group- based ACT with ABM.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Attention Bias Modification</title><p id="Par29">The cognitive model of depression is an empirically based framework for identifying and understanding factors that maintain an episode of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Within this model, biased attention is believed to play a key role in maintaining depression by fuelling negative thoughts and feelings. Such effects have been shown using a dot-probe paradigm where participants are presented with pairs of stimuli, typically words or faces, consisting of one neutral stimulus and one emotional stimulus. After the offset of each pair, a dot probe appears in the location of either the neutral or the emotional stimulus with allocation of attention measured by latency in detecting it. Participants orienting selectively toward the emotional stimulus will be faster to detect dot probes that replace that stimulus (where they are already attending) and slower to detect probes that replace the neutral stimulus. For example, it has been demonstrated that clinically depressed subjects orient attention toward sad faces rather than neutral or positive faces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A bias towards sad faces has also been reported in previously depressed, currently euthymic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and in never-depressed individuals at high risk because of a family history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our own research group we have shown similar effects in healthy subjects at genetic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Together these results suggest that negative cognitive biases may constitute important vulnerability factors for depression, rather than simple markers of lowered mood.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Attentional Bias Modification procedure</title><p id="Par31">Selective biases in attention can be modified by a simple computerized technique; the Attention Bias Modification task (ABM), pioneered by Colin MacLeod et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], was originally developed to test the critical hypothesis that attention bias towards negative emotional information plays a causal role in depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The current approach uses a variant of the dot-probe task, which encourages patients to orient attention towards positive rather than negative stimuli, through an implicit association between the valence of the stimulus and the location of the probe. If the probe appears in the location of the positive stimulus (in 80% of the trials), a habit of automatically directing attention toward positive stimuli is encouraged; i.e., the subject develops a positive attention bias. This manipulation can be compared to a neutral (&#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d;) condition in which the probe appears equally often behind the positive and negative stimuli, without affecting attention bias Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Illustration of the dot-probe paradigm. Attentional bias is reflected in faster times to respond to probes presented in the same position as the negative facial expression versus probes located in the opposite position</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2515_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">There has been a growing interest in ABM research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Unfortunately, some projects have been limited by small sample sizes and poor trial methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While overall findings have been mixed, studies that have found measurable positive changes in emotional biases with ABM, have also reported associated changes in clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For example, a recent small-scale study from the research group of Harmer revealed that alteration of attention bias using the ABM technique causally influenced residual symptoms and the cortisol awakening response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</title><p id="Par33">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a modern cognitive-behavior therapy that combines acceptance and mindfulness processes, with commitment and behavior-change processes. ACT is a transdiagnostic model that focuses on pathogenic processes that are hypothesized to be common in different forms of human suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The main goal in ACT is to foster psychological flexibility, which is defined as &#x0201c;the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being and to change, or persist in, behavior when doing so serves valued ends&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], p. 7). Psychological flexibility has shown to be associated with higher life satisfaction, emotional well-being, job performance, and job satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Because ACT focuses on promoting psychological flexibility, rather than removing psychopathology, ACT is hypothesized to be well suited for the prevention of psychological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Psychological flexibility, in turn, is strengthened through the six core processes of (1) acceptance, (2) defusion, (3) self as context, (4) committed action, (5) values, and (6) contact with the present moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Of these six process, acceptance has received the most attention. Correlational and experimental evidence indicates that experiential avoidance, as the converse of acceptance, contributes to the development and maintenance of different psychological and behavioral problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A basic tenet of ACT is that by nurturing and developing a more accepting and psychologically flexible stance makes it possible to remain in contact with the uncomfortable experiences, while remaining focused on what one wants life to be about both now, and in the future. Another process contributing to psychological flexibility that ACT addresses, that would appear to be of greater relevance for the rationale of this study, is that of present-moment awareness. To somewhat varying degrees and via differing means, ACT protocols seek to strengthen mindfulness in a manner consistent with that of Jon Kabat-Zinn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] as &#x0201c;paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, nonjudgmentally&#x0201d; (p. 4). Depressed clients are encouraged to &#x0201c;just notice&#x0201d; with an accepting attitude thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations that might otherwise be responded to in a ruminative and experientially avoidant manner.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>The ACT model of depression</title><p id="Par34">From an ACT point of view, depression is a secondary emotion that emerges from unsuccessful efforts to experientially control sadness and disappointment as normal and adaptive emotional reactions to distressing life events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In effect, sadness that is not toxic or psychologically unhealthy per se, may be transformed into clinical depression. Rather than targeting changes in the thinking of those who struggle with depression, ACT seeks to change how they respond or relate to their thoughts. For example, thoughts like &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t deserve to be loved&#x0201d; may often lead to social isolation. Instead of changing the thought, ACT through mindfulness, acceptance, and defusion strategies seeks to minimize its impact as a barrier to psychological flexibility. In depression there is often a reduction in pleasurable and task-oriented activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. From an ACT perspective, it is not an increase in activity levels by itself that is most important. It is rather exploring and clarifying values, and exemplifying psychological flexibility by committed actions coherent with values in multiple life areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consistent with this formulation, Plumb, Hayes, Hildebrandt and Martin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] found an association between depression and lack of valued action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Combining ACT and ABM to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of depression</title><p id="Par35">The overarching hypothesis of this project is that because both ABM and ACT seek to increase attentional flexibility, albeit in differing ways and perhaps to differing degrees, they are likely to complement each other. Accordingly, participants who receive sequentially both treatments generally are expected to demonstrate greater benefits than those who only receive ACT. In a special issue on ABM, Koster and Bernstein suggests that combining ABM and clinical treatment might give a better outcome than &#x0201c;stand-alone&#x0201d; treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">A positive attentional bias established and maintained through ABM should reduce the degree to which negatively valenced stimuli (whether they be sad faces or unwanted thoughts and feelings) become the focus of present-moment awareness. If successful, ABM, in effect, should thus result in less attentional material that is subject to rumination. However, ABM alone does not address how individuals may continue to process and react to negatively valenced material that is attended to in a judgmental way. To the extent that ACT complements ABM, it may primarily do so through its emphasis on mindfulness. In short, individuals who receive both ABM and ACT may be less likely to (1) even be aware of stimuli and events that might otherwise trigger rumination and (2) to be more accepting of that which is still noticed. Studies have found that both ABM and mindfulness-based treatments (of which ACT is an example) may cause neuroplastic changes in the brain regions associated with attention, emotion and self-awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The changes that ABM might bring forward could predict a boost to ACT treatment.</p><p id="Par37">Another lens through which ABM and ACT could be seen as complementing each other entails multilevels of cognitive processing. ABM could be thought to involve &#x0201c;lower-order&#x0201d; cognitive processes incorporating implicit attention without the involvement of apparent language or cultural-based processes. ACT, on the other hand, implicates more &#x0201c;higher-order&#x0201d; cognitive processes. Somewhat relatedly, Skinner&#x02019;s distinction between contingency-shaped (ABM) and rule-governed behavior (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] may also be useful in considering how ABM and ACT could work together. ABM targets contingency-shaped behavior. In the dot-probe paradigm attention under the discriminative control of positive stimuli is shaped to establish a positive bias. Once established at sufficient strength, selective attending may be maintained by its naturally reinforcing consequences. In contrast to ABM, ACT is more concerned with rule-governed behavior. Mindfulness instruction and practices in ACT can be viewed as efforts to increase attentional flexibility by bringing certain facets of present moment awareness under more deliberate control. However, unlike in ABM, the agenda is less on shifting from <italic>what</italic> is attended to, to that of altering <italic>how</italic> whatever is noticed is attended to in a less judgmental and more accepting manner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par38">This study has the following hypothesis;<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par39">Group-based ACT will reduce residual symptoms of depression when compared to patients not receiving group-based ACT</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Group-based ACT will reduce cognitive, neurobiological, and emotional markers of vulnerability in a sample of patients in remission from depression when compared to patients not receiving group-based ACT</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Group-based ACT preceded by ABM will have greater effect on reduction of residual symptoms than group-based ACT proceeded by sham ABM</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">The absolute and relative reductions in episodes of low-mood among those receiving group-based ACT will be maintained over a 12-month follow-up period</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Increased valued living and mindfulness skills as well as decreased scores on perceived stress, experiential avoidance, automatic thoughts and cognitive fusion, alone or in combination, will significantly mediate reductions in depressive symptoms in group-based ACT</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Overview of study design</title><p id="Par44">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the design of the study.

The intervention aims at increasing experiential acceptance, which is a posture that reflects openness to both aversive and pleasant experiences, as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Mindfulness exercises are used in every meeting as an exercise to become present and focused in observing what takes place in the present. Each meeting is ended by reviewing what participants are encouraged to practice or reflect on until the next session. Emphasis is placed not on how well they do the exercises that are important, or if they do them at all for that matter, but on their experiences and their observations.

However, many patients do not wish to use long-term drug treatment and psychological interventions are often a preferred option. Recent evidence suggests that relatively automatic training using ABM can prevent some markers of relapse in formerly depressed patients. ACT has shown promising results in secondary prevention for other patient groups, and is recognized as an empirically supported treatment for depression.</p><p id="Par113">The sequential presentation of these two treatments can be viewed as somewhat controversial as they come from quite different scientific and philosophical traditions. ACT originates from cognitive-behavioral psychology, while ABM originates from neuroscience. Both treatments have had promising effect on depression separately, but their combination has not been investigated before.</p><p id="Par114">While psychological interventions may often be offered in conjunction with antidepressant medication, they are seldom combined with each other. If psychological approaches are combined they are often closely interrelated theoretically and philosophically; unlike ACT and ABM. Paradoxically this may also be why ACT and ABM may work well together. The two treatments both can be seen as targeting attentional processes, but on different levels cognitively, theoretically, and philosophically.</p><p id="Par115">This project takes place in a &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; clinical setting, where patients have varied history, backgrounds and challenges. ABM and group-based ACT represent two cost-effective and easily accessible treatments. If combining these two treatments should prove effective, it could represent an interesting opportunity for patients with recurrent depression, and a shift in perception of combining two quite different treatments. To our knowledge there has been one other study where the effect of combining ABM with regular treatment was investigated. Salemink et al. conducted a small randomized study, investigating the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with ABM, finding that ABM-augmented CBT treatment in adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Additional and larger studies are needed to investigate whether these findings can be replicated. The current ABM and ACT project will hopefully contribute to increasing the understanding of mechanisms in ABM and ACT, and the clinical impact of combining the two.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par116">Recruitment started in April 2015 and is expected to be completed in December 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
