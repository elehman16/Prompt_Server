A one-hour lecture on the principles of information mastery was organized followed by self learning slide shows before using each database. Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to answer 2 clinical scenarios using either UpToDate or PubMed Clinical Queries then crossed to use the other database to answer 2 different clinical scenarios. The proportion of relevantly answered clinical scenarios, time to answer retrieval, and users' satisfaction were measured in each database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on intention-to-treat analysis, participants retrieved the answer of 67 (76&#x00025;) questions using UpToDate and 38 (43&#x00025;) questions using PubMed Clinical Queries (P&#x0003c;0.001). The median time to answer retrieval was 17 min (95&#x00025; CI: 16 to 18) using UpToDate compared to 29 min (95&#x00025; CI: 26 to 32) using PubMed Clinical Queries (P&#x0003c;0.001). The satisfaction with the accuracy of retrieved answers, interaction with UpToDate and also overall satisfaction were higher among UpToDate users compared to PubMed Clinical Queries users (P&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For first time users, using UpToDate compared to Pubmed Clinical Querries can lead to not only a higher proportion of relevant answer retrieval within a shorter time, but also a higher users' satisfaction. So, addition of tutoring pre-appraised sources such as UpToDate to the information mastery curricula seems to be highly efficient.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With increasing medical literature, learning information management is crucial for clinicians to make them competent to find the best evidence in a short time <xref rid="pone.0023487-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In this context the important issue for clinicians is identifying sources which can provide them with reliable, relevant and readable information <xref rid="pone.0023487-Straus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Many evidence based medicine workshops and courses have been conducted all over the world to teach clinicians and medical students information management.

Both models suggest looking for the needed information at the highest level and proceeding to lower levels in case of failure to find the relevant evidence <xref rid="pone.0023487-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, it seems that learning search within the higher level resources is at least as important as learning search within lower level resources since it may change inefficient information-seeking behavior of physicians <xref rid="pone.0023487-Straus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Some studies have compared different medical information resources to suggest the best resources fulfilling trainees' need in practice.

In contrast, considering the time factor, a higher proportion of questions were answered in less than 5 minutes when pre-appraised sources were searched prior to MEDLINE (26&#x00025; vs. 55&#x00025;) <xref rid="pone.0023487-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These results could show that the content coverage of MEDLINE is more comprehensive; but in limited time, pre-appraised sources are more rewarding. In another study, Hoogendam and colleagues reported a higher answer retrieval rate for UpToDate compared to Pub Med (83&#x00025; vs. 63&#x00025;) and also a shorter time to answer retrieval (241 vs. 291 seconds) <xref rid="pone.0023487-Hoogendam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Similarly, Thiele and colleagues showed that not only users of UpToDate were more likely than users of PubMed to answer the questions correctly but also UpToDate were faster than PubMed in answer retrieval. Indeed, subjects had the most confidence in UpToDate <xref rid="pone.0023487-Thiele1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Most of the results of these studies support our findings. However, in both of these studies Clinical Queries was not emphasized in searching MEDLINE. While Demner-Fushman and colleagues showed that using Clinical Queries facilitates timely retrieval of results in MEDLINE <xref rid="pone.0023487-DemnerFushman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, not focusing on Clinical Queries might be the reason of the low timely retrieval rate in MEDLINE in those studies.</p><p>PubMed Cilnical Queries is a set of search filters for separating valid and relevant articles out of the repository of PubMed citations. Thus limits its clinical efficiency; because: a) Searching for one question may yield multiple high quality articles that present different answers, which the clinician does not have time to evaluate comprehensively. b) Few articles compare all management options for a given health problem. Therefore if the clinicians intend to decide between all possible options, they would have to review several studies systematically to inform their decision making. This is time consuming and also requires expertise.</p><p>On the other hand, UpToDate is highly efficient; because a) the information is organized in entries rather than articles; each discusses a complaint (e.g. chest pain), disease (e.g. acute coronary syndrome) or a category (e.g. diagnosis) of a disease; if a special issue needs further discussion, another entry would be specified to it (e.g. cholesterol lowering after an acute coronary syndrome). Thus, the clinician is guided to alternation and is not overwhelmed with information. b) The information is provided by integrating the best available evidence by experts to address all management options for a given health problem and most of the recommendations are graded on the basis of their level of evidence. Thus, clinicians can use the recommendations knowing that all options are considered and the best one is recommended.</p><p>The study limitations include: a) Whilst the native language of the participants was Persian (Farsi), the databases were in English. Thus may increase the time to retrieve answer, b) Unfamiliarity of participants with information management skills and inadequate competency for searching PubMed Clinical Queries compared to UpToDate inspite of equal prior training which might be the reason of such a low answer retrieval in this source, c) limited time for learning, practicing, and also searching for the answer of each question, d) using limited number of questions compared to the previous studies, e) limited questioned clinical categories and failure to include other important categories (e.g. prognosis), and f) Technical problem with the internet speed in the 2nd workshop which leaded to such a long median time to answer retrieval for both databases compared to the similar studies.</p><p>However, this study has the following strengths: a) conducting a randomized cross-over rather than self-control trial during the workshop, b) providing training to use both PubMed Clinical Queries and UpToDate by the self-learning slide shows, c) providing participants with clinical scenarios and formulated foreground questions, d) measuring the time to answer retrievals accurately using special designed software, e) verifying all answers for relevance.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, we recommend addition of tutoring pre-appraised resources such as UpToDate in information mastery workshops; because they seem to be more rewarding and faster, so more applicable in the daily practice; furthermore, they can enhance lifetime learning competencies among physicians. This study can be a signal to conduct studies comparing two different EBM workshop curricula regarding participants' satisfaction, effects on clinically important outcomes, medical errors, and costs. The results of such studies may make refinements in EBM workshop curricula.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Dr. Jane Fitzpatrick, for proof reading this paper.</p><p>We would also like to thank Miss Hoda Faghankhani, Bachelor of industrial engineering graduated from Iran University of Science and Technology, for designing the special software for recording participants' answers in this study.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to acknowledge the head of Department of Social and Preventive Medicine at Tehran University of Medical Sciences for providing this opportunity to run the designed information mastery workshop.</p><p>For designing the special software for recording participants' answers in this study, we thank Miss Hoda Faghankhani; Bachelor of industrial engineering graduated from Iran University of Science and Technology.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0023487-Phillips1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
