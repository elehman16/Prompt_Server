In recent years there is an increased awareness of esthetics within the community. Every one wishes to have neatly aligned whiter and brighter teeth which typifies youth, health, and physical attractiveness. Thus a situation arises in which some adults who are interested in orthodontic treatment might have also had their teeth bleached or might be interested in bleaching, and it seems important to determine whether bleaching would significantly influence the bond strength of orthodontic bracket adhesives to the enamel surface.</p><p>Many studies have shown that the bleaching of teeth with various concentrations of bleaching agents such as hydrogen peroxide reduces the bond strength of orthodontic brackets to the enamel surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However recent studies have shown that certain chemicals such as Sodium Ascorbate have the ability to reverse the action of bleaching agents which reduces the bond strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The aim of this study was to know whether there is any significant change seen on the shear bond strength of the brackets immediately bonded to previously bleached teeth and teeth which were bonded after it was treated with 10% Sodium ascorbate solution following bleaching.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was done in the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, Vinayaka Mission&#x02032;s Sankarachariyar Dental College, Salem, and the bond strength analysis was carried out at CIPET, Chennai. This study was carried out with an objective of assessing the effect of in-office hydrogen peroxide containing bleaching agent on the bond strength of orthodontic brackets, and the possibility of 10% sodium ascorbate usage in reversing any effect on the bond strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Sixty non-carious, sound premolar, extracted for orthodontic treatment were used for the study. Teeth with hypoplastic areas, cracks, or gross irregularities of the enamel structures were excluded. No pretreatment with chemical agents such as alcohol, formalin, or hydrogen peroxide, or any other form of bleaching was allowed. The teeth were cleaned of blood and tissue debris and stored in normal saline after extraction. The saline was changed daily to avoid bacterial contamination.</p><p>The samples were divided randomly into three groups of twenty each as Group A, B and C, the acrylic blocks in which the teeth were embedded was colour coded [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Group A - green coloured, Group B - blue coloured and Group C - red coloured. Each tooth was mounted vertically in the self cure acrylic blocks so that the crown of the teeth was exposed. The teeth in all the groups were mounted in such a way that the buccal surface would be exposed, and a jig fabricated for mounting onto an instron universal testing machine [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Group A, Group B and Group C</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-5-17-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Instron universal testing machine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-5-17-g002"/></fig><p>In Group A, which was considered as control group, the teeth were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel (3M ESPE) for 30 s, then rinsed with water and dried till the enamel surface of the teeth showed frosty white appearance of etched enamel. For those teeth that did not show white frosty appearance the above mentioned procedure was repeated. Then the pre-adjusted edgewise appliance (3M 0.022 slot) brackets of a surface area 10 mm<sup>2</sup> provided by the manufacturer (3M unitek) were bonded on to the etched surface using light cure composite resin (3M transbond XT) adhesive taking care to follow the manufacturer&#x02032;s instructions. Excess material was removed using a sharp probe and cured, using a light emitting diode (LED) light source and cured for 30 s.</p><p>In Group B the buccal surface of the tooth was bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide containing bleaching agent (Pola office), which was mixed according to manufacturer&#x02032;s recommendation and applied with brush on to tooth surface in a layer of approximately 2 mm in thickness ensuring no enamel was visible. It was then cured using a LED curing light for 30 s and kept in place for 3 min before it was washed away. Immediately after this, the bonding area was etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel for 30 s then washed and dried till white frosty appearance was seen. The pre-adjusted edgewise brackets were bonded as mentioned earlier for Group A.</p><p>In Group C, the teeth were bleached in the same procedure as Group B, after washing away the bleaching agent, 10% sodium ascorbate solution was applied to the enamel surface of the embedded teeth as an irrigation solution for 10 min with the flow rate of 1 ml/min. During this period the enamel surface was continuously agitated using a sterile brush. After the antioxidant treatment the enamel surface was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water for 30 s. Then acid etched for 30 s, rinsed and the brackets bonded using LED light cure unit carried out as mentioned previously for other two groups.</p><p>The teeth in all the groups were mounted individually on to a universal testing machine for the debonding procedure.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Debonding procedure</title><p>The shear bond strength was tested in the laboratory at CIPET Chennai, following 24 h after the bracket bonding procedure for all the three groups, the Instron machine (model no: 100 K) was used in this study to record the maximum load necessary to debond the bracket, using a stiff 0.09 mm stainless steel (SS) wire hook the ends of which were embedded in an acrylic block, which was mounted on the movable crosshead of the Instron testing machine and positioned so that the hook engaged the bracket which was to be debonded.</p><p>The force required to debond the bracket was measured in Newtons (N), and the shear bond strength was calculated by dividing the force value by bracket base area (10 mm<sup>2</sup>, as provided by manufacturer).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical method</title><p>Statistical analysis was done by using ANOVA (Analysis of variances) by Fishers <italic>F</italic> test.

The studies conducted by Adanir, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] in 2007 and Dishman,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] in 1994 has found that there is reduced bond strength when the teeth is treated with the 35% hydrogen peroxide and immediately bonded with the light cure composite for bonding procedure. Several authors have reported significant reduction in the bond strength of brackets bonded to enamel, immediately after bleaching. One of the reasons suggested for the reduced bond strength is because of the release of free oxygen radical of the bleaching agents on the tooth surface.</p><p>The study carried out by Lai, Tay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] in 2002 found that resin - enamel interface in bleached teeth exhibited more extensive nano-leakage in the form of isolated silver grains and bubble like silver deposits. Reduction of resin enamel bond strength in bleached etched enamel is likely to be caused by delayed release of oxygen that affects polymerization of resin components. Studies have been done using several antioxidants such as 10% sodium ascorbate, catalase, glutathione peroxide, acetone, ethanol, 7% sodium bicarbonate helps in removal of the free oxygen radical from the tooth surface before bonding. Studies conducted by Torres <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] in 2006, Muraguchi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] in 2007, found out that treating the bleached teeth with antioxidants will reverse the reduced bond strength. The bond strength of the human enamel could be reversed by delaying the bonding procedure following 1 week after the bleaching, Studies conducted by Machado, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] 2007, Bishara, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Bulut, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] 2006, the results showed that if the bonding procedure on the bleached teeth is delayed for 1 week the bond strength will be reversed.</p><p>Study by Turkun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] in 2009 found that the concentration of 10% sodium ascorbate will be effective in reversing the bond strength of the bleached teeth to the normal. Study conducted by Muraguchi,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] showed that the antioxidant treatment immediately after office-bleaching was effective in reversing the bond strength of both adhesive systems.</p><p>The results of this study conducted on 60 premolar teeth extracted for orthodontic purpose showed Group B (bleached and immediately bonded) teeth had the least bond strength this could be due to the reduced bond strength following bleaching procedure.</p><p>Group C (bleached and 10% sodium Ascorbate treated and bonded) teeth had higher value than Group B possibly due to the antioxidant effect on the surface of the enamel by removing the free oxidant radical formed during bleaching, Group C had comparatively less shear bond strength than Group A (control group) which had not undergone the bleaching procedure, but not statistically significant. Even though the Group B had the least bond strength when compared with the other two groups, the mean value suggests that the bond strength is still above the clinical requirement as suggested by Reynold and Lopez. According to Lopez, a maximum bond strength of seven Mpa is adequate for successful clinical bonding. Hence orthodontic brackets can be bonded immediately after bleaching without significant reduction in the bond strength. Thus effective bonding can be done on the teeth immediately after bleaching. When increase in bond strength is desired in bleached teeth, 10% sodium ascorbate treatment was found to increase the bond strength by 6.027%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The following conclusions can be drawn from the result of present study:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The control group (Group A) brackets bonded without bleaching had the maximum bond strength when compared to the three groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office bleaching system immediately before bonding does not significantly reduce shear bond strength of adhesive to the enamel.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Though the shear bond strength was comparatively less for bleached tooth immediately bonded group (Group B) when compared to control group (Group A), it was above the minimal bond strength required for orthodontic bonding.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The shear bond strength of bleached enamel surface treated with 10% sodium ascorbate was higher when compare to the bonding done immediately after bleaching and less when compared to control group.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>It can be concluded that in office bleaching 35% hydrogen peroxide though reduces the bond strength, it is not significantly reducing the bond strength below the required level of seven Mpa. It is also found that the sodium ascorbate treatment increases the bond strength.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn
