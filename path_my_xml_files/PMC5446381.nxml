Current management strategies balance optimization of glucose control with potential risks from the therapy, especially hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, increased hypoglycemic risk is associated with the duration of diabetes and insulin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and not with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prandial insulin carries a higher risk for non-severe hypoglycemia than treatment with basal insulin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and intensive insulin treatment for the management of type 2 diabetes further increases the risk for severe hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, enhanced detection of dysglycemia for patients with type 2 diabetes managed with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is essential and can be challenging with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) as neither hypo- nor hyperglycemia are easily detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can offer enhanced assessment of glycemic issues; however, current guidance for CGM use and benefit in the patient population with type 2 diabetes excludes the use of intensive insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] due to the scarcity of published data in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our results from the randomized controlled trial &#x0201c;Novel Glucose-sensing Technology as a Replacement for Blood Glucose Monitoring for the Management of Insulin-treated Type 2 Diabetes (REPLACE)&#x0201d;, which compared the safety and efficacy of the new flash glucose-sensing technology to SMBG over a 6-month period have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study included an additional 6-month open-access phase for all participants in the intervention group. The aim of the open-access phase was twofold: to evaluate (1) the safety of the new device in day-to-day use over an extended time period by assessing changes in glycemic measures between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months and (2) device-related adverse events.</p><p>The flash glucose-sensing technology used was FreeStyle Libre&#x02122;, a sensor-based flash glucose monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, UK). This small, single-use, factory-calibrated, on-body sensor utilizes wired enzyme technology (osmium mediator and glucose oxidase enzyme co-immobilized on electrochemical sensor) to continuously monitor interstitial glucose levels. The sensor is worn on the back of the arm for up to 14&#x000a0;days and automatically stores glucose data every 15&#x000a0;min. A real-time glucose level may be obtained as often as each minute by scanning the sensor with the reader. A glucose trend arrow (indicating rate and direction of change in glucose levels) and a graphical trace of glucose values for the previous 8-h period is also displayed on the screen. Data are transferred wirelessly by radio frequency identification from the sensor to the reader memory which stores historical sensor data for 90&#x000a0;days. Data can be uploaded using the device software to generate summary glucose reports (including an ambulatory glucose profile) for review by the patient at home or in the clinic with their healthcare professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Details on the rationale, methodology and results of the treatment phase (6&#x000a0;months) of the REPLACE study have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, this was a 6-month, prospective, open-label, non-masked, two-arm, randomized controlled study that was conducted at 26 European diabetes centers (8 in France, 10 in Germany, 8 in the UK). The treatment phase of the study was designed to compare the use of novel flash glucose sensing technology with SMBG in participants with type 2 diabetes treated with multi-dose insulin therapy. Following completion of the 6-month treatment phase, intervention group participants continued using flash sensing technology for a further 6&#x000a0;months during the open-access period.</p><p>At each study center, any potentially eligible patient from the general diabetes population was invited to participate in the study if they were &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for at least 6&#x000a0;months and on their current regimen (prandial only or prandial and basal multi-dose-insulin therapy or CSII therapy) for &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months; had an HbA1c level of 58&#x02013;108&#x000a0;mmol/mol (7.5&#x02013;12.0%); had self-reported regular blood glucose testing data (more than 10/week for at least 2&#x000a0;months prior to study entry); were considered by the investigator to be technically capable of using the flash sensor-based glucose monitoring system.</p><p>Participants were not included for the following reasons: if they had any other insulin regimen to that described above; had a total daily dose of insulin &#x02265;1.75 U/kg on study entry; had severe hypoglycemia (requiring third-party assistance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar&#x02013;hyperglycemic state in the preceding 6&#x000a0;months; had a known allergy to medical-grade adhesives; used continuous glucose monitoring within the previous 4&#x000a0;months; were pregnant or planning pregnancy; were receiving steroid therapy for any condition; were considered by the investigator to be unsuitable to participate.</p><p>Approval was given by the appropriate competent authorities in each country. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013. Informed consent was obtained from all patients for participation in the study.</p><p>Following 2&#x000a0;weeks of blinded sensor wear, the subjects were randomized (centrally, using biased-coin minimization dependent on study center and insulin administration) to the control group (SMBG) or to the intervention group (glucose-sensing technology). For the 6-month treatment phase (post-randomization), the sensor-based glucose monitoring system was un-blinded for the participants in the intervention group so that they could continuously use sensor glucose data for self-management, including insulin dose decisions, in accordance with the product labeling. No training was provided to these participants for interpretation of glucose sensor data. Their historical data was uploaded at subsequent study visits, and glucose reports [including ambulatory profile reports (AGP)] were generated for review by the healthcare professional with the participant, using the device software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>At 6&#x000a0;months (day 208), all control participants concluded their involvement in the study while intervention participants entered an open-label, open-access study phase for a further 6&#x000a0;months. For the open-access phase participants continued to use the sensor-based glucose monitoring system for their day-to-day glucose management and also to record any events in their event diary. These participants had a review of their glucose reports with the clinician at 3-month intervals; at the beginning of the open-access phase and after a further 3&#x000a0;months (day 284). Similar to the visits during the intervention phase, at these visits the effect of life-style/diet on glucose levels and insulin doses were discussed and any management changes agreed upon. In order to continue to reflect &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; conditions there was no pre-set algorithm for insulin adjustments mandated by the protocol. However, common principles continued to be applied, including avoidance of hypoglycemia, optimization of fasting glucose and reduction of postprandial glucose excursions.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes were changes in sensor-derived glycemic measures between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months post-baseline. The sensor-derived glycemic measures were number and duration of hypoglycemic events [glucose &#x0003c;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/L (70&#x000a0;mg/dL)] and number and duration of hyperglycemic events [glucose &#x0003e;13.3&#x000a0;mmol/L (240&#x000a0;mg/dL)].</p><p>Pre-specified secondary endpoints included sensor-derived glycemic measures between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months post-baseline; frequency of glucose finger-sticks and sensor scans per day during the study period; and total daily dose of insulin. Sensor-derived glycemic measures included number and duration of hypoglycemic events [glucose &#x0003c;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/L (55&#x000a0;mg/dL)]; time in glucose range 3.9&#x02013;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/L (70&#x02013;180&#x000a0;mg/dL), number and duration of hyperglycemic events [glucose &#x0003e;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/L (180&#x000a0;mg/dL)]; mean and standard deviation (SD) glucose. An event was defined as at least two consecutive readings, at 15-min intervals, outside the predefined glucose range (the end of an episode was 1 reading at or inside the predefined range).</p><p>Safety endpoints incorporated all adverse events, including severe hypoglycemia (requiring third-party assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]), hypoglycemic events and sensor insertion or sensor wear-related symptoms, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state episodes and cardiac events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Differences between post-baseline and baseline measurements were evaluated using a paired <italic>t</italic> test.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p>The REPLACE study was the first to publish data investigating the use of flash sensor-based glucose technology as a replacement for standard SMBG in individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with multi-dose insulin therapy. The findings from the treatment phase of the study have demonstrated that flash glucose monitoring technology is a safe replacement for blood glucose monitoring and that the use of the technology is associated with reduced time in hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During the additional 6&#x000a0;month open-access phase, reductions in time in hypoglycemia were maintained across all age groups, with sustained benefit continued during nighttime. Our findings from a further 6&#x000a0;months of using flash glucose sensing technology reinforce those from the 6&#x000a0;months of use in the REPLACE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], demonstrating that the device is safe with repetitive, consecutive use over an extended period of 12&#x000a0;month for adults, irrespective of age, and that the benefit of reduced hypoglycemia is sustained. In addition, our data reinforce the significant reductions in hypoglycemia shown by Bolinder et al. in the IMPACT study for adults with well-controlled type 1 diabetes using flash technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has resisted defining hypoglycemia numerically as all abnormally low glucose events are potentially harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, both the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consider glucose levels below 3&#x000a0;mmol/L (54&#x000a0;mg/dL) as serious and clinically important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] due to the associated risks of cardiac arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and mortality in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Notably, our findings of significantly less time in overall hypoglycemia included time at the lower glucose thresholds, and this benefit was maintained over 12&#x000a0;months. Furthermore, a 30% reduction in hypoglycemia is considered to be clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the use of flash technology reduced time in hypoglycemia [3.9&#x000a0;mmol/L (70&#x000a0;mg/dL)] by 50% at 12&#x000a0;months compared to baseline.</p><p>Time in hypoglycemia began to decrease as soon as participants were able to utilize sensor glucose readings for self-management (day 15 of the treatment phase; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and was significantly reduced at 12&#x000a0;months.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Significantly reduced time in hypoglycemia is observed as soon as sensor glucose results can be utilized by the participants at the end of the baseline phase and is sustained for 12&#x000a0;months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13300_2017_255_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>
</p><p>No change in insulin doses was observed, suggesting that the trend arrow with numerical and graphical sensor glucose information displayed on the reader is of value to support self-management of hypoglycemia detection, prevention and avoidance. The value of continuous monitoring data for self-care modification rather than therapy adjustments has been noted previously for individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with oral therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and basal insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>High deployment of the device continued with a utility rate of 84%, and sensor scanning frequency averaged seven times daily with virtually no recourse to blood glucose testing. There was no difference in device use or scanning rate for those younger or older than 65&#x000a0;years, demonstrating confident use of the technology across all adult age groups, which supports current recommendations that those over 65&#x000a0;years should have access to continuous monitoring technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>At the end of the treatment phase, all of the intervention subjects opted to continue into the open-access phase and highly concordant use of the sensor continued. This suggests that flash glucose technology is acceptable as a method of glucose monitoring and that it does not appear to have the same nuisance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and variable concordance issues that can be experienced with longer term CGM use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>There was no difference in change for time in hyperglycemia compared to baseline at the end of the open-access phase. Of interest, time in hyperglycemia had risen during the treatment phase and subsequently dropped back to baseline values at 12&#x000a0;months. Mean glucose had also risen during the treatment phase and dropped back towards baseline values at 12&#x000a0;months. These apparent rises during the treatment phase were not statistically significantly different to the control group at 6 months. Highly speculative reasoning for this is that previously undetected hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal, may affect a retrospective fear of hypoglycemia reoccurrence, prompting a resistance to treatment intensification to address hyperglycemia. Although there was no significant change in fear of hypoglycemia in the intervention group compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], any hypoglycemia and especially nocturnal is feared by those with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and this may partially explain why there was no change in time in hyperglycemia as it was not actively addressed with therapy adjustments.</p><p>Similar to the treatment phase, there were no safety concerns during the 12-month-long open-access phase. Skin reactions were reported for nine (6.5%) participants during the open-access phase and six participants (4.0%) in the treatment phase (preceding 6&#x000a0;months). With any medical device that is attached to the body, skin reactions will be experienced by some individuals. Longer duration of sensor wear likely contributes to this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There is little published data on using a device attached to the body with medical grade adhesive; the type of events in our study are similar to those reported for use of flash technology in adults with type 1 diabetes over 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and for other systems with on-body sensor use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The original randomized, controlled trial conducted over 6 months included intervention and control participants; only intervention participants continued into the open-access phase for a further 6&#x000a0;months. This is a limitation to our study; however, the primary endpoint of the open-access phase was to assess safety over an extended period of use. A final HbA1c measurement, although of clinical interest, has little value when evaluating safety or the overall effectiveness of flash technology. Similarly, quality of life and patient-reported outcome questionnaires could also have been completed at 12&#x000a0;months. In all phases of the study, our aim was to test the new technology in &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; conditions. Having restrictive protocols for treatment changes would have made general applicability of our data uncertain. Therefore, this work is limited by the modification of insulin therapy according to local practice rather than using a treatment algorithm. Our inclusion of only adults with type 2 diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy who performed regular glucose testing means future studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of flash glucose-sensing technology in younger, less concordant, individuals for modifying insulin therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the use of sensor glucose readings over a 12-&#x000a0;month period for glucose self-management by individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy was associated with significant and sustained reductions in hypoglycemic measures across all age groups with no safety concerns. Our findings confirm that longer term use of the convenient flash glucose sensing technology is safe and effective and eliminates the need for standard SMBG for glycemic management of type 2 diabetes treated by intensive insulin therapy with multiple daily injections or CSII.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec001"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
