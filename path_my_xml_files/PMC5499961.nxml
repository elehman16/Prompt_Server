These symptoms are related to a poor tolerance of gut contents, which involves an impaired reflex control and hypersensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent data suggest that intestinal microbiota may play a role; indeed, microbiota has been shown to influence intraluminal content as well as both gut reflex activity and sensitivity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Prebiotics serve as substrate for gut microbiota, thereby influencing gut microbiota activity and composition and exerting beneficial effects for the host. In particular, inulin-type fructans are storage carbohydrates that are found in many plants, including chicory, leek, onion, wheat, garlic, and artichoke, which are part of the normal human diet. Orafti HSI inulin is a highly soluble inulin and is an ingredient in food derived from chicory. Inulin is a mixture of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides composed of fructose units connected by &#x003b2; (2&#x02192;1) links.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The total number of fructose and glucose units of chicory inulin ranges mainly between 2 and 70. It is a nondigestible carbohydrate, is a dietary fiber that reaches the colon intact and serves as a substrate for microbiota metabolism. The main characteristics of inulin are its prebiotic properties because it selectively stimulates beneficial bacteria, particularly bifidobacteria.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Because of these properties, inulin is thought to have a stabilizing effect on the normal gastrointestinal function.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>We hypothesized that Orafti HSI inulin would improve functional digestive symptoms by influencing the key pathophysiological factors described above: gut content, reflex dysfunction, and hypersensitivity. The problem of investigating the effect of a treatment on clinical complaints related to gut function is the heterogeneity in pathophysiology, the intraindividual day-to-day variability of symptoms, and the high placebo response. To overcome these problems, our study applied very precise selection criteria through a comprehensive preentry selection process and measured symptoms during standard conditions and in response to a challenge test. Previous studies using the gas challenge test showed that patients with functional gut symptoms have impaired transit and poor tolerance to intestinal gas loads.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Dietary Intervention and Experimental Design</title><p>This was a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel (n=18 per group), randomized and double-blind study conducted at the University Hospital Vall d&#x000b4;Hebron. Orafti HSI inulin (8 g/d; Beneo-Orafti, Tienen, Belgium) was tested against a placebo (maltodextrine 8 g/d) during a 4-week intervention period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). After a preliminary visit, potential participants entered a 1-week basal period. Those who fulfilled specific inclusion criteria (see below) were then randomized into inulin and placebo groups through a computer-generated randomization list and entered a 4-week intervention period. During the intervention period, either inulin or placebo was administered in 4-g sachets and was taken in 200 mL liquid (water, juice, milk, coffee, or tea) during breakfast and dinner. During the first 3 days of the intervention period, only half of the dose was administered for adaptation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mcg-51-619-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Patients (20 to 70 y of age) who presented in the gastroenterology outpatient clinic complaining of moderate abdominal discomfort without diarrhea followed a work-up by their attending physician, including blood test, endoscopy, and ultrasonography as indicated.

At the end of the basal period, only the participants fulfilling the following inclusion criteria continued in the study and entered the intervention period: (a) a negative sensation of digestive well-being (score &#x02264;1 on at least 2 of the 6 evaluation days, scored on a &#x02212;5/+5 scale; see &#x0201c;Clinical evaluation&#x0201d; below); (b) poor tolerance of a gas challenge test (abdominal perception score &#x02265;3, on a 0 to 6 scale, for at least three 15-minute time points over the last 90 minutes of the 180-minute long intestinal gas infusion test; see below). Over the preceding month antibiotic intake, exceptional diets, changes in dietary habits or intake of Ca supplements were not allowed. Medications that could interfere with intestinal motility or sensitivity as well as prebiotics and probiotics were discontinued before entering the study.

Studies were conducted in a quiet, isolated room. After an 8-hour fast, participants were orally intubated with a tube (1.6 mm internal diameter) that had multiple side holes scattered over the distal 2-cm segment; the tip of the tube was positioned under fluoroscopic control 5 cm caudal to the angle of Treitz. A rectal catheter (20 Fr Foley catheter, Bard, Barcelona, Spain) was introduced, and the subjects were then placed supine in a bed at an angle of 30&#x000b0; to the horizontal plane. The tubes were connected to infusion and collection systems (see below), and gas was perfused into the jejunum for 180 minutes while measuring anal gas evacuation, abdominal perception and changes in girth.</p><p><italic>Jejunal gas infusion</italic>: Gas was continuously infused into the proximal jejunum at 12 mL/min using a modified volumetric pump (Asid Bonz PP 50-300; Lubratronics, Unterschleissheim, Germany). The gas mixture infused (88% nitrogen, 6.5% carbon dioxide, and 5.5% oxygen, bubbled into water for saturation) mimicked the partial pressures of venous blood gases to minimize diffusion across the intestinal-blood barrier.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p><italic>Anal gas evacuation</italic>: Intestinal gas evacuation was collected by an intrarectal catheter connected to a barostat, and the volume of evacuated gas was recorded continuously and measured at 30-minute intervals.</p><p><italic>Perception measurements</italic>: The perception of abdominal sensations was measured at 15-minute intervals by using five graphic rating scales, each of which was graded from 0 (no perception) to 6 (maximum tolerable) and aimed to score 4 specific possible abdominal sensations: (a) pressure/bloating, (b) distension; (c) borborygmi/colicky sensations, (d) puncture/stingy sensations, and (e) other types of sensations (to be specified). Participants were asked to score any perceived sensations (one or more perceived simultaneously) on the scales.</p><p><italic>Measurements of abdominal girth changes</italic>: Once the subjects were positioned in bed, a 48-mm-wide, nonstretch belt with a metric scale was adjusted around the abdomen by means of 2 elastic bands. Girth changes were measured at 15-minute intervals during the gas test while the subjects were breathing comfortably, and the changes were referenced to the mid-point of respiratory displacements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes Measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the effect of inulin intake (change from baseline with inulin vs. placebo) on the tolerance of the gas challenge test, which was measured as the perception of digestive sensations during the gas challenge test.

To detect differences in the secondary outcomes of daily symptoms, we anticipated an improvement of &#x02265;1 in the score of the digestive well-being scale in 15% of the placebo group and 58% of the inulin group; thus, 18 subjects per group were recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Daily data during the 6-day evaluation period, as well as repeated measures during the last 60 minutes of the gas challenge test, were averaged in each subject, and the grand mean values (&#x000b1;SE) in each group of subjects were calculated.

In this context, our study shows that inulin at a dose that induces significant proliferation of colonic bifidobacteria, is well tolerated by patients with digestive symptoms in daily life. The primary aim of our study was to prove the effect of inulin in improving the tolerance to a standard intestinal gas load. Inulin significantly reduced perception as compared with baseline. However, the effect was not significantly different than that of placebo, and hence, the primary outcome was not met.</p><p>Characteristically, clinical symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders markedly improve in response to placebo.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Since our primary aim was to measure perception in response to a standard challenge test in a selected population of patients, we assumed a smaller placebo response, but still under these conditions the placebo group showed a high improvement rate. However, a type II error related to underestimation of the placebo effect seems unlikely, because individual effects in both groups were similar. In previous studies repeat experiments yielded reproducible results, but the order effect of baseline and intervention test could explain the reduced perception with both inulin and placebo as compared with the initial baseline test.</p><p>When measuring retention of the gas infused, as a physiological marker of intestinal function, inulin but not placebo, exhibited a significant effect versus the baseline tests. The difference between inulin and placebo did not reach statistical significance and this could be related to a type II error with the sample size calculation targeting perception.</p><p>Inulin has been characterized as a prebiotic that influences intestinal microbiota with beneficial effects on the host. Indeed, as previously described,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> inulin in our study, induced the proliferation of bifidobacteria. Prebiotics are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota, and in this fermentation process, short-chain fatty acids and a series of gasses are normally produced.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It has been shown that patients with functional gut disorders have intestinal hypersensitivity along with impaired gas handling.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Under these conditions, increased gas production due to the fermentation of residues may worsen their symptoms. However, inulin intake did not cause any increase in symptoms such as bloating and flatulence or other side effects. Conceivably, the good response to inulin is related to the adaptation of microbiota activity. Prebiotics promote the proliferation of more efficacious microbiota such as bifidobacteria, which are able to ferment residues using metabolic pathways with lower gas release.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Prebiotics may also stimulate the growth of gas-consuming microorganisms; thus, reduced gas production may also be associated with increased gas consumption, and this adaptation may take place a few days following treatment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Only patients with a negative sensation of digestive well-being were included in the study.

This scale has been previously used in our laboratory and has been shown to provide a good discrimination between healthy subjects and patients with functional gut disorders and to detect changes in response to dietary interactions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In previous studies, the effects of inulin were investigated in a variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. Chicory-derived inulin has been shown to improve bowel motor function in patients with functional constipation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In our cohort, stool frequency increased slightly, yet nonsignificantly, during the 4-week intervention period, and stool consistency remained stable. Because the bowel habits in participants were within the normal range at study entry, we did not expect any improvements. The fact that inulin improved, clearance of the gas overload without affecting normal fecal transit or bowel habits in these patients, suggests that gas and the transport of solids are modulated by different mechanisms.</p><p>A recent trend involves advocating diets low in fermentable oligo-di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) to treat functional gut symptoms.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A low FODMAPs diet requires complex dietary advice, but a simple low-residue diet was proven to be effective in the short term<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and was even equal to FODMAPs restriction.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, a low FODMAPs diet may impoverish gut microbiota, which could be especially deleterious in patients who have been shown to harbor poor, less diverse and unstable microbiota.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Indeed, subjects who followed a low FODMAPs diet were shown to harbor reduced numbers of bifidobacteria, which are indicative of a healthy gut microbiota.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In this context, our study indicates that a daily dose of inulin, which promotes the proliferation of bifidobacteria, is well tolerated by hypersensitive subjects with gastrointestinal complaints and may have favorable effects on gut function. Hence, the current study would favor the use of inulin over restrictive dietary advice such as FODMAPs restriction to treat functional gastrointestinal symptoms, at least in patients with normal bowel habits or constipation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank American Journal Experts for English editing of the manuscript (Certificate Verification Key: AA4E-7997-6881-2599-204D) funded by SAF 2013-43677-R.
