For achieving a long-term high performance composite restoration, a good isolation especially near or at the gingival margin is needed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In a situation such as sub-gingival caries, class V cavity preparation, taking impression, cementation of all-ceramic restorations with margins near the gingiva, and chronic gingival inflammation preventing or eliminating gingival bleeding or contamination by crevicular fluid is very critical for the longevity of the restoration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Blood has high-protein content (approximately 6.7%) and fibrinogen macromolecules,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] on the other hand, because of protein attraction property of dentin, blood proteins can form a layer, which prevents resin infiltration into the dentin structure and reduces 30-70% of bond strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In the other words, in blood contamination situation, some reactions have occurred between dentin organic layer and the blood proteins that influence resin infiltration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, use of hemostatic agents for controlling of gingival bleeding and reducing sulcular fluid are indicated. They have presented in various formulations with different mechanism of action, such as aluminum chloride, ferric sulfate compounds, iron solution, aluminum and potassium sulfate and epinephrine 0.1%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Recent studies showed that most of them have acidic property (pH = 0.7-3) and hydrophilic characteristics that can contaminate each stage of bonding procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>By hemostatic agents&#x02019; application, smear layer was removed or some change in dentin surface happened that could affect the hybrid layer quality after the self-etch or etch-and-rinse adhesives usage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Contamination prevented penetration of adhesives into dentin surface and ultimately affect bond strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Therefore, the efficacy of self-etch and etch-and-rinse adhesive systems should be considered first and then recommended for clinical uses. This study evaluated the shear bond strength of one etch-and-rinse and two self-etch adhesives to human dentin contaminated with a ferric sulfate hemostatic agent. The null hypothesis of this study was that contamination with ferric sulfate 20% may not have any effect on shear bond strength of etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesive systems to dentin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental study, 60 intact caries-free human third molars were selected and cleaned up of soft tissues. Then, they were stored in a 0.5% Chloramine-T (Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) solution for 24 h. After they were rinsed, about 1.5-2 mm of buccal or lingual tooth structure (enamel and dentin) were removed by using a diamond bur (SS White, Great White Series, Lakewood, NJ, USA) to create flat surfaces of superficial dentin for testing (each bur was discarded after each five preparation). Dentin surfaces were ground with 400 and 600 grit sand paper under running water to produce a standardized smear layer. Teeth were mounted in self-cure acrylic resin. The samples were randomly assigned to six groups. Materials were used according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group 1: ViscoStat hemostatic agent (Ultradent Product Inc., Utah, USA) was applied for 60 s and then it was rinsed for 60 s thoroughly.

AdheSE One FAdheSE One FA plastic mold (2 mm in internal diameter and 4 mm in height) were used to prepare the composite (Tetric N-Ceram, Ivoclar/Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) cylinders on dentin surfaces. Composite were placed in two increments and each increment was light cured for 40 s. All samples were stored in distilled water for 24 h at room temperature, then were thermocycled for 500 cycles between 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C (with a 60 s dwell time and a 15 s transfer time).</p><p>The shear bond test was done using a Universal Testing Machine (M350-10CT Testometric, Lancashire, United Kingdom) at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. The shear bond strength was calculated in mega Pascal (MPa). Two examiners evaluated the debonded surfaces at &#x000d7; 40 magnifications by using a stereomicroscope (Olympus, DP 12, Germany) to identify the mode of bond failure whether adhesive, cohesive or mixed.

Phosphoric acid 37% because of its strong acidity (pH = 0.5) accompany with demineralization, can eliminate surface ViscoStat contamination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Furthermore, according to Fischer's study, phosphoric acid can decompose and destroy ferric sulfate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Kimmes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] study showed that rinsing contaminated dentin surfaces with ViscoStat and ViscoStat Plus after blood contamination did not alter shear bond strength of Optibond Solo Plus (Kerr, Orange, CA, USA) to dentin.</p><p>A study of Harnirattisin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] has shown that there were no differences in dentinal content between aluminum chloride (a hemostatic agent) contaminated dentin and non-contaminated one after acid etching.</p><p>In AdheSE groups, results showed that rinsing ViscoStat, alone, cannot eliminate surfaces contamination and thus the remnant ferric sulfate interfered with diffusion of AdheSE in dentinal tubules and reduce shear bond strength significantly.</p><p>In a Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) study by Ayo-Yusuf, contaminated dentinal surfaces with different hemostatic agents were studied. It was mentioned that hemostatic agents because of their acidic property (pH = 0.7-3), can dissolve smear layer and also obturated dentinal tubules orifices. They form an amorphous layer or a granular precipitation on the surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Because of the weak acidity of the primer of self-etch adhesives in comparison with phosphoric acid, it was predictable that they could not dissolve ViscoStat contamination so that their penetration to deeper areas of dentin was impossible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Several studies emphasize that hemostatic agent can cause derangement in bonding procedure because of dentinal tubules obturation and dentinal surface was demineralized in different values.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>O&#x02019;Keefe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] study showed that rinsing ferric sulfate and aluminum chloride hemostatic agents with water before using self-etch adhesives causes higher bond strength than non-rinsing ones.</p><p>AdheSE One F had moderate acidity strength (pH = 1.5) with 0.05 &#x003bc; penetration depth in dentin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] On the other hand, it seems that demineralized property of ViscoStat could be increased AdheSE One F dentinal diffusion depth and may be ViscoStat dissolved smear layer and smear plugs, which helps to better diffusion of AdheSE One F (or not interfered with AdheSE One F diffusion). Furthermore, in one study, it seems that despite control group that had a thick smear layer, in group with Aluminum chloride hemostatic agent contamination, the smear layer was partially removed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there were significant differences between contaminated groups. According to manufacturer's claim, ViscoStat is a water soluble gel and rinsing with water before bonding procedure is necessary. In etch-and-rinse adhesives because of lower pH of phosphoric acid and its capability for removing contaminants that lead to better diffusion of adhesive, the shear bond strength was higher than the others, where the demineralization effect on contaminated dentin was inhibited.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Also, there were significant differences among control groups where Tetric N-Bond had the highest and AdheSE One F had the lowest bond strength value. Phosphoric acid could cause much more microporosities in dentin than achieving better contact between adhesives and dentin substrate. Removing more smear layer resulted in more mechanical retention and bond strength,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] which can explain the higher bond strength in Tetric N-Bond in comparison with AdheSE and AdheSE One F. Hybrid layer in self-etch adhesives were uniform cylindrical resin tags but in etch-and-rinse adhesives were thicker with funnel-shaped resin tags.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Methacrylates in most of the self-etch adhesives (such as AdheSE) in acidic solutions are not stable, because of hydrolysis of ester groups that causes weaker cross-linking, an inadequate polymerization, lower bond strength and lower bonding durability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The presence of HEMA in AdheSE composition, prevents phase separation and collagen collapse in adhesive bottle and helps better adhesive diffusion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] unlike it can maintain water in adhesive layer and weakened mechanical strength in long-term[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Hence to prevent this problem, &#x0201c;HEMA free&#x0201d; adhesives were introduced (such as AdheSE One F). In &#x0201c;HEMA free&#x0201d; adhesives, higher concentration of solvents was necessary but after solvent evaporation, homogeneity of one-step self-etch adhesives was disturbed and phase separation and water blister formation happened. These water blisters promoted to reduce hydrolytic stability of adhesive even after polymerization and bond strength reduction happened. Hybrid layer in one-step and two-step self-etch adhesives were semi permeable that water can transfer through the tooth-composite interface even after polymerization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>The differences in depth of penetration in dentin (AdheSE: 1.2-2.2 &#x003bc;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], AdheSE One F: 0.05 &#x003bc;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]) could explain the differences of their bond strength, which resulted from this study.</p><p>The presence of hydrophobic monomers and hydrophilic acids in one bottle in one-step self-etch adhesives could compromise polymerization steps and also waters in dentinal tubules, caused incomplete polymerization at the interface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>All these problems can explain lower bond strength in AdheSE One F group in comparison with AdheSE and these findings were in agreement with Gr&#x000e9;goire <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and Knobloch <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] studies.</p><p>In filled adhesives such as AdheSE and AdheSE One F, polymerization shrinkage reduced but because of lesser diffusion in dentin, bond strength reduced as well.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>According to Mousavinasab and Kavian[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] study, one-bottle adhesive (such as AdheSE One F) had a very thin hybrid layer where polymerization may be damaged because of the oxygen inhibiting layer formation.</p><p>Some self-etch adhesives could not diffuse through smear layer because of their weak acidity in which they buffered with smear layer, enamel and dentin. Buffered primer or adhesive had lower penetration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Tooth demineralization with self-etch adhesives has contrary with tooth buffering capacity and these adhesives could show different behavior. AdheSE One F was one of the new presented products, which had an unknown behavior in adhesion.</p><p>According to Proen&#x000e7;a <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] study in 2009, lower degree of conversion of self-etch adhesive and water trees builds up (pertain to water diffusion from underlying dentin to hybrid layer) was the main reason of lower bond strength of self-etch adhesive in comparison with etch-and-rinse adhesives.</p><p>If bond strength to dentin or enamel was more than 20 MPa, mode of failure dominantly happened cohesively in tooth structure or composite.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In this study, cohesive failure was seen in etch-and-rinse groups more than self-etch groups. Indeed, the higher bond strength in control groups showed the lower adhesive failures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that dentin contamination with ViscoStat hemostatic agent had an adverse effect on the shear bond strength of two-step self-etch adhesive, AdheSE, and reduced it.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was resulted from a student thesis which supported by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.
