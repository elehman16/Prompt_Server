Although preliminary reports in normotensive African-Americans demonstrate no difference in homeostasis model assessment &#x02013; IR (HOMA-IR) compared to whites, blacks had higher glycated hemoglobin, impaired oral glucose tolerance test parameters and higher incidence of T2DM.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is thus unclear whether the effect of antihypertensive therapy on IR will exhibit any inter-ethnic differences. We found no report of any ethnic comparison of these drugs on IR in Africans.

The study was carried out at the Department of Medicine and General Outpatients Clinic of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital (LTH), Oshogbo, Nigeria. LTH is a 200-bed tertiary health facility located in Oshogbo, the capital city of Osun State. Oshogbo is located in the tropical rain forest belt of Southwestern part of Nigeria and is about 200 km from Lagos the commercial capital city of Nigeria.</p><p>All participants gave written informed consent. The Research and Ethics Committee of LTH approved the study. A total of eighty consecutive subjects (convenient sample size) aged 40 years and above attending the hypertension clinic of LTH with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, that is, blood pressure (BP) &#x02265;140/90 mmHg (systolic BP [SBP] &#x02265;140 mmHg and diastolic BP [DBP] &#x02265;90 mmHg) on at least two occasions, were recruited for this study. Other inclusion criteria were fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x02264;6.1 mmol/l and provision of written informed consent to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were subjects with SBP &#x0003e;170 mmHg and DBP &#x0003e;110 mmHg; those with secondary hypertension, cardiac, or renal failure and those with known hypersensitivity to a study drug. In addition, pregnant women and those breastfeeding were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Subjects meeting the BP and other criteria for eligibility were entered into a 12-week treatment protocol and assigned into one of two treatment groups &#x02013; HCT monotherapy 25 mg daily or HCT-Lis combination 25/10 mg daily. During this treatment period, those with persistently high BP (i.e., SBP &#x02265;160 and DBP &#x02265;100 mmHg) after the second visit (patients were seen every 4 weeks), were given calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) as a rescue drug. Amlodipine has been shown to have a neutral effect on blood glucose.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The primary end point was the change in HOMA-IR value from baseline to end of study (week 12). Changes in FPG, serum potassium, serum insulin, and BP over the same period were also evaluated.</p><p>Beta-cell function (BCF) was assessed using HOMA. Before treatment, blood samples were collected for FPG, insulin, lipid profile, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. Baseline HOMA-IR value was calculated using the result of fasting plasma insulin at week 0. Blood samples were collected again after 12 weeks of therapy for the analysis of FPG, insulin, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and the calculation of HOMA-IR.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Test instruments</title><p>HOMA is a computer-solved model used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of &#x003b2;-cell deficiency and IR.

This study showed that after 12 weeks of therapy, there was no statistically significant change in IS in either of the two groups. Further, HCT monotherapy did not significantly affect IS as measured using HOMA-IR. Our results do not support the findings of previous studies comparing inhibitors of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (ACEI or ARB) with HCT therapy, in which most study participants demonstrated worsening of IS as measured using HOMA-IR index with HCT monotherapy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This absence of deterioration in HOMA-IR could be partly explained by the lack of development of hypokalemia in our subjects. Hypokalemia, one of the metabolic derangements induced by thiazide-diuretics reduces insulin secretory ability through the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels in Beta-islet pancreatic cells and worsens peripheral IS.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There are suggestions that preventing hypokalemia or keeping serum potassium between 4.0 and 4.5 mmol/L reduce or eliminate the risk of diuretic-induced dysglycemia or diabetes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Diuretic related reduction in serum potassium is typically dose-related and usually ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 mmol/L. In this study, the mean change in serum potassium was similar to these values, 0.3 &#x000b1; 0.9 mmol/L for the HCT group and 0.2 &#x000b1; 0.8 mmol/L in the HCT-Lis group; these represents a percentage change of 5.7% and 4.5% for the HCT monotherapy and combination therapy groups, respectively.</p><p>A similar potassium change was found by both Okoro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Adigun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who used HCT to treat hypertension. Studies in which higher doses of up to 50 mg of HCT was employed as monotherapy in hypertensives similarly showed the percentage change in plasma potassium of 4.9%.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>When combined with ACEI enalapril (10 mg) with 50 mg HCT, a 7.9% fall in serum potassium was observed in hypertensive diabetic patients after 12 weeks of combination therapy, the fasting and postprandial plasma glucose likewise fell.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>A meta-analysis of 59 studies involving 83 thiazide-diuretic treatment arms found a significant correlation between the degree of diuretic-induced hypokalemia and the increase in plasma glucose, and there was evidence that prevention of hypokalemia with potassium supplementation or potassium-sparing agents lessened the degree to which plasma glucose increased consequently to diuretic therapy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, the change in plasma potassium appears to be related inversely to blood glucose change. The well-described effects of hyperkalemia in stimulating insulin secretion[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and insulin in inducing cellular uptake of potassium[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] suggest that low plasma potassium could impair insulin secretion and thereby increasing plasma glucose.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The lack of significant change in potassium levels in our study does not support findings from a previous report suggesting greater hypokalemic effect of thiazide diuretics in American blacks.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This lack of significant reduction in potassium levels may reflect the low-renin, volume-dependent nature of hypertension in Nigerians, which may alter K+ homeostasis in response to therapy in blacks[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or the relatively higher salt/potassium intake of the subjects studied.</p><p>IS was lower at 12 weeks in both treatment groups compared with baseline values. There was also a 10% reduction in IS in the HCT-monotherapy group compared with 4% reduction in the HCT-Lis combination group. There was a clear trend to Lis mitigation of IR following HCT. However, neither of changes attained statistical significance, probably reflecting a type 2 error. Similar worsening of IS with an increase in new-onset diabetes with thiazide diuretics was found in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The result of this study showed that body composition as measured by the WC, WHR and BMI as well as both SBP and DBP correlated positively with IR. However, diastolic BP and WC were the major contributors to IR as measured by HOMA-IR. This is consistent with the findings of several studies showing a positive association between IR and abdominal adiposity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with resistance to the effects of insulin on peripheral glucose and fatty acid utilization, often leading to T2DM. IR, the associated hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, and adipocyte cytokines (adipokines) may also lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction, an abnormal lipid profile, hypertension, and vascular inflammation, all of which constitute the metabolic syndrome and promote the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p><p>HCT/Lis combination therapy was more efficacious than HCT monotherapy in lowering BP. Adigun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have previously made a similar observation among hypertensives in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.

First, no formal power calculations were undertaken to determine sample size to achieve 80% power at 5% alpha level to detect HCT versus HCT/Lis differences. There was a brevity of follow-up and we did not determine if any of our treated patients developed frank T2DM in this study. Ethnic differences will be better detected by direct comparison of black and white hypertensive patients in the same study, instead of historical data comparison. Nevertheless, the short-term safety of the drugs and lack of gender impact was seen in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>There was no statistically significant difference in the metabolic effects of compared to HCT/Lis combination, after 12 weeks of treatment in black African hypertensives. This however, represents short-term effects; as more pronounced effects of thiazide diuretics, and possibly also of ACEI, on BCF may occur in the longer term or at higher doses. The similarity observed in the metabolic impact of the two drug treatment groups may be due to the low dose of HCT employed.
