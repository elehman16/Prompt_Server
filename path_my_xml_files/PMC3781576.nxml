often leads to substantial limitations of occupational, educational, social
and personal activities. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the
treatment. Patients try many different therapies to overcome their fatigue.
Although there is no consensus, cognitive behavioural therapy is seen as one
of the most effective treatments. Little is known about multidisciplinary
rehabilitation treatment, a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy
with principles of mindfulness, gradual increase of activities, body
awareness therapy and pacing. The difference in effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness between multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment and
cognitive behavioural therapy is as yet unknown. The FatiGo (Fatigue-Go)
trial aims to compare the effects of both treatment approaches in outpatient
rehabilitation on fatigue severity and quality of life in patients with
chronic fatigue syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred twenty patients who meet the criteria of chronic fatigue
syndrome, fulfil the inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent form
will be recruited. Both treatments take 6 months to complete. The outcome
will be assessed at 6 and 12 months after the start of treatment. Two weeks
after the start of treatment, expectancy and credibility will be measured,
and patients will be asked to write down their personal goals and score
their current performance on these goals on a visual analogue scale. At 6
and 14 weeks after the start of treatment, the primary outcome and three
potential mediators&#x02014;self-efficacy, causal attributions and
present-centred attention-awareness&#x02014;will be measured. Primary outcomes
are fatigue severity and quality of life. Secondary outcomes are physical
activity, psychological symptoms, self-efficacy, causal attributions, impact
of disease on emotional and physical functioning, present-centred
attention-awareness, life satisfaction, patient personal goals, self-rated
improvement and economic costs. The primary analysis will be based on
intention to treat, and longitudinal analysis of covariance will be used to
compare treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the trial will provide information on the effects of cognitive
behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment at 6 and
12 months follow-up, mediators of the outcome, cost-effectiveness,
cost-utility, and the influence of treatment expectancy and credibility on
the effectiveness of both treatments in patients with chronic fatigue
syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN77567702.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic fatigue syndrome</kwd><kwd>CBT</kwd><kwd>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Fatigue</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), patients experience extreme fatigue that is
medically unexplained. Many patients feel limited in their daily activities, and are
not able to work at all or as much as they did before their CFS started
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Social and leisure activities
are reduced in most patients, and quality of life is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Of the current definitions of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we use
the definition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-94): a
persistent or relapsing unexplained fatigue, of new or definite onset and lasting
for at least 6 months, in which fatigue is not the result of an organic disease or
ongoing exertion. Rest does not alleviate the fatigue, and there is substantial
limitation of occupational, educational, social and personal activities. To support
the diagnosis, four or more of the following symptoms should be present for more
than 6 months: impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or
axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, pain in several joints, new headaches,
unrefreshing sleep or malaise after exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Three studies from the UK and the USA, using this
definition, show prevalence rates between 0.23 and 0.50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In The
Netherlands approximately 30,000-40,000 patients suffer from CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of CFS is unclear. Researchers have considered somatic (e.g.
viral infection, dysfunction of the central nervous system, immune dysfunction and
neuroendocrine responses) and psychosocial hypotheses. A commonly used hypothesis
relates CFS to stress. According to Van Houdenhove [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], patients have a reduced effort tolerance, which might be
interpreted as a fundamental failure of the stress system after a period of severe
or prolonged physical and/or psychosocial stress in vulnerable individuals. The
failure of the stress system may lead to disturbances in the nervous, hormone and
immune systems. Many studies have tried to investigate different parts of these
systems, but the precise mechanisms are still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although there is no consensus
on the pathophysiology of CFS, most researchers and clinicians believe that the
aetiology is multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Different predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors play an important role
in the aetiology of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Lifestyle and
personality characteristics like neuroticism and introversion are examples of
predisposing factors for developing CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Acute physical of psychological stress are
precipitating factors that may trigger the onset of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cognitions, beliefs and attributions about complaints
and behavioural factors such as persistent avoidance of activities are associated
with an increase of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other
perpetuating factors are a strong belief in a physical cause of the illness, a
strong focus on physical sensations and poor sense of control over the complaints.
Social processes, for example lack of social support, also contribute to the
perpetuation of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although many patients suffer from CFS, many parts of this syndrome are still unclear
and need further research in order to understand the pathophysiology and aetiology,
and to improve and customise treatment to individuals in accordance with the
different pathophysiology and/or aetiology.</p><sec><title>Relevance</title><p>Many studies have investigated the effects of different treatments that are
targeted towards one or two aspects of the complaints. Little is known about
treatments that are targeted towards more aspects of the complaints and combine
different interventions in multidisciplinary settings. Although a few treatments
that are targeted towards one or two aspects of the complaints have significant
effect on fatigue severity and quality of life, no consensus exists on the
treatment of patients with CFS. Many patients try different therapies to
overcome their fatigue, varying from pharmacological treatment (for example
immunoglobulin therapy and fludrocortisone therapy) to non-pharmacological
treatments (for example massage therapy and osteopathy). Several reviews
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]
compare different treatments. Immediately post-treatment, cognitive behavioural
therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) are the only interventions found
to be beneficial in reducing the severity of fatigue symptoms when compared with
usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. At medium term (with a maximal of 14 months after
baseline), CBT is also more effective than usual care in reducing fatigue
severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The review by Edmonds et
al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed two studies that found
no significant difference between GET and treatment as usual/relaxation in the
severity of fatigue at medium term. On quality of life, one study investigating
the benefits of CBT compared to usual care found no significant difference post
treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Three studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] analysed the change in quality of life
between GET and treatment as usual, and found that the physical function
subscale improved significantly with exercise therapy immediately post
treatment. Besides studies in which CBT and GET are compared to usual care,
three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], compared CBT with other psychological
therapies. They provide evidence that CBT was more effective in reducing the
severity of fatigue symptoms in CFS patients post treatment, but the evidence of
medium- and long-term follow-up was inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In three other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]
CBT was compared to GET and showed a lack of difference between both treatments
in reducing fatigue levels at post-treatment and at medium-term follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the randomised trial of
White et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], CBT and GET were
compared with adaptive pacing therapy (APT) and specialist medical care (SMC)
alone. Participants had less fatigue and better physical function after CBT and
GET than they did after APT or SMC alone.</p><p>Although several studies have shown positive effects on reducing fatigue severity
after treatment, some CFS patient groups are negative about CBT, as well as GET
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>At this time, most treatments are targeted towards one or two aspects of the
complaints, but various experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] recommend using CBT in
combination with other interventions or in a multidisciplinary setting in order
to increase treatment effectiveness. To date, only a few studies have reported
results of a multidisciplinary approach in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
Two uncontrolled studies among young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] reported positive effects
of multidisciplinary interventions. Viner et al. (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] assessed the outcome of multidisciplinary
rehabilitation group treatment (graded activity/exercise programme, family
sessions and supportive care) compared with supportive care alone. Results
showed positive effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment on
wellness, school attendance and severity of fatigue. A study by Voet et al.
(2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] in adolescents with chronic
pain and fatigue also showed strong positive effects on fatigue severity,
school/work attendance and general health after multidisciplinary rehabilitation
treatment. In an uncontrolled study, Torenbeek et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] evaluated a multidisciplinary group
program with a combination of clinical and outpatient treatment in a
rehabilitation centre. Patients were coached by a rehabilitation physician,
psychologist, physical therapist, social worker, occupational therapist,
exercise and sports coach, and a group leader. Positive effects were found on
fatigue severity, experienced impairments and physical functioning, post
treatment. In another uncontrolled pilot study of Vos-Vromans (2005) in Revant
Rehabilitation Centre Breda, in which the MRT was evaluated among 36 patients,
the results were promising: fatigue severity and the impact of disease on
emotional and physical functioning decreased significantly post treatment and
persisted 12 months after start of treatment. Although the results of these
studies are promising, conclusions should be drawn carefully, because all
studies were uncontrolled. None of the above studies included information about
the cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment, which
might facilitate the decision process regarding treatment selection for
practitioners as well as policy makers. Therefore, these findings need to be
confirmed in randomised controlled trials including an economic evaluation.</p><p>In summary, CBT is the most effective treatment at this time; therefore, CBT
needs to be compared with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach to
investigate which treatment is the most effective and most cost-effective.
Because effects of CBT on quality of life and other secondary outcomes in the
medium and long term are inconclusive, more research is needed to examine how to
sustain the treatment effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The FatiGo trial is designed to address the following primary objectives:</p><p> 1. To assess the differences in treatment effect (change between baseline and
6-month follow-up in fatigue severity and quality of life) in patients with CFS
between individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment (MRT) and
individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p><p> 2. To assess the differences in long-term treatment effect (change between
baseline and 12-month follow-up in fatigue severity and quality of life) in
patients with CFS between the two treatments.</p><p> 3. To assess the difference in cost-effectiveness and cost-utility between MRT
and CBT from both a health care and societal perspective at 12-month
follow-up.</p><p> 4. To assess the differences in treatment effect in psychological symptoms,
self-efficacy, causal attributions, present-centred attention-awareness, impact
of disease on physical and emotional functioning, self-rated improvement and
life satisfaction between MRT and CBT (at 6- and 12-month follow-up).</p><p>The secondary objectives of this trial are:</p><p> 1. To assess the influence of patients treatment expectancy and credibility on
the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p> 2. To assess what baseline factors (other than the assigned treatment) predict a
change in fatigue and increase in quality of life in all participants.</p><p> 3. To evaluate whether changes in self-efficacy, changes in causal attributions
and/ or changes in present-centred attention-awareness (at baseline, 6 and 14
weeks after start of treatment) mediate changes in fatigue severity and changes
in quality of life after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypotheses on the primary objectives</title><p> (1) MRT is more effective than CBT in reducing fatigue severity and increasing
quality of life 6 months after start of treatment.</p><p> (2) MRT is more effective than CBT in reducing fatigue severity and increasing
quality of life 12 months after start of treatment.</p><p> (3) MRT is more cost-effective than CBT when data on medical and non-medical
costs are compared over a 12-month period and shows a higher cost-utility.</p><p> (4) MRT is more effective than CBT in increasing self-efficacy, non-physical
attributions, present-centred attention-awareness and life satisfaction, and is
more effective in decreasing the impact of disease on physical and emotional
functioning and decreasing the psychological symptoms. Self-rated improvement is
significantly higher in MRT than in CBT (at 6- and 12-month follow-up).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A two-arm, pragmatic, randomised, multi-centre controlled trial of patients with
CFS, with follow-up of 1 year (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The RCT

Rehabilitation Centre Breda (RRCB), Rehabilitation Centre Blixembosch in
Eindhoven (RCB), Reade Centre for Rheumatology and Rehabilitation in Amsterdam
(RCRR) and Adelante Rehabilitation Centre in Hoensbroek (ARC). Patients are
referred to the trial by their general practitioner or a medical specialist.
Patients are treated individually in an outpatient setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval for the FatiGo trial was provided by the Research Ethics

research assistant screens the information provided by the referring general
practitioner or medical specialist. The research assistant sends the patient
information on the study and asks the patient to fill in the Checklist
Individual Strength to measure fatigue and the Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If the patient has a CIS
fatigue score of 40 or more, the patient is invited for an intake with the
rehabilitation physician. All patients are screened by a rehabilitation
physician to check the in- and exclusion criteria. The rehabilitation physician
will verify whether an extensive physical examination and laboratory research
according the guidelines for chronic fatigue syndrome by the Dutch Diagnostic
Compass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] have been done by a general
practitioner, consultant in internal medicine, neurologist or psychiatrist to
exclude any underlying illness. If the rehabilitation physician needs a second
opinion to decide whether a patient meets the in- or exclusion criteria or when
the HADS depression score is 11 or higher, an intake with a psychologist is
planned.</p><p>The rehabilitation physician explains the procedures of the study, and if someone
meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria, he asks
the patient to sign a (written) agreement. The research assistant contacts the
patient after 1 week to make an appointment for signing the informed consent
form and for the baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>The interventions</title><p>The two interventions to be compared, MRT and CBT, take 6 months to complete.</p><p>Three elements are incorporated in both treatment groups:</p><p> 1) Modification of dysfunctional beliefs regarding illness symptoms and
activity, and development of more adequate and effective coping strategies.</p><p> 2) Gradual increase of activities.</p><p> 3) Normalisation of sleep/wake rhythm.</p><p>These elements are incorporated in both treatments in a different way (see
below).</p><sec><title>Individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</title><p>CBT is a psychotherapeutic approach in which elements of behavioural therapy
and cognitive therapy approaches are incorporated. In CBT, a model of
perpetuating cognitions and behaviour of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is used to explain the persistence of CFS. This
model shows that high physical attributions will decrease physical activity
and increase fatigue and functional impairment. This model also explains
that a low level of sense of control over symptoms and focusing on physical
sensations have a direct causal effect on fatigue severity and functional
impairment. A perceived lack of social support also increases the fatigue
severity and functional impairment. These perpetuating factors (high
physical attributions, decreased physical activity, low level of sense of
control, focusing on physical sensations and perceived lack of social
support) are the focus of the intervention in CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>CBT is divided into three phases:</p><p> 1) Intake</p><p> 2) Gradual reactivation</p><p> 3) Prevention of relapse</p><p> 1) Intake</p><p>During the intake phase (four sessions in 4 weeks), the cognitive behavioural
therapist gets acquainted with the patient. The patient is asked about: the
cause and course of the complaints, the present complaints, illness beliefs
and illness behaviour, coping, social interactions/participation, and the
expectations and personal goals of the patient. The therapist tries to
determine the patient&#x02019;s activity level by asking about activities
during the day and week, and categorises the patient into a relatively
active patient or a patient with a low activity pattern. The therapist
explains the model of perpetuating cognitions and behaviour of CFS, and how
to overcome CFS by changing patterns of thinking and changing behaviour.</p><p> 2) Gradual reactivation</p><p> Graded exercise therapy (GET) is used to gradually increase physical
activity. The patient follows a schedule to gradually increase activities at
home (walking and bicycling). The schedule is provided by the therapist in
accordance with the patient&#x02019;s personal goals. The patient has to
increase his/her activities at home and receives feedback afterwards during
the next therapy session. If needed, schedules are made to increase social
and/or mental activities as well. Another important subject during gradual
reactivation is the balance between different activities and the
patient&#x02019;s personal responsibility to see to it.</p><p> In the dialogues with the therapist and by doing exercises at home, the
patient is taught to change negative beliefs regarding symptoms of fatigue,
self-expectations and self-esteem. Specific lifestyle changes are encouraged
if deemed appropriate.</p><p> Sleep/wake rhythm: the patient is encouraged to change the sleep/wake rhythm
immediately at the start of treatment into a regular sleep/wake rhythm.
Sleeping during the day is not allowed.</p><p> In accordance with the principles of GET, a plan to return to work will be
made.</p><p> 3) Prevention of relapse:</p><p>If activities are increased and the sleep/wake rhythm is normalised, the
patient is encouraged to unsettle him-/herself and to cope with these
disturbances by applying the things he/she learned during therapy. Personal
goals are evaluated and relapse prevention is addressed.</p><p>The patient assigned to this group will attend 16 individual therapy
sessions, spread out over 6 months with a psychologist or behavioural
therapist. The first 6 weeks, the patient has weekly contact with the
therapist, followed by once every 2 weeks for the next 20 weeks. The CBT
protocol is fixed and different for relatively active patients and patients
with a low activity pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the treatment for the relatively
active patient, the patient learns to spread out activities during the day
and to vary different activities during the day. The patient learns to be
active within physical and mental boundaries to overcome overburdening. With
the use of cognitive therapy, cognitions and behaviour that may lead to
overburdening (like not accepting boundaries in activity, and having high
expectations) are the primary focus of treatment. After reaching the
baseline (without peaks in complaints of the CFS) there will be a gradual
increase of activities. For patients with a low activity pattern, activities
will be increased from the beginning of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment (MRT)</title><p>In multidisciplinary treatment, a biopsychosocial model of CFS is used
including biological, physical and psychosocial aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the
biopsychosocial model of CFS various precipitating, predisposing and
perpetuating factors are merged, suggesting that multiple pathways may lead
to the causation and persistence of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The protocol of the MRT is not fixed, but varies
between patients, depending on the relation between treatable components
(precipitating, predisposing and perpetuating factors), present complaints
and personal needs of a patient. The focus of treatment can be different for
each patient depending on these relations. During treatment every therapist
fills in treatment checklists for every patient to register which methods
are used.</p><p>MRT is divided into three phases:</p><p> 1) Observation</p><p> 2) Treatment</p><p> 3) Prevention of relapse</p><p> 1) Observation</p><p>During a 2-week observation, therapists (psychologist, social worker,
physical therapist and occupational therapist) get acquainted with the
patient. During observation, they ask the patient about: the cause and
course of the complaints, the present complaints, illness beliefs and
illness behaviour, coping, the social environment the patient lives in,
expectations and personal goals. The psychologist (two 1-h sessions) further
elaborates on the psychological history, present psychological wellbeing,
use of medical care including medication, stress factors, cognitions,
attitudes and mood (state of mind). The social worker (two 1-h sessions)
assesses the social context in which the patient lives (relationships,
family and role in a family), work situation and communication. The physical
therapist (five 30-min sessions) makes an estimation of the physical
condition and the patient&#x02019;s body awareness. The occupational therapist
(four 30-min sessions) aims at ergonomics, lifestyle, day/week schedule and
the variety of activities during the day/week. During observation, the
treatable components are weighted in relation to the present complaints. If
a strong relation exists between these components and the present
complaints, these components will be addressed during treatment. In a team
meeting, therapists and the rehabilitation physician discuss the components
and methods that will be used during the treatment phase. The rehabilitation
physician will discuss the conclusions of this meeting with the patient and
ask for commitment to the proposed therapy. A treatment contract will be
signed by the rehabilitation physician and the patient.</p><p> 2) Treatment</p><p>Two weeks after ending the observation phase, the treatment phase starts.
This phase takes 10 weeks to complete. Depending on the patient goals/needs
and the relation between treatable components and present complaints,
different methods will be more or less used in the treatment phase. The
following methods can be incorporated:</p><p> Body awareness therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]: aims to establish an increased awareness and
consciousness of the body and its relation to psychological wellbeing. The
patient learns to discriminate bodily symptoms other than fatigue and pain
and learns to react on these healthy bodily symptoms. The patient will be
coached by a physical therapist. Bodyscan, grounding, awareness exercises of
the influence of thoughts and emotions on the body are some of the exercises
that will be practised during treatment. In the end, the patient will be
aware of the relation between the body, its physical function, psychological
wellbeing and social interaction, and is able to react on stress in an
appropriate way.</p><p> Cognitive behavioural therapy: A psychotherapeutic approach in which
elements of behavioural and cognitive therapy approaches are incorporated.
CBT facilitates the identification of unhelpful, negative emotion-provoking
thoughts, dysfunctional emotions, behaviours and cognitive patterns, and
challenges them through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. The patient
learns to identify negative beliefs regarding the symptoms of fatigue,
self-expectations or self-esteem, and is encouraged to challenge and change
them into new, more realistic, more helpful alternatives.</p><p> Gradual reactivation: At the start of treatment, activities are trained time
contingent under close supervision of the physical therapist and
occupational therapist. The patient follows schedules to gradually increase
activities and receives immediate feedback during treatment when needed. The
schedules of fitness exercises and swimming are provided by the physical
therapist in accordance with the patient&#x02019;s personal goals. Another
schedule is provided by the occupational therapist in accordance with the
patient&#x02019;s personal goals to increase activity and vary activities at
home. In the final phase of treatment, schedules are of less importance and
the patient is encouraged to increase activities on his/her own without
following a schedule (see pacing).</p><p> Pacing: During the second phase of treatment, the patient is taught to pace
his/her activities during the day/week. By developing awareness of healthy
bodily symptoms the patient will be able to balance his/her activities
(psychological as well as physical activities) before extreme fatigue or
pain prevails. The schedule of time-contingent increase is no longer
followed. The patient will pace his/her activities based on his/her own
experiences.</p><p> Principles of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a non-elaborative,
non-judgemental, present-centred awareness in which each thought, feeling or
sensation that arises is acknowledged and accepted as it is. The patient
learns to self-regulate attention that is maintained on immediate
experience, thereby allowing for increased recognition of mental events in
the present moment. They also learn to observe the thoughts, emotions and
sensations that arise, without making judgements about their truth,
importance or value, and without trying to escape, avoid or change them.
Regular practice of mindfulness skills increases self-awareness and
self-acceptance, reduces reactivity to passing thoughts and emotions, and
improves the ability to make adaptive choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In patients who have been chronically ill,
mindfulness skills have a positive effect on depression, mood and activity
level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p> Normalising of the sleep/wake rhythm. The sleep/wake rhythm will be
discussed and with a schedule of 4 weeks will be gradually changed to the
sleep/wake rhythm the patient desires. Sleeping during the day will be
stopped immediately. If there are problems with the quality of sleep,
principles of sleep hygiene are prescribed by the psychologist. Relaxation
therapy is used to increase the efficiency of the resting moments during the
day and to improve the quality of sleep during the night if needed.</p><p> Social reintegration. Under supervision of the occupational therapist and
social worker, the patient is coached to reintegrate into society by making
a plan to return to his/her work or school, and to increase their social
activities.</p><p> 3) Prevention of relapse</p><p>Six weeks after ending the treatment phase, the patient will visit the social
worker. Thirteen weeks after ending the treatment phase, the patient will
visit two therapists of his/her choice who were involved in the previous
treatment. Both after-care visits are used to stimulate and motivate the
patient to practice at home what he/she has learned during the treatment
phase.</p><p>Although MRT and CBT have three corresponding aims&#x02014;modification of
dysfunctional beliefs, gradual increase of activities and normalisation of
sleep/wake rhythm&#x02014;many differences can be detected between the two
treatments. The main differences are viewed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Differences between CBT and MRT</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>CBT</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>MRT</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Treatment focus on perpetuating factors<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Treatment focus depending on the relation between the

Each team consists of one or two rehabilitation physicians or physician
assistants (under supervision of a rehabilitation physician), one or two
psychologists/behavioural therapists, two social workers, two physical
therapists and two occupational therapists. Six other psychologists/cognitive
behavioural therapists deliver the cognitive behavioural therapy in the four
participating rehabilitation centres. The psychologists of the CBT group are not
involved in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment and meetings with a
supervisor will be organised separately for both groups of psychologists.</p><sec><title>CBT</title><p>All psychologists and behavioural therapists are trained in CBT. A 3-day
workshop before the start of the study was held, guided by an external CBT
expert, who is acquainted with the CBT protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] to ensure that
execution of CBT is similar and up to standard in each centre. During the
trial seven supervision meetings are organised in which audiotaped sessions
provided during the trial are used to evaluate the therapy. Therapists are
free to contact their supervisor when questions arise.</p></sec><sec><title>MRT</title><p>Before the beginning of the study, the therapists of RRCB, who work with the
protocol for at least 5 years, organised separate workshops for each
involved discipline and a multidisciplinary team meeting in which the
therapists got acquainted with the MRT protocol. During the trial two
disciplinary supervision meetings and two multidisciplinary team supervision
meetings will be held. Therapists are free to contact their supervisor when
questions arise.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of patients</title><p>The inclusion of new patients took place from November 2008 until January 2011.
Potential referrers of patients to the four rehabilitation centres were informed
about the developments of the trial by newsletters four times during the trial.
Several articles on Internet sites and in magazines of patient support groups
were published to inform patients about the trial and how they could be
referred.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcome parameter:</p><p> Fatigue severity is assessed by a subscale of the Checklist Individual
Strength (CIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The subscale consists of eight items, each scored
on a 7-point Likert scale (range 8&#x02013;56). Validity and reliability of
the scale are good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p> Quality of life is assessed by the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The SF-36 has eight subscales:
physical functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2
items), general health (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2
items), role-emotional (3 items) and mental health (5 items). Every subscale
is transformed into ratings on a scale of 0 (limited in all activities) to
100 (able to carry out vigorous activities). The validity and reliability of
every subscale are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Secondary outcome parameters are:</p><p> 1. Psychological symptoms will be measured with the Symptom Check List-90
(SCL-90). The SCL-90 is a multidimensional questionnaire designed to screen
for a broad range of psychological problems. The questionnaire consists of
90 items. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 is &#x02018;not at
all&#x02019; and 4 is &#x02018;extremely&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The items are
combined in the following primary symptom dimensions: somatisation,
obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety,
anger-hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoneuroticism
(total score of the SCL-90). The validity and discriminating validity are
good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p> 2. Self-efficacy will be measured with the Self-Efficacy Scale-28 (SES 28)
to compare sense of control in relation to CFS complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The scale
consists of seven questions. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale. The
total score ranges from 7 to 28. A higher score means more sense of
control.</p><p> 3. Causal attributions will be measured with the Causal Attribution List
(CAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The CAL assesses whether
the patient is likely to attribute complaints to physical or non-physical
causes. The list consists of ten questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale.
Total subscale scores of physical and non-physical attributions range from 5
to 20. A higher score indicates a stronger conviction.</p><p> 4. Present-centred attention-awareness, which is foundational to
mindfulness, will be measured with the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale
(MAAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The validity and
reliability of the Dutch version of the MAAS are good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The MAAS consists of 15 statements
scored on a 6-point Likert scale. The mean total score ranges from 1 to 6. A
higher score indicates a greater awareness of present experiences.</p><p> 5. A patient&#x02019;s personal treatment goals will be measured with the
Patient-Specific Complaints and Goals questionnaire (PSCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The patient selects three activities
that he/she perceives as important in his/her daily life and wants to
improve. The patient rates the performance of the activity on a 100-mm
visual analogue scale (VAS). The left side of the VAS is marked as &#x02018;no
problems at all&#x02019;. On the right side the VAS is marked
&#x02018;impossible&#x02019;. The PSCG is a valid and reliable measure with
sufficient responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p> 6. Sickness Impact Profile-8 will be used to measure the impact of disease
on both physical and emotional functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The SIP-8 is derived from the SIP. The SIP8
has eight subscales: home management, mobility, alertness behaviour,
sleep/rest, ambulation, social interaction, work, and recreation and
pastimes. Psychometric research has indicated that the SIP is reliable and
valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p> 7. Physical activity will be measured by a multisensor armband (Sense Wear
Pro Armband; BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The armband was developed to
measure energy expenditure by integrating accelerometry with multiple
physiologic sensors including galvanic skin resistance, heat flux, body
temperature and near body ambient temperature. The armband is worn 7
consecutive days on the right upper arm over the triceps muscle and monitors
various physiological and movement parameters. The armband provides a
reproducible and accurate measure in subjects with chronic illness with
moderate functional limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p> 8. Six questions are used to measure self-rated improvement after therapy
and the satisfaction of the patient. The questions: &#x02018;How satisfied are
you with the effect of treatment&#x02019;? &#x02018;Is there a difference in how
you handle problems now compared to before treatment started?&#x02019; and
&#x02018;Is there a difference in your daily activities now compared to your
situation before treatment started?&#x02019; are scored on a 5-point Likert
scale (&#x02018;1&#x02019; is very content/much improvement and &#x02018;5&#x02019;
is very discontented/situation is worse). The question: &#x02018;To what
extend did you achieve your personal treatment goals?&#x02019; is scored on a
10-point Likert scale, range 1&#x02013;10. The questions: &#x02018;Would you
recommend the treatment to other CFS patients?&#x02019; can be answered with
&#x02018;yes&#x02019;, &#x02018;no&#x02019; or &#x02018;I don&#x02019;t know&#x02019;. The
question: &#x02018;Do you still consider yourself a CFS patient?&#x02019; can be
answered with &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p> 9. Life satisfaction will be measured by the Life Satisfaction
Questionnaire, Dutch version (LSQ-DV). The LSQ-DV has one question on
general life satisfaction and eight questions about domain-specific life
satisfaction: self-care ability, leisure situation, vocational situation
(including housekeeping), financial situation, sexual life, partner
relationship, family life, contacts with friends and acquaintances.
Questions are answered on a 6-point Likert scale (&#x02018;1&#x02019; is very
dissatisfied, &#x02018;6&#x02019; is very satisfied). The reliability of the
LSQ-DV has been proven to be moderate to good for most domains in a patient
group with chronic illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p> 10. Quality of life and utilities (health-related quality of life) will be
measured by means of the standard Dutch version of the EuroQol (EQ-5D)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The EQ-5D contains
five dimensions of health-related quality of life, namely mobility,
self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety. Each
dimension can be rated at three levels: no problem, some problems and major
problems. The five dimensions can be summed into a health state. Utility
values are calculated for these health states, using preferences elicited
from a general population, the so-called Dolan algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The utility values derived from the
Dolan algorithm will be used to compute Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
The Dolan algorithm has been established using a general population from the
UK. Also a Dutch algorithm has become available that will be used in the
sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment expectancy and credibility</title><p>Patients&#x02019; initial beliefs about the success of a given treatment have
been shown to have an important influence on the final treatment outcome. A
study by Smeets et al. (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]
found evidence of predictive validity of expectancy and credibility scored
by patients with chronic low back pain before following different active
interventions To measure treatment expectancy and credibility, 2 weeks after
the start of treatment, all participants will be asked to fill in the Dutch
version of the Devilly and Borkovec questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mediation</title><p>In order to understand how treatment works, mediation analyses are performed.
Two studies on mediation could not confirm the mediating role of physical
activity in reducing fatigue in CFS. Moss-Morris (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] investigated physical activity as a
mediator in the treatment effect of GET and Wiborg (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] in CBT. Since physical activity does
not mediate the outcome, other parameters have to be responsible for a
decrease of fatigue during therapy. In the model of Vercoulen et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], somatic attributions,
focussing on pain and fatigue, and low self-efficacy contribute to the
perpetuating of CFS complaints. Patients with CFS feel helpless and
surrendered to their complaints, making it difficult to change their
situation. During therapy patients learn to change cognitions into more
helpful cognitions, which increases self-efficacy. They learn to accept
their situation in the present, making choices based on helpful cognitions
and bodily symptoms other than pain and fatigue, and learn to focus on
getting better instead of focussing on complaints and somatic attributions.
Our hypothesis is that by increasing self-efficacy, decreasing somatic
attributions and increasing the present-centred attention-awareness during
activities first, behavioural changes can be made based upon these changes
and eventually the severity of fatigue will decrease.</p><p>There are no studies that we are aware of that determine the mediating role
of self-efficacy, somatic attributions and present-centred
attention-awareness. Mediation will be investigated by the three-step method
described by Baron and Kenny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].
Before treatment (T1), 6 and 14 weeks after start of treatment (T2, T3),
CIS, SE28, CAL and MAAS are filled in by the patient in order to analyse
mediation at different moments during treatment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost analysis</title><p>The Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness
(Tic-P) will be used to measure treatment costs and additional expenses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. The subsection on
absence from work (productivity loss by absenteeism and by loss of
productivity while at work, and informal care and domestic help) is filled
in every month. The subsection on health care costs (medical treatments,
paramedic therapy, alternative therapy, self-care groups, clinical or
outpatient treatment in hospital and other institutions, and medication) is
filled in every 3 months. Treatment hours are registered by the therapists
and the rehabilitation physicians in checklists filled in after each
treatment session. The valuation of health-care costs, patient and family
costs will be based on the updated Dutch manual for cost analysis in
health-care research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. For care
for which no costs-guidelines are available, estimations of the costs will
be made based on the real costs or on population-based estimates from the
literature.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment and procedures</title><p>After inclusion, the research assistant contacts the patient to make an
appointment for the baseline assessment (T1). During T1 the patient is asked to
wear the activity monitor for one week and to fill in the following
questionnaires: </p><p> Checklist Individual Strength (CIS)</p><p> Short Form 36 (SF-36)</p><p> EuroQol- 5D (EQ-5D)</p><p> Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90)</p><p> Self-Efficacy Scale-28 (SES 28)</p><p> Causal Attribution List (CAL)</p><p> Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</p><p> Sickness Impact Profile-8 (SIP-8)</p><p> Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, Dutch Version (LSQ-DV)</p><p>The patient is instructed on how to fill in the Tic-P, part II on health- and
non-health-related costs every month for 1 year. One week after baseline
assessment, the research assistant collects the activity monitor. The research
assistant gives the patient a blind envelope with the treatment conditions.
Treatments start within 4 weeks. Two weeks after the start of treatment, a
patient is asked to fill in the list of Borkovec and Devilly and the PSCG, part
1. At 3 and 9 months after T1 a patient is asked to fill in the Tic-P, part I at
home. Six months after the start of treatment the research assistant assesses
the patient again (T4). The patient is asked to wear the activity monitor and
fill in the same questionnaires as in T1 completed by the PSCG, part II
self-rated improvement questionnaire and Tic-P, part I. Twelve months after the
start of the treatment, the same assessment as in T4 will be repeated (T5). For
each patient the study takes 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>After signing the informed consent form the patients are randomly divided into
two groups: CBT and MRT. For each rehabilitation centre a randomisation list was
generated by computer under supervision of an independent statistician. Before
recruitment of patients an independent person prepared sealed envelopes for each
rehabilitation centre and numbered them sequentially according to the
randomisation list. The envelope is given to the participating patient by an
independent research assistant after baseline assessment. The patient is asked
not to open the envelope in front of the research assistant. Randomisation is
performed for each centre to prevent differences between the treatment groups in
the distribution of centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>Patients are able to contact a physician, who is appointed as an independent
physician for the study, at any time. Adverse events will be monitored
carefully. If any adverse event occurs or a patient withdraws from treatment,
the researcher or research assistant will ask the patient and the therapist(s)
why the patient is withdrawing. If deterioration is reported, the patient is
offered appropriate help if needed. Referrals to other institutions are
registered. Each patient withdrawing from treatment is asked to participate in
the follow-up measurements. Patients who are not willing to participate in the
follow-up measurements are asked to fill in questionnaires at home without
wearing the activity monitor. Reasons for not wanting to participate in the
follow-up measurement are registered.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on the available literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and our pilot
study, mean CIS-fatigue scores at the start of CBT or multidisciplinary
rehabilitation are about 50&#x02013;52 with a standard deviation of 3.9-5.9.
Following previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], we assume that a difference of 0.5 SD of the
mean group score at baseline is clinically relevant. This equals a
difference of about 3.0 points on the CIS fatigue scale. With a sample size
of 48 patients in each treatment arm, accepting an alpha error of 0.05 and a
power of 0.80, it is possible to measure a minimal difference of 3.0 points
on the CIS fatigue scale. To compensate for an estimated 25% dropout rate, a
total of 120 people will be included.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of efficacy</title><p>The effects of therapy conditions on the various outcomes will be compared
using an &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019; approach. Data will be analysed
with mixed linear regression models. The follow-up measurement will be the
dependent variable, and the baseline value of the particular outcome will be
added as covariate as well as random intercepts for individuals to allow for
dependence within patients and centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Effect modification will be evaluated by
introducing interactions between therapy condition and the potential
modifiers in the equation. There will be a post-hoc analysis of the
non-response group and the missing values. Dropout patients will be asked
about the reason for stopping treatment or not attending a measurement.
Patient characteristics of the dropouts will be compared to those of the
group that completed each treatment. For the analyses we will use SPSS
statistical software.</p></sec><sec><title>Economic analyses</title><p>Health-care costs will be measured using the Tic-P. Total costs are
calculated by using an update of the Dutch manual for costing in economic
evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Clinical outcomes
12 months after the start of treatment will be used in the economic
evaluation. Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for statistical significance
will be used to measure differences between MRT and CBT. Fatigue severity
during 1 year of follow-up will be used as the primary outcome measure for
cost-effectiveness.</p><p>A cost-utility analysis will be performed by relating the mean total costs to
the mean health utility (EQ-5D) scores of both groups. The costs per QALY of
both treatments will be compared. Our primary (base-case analyses) will be
performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, including data from
all participants regardless of whether they received the intervention or
not. For the analyses we will use SPSS statistical software and Excel (for
the bootstraps).</p><p>Respondents for whom at least 75% of the data per measurement instrument are
available will be included in the analysis. Missing data on item level will
be handled using SPSS missing value analysis. Completely missing
measurements will be handled using multiple imputation (MI). A baseline
analysis will be performed to examine the comparability of groups at
baseline for both costs and outcomes. If necessary, methods will be applied
to control for differences in baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. To investigate whether data are normally
distributed, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed. Despite the usual
skewness in the distribution of costs, the arithmetic means will be
generally considered the most appropriate measures to describe cost data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Non-parametric bootstrapping is a method based on
random sampling with replacement based on individual data of the
participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The bootstrap
replications will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals around the
costs (95% CI), based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. If cost data are
distributed normally, <italic>t</italic>-tests will be used.</p><p>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be determined on the
basis of incremental costs and the effects of the MRT in comparison with
CBT. The cost-effectiveness ratio will be expressed in terms of costs per
unit of outcome; the cost-utility ratio will focus on the incremental cost
per QUALY gained. The robustness of the ICER will be checked by
non-parametric bootstrapping. Bootstrap simulations will also be conducted
in order to quantify the uncertainty around the ICER, yielding information
about the joint distribution of cost and effect differences. The
bootstrapped cost-effectiveness ratios will be subsequently plotted in a
cost-effectiveness plane in which the vertical line reflects the difference
in costs and the horizontal line reflects the difference in effectiveness.
The choice of treatment depends on the maximum amount of money the society
is prepared to pay for a gain in effectiveness, which is called the ceiling
ration. Therefore, the bootstrapped ICERs will also be depicted in a
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that MRT is
cost-effective using a range of ceiling ratios. Additionally, to demonstrate
the robustness of our base-case findings, a multi-way sensitivity analysis
will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Mediation analyses</title><p>In the mediation analysis, we investigate whether self-efficacy, somatic
attributions and/or present-centred attention-awareness intervenes in the
relationship between treatment and outcome. Multiple regressions are used to
explore which factors mediate the outcome. Mediation is suggested when the
change in the putative mediating factors is significantly related to
treatment as the independent variable, outcome is significantly related to
treatment as the independent variable, and finally, the relationship between
outcome and treatment decreases (or goes to zero) when the change in the
mediation factor is entered into the equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participant non-adherence with treatment</title><p>Participant non-adherence with treatment will be measured both by recording
attendance and by therapist ratings of adherence to therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial management and oversight</title><p>The day-to-day management of the trial is carried out by the principal
investigator, Desir&#x000e9;e Vos-Vromans, in consultation with other members
of the trial team and the research assistants. Every rehabilitation centre
has one or two research assistants.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Treatment facilities for patients with CFS in multidisciplinary rehabilitation
settings are rare, because most health insurance companies and rehabilitation
centres are not convinced of the benefit of MRT for this group. MRT in this form is
unique and has never been investigated in a multicentre RCT. The results of the
FatiGo trial will provide information on the effects of CBT and MRT, mediators of
the outcome, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and the influence of treatment
expectancy and credibility on the effectiveness of both treatments in patients with
CFS.</p><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of the first submission of the manuscript, data collection was
ongoing. Currently the data collection has been completed. The data will be
analysed from May until October 2012. Results of the trial will be available in
November 2012.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the overall design of this study and are involved in the
