Symptoms usually include a sore or scratchy throat, sneezing, coughing, hoarseness, runny nose, nasal obstruction and mild general symptoms like fever, headache, chills and not feeling well in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, in clinical practice, symptoms caused by the common cold vary from person to person, and cold to cold. Well over 200 viruses are implicated in the cause of the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among these pathogenic viruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses can even cause diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been reported that acute upper respiratory infection is the most common discharge diagnosis in emergency departments and the second most common diagnosis in physician offices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the United States, the costs associated with noninfluenza viral respiratory infections are estimated at 40 billion dollars each year, including indirect and direct costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite the high incidence and the economic impact of the common cold, no effective etiological treatment has been proven. Treatment thus mainly comprises symptomatic relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although various treatments are used in clinical practice nowadays, few of them are supported by any solid evidence.</p><p>Dissatisfaction with conventional treatments offered by Western medicine has resulted in many patients seeking help from complementary and alternative medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a 5000-year-old ancient system of medicine, has been used to treat a wide range of diseases, including the common cold. The TCM treatment for common cold is based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs, such as fever, fatigue, headache, aversion to cold, nausea and vomiting, nasal discharge, stuffy nose, tongue proper, tongue coating and condition of pulse. With a totally different system of concepts and theories for etiology, TCM divides colds into three categories: wind-heat syndrome, wind-cold syndrome and summer-heat and dampness syndrome. Among them, the common cold with summer-heat and dampness syndrome (CCSDS) is most commonly seen in midsummer and it is primarily characterized by aversion to cold, fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. According to the basic principles of TCM, CCSDS is treated by dispersing summer-heat and resolving dampness, as well as improving the spleen&#x02019;s transportation function.</p><p>A new TCM drug, <italic>Baoji Tablets</italic>, is manufactured by Wanglaoji Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Guangzhou, China. It is a new dosage form of <italic>Baoji Pills</italic>, which is an old and famous traditional Chinese preparation in the form of tiny round balls, 3 to 5&#x000a0;mm in diameter, used for treating CCSDS. This patented drug is made of active ingredients from the Chinese herbs listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, which have all been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Preclinical pharmacologic experiments showed that it can disperse summer-heat, resolve dampness and improve the spleen&#x02019;s transportation function. Furthermore, no evidence of an adverse or toxic effect has been found in toxicological studies. The preclinical studies were completed by Professor Rujun Wang and her research team from the new drug development research center of Guangzhou Traditional Chinese Medical University. Their studies have not yet been published.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Standard formulation of </bold><bold>

Original study forms will be kept on file at the participating sites for a period of 3&#x000a0;years after completion of the study. At the end of the trial, the investigators, data managers and statisticians will perform a blind review and confirm the database before processing the data.

Severe adverse events must be reported to both the institutional review board and the principal investigator within 24&#x000a0;hours.

The mean duration of all symptoms for a common cold was estimated to be 7&#x000a0;days with a standard deviation of 4&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To demonstrate a reduction in the duration of all symptoms by 2&#x000a0;days, which is defined as clinically relevant, the sample size needs to be 85 cases for each group. Considering the potential loss of patients, the number of participants recruited must be 96 per group. Therefore, a total of 288 patients will be recruited in this trial.</p><p>The statistical analysis for this study will be performed by an independent professional statistician using PEMS 3.1 in a separate location. An intent-to-treat analysis for the patients, who have received treatment at least once, will be carried out. Missing data will be adjusted using the last observation carried forward method. The per-protocol analysis will be restricted to participants who strictly follow the protocol and complete the study. The safety analysis will be conducted only for randomized subjects who have completed at least one study visit. Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be performed on categorical variables, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test on continuous normally distributed variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test on non-normal variables. Due to the multicenter design, the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test stratified by clinical centers and analysis of covariance adjusted for clinical center and baseline will be used in this study. The statistical significance level will be set at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and 95% confidence interval will be calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, there are still no effective therapeutic options available to treat the common cold. It seems that a vaccine may be a good solution. However, vaccines only work on certain viruses. Besides, since diverse viral serotypes cause the common cold, vaccine preparation is very difficult. Therefore, recent studies have mainly focused on symptomatic management. TCM is widely used in China to treat the common cold and many studies have shown that a TCM formulation might be better in reducing symptoms than a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the quality of many of these reported studies is of great concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A number of high-quality clinical trials are needed before any Chinese herbal preparation can be recommended for the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For this reason, the study protocol was designed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Quality controllers will pay regular visits to each center, recheck CRFs and monitor the research data throughout the trial. Moreover, investigators in different centers are all required to follow the standard operating procedures. To our knowledge, previous studies have only focused on wind-cold syndrome and wind-heat syndrome. Therefore, this will be the first multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized and placebo-controlled trial designed to treat CCSDS in an adult population from China. It will establish the basis for a scientific and objective assessment of the efficacy and safety of <italic>Baoji Tablets</italic> for treating CCSDS, and provide evidence for a phase III clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CCSDS: common cold with summer-heat and dampness syndrome; CFDA: China food and drug administration; CRF: case report form; PEMS: Package for encyclopaedia medical statistics; PSSR: percentage of symptom score reduction; TCM: traditional Chinese medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
