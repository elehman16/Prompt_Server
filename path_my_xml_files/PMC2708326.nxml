Incidence of new fractures rises with increasing number of preexisting fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and not only morbidity but also mortality rate rises with increasing number of fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, osteoporosis has become a significant socioeconomic burden in aged societies.</p><p>Bisphosphonates have been shown to have potent anti-fracture efficacy by inhibiting bone resorption, with a reduction in bone turnover and an increase in bone mineral density (BMD). Minodronate (ONO-5920/YM529) is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate with potent inhibitory effect on bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies demonstrated that minodronate is about ten times as potent as alendronate in inhibiting bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial revealed that daily oral administration of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5&#x000a0;mg minodronate to Japanese women with postmenopausal osteoporosis for 9&#x000a0;months caused an increase in lumbar BMD by 4.9%, 5.7%, and 5.2%, respectively, compared with the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because the incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events did not increase in a dose-dependent manner (0%, 12.6%, 6.3%, and 11.1% by placebo, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5&#x000a0;mg minodronate treatment, respectively), minodronate was shown to be well tolerated with excellent effect in increasing BMD. In addition, a head-to-head comparison of the effects of daily oral 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate with 5&#x000a0;mg alendronate revealed that the effect of 12-month treatment with 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate on lumbar and total hip BMD was similar to those of 5&#x000a0;mg alendronate and that minodronate was generally well tolerated with similar safety profiles to alendronate (Hagino et al., submitted for publication). These data suggest that minodronate can become a new treatment choice as a potent bisphosphonate for patients with established osteoporosis. However, its efficacy in reducing osteoporotic fractures has not been evaluated. The present phase III clinical trial was conducted to examine the effect of daily oral 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate on the prevention of vertebral fractures in Japanese women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient enrollment</title><p>We studied postmenopausal women aged 55 to 80 with one to five fragility fractures between the vertebrae T4 and L4 and BMD below 80% (<italic>T</italic> score &#x02212;1.7 at the lumbar spine) of the young adult mean (YAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Subjects who met all the entry criteria were enrolled and sequentially assigned an allocation number independent of study site. Subjects were randomized to take 1&#x000a0;mg minodronate (Astellas Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) or placebo once a day and were treated for 24&#x000a0;months. Randomization was performed by a computerized system. Subjects were instructed to take their tablet on rising and 30&#x000a0;min before food with plain water. All subjects received daily calcium (600&#x000a0;mg) and vitamin D (200&#x000a0;IU) supplementation once a day after the evening meal.

Subjects were enrolled based on a visual assessment of prevalent fractures in T4 to L4. All the radiologic specifications and the levels of vertebra at the thoracic sand lumbar spine were standardized throughout the study sites. The assessment of prevalent fractures was made if the ratio of anterior or middle vertebral body height to the posterior vertebral body height was less than 0.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Quantitative and semiquantitative techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] were used to identify incident vertebral fractures for the purposes of the efficacy determination. Lateral radiographs of the spine were performed at 6, 12, 18, and 24&#x000a0;months for the assessment of incident fractures. An incident of new vertebral fracture was diagnosed if the anterior, posterior, or middle vertebral height had decreased by at least 15% and by 4&#x000a0;mm in a vertebra that was normal at baseline, or semiquantitatively as a progress in grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Morphological diagnosis of fractures was made by quantitative and semiquantitative assessment of two evaluators who were blinded to the sequence of films at two independent central reading facilities at Tottori University, Yonago, Japan by Hagino, H. and at the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Fukuoka, Japan by Nakamura, T., with adjudication by a third investigator (Nakano,T. at Tamana Central Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan) in the event of discrepant results.</p><p><bold>Assessment of non-vertebral fractures</bold> All non-vertebral fractures were identified symptomatically as clinical fractures, and only non-traumatic fractures assessed by investigators were reported. Suspected clinical fractures at six non-vertebral sites (humerus, radius/ulna, subclavia, pelvis, femur, and tibia/fibula) were adjudicated radiographically, and only radiographically confirmed fractures were listed.</p><p><bold>Assessment of bone turnover</bold> Serum and urine samples were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#x000a0;months for measurement of bone turnover markers, including urinary total deoxypyridinoline (DPD) measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (SRL, Tokyo, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] after acid hydrolysis, urinary type I collagen <italic>N</italic>-telopeptide (NTX; Osteomark, Ostex International, Seattle, WA, USA), serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP; Osteolinks &#x0201c;BAP&#x0201d;, Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA), serum osteocalcin (BGP-IRMA Mitsubishi; Mitsubishi Kagaku Iatron, Tokyo, Japan), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; 125I RIA Kit, DiaSorin Inc., Saluggia, Italy). Study subjects were asked to visit study sites during the morning, but it was not mandatory to visit in the fasting state.</p><p><bold>Assessment of adverse events</bold> All subjects were questioned about adverse events (AEs) of treatment at each visit, and all adverse events reported were analyzed regardless of the investigators&#x02019; assessments of causality. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 8.1J) was used to categorize reported adverse events.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold> All the data analyses were performed by statisticians from Ono under the supervision and confirmation of data analyses by one of the authors (Ohashi, Y.).The intention-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and who attended at least one follow-up visit for any observation of efficacies. The ITT population was used for all fracture and height analyses. Safety analyses population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of study medication in either treatment group. A per-protocol (PP) approach was used as a primary approach to analyze the bone turnover markers because they can change rapidly by protocol violations, interruption of study therapy, or concurrent illness. The PP approach excluded protocol violators who took less than 75% study drug, who took prohibited medications during the course of the trial, or who violated the protocol in a significant manner as specified in the data analysis plan, and patients who took study drug for less than 12&#x000a0;months. This population included all patients in the ITT population, except those with a protocol deviation deemed to have a significant impact on the efficacy variables, i.e., major deviations regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients with insufficient compliance (&#x0003c;75% of the study medication), documentation of forbidden concomitant medication that could bias the fracture results, and patients lacking an assessable baseline and follow-up for X-ray assessments for less than 12&#x000a0;months.The risk of patients with new morphometric vertebral fractures at 24&#x000a0;months, as the primary endpoint, was analyzed by testing the superiority of minodronate group to the placebo group by the time-to-event curves (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method), the event being the first new incident vertebral fracture. The primary hypothesis was tested using an ITT analysis that was modified to include all subjects randomized, who had taken at least one dose of study drug, and attended at least one follow-up visit. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of vertebral fracture and its 95% confidence interval in minodronate group and placebo group. Log-rank test was used to determine the superiority of the minodronate group to the placebo group. The power calculation was based on the predictive risk of vertebral fracture. For the study to achieve a power of 90% to detect the superiority, a sample size of 290 subjects per group was required. To allow for subject withdrawals, the intention was to enroll 640 to 650 subjects. Differences were considered to be statistically significant if the <italic>p</italic> value was less than 0.05.Group mean and standard error (SE) were given for the percent changes from baseline in bone turnover markers and changes from baseline in height and were used to assess the significance of changes within two groups. <italic>T</italic> test was used to determine whether minodronate group was significantly different from the placebo group. The comparability between minodronate and placebo groups for demographic information was assessed with Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank-sum test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Differences in proportions of patients with AEs were analyzed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The treatment groups were also compared for the proportion of patients with gastrointestinal AEs using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All protocol violators were identified before database lock of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>A total of 1,083 subjects were screened at 98 study sites in Japan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The effect of minodronate on vertebral fracture was observed within 12&#x000a0;months, and there was also a significant decrease in height loss at 12&#x000a0;months. The overall safety profile including gastrointestinal safety was similar between the two groups.</p><p>In the present study, a large number of vertebral fractures occurred during the first 6&#x000a0;months in both groups (20 and 27 in minodronate and placebo groups, respectively). In our previous study, to compare the effect of minodronate on lumbar BMD and bone markers with that of alendronate (Hagino et al., submitted for publication), bone resorption markers were suppressed within 1&#x000a0;month, and lumbar BMD was significantly increased after 3&#x000a0;months of minodronate treatment. It should be noted that the assessment of vertebral fractures at baseline was performed within 2&#x000a0;months before the start of study drug administration. Therefore, a part of vertebral fractures identified after 6&#x000a0;months of drug administration might have occurred before drug administration was started. Although the exact reason why a large number of vertebral fractures occurred during the early period in both groups remains unclear, minodronate showed a marked anti-fracture efficacy from 6 to 24&#x000a0;months of treatment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the robust inhibitory effect on vertebral fractures, the present study did not show a significant effect of minodronate in reducing non-vertebral fractures. This is a major limitation of the present study. Because the study was aimed to examine the ability of minodronate to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, the study did not have enough power in terms of the number of study subjects and the length of study period to examine the effect of minodronate on non-vertebral fractures. Thus, although the study included patients with established osteoporosis having at least one prevalent vertebral fracture, the number of non-vertebral fractures developed in long bones during the 24-month study period was too small to draw any conclusions.</p><p>With regard to the safety profile of minodronate, no significant difference was observed between the minodronate and placebo groups in any AEs including drug-related or serious AEs. Although the most common AEs were gastrointestinal AEs, the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs, as well as those that caused discontinuation from the study, was very similar between the minodronate and placebo groups. These results suggest that minodronate does not cause any serious disturbance in osteoporotic patients, and daily administration of minodronate can be well-tolerated in patients with osteoporosis.</p><p>Minodronate exhibits very similar antiresorptive potency to zoledronic acid in pre-clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and intermittent oral administration of ibandronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as well as yearly intravenous administration of zoledronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] demonstrated potent anti-fracture efficacy. Therefore, further studies are warranted to examine the effect of intermittent oral and intravenous minodronate on vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in osteoporotic patients.</p><p>In conclusion, daily oral minodronate is safe, well-tolerated, and is effective in reducing vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. Because the dose of minodronate in reducing fracture incidence was low, further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of intermittent administration of higher doses of minodronate on osteporotic fractures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mr. T.
