<article-title>Deception in Research on the Placebo Effect</article-title>
</related-article></article-meta></front><body><p>Kudos to Miller et al. [<xref rid="pmed-0020388-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] for exposing the seamy side of medical research. No matter how positive the results of drug effectiveness, as demonstrated through against-placebo comparison studies, the fact remains that the ends do not justify the means.</p><p>To knowingly and willingly induce a patient to trust in the pharmacotherapeutic effectiveness of a phony drug not only trivializes the patient's intelligence, but also devalues the mentor status of the treating physician.</p><p>The role of placebo therapy, though quite dramatic at times, does not sanctify the manner in which large-scale research studies pit one group of falsely guided patients or volunteers against another. The medical and pharmacological world must relegate blind new drug&#x02013;placebo comparison studies to the back burner. Medical journals, too, have a major role in publishing papers that contain misinformation and that mislead. The psychosomatic pharmacokinetics of drugs can be tested or evaluated through much less dubious means than placebo-based research.</p><p>The medical profession has an onus to constantly and continuously present itself as an educated partner of the patient in the treatment of disease and ill health: we are quite positive that not a single volunteer would agree to participate in any placebo&#x02013;new drug study, if informed of the patently false and fake nature of the research protocols.</p><p>There is no denying the fact that placebo therapy has a role in fighting disease, but too much nearly criminal injustice is perpetuated in the form of misinformation in placebo-based research studies. The sooner medical professionals and drug manufacturers proscribe placebo-based research, the better for all.</p><p>We congratulate the authors of this Policy Forum [<xref rid="pmed-0020388-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] for bringing to light this rather dark side of research, and hope that the debate engendered will result in re-establishing the physician as a trusted confidant of the trusting patient.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n3" fn-type="other"><p>
