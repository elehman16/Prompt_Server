It has been used for the prevention and treatment of virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection. BLG contains some antiviral compounds, but few evidence-based clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy against influenza. We assessed the effects of BLG (including efficacy and safety) on the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, oseltamivir- and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. A total of 177 subjects are going to be recruited after satisfying the criteria: (i) 18 to 65 years of age; (ii) illness onset within 36 h; (3) axillary temperature &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C; and (iv) positive influenza (type A/B) virus test. Subjects will be assigned randomly into three groups in equal proportions: oseltamivir treatment, BLG granule treatment, and placebo treatment. Each group receives 5-day treatment and is followed up 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 days later. Symptoms and patient compliance are recorded, and virus/serum viral antibodies tested. We will use the primary outcome, secondary outcome, and safety indicators to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study. And this clinical trial will serve as an example for the study of other traditional herbal medicines in evidence-based clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02232945&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT02232945</ext-link> (3 September 2014).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0645-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ban-Lan-Gen granule</kwd><kwd>Seasonal influenza</kwd><kwd>Oseltamivir</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>The influenza epidemic</title><p>Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by highly infectious influenza viruses such as H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and influenza B. It has a strong capability of spreading globally, leading to adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such respiratory diseases are usually caused by type A or type B influenza, and the symptoms include headache, muscle aches, cough, and sudden fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Infection by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus emerged initially in Mexico in early 2009 and has become a global pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Now, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009) and influenza B have induced co-infection worldwide, thereby causing considerable panic among general populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Drug resistance in Western medicine</title><p>M2 ion channel blockers (for example, amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (for example, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Amantadine and rimantadine, however, have been associated with neurologic toxicities and gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, overuse of these medicines has been found to result in drug-resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Up to 2003, M2-resistant variants had even spread to countries where these drugs are used infrequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has demonstrated resistance to amantadine and rimantadine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our previous study suggested that clinical isolates of H1N1 and H3N2 developed amantadine resistance at 93.1% and 100%, respectively, in Guangzhou, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. NA inhibitors, in comparison with M2 ion channel blockers, are more commonly used but they (i) can also cause respiratory side effects and even death (for example, oseltamivir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) owing to intensive use and (ii) have a higher barrier for resistance if overused. A survey from 1999 and 2007 showed a very low level (&#x0003c;1%) of resistance to oseltamivir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but a survey between 2008 and 2009 reported the resistance to be &#x02265;90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Resistance to zanamivir has been (albeit rarely) reported among immunodeficient patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Whether such antiviral agents can be used to address influenza epidemics is not clear. Furthermore, the true effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment against influenza is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Traditional Chinese herbal medicine and basic research</title><p>Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) is richly used in Chinese clinics and widely used to treat and prevent respiratory infection disease. Unlike Western medicine, TCHM has different mechanisms and targets of action and, potentially, could be used to overcome drug resistance and side effects. Therefore, exporting the new antiviral medicine from TCHM will be a new choice. For example, the starting material (shikimic acid) for the synthesis of the oseltamivir can be obtained from <italic>Illicium verum</italic>, which is a type of TCHM (Tamiflu&#x02122;, Roche, Basel, Switzerland).</p><p>Among the many types of TCHMs, Ban-Lan-Gen (BLG) has a thousand-year history of use for the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections (particularly respiratory viral diseases). BLG was highlighted as a classic antiviral and anti-influenza agent in the <italic>People&#x02019;s Republic of China Pharmacopoeia</italic> in 1979 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, BLG was one of the eight major medicines recommended by the Chinese government for the prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p><p>Several clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of BLG granules on treatment of acute pharyngitis (among which, 50% are caused by viruses), infection of the upper respiratory tract, and influenza H1N1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, none of those studies were evidence-based clinical trials.</p><p>The <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> root (<italic>IIR</italic>) is the single largest component of BLG granules. Our previous studies suggested that the <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic><italic>root polysaccharide</italic> (<italic>IRPS</italic>) and clemastanin B derived from <italic>IIR</italic> can inhibit various subtypes of the influenza virus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Inhibiting the hemagglutinin (HA) of the virus at its early stage of infection is an important antiviral mechanism of <italic>IIR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments revealed clemastanin B to significantly inhibit pneumonia and virus proliferation in lung tissue (Zifeng Yang and Zhengtu Li, unpublished work). We also found that the lignin group (<italic>IIR</italic> isolated) inhibits the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling activated by the influenza virus and blocks exportation of the NP protein of the influenza virus (article in press). Other studies have also shown that indirubin (also contains <italic>IIR</italic>) and its derivatives have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in infection due to the influenza A (H5N1) virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study aims</title><p>Studies have suggested that BLG and its active ingredients may inhibit the influenza virus. Little concrete clinical evidence has been provided, however, for the efficacy of BLG in the treatment of seasonal influenza. We wished to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules for the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Ethical approval of the study protocol was granted from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (number, 2011014; Guangzhou, China), and informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Design</title><p>This clinical study was a randomized, double-blind, double control trial that tested drugs and placebo. Noninferiority (versus positive control) and superiority (versus placebo control) trials were conducted. Patients with positive tests for the influenza virus (rapid detection of antigens to the influenza virus before enrollment, but if detection of nucleic acid of the influenza virus or cultivation of the influenza virus was inconsistent, the patient was excluded) were assigned randomly into three groups of equal proportions (1:1:1). Groups were: oseltamivir treatment (positive control), BLG granule treatment (test group) and placebo group. Patients will accept 5-day treatment and 21-day observation.

Duration of illness is defined as the time from symptom onset to alleviation of the influenza-like symptoms: nasal obstruction, running nose, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, chills and sweating. The definition of symptom alleviation is influenza-like symptoms score &#x02264;1 (mild) and maintenance of stable symptoms for more than 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another primary outcome is the time to defervescence, which is measured in hours.

The first is the duration of viral shedding. This endpoint is defined as the time from illness onset to the first time the viral nucleic acid test is negative. The second endpoint is disease severity. It is assessed by an area under the curve (AUC) analysis of nine influenza-like symptom scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The AUC is calculated as the product of the daily symptom scores multiplied by the duration of illness. The third endpoint is the frequency of acetaminophen usage. The fourth endpoint is the prevalence of secondary influenza complications. These are otitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, nasosinusitis, suppurative tonsillitis, acute parotitis, Reye&#x02019;s syndrome, central nervous system disease, myocarditis, pericarditis, acute myositis, and toxic shock syndrome. The final endpoint was an economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>Safety is evaluated using vital signs, cardiopulmonary signs, adverse reactions, electrocardiography, and clinical laboratory tests (including liver and kidney functions and myocardium enzyme). These indices are compared before and after the drugs were taken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Evaluation of adverse events</title><p>An adverse event refers to any adverse, unintended or unplanned effects on vital signs, symptoms, diseases, or laboratory indices that change after participants have enrolled in the clinical trial. An adverse event is not necessarily related to the drugs. Adverse events are divided into three levels: mild, moderate and severe (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The cause-and-effect relationship between an adverse event and study drugs is evaluated according to whether the agent (i) causes death; (ii) imperils life; (iii) leads to hospitalization or extends the duration of the hospital stay; (iv) is teratogenic or causes birth defects; (v) causes a permanent handicap; or (vi) is carcinogenic (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).

Our previous study showed that <italic>IPRS</italic>, clemastanin B and lignin, which are separated from <italic>IIR</italic>, have antiviral roles in the early infection stage of the influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Accordingly, we defined the time of illness onset to be &#x0003c;36 hours. Unfortunately, this criterion made patient recruitment quite difficult. However, this design, which is based on a combination of traditional medical experience and modern pharmacological study, should allow us to discover the objective treatment effectiveness of BLG.</p><p>The safety of TCHM is attracting major attention. First, in our study, BLG granules are used only for 5 days in the acute phase, so that it may be safe for humans. Second, we evaluate the safety of BLG based on changes in liver and kidney function after treatment. In addition, western medicines used for treating influenza (such as oseltamivir, which sells for 283 RBM/box in China) is expensive for &#x02018;developing&#x02019; countries. Hence, we need to explore new, safe and inexpensive anti-influenza medicine. BLG, which sells for 12.00 RBM/box in China, would be a good choice.</p><p>Furthermore, according to basic science studies, the active ingredient of <italic>IIR</italic> also exerts immune-modulating and anti-inflammation effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Polysaccharides from <italic>IIR</italic> can promote production of interleukin-2 and interferon-&#x003b3;, as well as the proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Also, indirubin and its derivatives can suppress the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by influenza infection in human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hence, an evidence-based clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of BLG in treating inflammation induced by influenza infection certainly has merit.</p><p>In summary, we have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>This clinical trial was reviewed by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University at the end of 2011.
