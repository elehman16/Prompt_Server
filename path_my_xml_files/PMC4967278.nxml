We analyzed RSA radiographs taken at baseline and at 1-, 2-, and 6.5-year follow-up. Cup migration and wear were assessed using model-based RSA software.

Wear increased over time, and was similar between the 2 groups (0.58&#x02009;mm vs. 0.53&#x02009;mm). Wear rate (0.08&#x02009;mm/year vs. 0.09&#x02009;mm/year) and clinical outcomes were also similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our results indicate that additional screw fixation of all-polyethylene press-fit RM cups has no additional value regarding medium-term migration and clinical outcome.

In cementless press-fit cups, this initial stability is achieved by the press-fit fixation. Additional primary fixation may be obtained by the use of extra screws (<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">Tabata et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). However, the value of additional screw fixation of press-fit acetabular cup implants on implant survival is questioned. On the one hand, additional screws can increase short-term fixation (Heller et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that additional screws may cause increased micromotion in several regions of the cup (Won et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Furthermore, screws may also cause stress shielding, which, in turn, can result in increased implant mobility in the long term due to bone resorption (Wolff <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Moreover, additional screw stabilization could facilitate migration of polyethylene debris into the pelvis through and along the screw tracts, resulting in osteolysis (Schmalzried et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that wear and wear rate of cup implants are important factors in this process, as more wear leads to more debris (Young et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Previously, our group reported on the short-term effects of additional screw fixation of the cementless, all-polyethylene RM press-fit cup (Mathys AG, Bettlach, Switzerland), measured by radiosteriometric analysis (RSA). At 2-year follow-up, no clinically relevant differences in cup stability and clinical outcomes were seen between patients with additional screws and patients without (Pakvis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These findings were confirmed by a meta-analysis of studies in the literature, which focused on the effect of additional screw fixation on the stability of press-fit cups (Ni et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This meta-analysis included studies with a follow-up of up to 5 years. Along with our previous study, only 2 other RCTs were included. Both investigated titanium alloy cups with a polyethylene liner (Thanner et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, R&#x000f6;hrl et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Recently, the results of long-term follow-up in the latter study were published&#x02014;again showing no difference between the groups (Otten et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The results on migration and wear from these studies using titanium implants are difficult to compare with the results with the titanium-coated all-polyethylene cup in the present study.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the medium-term effect of additional screw fixation of this all-polyethylene cup on migration, wear, and clinical outcome.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This paper describes the prolonged follow-up of a previous, single-center, patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed at Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (Pakvis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Briefly, patients with primary osteoarthritis of the hip received a cementless, all-polyethylene, press-fit acetabular cup with titanium coating (RM press-fit; Mathys AG, Bettlach, Switzerland). Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups: (1) with no additional screw stabilization, and (2) with additional screw stabilization using two 4.0-mm screws of variable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).

Both studies used titanium alloy cups with polyethylene liners, in contrast to the all-polyethylene cups used in the current study. In accordance with our findings, both studies found no difference in migration and wear between cups with additional screws and cups without. Nevertheless, an increased wear rate of 0.21&#x02009;mm/year was found by 1 study over the 14-year follow-up (Otten et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This is more than twice the wear rate that we found. This can be explained by the ethylene oxide- (EtO-) sterilized polyethylene liner that was used in that study, which has shown a higher wear rate compared to the gamma-sterilized polyethylene that we used (Digas et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>); probably because of the formation of larger wear particles (R&#x000f6;hrl et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>Increased proximal (y) translation and adduction (z-rotation) of acetabular cups during the first 2 years have been described as strong risk factors for component failure in the long term (Nieuwenhuijse et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, this may not be relevant to the current study, in which the cups showed no relevant migration after the 2-year follow-up. The underlying process of migration in the short term and in the medium term is possibly different (initial implant fixation as opposed to stress shielding and polyethylene debris osteolysis).</p><p>A concern with the all-polyethylene press-fit cup may be a possibly increased wear rate. As the diameter of the cup is oversized compared to the reamer, to ensure initial press-fit stability, the cup is likely to be deformed to a certain extent during placement. Consequently, the space for the femoral head might be reduced, possibly leading to increased wear. However, we did not find that the wear rate was increased compared to press-fit cups with a metal alloy shell, which are possibly less subject to deformation. Thus, we believe that there is no reason for concern about a high wear rate with this cup.</p><p>The study had some limitations. First, the sample size of the study was small, and possibly had low power to detect differences in migration or wear between the groups. However, the RSA precision limits were low and a great overlap in TT and TR was seen between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). We therefore believe that we would have found the same results in a larger study population. Secondly, no measurements of radiolucent lines were performed. However, as no statistically significant difference in migration was seen between groups, radiolucent lines are of less interest. A third consideration may be the fact that the RSA measurements were performed with patients in supine position, with unloaded joints during the measurements. This might have influenced the wear measurements, which were calculated as migration of the femoral head in relation to the cup implant. However, previous RSA research has not shown any difference in femoral head penetration between supine and standing position (Bragdon et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Thus, we believe that our wear measurements were accurate. Lastly, previous research found that a more vertical orientation of the cup was associated with more migration and increased wear (Kennedy et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Unfortunately, standard pelvis radiography images were not taken in all patients, so cup inclination angle could not be measured.</p><p>In conclusion, this medium-term study showed no statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in migration, wear, and clinical outcome between all-polyethylene press-fit cups with additional screw fixation and all-polyethylene press-fit cups without.</p><p>This study was funded by Mathys Orthopaedics, Bettlach, Switzerland, and prior to the study there were no limitations described by either party regarding publishing of the data resulting from the study.</p><p>PH and MS contributed to the conception and design of the study.
