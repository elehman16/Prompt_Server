It is unknown whether these antibodies, such as cetuximab, are more efficacious in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer as monotherapy, or in combination with irinotecan. Lack of mutation&#x000a0;in <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> predicts response to EFGR-inhibitors. The ICECREAM trial examines the question of monotherapy versus combination with chemotherapy in two groups of patients: those with a &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; tumour genotype (no mutations in <italic>KRAS, NRAS, PI3KCA</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic> genes) and those with the specific <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation in codon G13D, for whom possibly EGFR-inhibitor efficacy may be equivalent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>ICECREAM is a randomised, phase II, open-label, controlled trial comparing the efficacy of cetuximab alone or with irinotecan in patients with &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; or G13D-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, whose disease has progressed on, or who are intolerant of oxaliplatin- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is the 6-month progression-free survival benefit of the treatment regimen. Secondary endpoints are response rate, overall survival, and quality of life. The tertiary endpoint is prediction of outcome with further biological markers. International collaboration has facilitated recruitment in this prospective trial of treatment in these infrequently found molecular subsets of colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This unique trial will yield prospective information on the efficacy of cetuximab and whether this is further enhanced with chemotherapy in two distinct populations of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: the &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d;, which may &#x02018;superselect&#x02019; for tumours sensitive to EGFR-inhibition, and the rare <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutated tumours, which are also postulated to be sensitive to the drug. The focus on establishing both positive and negative predictive factors for the response to targeted therapy is an attempt to improve outcomes, reduce toxicity and contain treatment costs. Tissue and blood will yield a resource for molecular studies.

The trial will study two preselected patient populations in parallel, to determine whether cetuximab is optimally used as monotherapy, or in combination with an irinotecan-based regimen. In retrospective studies, the &#x0201c;quadruple wild type (WT) &#x0201d; genotype (no mutations in <italic>KRAS, NRAS, PI3KCA</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic> genes) appears to select responders to EFGR-inhibitors (EGFR-I) over and above that of <italic>KRAS</italic> exon 2 WT alone, which was until recently the extent of standard mutation testing. Similarly, retrospective data suggest that patients whose tumours harbour the specific <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutation may be sensitive to EGFR-I, in contrast to all other <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. To date, no prospective trials of EGFR-I selected by tumour mutation/WT status have been undertaken.</p><p>Trial results may affect the standard of treatment for both groups of patients, in particular defining both a highly sensitive group and potentially providing the foundation for access to EGFR-I treatment for patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutated mCRC. The trial was devised and instigated as an investigator initiated study in Australia, with participation of leading cancer institutes in Italy, Spain, Belgium and England.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for evaluating the addition of irinotecan to cetuximab in WT patients</title><p>The BOND study, undertaken in patients with irinotecan-refractory mCRC demonstrated a modest progression-free survival (PFS) benefit for cetuximab in combination with irinotecan compared with cetuximab alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Whilst the benefits were modest, toxicity was increased with the combination. Also, due to being conducted in an era prior to RAS testing, as well as the lack of tissue availability, RAS testing has not been retrospectively performed on the BOND cohort. Therefore it remains unclear whether the addition of irinotecan will provide additive benefit in patients selected for <italic>KRAS</italic> WT tumours. The landmark EGFR-I phase III trials in refractory mCRC elected to use the EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab) as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, clinical use in Australia and worldwide is divided equally between monotherapy and doublet therapy in the refractory setting. Therefore, the use of cetuximab alone versus combination with irinotecan remains an important, unanswered question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale for studying &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; tumours</title><p>EGFR-I administration is now restricted to patients with <italic>RAS</italic> WT tumours, following retrospective analyses that initially demonstrated lack of mutation in <italic>KRAS</italic> exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) as a positive predictive marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with subsequent extension of predictive molecular markers to include other exons of <italic>KRAS</italic> as well as of <italic>NRAS</italic> (exons 2, 3, 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Less certain, but suggestive are data showing that sensitivity to EGFR-I also depends on the WT status of <italic>BRAF</italic> (exon 15) and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (exon 20) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for studying EGFR-I in patients with G13D mutations</title><p>Multiple retrospective analyses, initially in refractory mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], then in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> line chemotherapy-EGFR-I combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggested that the subgroup with the specific codon 13 mutation: G13D appear to derive benefit from cetuximab therapy to a similar extent as <italic>KRAS</italic> WT patients. This is also supported in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The KRAS exon 2 mutation c.38G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A: pGly13Asp (G13D) accounts for ~19&#x000a0;% of KRAS mutations, with an absolute incidence of 8&#x000a0;% in mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Preclinical studies in cell lines and xenograft models have demonstrated a response to cetuximab and blockade of the EGFR kinase pathway in the G13D mutants, but not in other (eg G12V) mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Based on this data, the use of cetuximab for these patients harbouring the rare G13D KRAS mutation is becoming an increasingly relevant clinical predicament.</p><p>Results from the treatment of patients with G13D mutations varied in a pooled analysis of trials with panitumumab (a fully humanized EGFR-I) covering all lines of treatment of mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In one first line study, patients with a G13D mutation treated with panitumumab had an unfavourable overall survival, whereas patients with a G12V mutation had a favourable outcome, which was the opposite finding to cetuximab studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, analysis of outcomes of patients with G13D tumours showed a trend to benefit from panitumumab when compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These data further support the need for prospective studies in patients with G13D tumour mutations.</p><p>The enriched group of patients being examined in the ICECREAM trial will yield valuable information regarding other features associated with response to EGFR-I, in particular the depth of response to treatment, which has been shown to be a predictor of clinical benefit and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Biological substudies examining additional biomarkers in both subgroups are planned.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design and objectives</title><p>ICECREAM is a randomised, open-label, phase II study of cetuximab monotherapy versus the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan. The primary objective is to determine the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) benefit of cetuximab alone or in combination with irinotecan in patients with <italic>KRAS, NRAS, BRAF</italic> and <italic>PIK3CKA</italic> wild type mCRC or <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutated mCRC. PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Secondary objectives are to determine the response rate (as complete or partial responses according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1) in patients with &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; or <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutated mCRC. Overall survival benefit in the two patient cohorts will be determined based on death from any cause. The study will evaluate quality of life with FACT-C (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy), DLQI (Dermatology Quality of Life Index Questionnaire), and FACT-EGFRI 18 (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, pertaining specifically to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition).</p><p>Tertiary and correlative objectives are to undertake exploratory studies of biological markers as predictors of outcome. Early tumour response will be measured by assessment of tumour shrinkage on CT imaging performed at 6&#x000a0;weeks post first treatment, based on independent review of volumetric tumour size.</p><p>Biological substudies aim to improve understanding of the mechanisms of cetuximab and any interaction with irinotecan in wild type and G13D mutated tumours. Since the identification of new biomarkers correlating with disease activity, and the efficacy and safety of treatments are rapidly evolving, a definitive list of biomarker studies remains to be determined at the time of these studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial organisation</title><p>The trial was developed by Australian clinicians in collaboration with key international clinicians. The Australasian Gastrointestinal Trials Group (AGITG) is the study sponsor and the trial is coordinated by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre (CTC) at the University of Sydney, Australia. The legal sponsor in the European Union (EU) is Hammersmith Hospital. Randomisation and data collection are performed electronically and the CTC is responsible for management of safety, ethical and regulatory reporting, central coordination of study sites and management of statistical analyses. The trial is registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000901808).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size of 100 patients is comprised of 50 patients with confirmed &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; status and 50 patients with a confirmed G13D tumour mutation. An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken, with the inclusion of all randomised patients.</p><p>In keeping with the randomized phase II study design, PFS was selected as the appropriate primary endpoint as this would not be influenced by subsequent cross over from monotherapy to combination treatment, which may occur at progression on study. Statistical assumptions were on the basis of retrospective data (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with a median PFS of 1.8&#x000a0;months in the cetuximab-alone arm versus 4.0&#x000a0;months for patients with KRAS G13D&#x02013;mutated tumors receiving any cetuximab therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This corresponds to a 6-month PFS rate of approximately 10&#x000a0;% for the monotherapy group and 35&#x000a0;% for the combination group. The G13D component of the study planned to recruit 25 patients per arm to match the wild-type cohort. This enabled 80&#x000a0;% power (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05) to detect an improvement from 15 to 40&#x000a0;% in 6-month PFS by using the Simon design for phase II trials. This magnitude of effect was chosen because we were interested in detecting a similar degree of benefit in the KRAS G13D&#x02013;mutation population that was anticipated to be practice changing in patients with wild-type tumors. PFS and OS treatment effects were described by using hazard ratios (HRs) that were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards models. Completeness of the PFS was estimated by using a published equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Waterfall plots were constructed by using the biggest decrease compared with baseline in the sum of the target lesions. Patients with a decreased sum of target lesions but with new non-target lesions were set to a zero change but still qualified as having progressive disease. QoL changes over time were modeled by using generalized estimating equations. Analyses used SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of current clinical trial PFS data on which statistical calculations are based</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>KRAS unknown</th><th>KRAS WT</th><th>KRAS mutant</th><th>KRAS G13D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BOND study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] cetuximab alone vs cetuximab&#x02009;+&#x02009;irinotecan</td><td>6&#x000a0;m PFS&#x02009;=&#x02009;8&#x000a0;% vs. 30&#x000a0;%</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>CO.17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] cetuximab vs best supportive care</td><td>N/A</td><td>6&#x000a0;m PFS cetuximab&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x000a0;%</td><td>6&#x000a0;m PFS&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;%</td><td/></tr><tr><td>De Roock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] cetuximab vs no cetuximab</td><td>N/A</td><td>Median PFS 4.2&#x000a0;m vs 1.9&#x000a0;m</td><td>Median PFS 1.9&#x000a0;m vs 1.8&#x000a0;m</td><td>Median PFS 4.0&#x000a0;m vs 1.7&#x000a0;m</td></tr><tr><td>Tepjar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] cetuximab vs no cetuximab as 1st line treatment</td><td>Not relevant</td><td>Median PFS 9.6&#x000a0;m vs 7.6&#x000a0;m</td><td>Median PFS 6.7&#x000a0;m vs 8.1&#x000a0;m</td><td>Median PFS 7.4&#x000a0;m vs 6.0&#x000a0;m</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Planned futility analysis</title><p>As the activity of the combination is of particular interest in patients with G13D KRAS mutated tumours, Simon&#x02019;s II stage design was applied to this group of patients.

Archival tumour samples from the primary colorectal cancer or any metastatic site are acceptable for mutation analysis. All specimens are received as formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue biopsy blocks (FFPE), which upon arrival are cut into 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m sections by microtome and transferred onto glass slides before de-waxing and DNA extraction.

DNA is extracted using Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kits and successful DNA extraction is confirmed by Qubit DNA quantitation and LabChipGX DNA fragmentation assessment. For Sanger sequencing, targeted regions of interest from exon 15 of the BRAF gene, exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene, and exons 2, 3, and 4 of both KRAS and NRAS genes are amplified separately by PCR and sequenced using BigDye terminator chemistry on an ABI 3730 genetic analyser.

The infusion rate must not exceed 10&#x000a0;mg/min. Normal (0.9&#x000a0;%) saline solution is used to flush the line at the end of the infusion. Close monitoring of vital signs of the patient must be checked before, during and at end of the infusion and for at least one hour after the end of the infusion. The patient must be pre-treated with an antihistamine (e.g. loratadine) and dexamethasone prior to every infusion to reduce the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Cetuximab must not be mixed with any other substance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Irinotecan administration</title><p>Irinotecan will be administered by intravenous infusion over 90&#x000a0;min, protected from light. Close monitoring of vital signs of the patient must be checked before, during and at end of the infusion for cholinergic symptoms (ie. early onset diarrhoea, runny nose, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis or flushing). If these symptoms develop, the infusion must be stopped, vital signs recorded and the patient reviewed according to local institutional guidelines. The patient may be pre-treated with a 5HT3-antagonist, corticosteroid and atropine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Dose modifications and concomitant medications</title><p>Adverse events will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. If there is a requirement to delay treatment due to toxicity, and that toxicity can be attributed to one specific drug, then the other treatments can be continued on schedule. If irinotecan is delayed for &#x02265;28&#x000a0;days, then the patient must cease irinotecan and should continue cetuximab monotherapy. Cetuximab treatment may also be delayed for a maximum of 28&#x000a0;days.</p><p>In general, treatment should be withheld during adverse events of severity grade 3&#x02013;4, and not restarted until the adverse event has resolved to grade 0&#x02013;1, at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion if not otherwise indicated in the protocol. If the adverse event (not including skin toxicity) has not resolved to grade 1 after delay of treatment for 28&#x000a0;days, then study treatment should be discontinued. Treatment should not be delayed or modified for alopecia of any grade.</p><p>Specified dose reductions apply to all subsequent doses of the study drug. If a patient experiences several adverse events with differing recommendations, then the modification that results in the longest delay and lowest dose should be used. Dose escalations or dose re-escalations after reductions for adverse events are prohibited. All palliative and supportive care measures and medications may be administered at the Investigator&#x02019;s discretion unless otherwise stated in the dose modifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Treatment discontinuation</title><p>Study treatment will be permanently discontinued for documented progressive disease as per RECIST 1.1; unacceptable toxicity (as determined by the patient or treating clinician); delay of treatment for more than 28&#x000a0;days due to treatment-related adverse events; if the treating clinician determines that continuation of treatment is not in the patient&#x02019;s best interest; for occurrence of an exclusion criterion affecting patient safety, e.g. pregnancy or psychiatric illness; failure to comply with the protocol, e.g. repeatedly failing to attend scheduled assessments, or if the patient withdraws their consent to participate in the study.

At the time, mutation testing of the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene was limited to exon 2 only. Further analysis has led to the identification of particular predictive subgroups which may have differential benefit from EGFR-I. The first group is patients with tumours harbouring the <italic>KRAS</italic> exon 2 G13D mutation, who in retrospective series (with small numbers only) appear to respond to EGFR-I (in trials before <italic>KRAS</italic> selection became an eligibility criteria), but are currently precluded from accessing such treatment. The second group are patients who perhaps should be spared from having ineffective treatment, as they seem not to respond to EFGR-I because of mutations in other exons of <italic>KRAS</italic> (exons 3 and 4) or in the <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>PI3KCA</italic> genes. The superselection of responsive patients and exclusion of patients unlikely to benefit from EGFR-I needs prospective validation.</p><p>ICECREAM is an investigator-initiated, randomised, phase II trial being conducted through the Australian Gastro-intestinal Trials Group (AGITG) and coordinated by the Clinical Trials Centre (CTC) at the University of Sydney. Initially an international phase III study for the G13D mutated population was proposed, but the numbers for this subgroup were considered unachievable. Indeed, both the necessity as well as the challenge of performing prospective randomised trials in small molecularly defined subgroups such as this has been well recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. One strategy to ensure successful recruitment has been to open in key international sites within several countries, with strongly publicised and encouraged cross referral to trial sites facilitating good uptake.</p><p>The issue of whether cetuximab activity in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer is enhanced by the addition of irinotecan chemotherapy is the other important question addressed by the ICECREAM trial. There is preclinical evidence that irinotecan may enhance the efficacy of cetuximab in the G13D mutant subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and clinical evidence, from the BOND study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], in an unselected refractory mCRC population. Examination of the role of addition of chemotherapy in a highly selected subgroup such as the &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; is therefore important.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Summary</title><p>Therefore, this prospective study addresses the efficacy of cetuximab monotherapy compared to combination with irinotecan in two molecularly defined subpopulations of patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, either &#x0201c;quadruple wild type&#x0201d; tumours or <italic>KRAS</italic> G13D mutated tumours. Results will inform the need for larger phase III studies, as well as prove that randomised trials in rare molecular subtypes of CRC can be successfully completed using international collaborative networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AGITG, Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group; ALT, alanine transaminase (or alanine aminotransferase); ANC, absolute neutrophil count; AST, aspartate transaminase (or aspartate aminotransferase); BSA, body surface area; CT, computed tomography; CTC, National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre; DLQI, Dermatology Life Quality Index; DLQI, Dermatology Quality of Life Index Questionnaire; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFRI, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor; FACT, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy; FACT-EGFRI 18, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, pertaining specifically to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition; IV, intravenous; IVI, Intravenous infusion; mCRC, metastatic colorectal cancer; PBS, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; PFS, progression-free survival; QOL, quality of life; RECIST, Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours; ULN, upper limit of normal; WT, wild type</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Unrestricted educational grant to AGITG from Merck Serono Australia Pty Ltd.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.
