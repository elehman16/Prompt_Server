The safety of treatment was also documented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients (aged &#x02265; 18 years) were recruited if they had active acromegaly, defined as IGF-I levels at least 1&#x000b7;3 times the upper limit of the age-adjusted normal range. Patients who had previously received either a somatostatin analogue (other than lanreotide Autogel) or a dopaminergic agonist could be included if this elevated level of IGF-I was reached during the wash-out period, which lasted up to 12 weeks, depending on treatment previously administered. All somatostatin analogue or dopaminergic agonist treatment had to be discontinued at or before the first screening visit. A second screening visit was then scheduled as follows: 1 week after last administration of short-acting formulations of octreotide or dopaminergic agonist; 4 weeks after last administration of lanreotide 30 mg or long-acting dopaminergic agonist; and 8 weeks after last injection for long-acting octreotide formulation. If necessary, a third screening visit was scheduled 1 week after the previous visit for short-acting formulations, and 4 weeks after the previous visit for all others. If enrolment criteria were fulfilled at either of these visits, the patient was included. Patients were excluded from the study if they had previously received treatment with lanreotide Autogel. Patients were not permitted to have undergone pituitary surgery within the previous 3 months or have received radiotherapy for acromegaly within the previous 36 months.</p><p>All patients gave written, informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of each study centre. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (South Africa, 1996).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was an open-label, 48-week, phase III, multicentre study carried out by 17 investigators (16 in France and 1 in Switzerland).

This is comparable with a previous study in which 50% of patients given titrated doses of lanreotide Autogel achieved IGF-I normalization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Although other studies cite slightly higher percentages of patients achieving normalization in IGF-I levels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> it should be emphasized that, in contrast to other studies, this was the primary end-point in our study and the data analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population, recognized as the most realistic unselected method of assessing the data. Additionally, strict entry criteria were used to ensure that patients had active acromegaly &#x02013; that is, IGF-I levels increased at least 1&#x000b7;3 times the upper limit of the age-adjusted normal range. In contrast, in the other studies patients were selected on the basis of either GH level or marginally increased levels of IGF-I only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> This may be of importance when interpreting the results, as the response is generally better when baseline GH levels are not highly elevated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> Furthermore, although the inclusion criteria for this study were based on IGF-I levels only, all except one patient met the Cortina consensus criteria for active acromegaly (random GH &#x0003e; 0&#x000b7;4 &#x000b5;g/l and IGF-I levels above the age- and sex-adjusted normal range).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> The proportion of patients achieving normalized IGF-I levels in this study was not influenced by gender or prior radiotherapy.</p><p>In this study, GH levels &#x02264; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l were achieved in 85% of patients, higher than the percentage reported (68%) for titrated-dose lanreotide Autogel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> GH levels &#x0003c; 1 &#x000b5;g/l were achieved in 45% of patients, a higher proportion than achieved with octreotide treatment in a previous study (27%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with recent guidelines, which recommend assessing GH and IGF-I control using clearly defined ranges that were updated following recent advances in biochemical assay technologies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> The criteria for biochemical control of acromegaly that will best reduce disease-related morbidity are debated, and there remains no consensus regarding the criteria that predict a response to treatment. GH levels continue to have relevance as a disease marker, and may be the best predictors of the subtle GH excess or early GH dysregulation that is a precursor to acromegaly recurrence in some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Several studies have shown that achieving normal IGF-I levels is a good prognostic factor for acromegaly in terms of morbidity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> but also for mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Other studies, however, do not support the link between IGF-I level and excess mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> One recent study supports the validity of the currently used biochemical criteria for assessing long-term mortality and morbidity, but suggests that they may be insufficient in addressing patient quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> Therefore, the association between the improved hormonal control, in terms of both IGF-I and GH level, and the decrease in incidence of acromegaly symptoms in this study reinforces the concept of IGF-I as a useful disease marker.</p><p>Discordant results in the achievement of both GH levels &#x02264; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l and normal IGF-I levels are frequently observed when treating acromegaly patients with somatostatin analogues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and also after surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> Similarly, in our study there were 30 patients with GH levels &#x02264; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l but high IGF-I levels, and two patients with normal IGF-I levels but high GH levels. Reasons for why such discordance might occur in some patients have been proposed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> There is general agreement that achieving GH levels &#x02264; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l is not sufficient for the disease to be considered controlled;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> it is thought that the persistence of a continuous, albeit low, hypersecretion of GH (which can be detected with very sensitive assays) may promote the increased IGF-I levels seen in some patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> The situation whereby patients have normal IGF-I levels but high GH levels occurs less frequently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> It may be related to the fact that IGF-I levels are not only dependent on GH levels, but also on other factors which may interfere with sensitivity to GH at the receptor or the postreceptor level (e.g. the levels of oestrogens, the general nutritional state or the presence of diabetes).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> A direct peripheral effect of somatostatin analogues at a hepatic level has also been suggested to control the GH&#x02013;IGF-I axis, and may provide an explanation for the discordant GH and IGF-I suppression found in some patients receiving these drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref></p><p>In this study, following a starting dose of 90 mg of lanreotide Autogel, doses were titrated up to 120 mg or down to 60 mg according to GH and IGF-I levels, and therefore hormonal responsiveness. In our experience, although the initial dose of lanreotide Autogel does not appear to affect the rates of hormonal response achieved at optimal control after dose titration, initiation of treatment at 90 mg may result in lower annual cumulative GH concentrations. Thus, the 90-mg dose represents the optimal starting dose. Notably, Ashwell <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> also used 90 mg as a starting dose &#x02013; patients were switched from long-acting octreotide to 90-mg lanreotide Autogel, with the finding that acromegaly was at least as well controlled by lanreotide Autogel as it had been previously.</p><p>Fewer patients receiving the 60-mg dose had abnormal GH and/or IGF-I levels compared with those receiving higher doses, indicating that the patients whose doses are titrated down are the best responders and therefore able to achieve good control with a low dose. This improved efficacy at lower doses has been demonstrated,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and suggests that patients vary in their sensitivity to lanreotide Autogel. Like somatostatin, somatostatin analogues bind to receptors (sst) present on the cell surface of target organs. Five subtypes (sst1&#x02013;5) have been described, and the currently available somatostatin analogues bind with high affinity to sst2 and sst5. Partial or total resistance of GH-secreting adenomas to somatostatin analogues is in part due to variable tumoural expression or reduced receptor density of the five known sst subtypes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>The majority of patients had their doses titrated up, but 14% responded sufficiently to be able to have their dose titrated down to the lowest dose. The dose-titration frequency (12-week intervals) employed in this study is used widely in clinical practice &#x02013; generally the dose of lanreotide Autogel is increased when the GH level is &#x0003e; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l or the IGF-I level is outside of the age-adjusted normal range. The results are consistent with year-long dose-titration studies of other somatostatin analogues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> An alternative to changing the dose is to change the frequency of dosing;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> for example, it has recently been reported that patients whose acromegaly is well-controlled with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks may be able to have their dose interval extended to every 6&#x02013;8 weeks without loss of efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref></p><p>The general safety of repeated injections of lanreotide Autogel was assessed using standard haematology and biochemistry tests, physical examination and adverse event reporting. Treatment was well tolerated in this 48-week study and, as expected with somatostatin analogues, the adverse effects were predominantly minor, involving transient gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. There is an increased tendency for gallstone formation during long-term somatostatin analogue treatment, but gallbladder echocardiography performed at the end of this study revealed only a slight increase in the presence of gallstones or sludge (eight and four new cases, respectively). There were no cases of complicated gallstones. As a result of their inhibition of the secretion of insulin and glucagon, treatment with somatostatin analogues may be associated with disturbance of glucose control. In the present study, the proportion of patients with clinically significant abnormal glucose values was slightly higher at the end of the study (40%) compared with at baseline (33%), although adverse events of glycoregulation were mixed (two cases of new or aggravated diabetes mellitus and two cases of hypoglycaemia). It is recommended that blood glucose levels are monitored when lanreotide treatment is started, or when the dose is altered and any antidiabetic treatment adjusted accordingly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By the end of this 48-week study of lanreotide Autogel, in which IGF-I was used as the primary efficacy criterion, 43% of patients with acromegaly had normalized age-adjusted levels. This was accompanied by control of GH to levels &#x02264; 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b5;g/l in 85% of patients and reduction in acromegaly symptoms. Lanreotide Autogel was well tolerated with the safety profile expected of a somatostatin analogue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the investigators who recruited patients into the study (the Lanreotide Acromegaly Study Group): F.
