Therefore, the selective removal or inhibition of pathogenic microbes with systemic or locally delivered antimicrobial and host modulating agents, in combination with SRP, is often considered as an effective approach at specific disease active sites.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Various local delivery methods for administering chemotherapeutic agents, directly into the periodontal pockets, have been tested. These methods minimize the total dosage and resulting side effects and also maintain therapeutic drug levels in the gingival crevicular fluid over an extended period securing their therapeutic effects for a prolonged period of time.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The use of inexpensive pharmacologic compounds to stimulate the host to produce autogenous bone growth factors such as BMP-2 could be a cost-effective, nonsurgical alternative to treat osseous defects. Statins such as simvastatin (SMV), lovastatin, and pravastatin are specific competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and are widely used to lower cholesterol in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] SMV, an off-patent drug, used traditionally as a cholesterol-lowering medication and has recently been used as a craniofacial bone anabolic agent. It blocks the production of mevalonate, and its downstream products inhibit protein prenylation of geranylgeranyl-PP and farnesyl-PP. It seems to decrease osteoclast numbers, enhance alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization; increase sialoprotein, osteocalcin, type I collagen, and vascular endothelial growth factor; and decrease the production of interleukin-6 showing anti-inflammatory effect.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It also exhibits a positive effect on osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells. These effects may be caused by the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Pradeep and Thorat have analyzed the bioavailability and degradability of 1.2 mg of SMV gel in detail.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Hence, the subgingival drug delivery of SMV can produce advantages of achieving high intrasulcular drug concentrations, simultaneously avoiding its systemic side effects.</p><p>In this background, the present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of SMV, 1.2 mg, in an indigenously prepared biodegradable controlled-release gel, as an adjunct to SRP, comparing it with a placebo gel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective, interventional, and randomized controlled trial with split-mouth design was planned. Approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the institute (reference number &#x02013; KDCRC/ETH/Perio/2011/01). The cases were selected from the outpatient Department of Periodontology of the institute. After a detailed explanation of the procedures, written consents were obtained from the participants. The sample size was calculated with the help of a statistician. A total of sixty sites, two from each of thirty patients comprising both sexes, aged between 25 and 50 years completed the study. There was 11 drop-out of cases in the study.</p><p>Patients with definite clinical evidence of periodontitis, according to American Dental Association classification criteria 1999,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] having at least two periodontal pockets of &#x02265;5 mm on contralateral sides irrespective of single or multirooted teeth, having a minimum of twenty natural teeth, and normal lipid profile level were included in the study. Patients on systemic lipid lowering medication, smokers, pregnant women or lactating mothers, medically compromised patients, and mentally challenged, and physically challenged cases were excluded from the study.</p><p>Sites with periodontal pocket measuring &#x02265;5 mm and vertical bone loss &#x02265;2 mm between the base of defect and adjacent alveolar crest on intraoral periapical radiograph in different quadrants of the mouth were selected in cases for the two different treatment modalities by one examiner (KK). Each site was randomly assigned to either test group or the control group. Randomization was done by folded paper bits method and recorded secretly and coded by the second examiner (AC). The third examiner (EM), who was calibrated for intra- and inter-examiner variability and blinded for the study, recorded the clinical parameters-plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) at baseline and later on 1, 3, and 6 months. Radiologic assessment of interdental alveolar bone height using grid and Extended Cone Projection technique was recorded at baseline and 6 months. The fourth examiner (SA) performed SRP and delivery of SMV or the placebo gels according to the coded instructions. All the records were maintained by the second examiner who randomized the selection of the sites. At the end of the study, decoding was done. The data were compiled by the fifth examiner (MCA), and the statistical analysis and interpretation were done by the sixth examiner (VA).</p><p>Baseline values were recorded before providing any sort of treatment to the either sites. For the measurement of PPD and CAL, occlusal stents were prepared. For radiographic interpretation of the vertical depth of the defect, the contact point was taken as the reference point, and the distance from the contact point to the most apical extension of the defect was measured in mm, first at baseline and finally at 6 months.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The difference between the two readings gave the gain in vertical defect of the bone. The parameter was termed as INFRA 1, following the technique as used by Eickholz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The pattern, direction, and amount of bone regeneration in an infrabony defect also needed attention. To study this, the measurement of angulation of the bony defect was also taken into consideration.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Following the method applied by Tsitoura <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] the radiographic angle of the infrabony component of the defect was measured. As presented diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the following anatomical landmarks of the infrabony defect were identified on the radiograph:</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Measurement of angle of the defect (INFRA 2), i.e. angle between AC and CB</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-409-g001"/></fig><p>

</p><p>The radiographic defect angle was then defined by the two lines that represented the root surface of the involved tooth and the bone defect surface. These lines were expressed linearly as AC and BC, and the angular parameter between them was termed as preoperative INFRA 2.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Postoperatively, any change in the bone defect surface was represented by B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub> and the angle was measured between B<sub>1</sub>C1 and AC<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>The measurement of INFRA 2 is shown diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Thus, the following two groups were formed:</p><p>

Co., LLC, 3232 N. Rockwell St. Chicago, IL 60618-5935, USA). PPD, CAL, and radiographic findings were then recorded. The local delivery of SMV was done with the insulin syringe whose needle was made blunt by cutting its tip. The gel was loaded and delivered into the pocket with gentle force, and the needle was slowly taken out of the periodontal pocket so that the material filled the depths and curves of the pocket site. The gingiva was subsequently, carefully adapted to close the entrance of the gingival margin and Coe-Pak (Coe-Pak&#x02122;, GC America Inc., ALSIP, IL 60803, USA) was placed. The periodontal dressing of Coe-pak was removed after 2 days. Patients were expedited with postoperative compliance to report at 1, 3, and 6 months, during which their oral hygiene practices and status were evaluated and recordings of the postprocedural clinical parameters were done.

These observations may suggest the immunomodulatory effect of SMV as observed in various other studies also.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In addition, it may be interpreted that the significant reduction in PPD is not only due to the shrinkage of the soft tissue but also in response to SMV. This was further substantiated by getting a significant correlation between reduction in PPD and gain in CAL signifying the gain in attachment was taking place along with shrinkage of soft tissue, side by side [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. Radiographic evaluation further justifies these results. It was done by measuring the vertical depth of defect, INFRA 1 at baseline and at 6 months in both the groups. At baseline, between the groups, there was no significant difference which became significant at 6 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). The decrease in INFRA 1 is more in Group II (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) which concludes, relatively, more bone gain in Group II than in Group I. In one case, an unexpected INFRA 1 of 5 mm was also found at an SMV applied site.</p><p>The pattern, direction, and amount of bone regeneration in an intrabony defect also need attention. To study this, angulations of defects were calculated between root surface and defect surface and categorized as INFRA 2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In Group I, the values were compared between baseline and 6 months and was found to be identical so could not be calculated statistically, whereas in Group II, it was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>]. No significant differences were seen between the groups, when the values of INFRA 2 were subjected for statistical analyses at baseline (<italic>P</italic> = 0.736) and at 6 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.074) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. This might reflect that bone gain is parallel, i.e. from the lateral aspect also. Thus, the potential role of SMV as bone-sparing agent, and in the regeneration of lost periodontium could be justified along with other effects.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Although the present study is of short-term, the adjunctive use of subgingivally delivered biodegradable 1.2% SMV gel as evaluated in this study is safe and provides statistically significant results. Thus, on the basis of this study, it can be said that local SMV therapy markedly improves the benefits of SRP, both clinically and radiographically. By the use of these classes of drugs, the threshold for surgical periodontal therapy might move toward deeper pockets where better and additional effects might be expected with their use as local delivery drugs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Future trends</title><p>A point to be questioned is that why the deeper pockets are not always accompanied by bone gain with any of the nonsurgical procedures including local drug delivery. The answer could be that any of the above-mentioned techniques are blind techniques, and some amount of residual plaque and calculus could be left unnoticed. Hence, to achieve the osteogenic (modulatory) effect, placement of SMV mixed with bone graft after open flap debridement can give more challenging outcomes, and this has been proved clinically more effective in one of the studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The slow bio-absorption of this variant of SMV may be advantageous in patients in whom bone healing is slow. However, further research is demanded in this direction with long follow-ups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>SMV gel in the treatment of infrabony defects has shown favorable results clinically as evident by reduction in PPD and gain in CAL.
