Thus, changes made were similar in both the groups. In both the groups, <italic>Kasa</italic> (coughing) was decreased <italic>Vyaghreehareetakee Avaleha</italic> showed better results.

On ACQ assessments, <italic>Ashtangavaleha</italic> showed better results on awakening in night, awakening at morning due to asthma, limitation of activities, shortness of breathing, wheeze, need of bronchodilator, in comparison to <italic>Vyaghreehareetakee Avaleha</italic>. On total ACQ, changes made by both groups were statistically highly significant but on comparison between groups, the changes made by both formulations were similar and statistically insignificant by <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05. Thus, both formulations have a similar effect on total ACQ. The ingredients of both <italic>Ashtangavaleha</italic> and <italic>Vyaghreehareetakee Avaleha</italic> have immunomodulatory activity, which helps in regulating the allergic responses.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Immunostimulatory activity of aqueous extract of <italic>Kantakari</italic> fruits on mice gives strong evidence that the plant is an immunostimulating agent.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>On hematological parameters, decrease in absolute eosinophil count (AEC) shows a decrease in the magnitude of allergy. Here comparator agent showed better efficacy, so it may be inferred that it is more effective in allergic conditions, but the difference is statistically insignificant. Decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate simultaneous decrease in AEC clearly indicates the drugs action on allergic conditions.</p><p>In group AG and the change was statistically highly significant by <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001.

Comparative changes between group AG and group VG on FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF were statistically insignificant. Thus, both formulations have similar effect. A reduced ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) indicates obstruction to the flow of air from the lungs. In present trial, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC% was increased in group VG. Thus, <italic>Vyaghreehareetakee</italic> showed superiority over <italic>Ashtangavaleha</italic> on this parameter.</p><p>Quality of life is a key health indicator that should be routinely assessed. For children, it is important to obtain data on disorders that have an impact on the child and place a burden on the family. The QoL was assessed on general, physical, psychological, social and environmental health parameters. In the domain of all the parameters, both groups showed highly significant results but group AG showed better results than group VG while difference was statistically insignificant. In this study, both agents were highly effective in improving QoL. The formulations were having qualities to increases the <italic>Bala</italic> (strength) which is usually decreased in this condition thus improving the QoL of the child. Due to bio availability enhancer and immunomodulatory activity, the formulations have therapeutic potential for the prevention of allergic diseases. Due to effort made by researcher to educate patient and parents about preservation of the environment, healthy life-style and about exposure to risk factors (concept of <italic>Nidana Parivarjana</italic>), all the parameters of QoL improved significantly in both groups. Thus, all the QoL parameters assessed were improved significantly in both groups, and group AG showed better results than group VG. While comparing between the group AG and VG, difference was statistically insignificant. These profiles indicate that <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> significantly reduces the QoL in the patients. The investigator concluded that patients with bronchial asthma express overall lower levels of QoL.</p><p>When the individualized overall effect of therapy was considered, more number of patients in group AG reached moderate improvement zone when compared with group VG. In marked improvement zone, group AG had more number of patients while in mild improvement zone group VG had more number of patients. No patient had complete relief in any group. In no improvement zone both the groups are at par.</p><p>This shows a marginal better efficacy of <italic>Ashtangavaleha</italic> in comparison to <italic>Vyaghreehareetakee Avaleha</italic> on the overall condition of the patients presenting with Tamaka Shwasa. There was 66.66% of relief in the overall condition of <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> found in group AG and it was 63.15% in group VG. <italic>Tamak Shwasa</italic> is a multifactorial disorder.

Selected drugs are having <italic>Kapha-Vata</italic> mitigating action <italic>Ushnaveerya</italic> and <italic>Vatanulomana</italic> properties. These are having properties to remove the obstruction made by <italic>Kapha</italic> in the <italic>Pranavaha Srotas</italic> and related system and normalize the functioning of <italic>Vayu</italic>.
