Although hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment, there are concerns about serious adverse events. Non-hormonal pharmacological therapies are less effective and can also cause adverse effects. Complementary therapies, including acupuncture, are commonly used for menopausal vasomotor symptoms. While the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating vasomotor symptoms is inconclusive, acupuncture has a low risk of adverse effects, and two small studies suggest it may be more effective than non-insertive sham acupuncture. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of needle acupuncture in improving hot flush severity and frequency in menopausal women. Our current study design is informed by methods tested in a pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a stratified, parallel, randomised sham-controlled trial with equal allocation of participants to two trial groups. We are recruiting 360 menopausal women experiencing a minimum average of seven moderate hot flushes a day over a seven-day period and who meet diagnostic criteria for the Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis of Kidney <italic>Yin</italic> deficiency. Exclusion criteria include breast cancer, surgical menopause, and current hormone replacement therapy use. Eligible women are randomised to receive either true needle acupuncture or sham acupuncture with non-insertive (blunt) needles for ten treatments over eight weeks. Participants are blinded to treatment allocation. Interventions are provided by Chinese medicine acupuncturists who have received specific training on trial procedures. The primary outcome measure is hot flush score, assessed using the validated Hot Flush Diary. Secondary outcome measures include health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, credibility of the sham treatment, expectancy and beliefs about acupuncture, and adverse events. Participants will be analysed in the groups in which they were randomised using an intention-to-treat analysis strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results from this trial will significantly add to the current body of evidence on the role of acupuncture for vasomotor symptoms. If found to be effective and safe, acupuncture will be a valuable additional treatment option for women who experience menopausal vasomotor symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=336767">ACTRN12611000393954</ext-link> 11/02/2009.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Complementary medicine</kwd><kwd>Menopause</kwd><kwd>Hot flashes</kwd><kwd>Vasomotor symptoms</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Vasomotor symptoms</title><p>Three quarters of menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS), or hot flushes and night sweats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. VMS last an average of 5.2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] but persist in 10% of women for 15&#x000a0;years or longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and can cause significantly lowered quality of life due to social embarrassment, sleep deprivation, and physical discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Risk factors for VMS include Caucasian ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], increased body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], being a smoker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], feeling stressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], financial impoverishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and history of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>VMS management</title><p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a highly effective treatment for hot flushes, reducing incidence by up to 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, HRT also increases the risk of thromboembolic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and possibly, dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite growing interest in non-hormonal pharmacological therapies such as psychotropic drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), these are not as effective as HRT, and often cause troublesome adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Current evidence does not support the use of most complementary medicines (CM) for VMS, with popular treatments such as black cohosh shown to be ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and only modest benefits reported with soy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Yet, over half of the women surveyed in a 2006 Sydney study reported using CM for their menopausal symptoms, with acupuncturists being the second most popular therapists visited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Acupuncture</title><p>Acupuncture is a form of Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of fine needles into specific points on the surface of body known as acupuncture points, or acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Acupuncture has an excellent safety profile when practised by qualified acupuncturists, with large prospective studies reporting that 90% of patients do not experience any adverse events, and that serious events are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Some progress has been made on understanding the neural mechanisms of acupuncture. Acupuncture analgesia is modulated by various transmitters, notably endogenous opioids, serotonin and noradrenaline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Acupuncture activates the &#x02018;pain matrix&#x02019; - areas of the brain that have been shown to be consistently activated by noxious stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] - which includes the insula, an area that may be involved in the hot flush mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Acupuncture for VMS</title><p>The thermoneutral zone is the tolerable temperature zone of the immediate environment within which changes in core body temperature do not cause compensatory sweating or flushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Researchers propose that low serotonin levels and subsequent high noradrenaline levels during menopause narrow the thermoneutral zone in women experiencing VMS. Treatments that raise central serotonin levels, such as SSRIs or acupuncture, may reduce hot flushes by normalising the thermoneutral zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Two systematic reviews, published in 2009, found no evidence that acupuncture is effective for VMS, and recommended more rigorous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Since then, four new clinical trials have published their results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Two of these were pragmatic randomised trials and reported reductions of mean hot flush scores by 48 to 66% in treatment groups, compared with 28 to 29% in usual care groups (total n&#x02009;=&#x02009;451) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, a contentious issue in acupuncture research is the use of an adequate sham method in order to control for non-specific effects of acupuncture. One approach is insertive sham acupuncture, which may involve needling of acupuncture points that are considered to be &#x02018;irrelevant&#x02019; in the treatment of the condition in question, needling non-acupuncture points, or superficial needling without eliciting a needle sensation. Insertive sham controls are increasingly considered to be an inferior acupuncture control method, with many large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) failing to show a difference between true and insertive sham acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Five such trials for VMS all failed to demonstrate a difference in mean hot flush scores between groups receiving true and insertive sham acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Alternatively, non-insertive sham acupuncture controls for needling while simulating a needle-prick sensation using a blunt needle which does not penetrate the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These sham needles have been designed to shorten and &#x02018;telescope&#x02019; into themselves, and have been validated as plausible simulations of acupuncture in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Three small trials reported true acupuncture to be more effective than non-insertive sham, with greater reductions in VMS frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Two of these trials were published after the 2009 systematic reviews were conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Collectively, the extant literature suggests that acupuncture treatment as practised in a community setting can relieve the burden of hot flushes and that the insertion of a needle may represent part of the specific effect of acupuncture on VMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Pilot study of acupuncture for VMS</title><p>In 2009, CE, MP and CX undertook a pilot project to assess feasibility of a trial of needle acupuncture compared with non-insertive sham needle for VMS. Twenty-seven women were randomised, and 20 completed the study. Study outcomes and participant feedback were used to modify the design of this current RCT protocol. Our method was feasible and acceptable to participants (results not published).</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>There is a need for safe and effective treatment of menopausal VMS, given the negative impact that hot flushes can have on quality of life. Acupuncture is a popular treatment amongst midlife women and has a favourable safety profile. However, evidence for its effectiveness in treating VMS remains inconclusive, although results from pragmatic studies and studies using non-insertive sham needles are promising. We have used findings from our feasibility study to inform the design of an adequately powered randomised sham-controlled trial using the non-insertive sham needle.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>Our primary aim is to assess the efficacy of needle acupuncture in improving hot flush severity and frequency in menopausal women. Our hypothesis is that needle acupuncture will result in greater improvement in the severity and frequency of hot flushes compared to non-insertive sham acupuncture after ten treatments given over an eight-week period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The trial, also known as the &#x02018;Acupause&#x02019; trial, is a stratified, single (participant)-blind, parallel, randomised sham-controlled trial with equal allocation.

In particular the positive study by Nir <italic>et al</italic>. used an average of six points, and nine treatments were provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. A literature review suggests that at least ten treatments should be provided for hot flush treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

To be clinically significant, we expect that women in the true intervention group to show at least 75% reduction in the total HF score from baseline, with a mean HF score of 3 at EOT. Based on these assumptions, 266 women (133 per trial group) will be needed to detect hot flush score difference of 4 (standard deviation (SD)&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]) between the two trial groups at EOT. This sample size is sufficient to detect a difference of 0.35 of 1 SD between the trial groups for the quality of life measures. Sample size was inflated to 360 women (180 per study group) to allow for attrition of 26% (experienced in the pilot study) at the measurement of the primary outcome at the EOT.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><sec><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Participants are randomly allocated to one of two trial groups: true acupuncture or sham acupuncture, using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, stratified by project acupuncturist using block sizes of either eight or twelve (with block sizes appearing in random order) within each stratum and an allocation ratio of 1:1. The research assistant responsible for allocating participants is not aware of the block sizes used. An independent researcher with no other involvement in the trial used this allocation sequence to create a password-protected electronic &#x02018;spreadsheet&#x02019; which contains the covert allocation schedule. The principal investigator (MP) holds the randomisation schedule.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation and allocation concealment</title><p>Upon confirmation of eligibility of women for the trial (that is, after completion of the baseline HFD and clinical confirmation of diagnosis of Kidney <italic>Yin</italic> deficiency), the unblinded research assistant (KN) uses the spreadsheet to randomly allocate participants to receive either real or sham acupuncture. The spreadsheet displays sequentially only the next treatment allocation.</p><p>The research assistant informs the relevant project acupuncturist of the allocation status by mobile phone text messaging, Email or fax, depending on the acupuncturist&#x02019;s preference. Group allocation is indicated only by the list of acupuncture points for either real or sham acupuncture, to avoid unblinding should the participant inadvertently see the communication. As acupoints used for &#x02018;needling&#x02019; in real and sham acupuncture groups are different, acupuncturists can easily identify group allocation from the list of points provided. This process can be cross-checked against the covert randomisation schedule code held by the principal investigator to ensure no corruption of the process has occurred. To prevent selection bias, all baseline information is collected prior to the acupuncturist being informed of the treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The research assistant responsible for randomisation (KN) and the project acupuncturists who deliver the treatment to the women are not blind to treatment allocation. Blinding of project acupuncturists is not possible because of the difference between real and sham acupuncture points used and the tactile difference between real and sham needling.</p><p>Participants and all other investigators are blinded, including the study statistician. As outcomes are self-assessed, outcome assessment is blinded. Data analysis will be performed where the treatment groups will be identified as Group A and B. The codes for the treatment groups will be revealed after the all outcome data collection is completed at six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Prior to providing consent to participate, participants are informed of potential adverse events from acupuncture. Common adverse events include fainting, drowsiness, tiredness, temporary increase in symptoms, bruising and soreness. A practitioner guide to preventing and managing common adverse events is provided in the Practitioner Training Manual. Participants report adverse events either to the project acupuncturist delivering the intervention or the acupuncturist researcher. The project acupuncturist refers to the acupuncturist researcher in the event of ongoing or unresolved concerns. Serious adverse events (defined as potentially life-threatening, permanently incapacitating or resulting in hospitalisation) are notified to the study chief investigator (MP) and the Human Research Ethics Committee within 24&#x000a0;hours. Informed by the pilot project, it is anticipated that telephone advice from a general practitioner (MP/CE) and/or acupuncturist researcher (JS) will be adequate in most cases. If participants require additional medical advice, they are directed to their general practitioner. The expert acupuncturist (CX), who chairs the Chinese Medicine Board in Australia, is also available for advice.</p><p>Participants who score higher than 15 on the baseline depression and/or anxiety scales will be contacted by a general practitioner investigator (CE/MP) to be assessed for suicide risk and referred to relevant services as required.</p><p>Both the relevant project acupuncturist and the participant complete an Adverse Event Form should the need arise. The form records the dates and times that the event began and resolved; a description of the event; the intensity of the event (mild/moderate/severe); an assessment of the possible relationship to acupuncture, on a four-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;unrelated&#x02019; to &#x02018;definitely related&#x02019;; the outcome on a five-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;completely resolved&#x02019; to &#x02018;persistent&#x02019;; and whether the event was considered serious (potentially life-threatening, permanent incapacitating or resulting in hospitalisation).</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire, Case Report Form, TCM Diagnosis Form and Adverse Events Form are completed on paper copies.

Online surveys have the advantage of minimising missing data if completion of survey questions is made mandatory prior to submitting the survey online. Range checks are also built into online surveys, and automated reminders are Emailed. The study acupuncturist and research assistant (CE and KN) oversee this data management. A reminder letter/Email is sent after two weeks, followed by a courtesy telephone call two weeks later by the research assistant should questionnaires not be returned. Details of treatment dates and follow-up are recorded in a custom-built password-protected database.</p><p>All paper-based data are entered into the same survey management website by staff blinded to group allocation at the University of Melbourne. Ten percent of all data entry will be audited by an independent investigator for quality assurance purposes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise baseline measures and participant characteristics between the two trial groups and to assess for chance imbalance of important prognostic factors. Primary outcome is the hot flush score at EOT. Analysis will account for repeated outcome measures taken on the same women over 12&#x000a0;months and stratification by project acupuncturists. Mixed-effects linear regression model will be used to compare the continuous outcomes between the trial groups and marginal logistic regression model using generalised estimating equations with robust standard errors will be used for the binary outcomes. Where appropriate the baseline measure of the outcome will be included as a covariate in the regression model. In addition, factors strongly associated with the outcome and are found to be imbalanced between the trial groups at baseline will also be adjusted in the regression models. Estimates of the intervention effect will be reported as the difference in means between trial groups for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes, with respective 95% confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic>-values. Stata 13.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] will be used for the data analyses.</p><p>An intention-to-treat analysis strategy will be employed where all participants will be analysed in the trial group in to which they were allocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In the first instance, we will strive to minimise the extent of missing outcome data for participants, where all efforts will be made to collect the primary outcome on participants who withdraw, discontinue their treatment or do not respond to the online survey. However, in the presence of incomplete data, information collected on the reasons for missing data will be used to inform the appropriate statistical analysis approach to handle the missing data. Sensitivity analyses that capture departures from the assumption of the missing data mechanism for the primary analysis will also be considered to assess the robustness of the results.</p><sec><title>Secondary analyses</title><p>Additional secondary analyses are planned. These will include (1) exploring the effect acupuncture had on women&#x02019;s quality of life, (2) identifying factors that are associated with a placebo response, (such as anxiety/depression levels and demographic characteristics such as socioeconomic status), (3) the association between expectancy and beliefs and women&#x02019;s response to acupuncture treatment, and (4) the credibility of the Park Sham Device.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data monitoring</title><p>As acupuncture has an excellent safety profile, and is not considered an experimental treatment, no data monitoring committee is required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Hot flushes are a common and potentially disabling symptom during the menopause. While HRT is an effective treatment, it does not suit all women either because of concerns over potentially serious adverse events, or because of relative contra-indications. Many women also prefer to use natural or complementary therapies where available. There is a paucity of effective and safe non-hormonal treatments for VMS. However, preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, a popular and safe treatment for a wide range of conditions, may be effective for VMS.</p><p>We are conducting a randomised sham-controlled trial on acupuncture for VMS, which builds on the results from our earlier pilot project during which feasibility of methods was demonstrated. This robustly designed study meets methodological benchmarks of adequate randomisation and allocation concealment procedures, blinding of outcome assessors and statisticians and utilising intention-to-treat analysis strategy. The trial method also allows for Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis in the eligibility criteria and a &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of acupuncture reflecting clinical practice to ensure results are applicable to a broad range of health practitioners. The trial is appropriately powered to determine a clinically relevant treatment effect. Our results will determine the efficacy of acupuncture for treating VMS in postmenopausal women. In particular, we will assess the specific effect of insertion of the acupuncture needle and its contribution to the entire treatment effect.</p><p>Our results will inform women suffering with menopausal symptoms and both conventional and Traditional Chinese Medicine health care professionals on the potential role, if any, of acupuncture in the treatment of VMS. This will advance the field significantly and, if effective, will offer an important treatment option to reduce VMS and potentially improve quality of life in women at this important life stage. Future research may explore the optimal treatment regimen for acupuncture for VMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial has received funding and recruitment commenced in late 2011. At the time of submission of this protocol, project acupuncturists had been trained, participant enrolment was progressing well and data collection was well underway. Trial enrolment closed in March 2014. We anticipate that all data will be collected by late 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: body mass index; CM: complementary medicines; CONSORT: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; EOT: end-of-treatment; FSH: follicular stimulating hormone; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HFD: Hot Flush Diary; HRT: hormone replacement therapy; MENQOL: Menopause-specific Quality of Life questionnaire; STRICTA: Standards for reporting interventions in acupuncture trials; RCT: randomised controlled trial; SD: standard deviation; SNRIs: serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; SSRIs: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; TCM: Traditional Chinese Medicine; TNZ: thermoneutral zone; VMS: vasomotor symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CE conceived of the idea and designed the pilot project with input from MP and CX.
