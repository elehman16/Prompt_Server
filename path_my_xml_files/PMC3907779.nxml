PrUs are an important challenge for the overall health system because can prolong patient hospitalization and reduce quality of life. Moreover, 95% of PrUs are avoidable, suggesting they are caused by poor quality care assistance. PrUs are also costly, increasing national costs. For example, they represent about 5% of overall annual health expenses in Spain. Stages I and II PrUs have a combined prevalence of 65%. According main clinical guidelines, stage II PrUs (PrU-IIs) are usually treated by applying special dressings (polyurethane or hydrocolloid). However, little scientific evidence regarding their efficacy has been identified in scientific literature. Our aim is to assess the comparative efficacy of adhesive polyurethane foam and hydrocolloid dressings in the treatment of PrU-IIs in terms of healed ulcer after 8 weeks of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This paper describes the development and evaluation protocol of a randomized clinical trial of two parallel treatment arms. A total of 820 patients with at least 1 PrU-II will be recruited from primary health care and home care centers.

Long-standing pressure can reduce capillary blood flow and lead to cell death, necrosis and broken tissue, or to additional serious complications, including osteomyelitis, sepsis, contractures, atrophy and psychological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These complications may delay mobilization and active rehabilitation, as well as reducing the ability of patients to live active and independent lives. PrUs can affect patients in all health care settings, provoke pain and discomfort, decrease quality of life and even increase morbidity and residence time in healthcare institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>PrUs can also increase direct and indirect healthcare costs and provide a negative image of healthcare institutions, attributable to deficits in the quality of care, especially since 95% of PrUs are preventable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A national study has estimated that expenditures related to the onset of PrU amounts to approximately 5% of the annual healthcare spending in Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>A national prevalence study in 2006 by the GNEAUPP (Spanish acronym of National Group for the Study and Advice in Pressure Ulcers and Chronic Wounds) showed a wide variability in PrUs prevalence among types of institutions. PrUs have been reported to occur in 3.73% of patients in domiciliary care, 8.24% of hospitalized patients and 6.1% of patients in nursing homes. Moreover, 2.1% of patients with PrUs were aged 0 to 45&#x000a0;years, 6.4% were aged 46 to 64&#x000a0;years and 87.4% were aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Within each category, PrU incidence was very variable, ranging from 3-29% in hospitalized patients. Moreover, PrUs have been observed in 66% of elderly individuals (risk population) with femur fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) has classified PrUs in four stages. Stages I and II are more frequent, with a combined rate of about 65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], although it differs among studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The EPUAP has defined stage II PrU (PrU-II) as involving a partial loss in skin thickness, affecting the epidermis and/or dermis. These are considered superficial ulcers, clinically manifesting as abrasions or blisters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Prevention is the best treatment for PrU. However, despite Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCP), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] which report the effectiveness of preventive activities (adequate nutrition, effective pressure relief, positional changes, management of incontinence and elimination of shearing and friction forces), there is little scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of these measures in avoiding further problems related to PrUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, evidence has suggested that PrUs healing in a moist environment, using special or modern dressings, is more cost effective than traditional cure or dry-to-wet dressings (i.e. dressings that do not maintain a moist environment) because the former stimulate cell proliferation. In addition, special dressings act as a barrier against bacteria, absorb excess wound fluid, reduce pain during the healing process and create the right conditions (moist environment) for healing or scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of a moist environment have led to the development of a flowering variety of synthetic dressings (special or also called modern dressings). Use of these dressings depends on the availability of resources, PrU stage and morphology, and the presence of infection and/or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although GCP guidelines indicate that the special dressings most frequently used to treat PrU-II are hydrocolloid and polyurethane foam dressings. To date, however, systematic reviews and clinical trials have established a poorly and scarcely evidence of their effectiveness. Although studies have shown benefits of polyurethane dressings, their benefits did not differ significantly from those of hydrocolloid dressings. In addition, these studies involved patients with various wound types (pressure ulcers and venous ulcers) and different PrU stages, which may have affected the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To overcome these limitations, the present study will compare two types of dressings in the treatment of PrU-IIs, both which are recommended and are part of habitual clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, due to the wide variability in both types of dressing, this study will compare the adhesive versions of polyurethane and hydrocolloid dressings.</p><sec><title>Aim and hypothesis</title><p>The main hypothesis of this study is that hydrocolloid dressings would heal at least 10% more stage II PrUs than polyurethane foam dressings over 8&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up in patients with PrU-II.</p><p>The aim of the proposed protocol is to compare the efficacy of adhesive polyurethane foam dressings and adhesive hydrocolloid dressings in the treatment of PrU-II.

All patients will receive a standardized preventive intervention to reduce pressure and undergo a PrU healing cure process.</p><p><bold>
<italic>Transversal interventions</italic>
</bold> are designed for pressure relief and positional changes, favoring an optimal evolution of stage II PrU (PrU-II). Adequate relief of pressure forces (shearing or friction) requires changes in position of bedridden or sitting patients and the use of pressure-relieving support surfaces (PRSS).</p><p>Due to their structure, PRSS can reduce pressure forces, as well as heat and humidity, increasing patient comfort. PRSS can cover the entire body or only part of it and can be found in different sizes and types: mattresses, mats or cushions. However, it is important to highlight that the use of PRSS does not mean ignoring other healing procedures, including changes of position, skin care and good nutritional state. Rather, PRSS use only serves as a complement to the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>To standardize changes in position and pressure reduction, study nurses will follow a national GCP recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recommendations for frequency of position changes, as well as specific recommendations for bedridden and sitting patients, must be taken into account. Each study nurse or caregiver will be trained to properly implement the recommendations in the aforementioned GCP.</p><p><bold>
<italic>Healing cure process</italic>
</bold> addresses the cleansing process and prevention of infection. Standardization of this process can be accomplished using recommendations from the reference GCP. Briefly:</p><p><italic>The wound must be cleaned every time the study dressing is changed</italic>. The first step is to thoroughly irrigate the wound bed with saline solution to remove detritus, bacteria and remains of any previous treatment. A 20&#x000a0;ml syringe of saline solution adapted with a 0.9 &#x000d7; 25 needle or a 19&#x000a0;mm catheter. Local antiseptics (e.g. povidone, chlorhexidine) and skin cleaners should be avoided because they are cytotoxic to new granulating tissue and their habitual use can have systemic effects due to absorption.</p><p><italic>The drying procedure must be also delicate</italic>. Rough material (such as gauzes or sponges) can induce small traumas on the wound bed, increasing the risk of infection and interfering with the healing process. Wound edges should be dry and clean and wound beds moist. Care should be taken to avoid damaging healthy tissue during cleansing and drying procedures.</p><p><italic>Bacterial infection should be prevented</italic>. An aseptic technique should be used if possible, including the use of clean gloves. Proper healing and debridement procedures can minimize the risk of infection. If a patient presents with more than one PrU-II, the most contaminated one should be left to the end (i.e. perennial area).</p><p>It is important to isolate and remove waste and contaminated materials in accordance with established precautions to avoid cross contaminations.</p><p>If there is leakage of exudates, lack of adherence or any situation suggesting loss of study dressing, additional (secondary) dressings will be used. If this additional support is inadequate, the study dressing will be changed following the same procedure and be registered in the CRF.</p></sec><sec><title>Study dressings</title><sec><title>Polyurethane foams</title><sec><title>Description and features</title><p>These dressings derive from polyurethanes and have a hydrophilic structure. They present with a high capacity of autolytic debridement and absorption of exudates; and keep the wound bed from drying out, without leaving residuals or decomposing. In addition, they avoid leakages, stains and odors, keep periwound skin intact, reduce frictional forces and do not produce traumas when removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Indications</title><p>These dressings are recommended for all stages of PrU (with moderate or high exudates). Frequent monitoring and changes may be necessary when PrUs become infected.</p></sec><sec><title>Contraindications</title><p>These dressing cannot be combined with antiseptics (e.g. iodine, chlorhexidine, hypochlorite, ether or hydrogen peroxide), oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite because all of the latter can destroy the dressing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Hydrocolloids</title><sec><title>Description and features</title><p>These dressings are made of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and other hydrocolloids (elastomers), adherent substances or hydroactive compounds, providing absorption capacity. They are covered with a polyurethane layer, giving them occlusive or semi occlusive properties. In addition, they absorb exudates and necrotic residuals by forming a gel with special color and odor characteristics, creating a slightly acid environment with bacteriostatic properties. Moreover, they reduce friction forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Indications</title><p>These dressings are recommended in non-infected PrU stages I, II and III; slough ulcers and those with necrotic tissue (as an autolytic debriding agent) and granulation phase or epithelialization healing process.</p></sec><sec><title>Contraindications</title><p>These dressings should not be applied to infected ulcers or those in which bones or tendons are observed.

This approach reduces any bias that may occur when participants not receiving assigned treatments are excluded from analysis. All tests will be two-sided and &#x003b1;-values of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Descriptive analysis of the patients</title><p>The trial involves a descriptive analysis of the baseline characteristics of patients in both treatment arms.

Mean changes in PrU size will be compared using Student&#x02019;s t-tests for normal distributions or the Mann-Whitney U test against the usual null hypothesis (non-normal distributions): (initial area-final area)*100/initial area). In addition, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to assess the clinical significance of treatment.</p><p>A logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders will be performed when patients are not equally distributed in both treatment arms. Relative and absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat, defined as the estimated number of ulcers needed to be treated with the chosen dressing for one additional ulcer to be healed will be estimated, along with their corresponding 95% CIs.</p><p>Time to healing in the two treatment arms will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox regression model of proportional risks will be used when the models require adjustment for any statistically significant baseline variable.</p><p>Finally, a partial economic evaluation will be performed, including direct costs such as number of dressings used per patient, additional dressings used, materials used, labor cost per cured ulcer and further treatment cost. The overall differences in mean costs and effects between treatments will be calculated using Student&#x02019;s t-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Balearic Island Ethic Committee. It will be performed by qualified nurses. The rights and welfare of patients will be respected throughout the trial. All involved patients will be informed, verbally and in writing, of the trial objectives, risks and possible benefits. Signed informed consent form will be required from each patient.

Of these lesions, about 40% have been categorized as stage II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>PrU-II treatment consists mainly of the application of polyurethane and hydrocolloid dressings, which are recommended and part of habitual clinical practice. However, little is known about the relative efficacy of these two types of dressings.</p><p>Among available data, highlights a recent systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of modern dressings in the treatment of venous ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found that hydrocolloid dressings were the most common type, evaluated in 27 of 45 (60%) clinical trials (CTs). Most of these CTs compared hydrocolloid dressing with other types of dressings or compared different types of hydrocolloid dressings.</p><p>The review included a meta-analysis of four CTs, involving 311 patients, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] comparing the effectiveness of hydrocolloid and polyurethane foam dressings for venous ulcers, with the primary outcome being the total number of healed ulcers in 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks. However, that analysis found no statistically significant difference in the healing rates with dressings (pooled relative risk (RR) 0.98; 95% CI, 0079 to 1.22).</p><p>Similarly, another meta-analysis of three CTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] comparing the effectiveness of hydrocolloid dressings with preparations of polyurethane foams in treating 129 patients with PrUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], found no significant between group difference (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.17).</p><p>Most previous studies comparing polyurethane and hydrocolloid dressings have methodological shortcomings, reducing the value of their results and conclusions. These included small sample sizes, resulting in low statistical power, as well as a lack of patient follow up, absence of ITT analysis, different outcome measures, and the inclusion of various wound types and different PrU stages.</p><p>Furthermore, among the many types of PrU treatments and dressings currently in use are silicone hydrogels, hydrocellular polyurethanes and polyurethane foams, hydropolymeric silicone and foams, hydrocolloids, and antimicrobial bioactive collagen (collagenase). However the use of most is based on little scientific evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].However, scientific evidence is required to optimize the treatment of PrU-II, and pressure ulcers in general.</p><p>This study has been designed to avoid the methodological problems encountered in other studies and to provide better evidence for optimal PrU-II treatment. Our protocol includes training sessions for nursing staff involved in the conduct of the trial, and standardizing data collection.</p><p>Identification of optimal dressings can improve patient quality of life and decrease treatment costs. It won&#x02019;t be able to succeed unless we don&#x02019;t stop and try to shed light on this health problem with the resources which are at our disposal and are recommended in the main GCP guidelines with little evidence about them.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PrU: Pressure ulcers; PrU-II: Stage II pressure ulcers; EPUAP: European pressure advisory panel; GCP: Good clinical practice guidelines; CT: Clinical trial; AE: Adverse events; ITT: Intention to treat analysis</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>AS and MG conceived the project.

In addition, some GAUPP members constitute the expert panel responsible for confirming the occurrence of PrU-II and its healing (or not) at the end of the study. MH, AM, JM, CP and MAR are responsible for contacting the main study nurses, at primary health centers, nursing homes, and non-acute long term hospitalization centers AL is responsible statistical analyses and sample size calculations. MA and SM are responsible for the logistics of obtaining and delivering study dressings to primary health centers, nursing homes, and non-acute long term hospitalization centers. ME and JL have provided unconditional support and scientific knowledge to improve the study. Finally, MG was responsible for drafting this manuscript.
