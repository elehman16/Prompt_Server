The Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the study protocol (Research project number 288132). 64 uremic patients were randomized into two study groups by random allocation software. All subjects signed a consent form permitting catheter use.</p><p>Collected information for this study included demographic data, body mass index (BMI), and having history of hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease, selection cause of peritoneal dialysis (PD), duration of operation (minute) and duration of hospitalization (day). Data were extracted from a check list included history, clinical assessment and treatment given to patients. Outcome was considered as infectious and mechanical complications. Exit site infection confirmed by redness, purulent discharge and peritonitis. Mechanical complications were considered as PDC out flow failure, fluid leak from, hemopenitoneom, hollow viscous perforation, and incisional site hernia. Patients were followed for two months with respect to mechanical and infectious complications. Inclusion criteria were having stage 5 chronic kidney disease (according to national kidney foundation guideline) which needed renal replacement therapy; self-care ability, patient's consent and having family support for choosing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) as a choice of therapeutic modality,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> and being aged over 18 years old.

A 18 French dilator and split sheath was inserted over the guide wire then the dilator and guide wire removed and swan neck coil peritoneal dialysis catheter with 2 felt cuffs was inserted and advanced through the sheath. Then two parts of sheath were divided and removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). First cuff fixed on linea Alba with absorbable suture (vicrill 2-0).

Duration of hospitalization for these patients was approximately 3 days in comparison to 7-10 days in those for whom laparotomy and surgical placement were used. There was no fluid leakage. One patient had an injury to the hollow viscous and mesenteric artery. They needed emergency laparotomy and ligation of the bleeding vessel. Another patient had bloody drain fluid which managed conservatively. In three patients, the drain of peritoneal fluid was inadequate, presumably due to omental wrapping around the in-dwelling catheter, and needed surgical omentectomy. Percutaneous catheter insertion is extremely simple to perform and, in comparison to laparotomy, reduces the duration of hospitalization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> In our series there were no significant differences in hospitalization time in both groups. In addition there was not any serious complication like visceral or vascular perforation. Also fluid leakage was the same in both groups.</p><p>Ozener et al suggested that in comparison to surgical technique, percutaneous insertion of PDC has the same catheter-related mechanical and infectious complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> This study showed that there is no significant difference between two methods of catheter insertion, however some of complications (hemopenito-neom and outflow failure) were seen more common in surgical method than percutaneous method.</p><p>Mellotte et al retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 230 PDC insertions, fifty were placed percutaneously and 180 were placed through surgical techniques. Inserted percutaneous PDC was non-elective in a procedure room beside the nephrology ward. Percutaneous group were older (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and had increased early mortality (p &#x0003c; 0.005) due to cause of renal disease. They concluded that percutaneous PDC placement provides a safe, reliable access for peritoneal dialysis and is especially suitable for critically ill patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> In this study there were 3 deaths in P group and they were not related to catheter insertion method, but due to underlying coronary artery events. We excluded them and there is no statistical analysis in this manner, but it seems we are the same in this complication.</p><p>Tiong et al showed that, 31% of percutaneous inserted catheters had early complications, which most of them were wound infections and catheter malfunctions. Catheter insertion for peritoneal dialysis is associated with remarkable surgical morbidity. Also, surgical time is prolonged and patients with previous abdominal surgery are at increased risk of morbidity and complication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Yang PJ et al reported their results in mini laparotomy for PDC insertion in which exit site and tunnel infection were the most common complication (11.8%), in expert surgeon hand with a good post-operative care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> They did not compare their series with percutaneous method. In our series percutaneous method is less time consuming with fewer complications so it can be done faster even in an emergency situation.</p><p>This study was done on a small group of uremic patients in an elective situation; further studies should be performed on larger groups in both elective and urgent situations to evaluate this method of PDC insertion in acute renal dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Percutaneous catheter insertion has fewer rate of complications and is less time consuming in comparison with surgical method.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>All the authors have carried out the study, participated in the design of the study and acquisition of data performed the statistical analysis and wrote the manuscript.
