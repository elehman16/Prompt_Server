Despite being shown to improve survival and quality-of-life in stable patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, long-term noninvasive ventilation is controversial in unstable patients with frequent exacerbations, complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In an uncontrolled group of patients with previous episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, treated with noninvasive ventilation, we have been able to reduce mortality and the number of repeat respiratory failure and readmissions by continuing the acute noninvasive ventilatory therapy as a long-term therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Multi-center open label randomized controlled trial of 150 patients having survived an admission with noninvasive ventilatory treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

COPD patients having survived AHRF have a poor prognosis; Chu et al. have shown one-year risks of readmission of 79.9&#x000a0;%; of a new life-threatening event (death or repeat AHRF) of 63.3&#x000a0;%; and of death of 49.1&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Hypothetically, long-term NIV (LTNIV) can improve the prognosis for severe COPD. The majority of trials have focused on patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to stable COPD (i.e., patients with no exacerbations prior to LTNIV initiation); and their results have been conflicting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in 2014, K&#x000f6;hnlein et al. published the results of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LTNIV for stable patients with an arterial CO<sub>2</sub> tension (<italic>P</italic><sub>a,CO2</sub>) of 7 kPa or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]: The patients treated with LTNIV had a one-year mortality of 12&#x000a0;% vs. 33&#x000a0;% for the controls; and the patients treated with LTNIV scored higher in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL).</p><p>Three RCTs have studied the effects of LTNIV for unstable COPD, i.e., where the participants were enrolled after an admission with NIV treatment of AHRF: Cheung et al. and found that the patients treated with LTNIV had a lower rate of repeat AHRF (38.5&#x000a0;%/year vs. 60.2&#x000a0;%/year, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; and Funk et al. found that the LTNIV group had a longer mean time to clinical worsening (391&#x000a0;days vs. 162&#x000a0;days; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the largest RCT by Struik et al., showed no differences between the LTNIV group and the controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Little is known of what predicts AHRF in severe COPD. However, based on the large ECLIPSE study on exacerbations of COPD, Hurst et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and M&#x000fc;llerova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showed that previous exacerbations predict new exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; and that previous admissions due to exacerbations of COPD predict new admissions and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>We assume that previous admissions with AHRF due to COPD could predict new admissions with AHRF and need of NIV, as well as death.</p><p>We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients who were treated with LTNIV and followed at our pulmonary ward. The patients were offered LTNIV if they had been admitted for NIV treatment of AHRF at least twice. We found that the patients&#x02019; number of AHRF episodes and admissions due to COPD decreased significantly. And only four of the patients (20&#x000a0;%)&#x02014;considerably less than the 49.1&#x000a0;% showed by Chu et al.&#x02014;died within one year after initiation. Furthermore, these highly selected patients tolerated LTNIV well.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this RCT is to investigate whether LTNIV can reduce mortality or repeat AHRF in patients who have been admitted for NIV treatment of AHRF due to COPD; and, secondarily, whether LTNIV can reduce mortality per se and the number of repeat AHRF, readmissions, and exacerbations, and improve quality of life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>COPD patients who are admitted for NIV treatment of AHRF (pH&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7.35 and <italic>P</italic><sub>a,CO2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6 kPa) at Gentofte, Bispebjerg, Hvidovre or Herlev Hospitals in Greater Copenhagen are eligible.

The participants are included during an admission with NIV treatment of AHRF due to COPD. If the patient gives consent (see below), he or she is randomized to either LTNIV or usual care. The acute NIV therapy is continued for as long the patient presents a hypercapnic acidosis or severe dyspnea without NIV; hereafter, NIV is ceased in the patients in the control group, whereas it is continued with the same settings in the LTNIV patients. When stable and when deemed appropriate by a physician, the patients are discharged.</p><p>The included patients will be given the possibility of contacting an acute hotline, operated by a nurse.</p><p>One week after discharge, all patients are visited by a nurse. The patients are followed in the outpatient departments with visits 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months after discharge.</p><p>A participant who is readmitted will not be re-randomized. If the participant is in the intervention group, LTNIV is resumed, if paused.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Consent</title><p>When stabilized and able to have a small pause from NIV, the patient is presented to the study. If interested, the patient is formally informed of the study by one of the attending physicians. This is typically 2&#x000a0;days after admission, although individual. The information session is held with a physician who has devoted time for this and who is not disturbed. When informed, the consent form is signed by the patient and the informing physician. If the participant wants time for consideration, a new session will be planned one or two days later.</p><p>No individual data will be published.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>For the intervention group, the acute NIV treatment is continued as LTNIV with the pressures and settings which had reversed the respiratory failure and the hypercapnic acidosis. The participant is offered to initiate an average volume-assured pressure support, but this is not mandatory.</p><p>Before discharge, the participant and caregivers are trained in handling and cleaning the ventilator, tubes, masks, etc. The participant is told to use the ventilator for a minimum of six hours of daily, preferably during sleep.</p><p>At the home visits and outpatient consultations, LTNIV is optimized according to the participant&#x02019;s requests or complaints.</p><p>One month after discharge, LTNIV participants who have had only this one episode of AHRF and who do not feel a subjective improvement are offered to pause the LTNIV therapy, provided they have not had any of the following after discharge: exacerbation; need for antibiotics, increased oral corticosteroids, or inhaled medicine; hospitalization or visit to an emergency room or emergency physician due to COPD; fever of 38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or higher for at least one day; increased or purulent expectoration; or increasing dyspnea for at least one day.</p><p>If it is agreed to pause LTNIV, the participant is instructed to resume LTNIV at one or more of the above symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization</title><p>A total of 150 COPD patients will be included from the four wards. The participants are randomized to LTNIV or usual care in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated block-randomization for each center. The participant is presented with a sealed envelope containing a piece of paper with either &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; (= LTNIV) or &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; (= usual care).

Three previous RCTs have assessed LTNIV for COPD patients after an episode of AHRF, treated with NIV; the results have been conflicting as the two smaller RCTs showed that LTNIV could reduce repeat AHRF and clinical worsening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], whereas the largest RCT showed no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the large RCT and in one of the two small, an additional inclusion criterion was persistent hypercapnia without acidosis after the AHRF episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>It is documented that previous exacerbations of COPD predict new exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and that previous admissions due to exacerbations predict new admissions and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Based on this and on our experience with LTNIV for COPD, we believe that LTNIV can reduce mortality and repeat AHRF, regardless of whether the patient was persistently hypercapnic after the acute NIV treatment. We are looking forward to assessing this in an RCT.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Blinding</title><p>The study is randomized with an intervention group and a control group. The random sequence generation is random and unknown to the investigators. However, the study is open label, i.e., unblinded; the patient allocation cannot be concealed, as the patients will necessarily know whether they receive LTNIV or usual care. We considered the possibility of using sham NIV or CPAP in the control group; but we assume it would not be worthwhile, as the patients would undoubtedly figure out their allocation. Furthermore, CPAP could affect quality-of-life negatively and thus favor the NIV treatment group. We believe that&#x02014;by offering the same outpatient monitoring in the two arms, and as our primary outcome is mortality&#x02014;the risk of bias in an open trial will be minimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Risks</title><p>There are few side effects of NIV treatment:</p><p>Some people feel uncomfortable wearing the mask, as it fits tightly to the face; some will experience dryness of the eyes, nose and mouth, due to the airflow. The mask can&#x02014;if not fitted and placed properly&#x02014;give pressure ulcers, especially over the nose. Due the high ventilator pressures, the user can get a sense of flatulence. NIV should not be used if the user tends to vomit because of the risk of aspiration.
