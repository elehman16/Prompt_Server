Tacrolimus is a medication with a narrow therapeutic index and large interpatient and intrapatient pharmacokinetic variability. High intrapatient variability in systemic exposure to tacrolimus and non-adherence to medication are two of the major causes of poor graft survival.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Tacrolimus is available as immediate-release formulations administered twice daily and prolonged-release formulations administered once daily. Prolonged-release tacrolimus was developed to improve adherence and reduce intrapatient variability of tacrolimus exposure.</p><p>As a narrow therapeutic index drug, tacrolimus therapy is optimised on an individual patient basis using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Trough levels of whole blood tacrolimus concentrations (C<sub>0</sub>) are used as a surrogate marker of area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Comparative pharmacokinetic studies in de novo and in stable patient populations have shown that the relationship between C<sub>0</sub> and AUC is similar for evaluated formulations of prolonged-release and immediate-release tacrolimus.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> As such, the same target C<sub>0</sub> is used for TDM for both such formulations. Clinical studies have confirmed similar efficacy and tolerability of the two formulations in adult kidney and liver transplantation during the first year of treatment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>In the immediate postsurgical period when many patients cannot swallow intact capsules, tacrolimus therapy is often initiated by administering the contents of tacrolimus capsules as a suspension orally or via a nasogastric tube. Although immediate-release tacrolimus is routinely administered as a suspension in clinical practice, the pharmacokinetic profile of a suspension prepared from prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules has not been established. This was the first study to compare the relative bioavailability of a suspension prepared from the contents of prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules administered orally or via a nasogastric tube, with oral administration of intact capsules, in healthy participants. Tolerability was also assessed throughout the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase 1, open-label, partially randomised, single-dose, three-period cross-over study in healthy participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice consolidated guidelines. The protocol was approved by a local independent ethics committee. Participants provided written consent for prestudy screening procedures and signed a study-specific consent form prior to the start of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were male, 18&#x02013;55&#x02005;years old and had a body mass index of 19&#x02013;29&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All participants were in good health according to predefined criteria assessed during a physical examination, a 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations and a medical history review. Exclusion criteria included prescribed topical/systemic medication taken within 14&#x02005;days of first tacrolimus administration, or non-prescribed topical/systemic medication within 7&#x02005;days, or any medications taken within 30&#x02005;days that were known to have a chronic impact on drug absorption or elimination processes. Participants who had been enrolled in a clinical study of an investigational drug in the previous 4&#x02005;months or a marketed drug within the past 3&#x02005;months were also excluded. Participants who had participated in a clinical study involving single-dose administration of prolonged-release tacrolimus in the previous 12&#x02005;months, multiple-dose administration of tacrolimus or any other immunosuppressants preceding the first dose in this study were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Preparation of suspension</title><p>Tacrolimus suspension was prepared in the pharmacy on the day before dosing. Two 5&#x02005;mg prolonged-release tacrolimus (Advagraf; Astellas Pharma Europe BV, The Netherlands, hereafter referred to as prolonged-release tacrolimus) capsules were opened and the contents (powder) were mixed in a brown glass bottle with 50&#x02005;mL of tap water to produce a suspension.

The overall systemic exposure to tacrolimus, in terms of AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, was similar when single doses of prolonged-release tacrolimus were given orally as suspension and as intact capsules. The geometric mean ratio for this parameter was close to unity and the 90% CIs around the ratio were contained within the limits of 0.8 to 1.25, indicating similar relative bioavailability. However, the rate of absorption of prolonged-release tacrolimus was faster when administered as an oral suspension compared with administration by intact capsules, resulting in a higher mean C<sub>max</sub> and a shorter median T<sub>max</sub>.</p><p>Tacrolimus as a compound has poor water solubility; however, for oral dosing, the solubility was improved by developing a solid dispersion formulation using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as an excipient in the immediate-release formulation of tacrolimus and prolonged-release formulation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Prolonged-release tacrolimus has been formulated to release a portion of tacrolimus at a rate similar to that of the immediate-release formulation and the remaining proportion of the tacrolimus over an extended time. This allows the tacrolimus to be delivered over a larger part of the gastrointestinal tract. These two components can be seen in the absorption profile as a rapid increase in mean whole blood tacrolimus concentration within the first hour postadministration due to the immediate-release component, followed by a steady decline in tacrolimus levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In this study, the contents of prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules were prepared as a suspension in the pharmacy and then transferred to the clinic for dosing. We believe that the more immediate-release component was already dissolved in the suspension before administration. This would have resulted in a more rapid absorption rate compared with that of intact capsules and could subsequently explain the faster absorption rate with suspension administered orally and via the nasogastric route. However, the T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of tacrolimus was not affected, being &#x0223c;33&#x02005;hours irrespective of the route of administration, and the interparticipant variability of prolonged-release tacrolimus pharmacokinetics was similar for both oral administrations (suspension and intact capsules).</p><p>Nasogastric dosing of the prolonged-release tacrolimus suspension had a lower AUC<sub>0&#x02013;tz</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> compared with oral suspension or intact capsules. While it would be tempting to suggest that part of the tacrolimus dose may have adhered to tubing and syringes in the cohorts receiving the nasogastric suspension, the probability of such a phenomenon occurring is, at best, highly unlikely, as all materials used to administer such doses were free of polyvinylchloride to minimise the potential for adsorption. It is also important to realise that the C<sub>max</sub> of tacrolimus administered via nasogastric dosing occurred at the first sampling time point (0.5&#x02005;hours postdose) for the majority of participants, so the absorption phase was not fully defined. Taken in conjunction with the fact that all participants in treatment period 1 received the suspension via a nasogastric tube, a period effect cannot be ruled out. For this reason, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> may have been underestimated during nasogastric administration. The pharmacokinetic profiles obtained in this study following administration of intact prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules were consistent with previously reported studies in healthy participants.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The recommended range of tacrolimus dose for the prophylaxis of liver transplant rejection is 6.5&#x02013;13.0&#x02005;mg, based on a body weight of 65&#x02005;kg. Therefore, the mid-range of 10&#x02005;mg was selected for dosing in this study. Furthermore, 10&#x02005;mg was the maximum dose for healthy volunteers permitted by the ethics committee. Single doses of prolonged-release tacrolimus were well tolerated when administered as oral capsules, oral suspension and a suspension administered via a nasogastric tube. The incidence of adverse events for oral administration (capsules and suspension) was low and similar, with the majority of the events being mild in severity. The incidence of adverse events for the nasogastric suspension was higher, with both mild and moderate events being reported. However, with the exception of three events, all adverse events that were possibly related to tacrolimus administration resolved without the need for treatment. Adverse events possibly related to prolonged-release tacrolimus administration occurred only with the oral suspension and nasogastric tube suspension. Toothache, upper respiratory tract infection and throat infection could have been as a direct result of nasogastric tube use, due to bias in the open-label setting or as a result of the period effect. Previous studies in healthy participants showed that oral administration of intact prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with immediate-release tacrolimus.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Limitations of this study include the potential treatment effect, as randomisation did not occur for the nasogastric tube administration. This design was chosen to ensure that all participants included in the study were able to swallow a nasogastric tube. Additionally, the absorption phase of the study was not fully defined, as C<sub>max</sub> was achieved at the first sampling time point for the majority of participants receiving nasogastric administration of prolonged-release tacrolimus. Earlier blood sampling points would therefore be required in order to fully define the absorption phase. Finally, no formal statistical assessment of sample size was performed. However, the number of participants included in this study is typical of clinical pharmacology studies, and was considered sufficient to achieve the primary objectives of the study.</p><p>This is the first clinical study to assess the absorption and pharmacokinetic profile of prolonged-release tacrolimus when administered by a nasogastric tube. These data will facilitate a better understanding of future postmarketing pharmacokinetic data, as well as previously conducted phase 2 and 3 studies. As such, this phase 1 study demonstrated that a suspension of prolonged-release tacrolimus results in a faster rate of absorption compared with intact prolonged-release tacrolimus capsules, resulting in a higher C<sub>max</sub> and a shorter T<sub>max</sub> for the suspension. While total systemic exposure to tacrolimus was &#x0223c;17% lower with nasogastric compared with oral administration, this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the potential treatment effect and not fully defined absorption phase of nasogastric administration. However, single 10&#x02005;mg doses of tacrolimus were well tolerated in all three administrations, with similar elimination half-lives and no marked differences in the interparticipant variability of systemic exposure. Owing to demonstrated dose proportionality<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and lack of therapeutic effect of the tacrolimus excipients, similar results can be expected with other prolonged-release tacrolimus capsule strengths.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Amy MacLucas and James Wallis from iS LifeScience for drafting the initial version of the manuscript and providing editorial support throughout the development of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NU was involved in the conception and design of the study.
