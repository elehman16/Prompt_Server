This is especially true for medial meniscal tears, medial meniscal repairs or medial meniscal transplantation. Various methods and instruments have been proposed to help with this approach. PPMCLR is one of these methods. This study found that this is a safe technique and does not result in measurable laxity of the MCL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>50 consecutive patients took part in the study. The patients were then randomized into a control or partial percutaneous release group (25 in each group). Prior to arthroscopy each patient had standardized 30 degree valgus stress radiograph performed. The MCL was stressed with the Telos Stress Device GA/III at 30 degrees of flexion; utilizing 150 Newton's of stress. The stress radiographs were measured independently for the maximal separation at the medial compartment. At six weeks the stress radiographs were repeated and the results again recorded. The postoperative care for each group was the same.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The results were then statistically evaluated using the, finding no radiographic evidence of residual laxity P&#x0003c;.005. There was also no difference in the control and PPMCLR group p&#x0003c;.0005. No patient complained of residual laxity. Patient follow up will be discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>PPMCLR is an effective and safe method to reach the intra-articular posterior aspect of the knee during arthroscopy. PPMCLR does not result in measurable laxity of the MCL.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
