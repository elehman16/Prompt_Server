</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par29">Self-myofascial release (SMR) is becoming increasingly popular both in the amateur and professional sports field. SMR is a type of myofascial release that is performed by individuals themselves, most often using a foam roller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or a roller massager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. SMR appears to have a wide range of effects, most typically increasing flexibility acutely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and chronically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with respect to changes in joint range of motion (ROM), although it has also been utilized to reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], affect arterial and vascular endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and modulate autonomic nervous system activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">More recently, therapeutic myofascial and soft tissue manipulation tools have incorporated devices that have firmer edges to increase leverage and/or vibration features to enhance effects. An evidence-based form of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization, called the Graston&#x000ae; Technique (GT), utilizes a stainless-steel tool to localize and treat soft tissue restrictions. Developers of the GT recommend that the edges of the instrument be prepared at a 30&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0; angle to more effectively and efficiently address soft tissue lesions and fascial restrictions. Studies utilizing the GT have reported producing a localized inflammatory response, reducing scar tissue, and breaking down existing scar tissue in people with soft tissue restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Vibration features have been used extensively since the beginning of the twentieth century in instrument-assisted techniques to mechanically stimulate myofascial tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Low-intensity vibratory massage (VM), with a 15&#x02013;50-Hz frequency band, has been shown to increase oxygen uptake, blood and muscle oxidation, local and general blood circulation, local temperature in massaged tissues, and muscle enzyme activation. Other effects include marked general relaxation, relaxation of myofascial tissues, decrease of emotional tension, and a general sedative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">To date, no studies have investigated the value of adding a vibration component to the shearing effect of SMR tools. Shearing is defined as a mechanical force that acts on an area of skin in a direction parallel to the body&#x02019;s surface. Shearing is affected by the amount of pressure exerted, the coefficient of friction between the materials contacting each other, and the extent to which the body makes contact with the support surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This study was designed to assess the clinical utility of a new self-help tool for treating myofascial tissue that combines a number of the aforementioned features&#x02014;vibrational oscillation, leverage, and the vibro-shearing effect&#x02014;in a novel self-help instrument called the Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae; (FR). This tool has the potential added advantage of having the user apply the desired pressure in the absence of external support, unlike foam rolling and related approaches that require the device to be pressed against a firm object.</p><p id="Par33">The specific aim of this study was to explore the practicality and preliminary effectiveness of this new self-help tool by examining biomechanical tissue changes and other associated effects when this device is used. We selected a sample of individuals, experienced breakdancers, known to be particularly well fit. This was done to minimize potential biasing effects and thus provide a strong test of the value of FR. In this investigation, we selected the quadriceps muscle (QM) and the iliotibial band (ITB) as our test targets (see below why these targets were specifically selected).</p><p id="Par34">Breakdancers, referred to as B-Boys within this community, were further specifically selected for participation in this exploratory investigation because the movement patterns in this dance style involve extremely strenuous physical activities, such as splits, spins, handstands, and tumbling, all varying in velocity, quality, and planes using all parts of the body fascia. Kicking of the legs and recruiting the myofascial tissues from the QM, as well as the ITB and the tensor fascia latae, produces the high velocity for the acrobatic maneuvers in breakdancing. All dance movements, such as jumping, spinning on the floor, or lifting, demand the perfect timing of the impulse, momentum, and rebound: the optimal timing in releasing the preloaded fascia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For an energetic and elastic movement, which is required in breakdancing, a dynamic catapult effect of the fascial fibers is necessary. Therefore, the elasticity of the fascial tissue is the key to its high capacity to store kinetic energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">By addressing the inner body perspective, dance (breakdancing in particular) stimulates both the proprioception and interoception of the body. The highest density of proprioceptive and interoceptive receptors are found within the fascial tissue, because the fascial net plays an important role in the perception of inner sensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview of Study</title><p id="Par36">Male breakdancers were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: no-treatment control or a brief self-applied intervention using a specially designed myofascial manipulation tool. Various primary measures were taken from the right thighs of all dancers, with the intervention being applied to the right thigh only to the dancers assigned to the intervention group. A variety of primary outcome measures, described below, were collected from all dancers before and after intervention. Two final secondary measures were collected at pre- and post-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par37">One hundred thirteen (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;113) male breakdancers were recruited and randomized into an intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56) and a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55). All participants fulfilled the following criteria: (1) healthy condition, (2) no physical preloading or physical execution, (3) skinfold measures of body fat at the ITB with a maximum of 10&#x000a0;mm, (4) dancing breakdance for a minimum of 1&#x000a0;year, and (5) age over 18&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria consisted of the presence of acute or chronic injuries concerning the legs and the hip area, pain in the treatment area, and acute inflammation and degenerative neurological illnesses or scars in the measuring area. Inspection of Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> reveals the groups were comparable with respect to all measures used for study inclusion. Written informed consent was obtained for all procedures, with participants being free to withdraw at any time without penalty. Of the total who consented to participate, two withdrew (one from each condition), reporting they became dizzy while sitting for an extended period. The study was conducted in a manner consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and was granted for approval by the Ethics Committee of the University of T&#x000fc;bingen.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic information for the control and intervention groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Control (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55)</th><th colspan="2">Intervention (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56)</th></tr><tr><th>Variable name</th><th>

The right thigh was first lightly lubricated with a vaseline-neutral oil. The opposite side was not oiled as this might have effected changes in the tissue. A standardized protocol was developed for the self-help treatment, which consisted of three short and three long linear strokes on the quadriceps muscle (QM) followed by three short and three long linear strokes on the iliotibial band (ITB). This procedure was repeated until 8&#x000a0;min had elapsed, gauging the time by a stopwatch placed on the wrist of the participant. The intervention tool was held and applied at a 45&#x000b0; angle to the treated tissue (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Patients were instructed to apply a pressure intensity that they subjectively perceived to be equivalent to a rating ranging from 3 to 5 on a numerical scale where 10 was the maximal value.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Protocol of assessments and self-treatment. <bold>a</bold>&#x000a0;Finger-to-Floor Distance Test for the Hamstrings and Triceps Surae. <bold>b</bold> Passive Thomas Test for Hip flexors. <bold>c</bold> Objective biomechanical evaluation of tissues. <bold>d</bold> Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) indicator of tissue sensitization. <bold>e</bold> Thermography, an indicator of micro-circulation. <bold>f</bold> Example of standardized self-treatment of the Iliotibial structures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40798_2018_128_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Control Condition</title><p id="Par40">Dancers assigned to the control condition were instructed to sit quietly in the standardized position and refrain from moving during the 8-min period when those in the intervention group applied the myofascial tool.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data Collection</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Position and Marking of the Measuring Points</title><p id="Par41">Position and posture were standardized for both groups, with participants being instructed to maintain the specified position and posture throughout. When necessary (which rarely occurred), they were corrected by the study examiners. Study position was controlled by having participants sit in a specific manner on a four-legged stool (58&#x000a0;cm length, 42&#x000a0;cm width, 43&#x000a0;cm height, UTTER IKEA). The back of the stool had contact with a flat wall. The lumbar spine of the participants had full contact with the wall, the pelvis was in a neutral position, and the participants were instructed to retain a straight posture. Both feet maintained full contact with the floor and were taped to the floor to help restrict any involuntary movement. The inside of the knees had full contact with the lateral sides of the stool. Both lower legs were attached with a strap to the front legs of the stool (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">A standardized protocol for marking the measuring points was performed by the same study examiner (the second author). A line was drawn from the epicondylus lateralis parallel to the femur on the strongest embossment of the ITB. The area revealing the highest level of stiffness was palpated and marked in the most anterior quarter of the ITB. A vertical line was drawn over the QM to this measuring point of the ITB. From the middle of the patellae, a line was drawn parallel to the rectus femoris muscle. The crossing of the two lines was the measuring point of the QM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary Outcome Measures</title><p id="Par43">Objective measures were taken within multiple domains throughout the investigation in order to more fully explore and identify changes in response to our intervention, and these served as our primary measures. Assessors, all credentialed physical therapists, received 6&#x000a0;weeks of intensive training over the course of 14 pilot studies prior to conducting the assessments, with ongoing supervision by the first author provided throughout the investigation. All assessments were performed by the same study examiner (second author) and two further well-trained assessors, who met frequently during data collection to ensure continuity and prevent measurement drift.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Biomechanical Tissue Changes</title><p id="Par44">Key measures within this domain were collected with the MyotonPRO (Myoton AS; Estonia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The measurement probe (<italic>D</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mm) was placed perpendicularly on the pre-marked skin areas above the muscle being measured, QM and the ITB (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The device was then lowered into the measurement position and held steady while it automatically performed the predefined measurement series (five single measurements with a recording interval of 1&#x000a0;s for each measuring point, using the average for data analysis). The method of myometry developed for measuring superficial skeletal muscles consists of (a) creating a constant pre-compression 0.18&#x000a0;N over the area of 7.1&#x000a0;mm<sup>2</sup>, followed by a brief (15&#x000a0;ms) mechanical impulse of 0.4&#x000a0;N to the contact surface of the skin; (b) recording the response of the tissue in a form of damped oscillation that is registered by an accelerometer in a form of an oscillation acceleration graph; and (c) subsequently conducting signal processing and computing for the variables of interest. Of the five available variables, we chose the two most pertinent to our study aims&#x02014;elasticity and dynamic stiffness.</p><p id="Par45">The logarithmic decrement of a tissue&#x02019;s natural oscillation characterizes its elasticity, but more directly, it reflects the dissipation of the mechanical energy within an oscillation cycle, when tissues recover their shape after being deformed. Said another way, elasticity is the biomechanical property of a muscle that characterizes the ability to recover its initial shape after a contraction or removal of an external force of deformation. Elasticity is inversely proportional to the decrement. Therefore, as the decrement of a muscle decreases, the muscle elasticity increases. In theory, a decrement of 0 (zero) represents absolute elasticity. Elasticity is reported as the logarithmic decrement, while the inverse of elasticity is plasticity.</p><p id="Par46">Dynamic stiffness [N/m] is the biomechanical property of a muscle that characterizes the resistance to a contraction or to an external force that deforms its initial shape. In the case of overly high stiffness, a greater effort is required from the agonist muscle to stretch a stiff antagonist, which leads to an inefficient economy of movement (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, relationship of the displacement oscillation and oscillation velocity in relation to the oscillation acceleration).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Range of Motion</title><p id="Par47">Three measures were collected with respect to this domain&#x02014;the Modified Passive Thomas Test, Modified Thomas Test with Pressure&#x02014;using a goniometer (KaWe Kirchner &#x00026; Wilhelm, Germany), and the Modified Finger-Floor Distance Test&#x02014;using a measuring tape.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Modified Passive Thomas Test (MPTT) and Modified Thomas Test with Pressure (MPrTT)</title><p id="Par48">A standardized protocol was performed in order to obtain a value from the modified Thomas test.

The position of the thermography camera was standardized by positioning the camera on a chair at a height of 48&#x000a0;cm (approximately at the position of the participant&#x02019;s ITB) at a distance 60&#x000a0;cm away from the measuring chairs. Strips of tape were placed on the floor to mark the position of the chairs as well as the table for the thermography camera in order to standardize the distance. The sensor of the camera was directed towards the measuring point on the ITB in order to perform a spot measurement, and a calibration was performed before taking a picture (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).

We selected a modified German short version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] of the original &#x0201c;Profile of Mood States&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a standardized psychological test formulated to assess momentary mood states. The 19 items contained within the version we used inquire about varied momentary feelings of respondents, with each being rated on a numeric scale, from 1 to 7, with the values described as &#x0201c;Not at All&#x0201d; (1), &#x0201c;Very Poor,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Poor,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;A Little,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Moderately,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Quite a Lot,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Extremely&#x0201d; (7).

This was followed by a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) comparing the intervention (treated) and control groups with respect to all primary outcome measures (biomechanical tissue measures, range of motion, pain pressure threshold, and bloodflow) in one integrated analysis, using change scores (post-treatment minus pre-treatment values) as the unit for analysis in order to provide the most sensitive test of effects. A second MANOVA was conducted to address group differences with respect to the secondary outcome measures pertaining to perception of physical sensations and mood states, both collected prior to and at the end of the study (again using change score). MANOVA was chosen based on the recommendations of both Pallant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Tabachnick and Fidell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] that it is the most appropriate procedure to use when conducting analyses of variance with multiple dependent variables (DVs) as it can be used to detect which DVs are influenced by the manipulation. Multivariate analysis also protects against inflated type I error due to multiple tests, especially when DVs are correlated (which was the case here). The inclusion of covariates was judged unnecessary because only one primary outcome measure revealed a significant difference between groups (to be discussed later).</p><p id="Par59">Prior to the MANOVA analyses, data were screened in SPSS 24 to ensure that the assumptions for this approach were met, following recommendations by Pallant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Tabachnick and Fidell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Univariate outliers were screened by variable, with outliers classified as those falling above or below 3 standard deviations of the mean. Multivariate outliers were screened separately for each planned analysis by conducting a linear regression with participant ID as the independent variable (IV) and all primary outcome dependent variables (DVs) for the planned analysis as the regression DVs. Outliers were classified as those with Mahalanobis&#x02019; distances falling outside of the chi-square threshold, consistent with the recommendations of Pallant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Tabachnick and Fidell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Both univariate and multivariate outliers were removed from analysis by applying these tests, and the resulting sample size is reported separately for each MANOVA analysis. As identified outliers varied as a function of each major analysis, the sample sizes reported per condition in the data table summaries vary somewhat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Results</title><p id="Par60">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the findings when comparing pre-treatment values for all primary dependent measures for those serving as controls versus those receiving treatment.

After 8&#x000a0;min of use, elasticity increased in the quadriceps, stiffness (for the QM and the ITB) and pain sensitivity decreased, ROM improved for the QM and hamstrings, and local temperature values increased (reflecting improved blood flow). Although the intervention was very brief in duration, some differences were found with respect to perceived sensations, all of which favored those receiving the intervention. The absence of major differences on the POMS between those dancers assigned to the intervention condition and those assigned to the control condition suggests the observed findings are unlikely to have occurred due to participants&#x02019; awareness of them being observed or taking part in an experiment (i.e., demand or reactivity effects). Our findings are further strengthened by the fact that the demographic data of both groups were similar and comparable. The standard deviations for age, size, weight, training experience, training intensity, and training duration were small. Further, measurements of improvement were fairly consistent across all parameters for the treated legs only, with the control (untreated) legs basically remaining unchanged.</p><p id="Par65">Stiffness reduced, while elasticity increased in the treated thigh. Elasticity of the ITB of the right thigh, however, did not change. The failure to find a change in the elasticity of the ITB is not surprising given that a certain level is required for lateral knee stabilization. The ITB serves to reinforce the fascia lata and divides the QM from the hamstring. Its inner side is in continuity with the lateral intermuscular septum, while on its posterior side, the majority of collagen fibers of the ITB are in continuity with the intramuscular septa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The myofascial force transmission between gluteus maximus and lower leg muscles via the fascial lata shows the important role of the ITB in the movement patterns of the lower extremities.</p><p id="Par66">An increased range of movement was achieved in the treated QM (MPTT, MPrTT). Bradbury-Squires et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] also found increases, ranging from 10 to 16%, for knee-joint ROM with applying a roller massager for 20 and 60&#x000a0;s on the QM. Although the ischiocrural muscles (MFFD) were not treated by the participants, a significant change pre- to post-treatment in ROM was found. A coherence between the ITB and the ischicrurale muscles was also observed by Kwak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, loading the ITB alters the kinematics and contact pattern of the tibiofemoral joint similarly to loading the hamstrings.</p><p id="Par67">The intervention tool, the Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae;, with its combination of vibrational oscillation, leverage, and specific edges for a shearing manipulation of the myofascial tissue, thus seems useful. However, as all features were combined, it is not possible to determine which component contributed most to the effects observed.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Possible Effects Due to Vibrational Oscillation</title><p id="Par68">The physiological mechanism of vibrational oscillation that decreases stiffness and increases elasticity in myofascial tissues is uncertain. Several studies have pinpointed the mechanoreceptors, mainly the Pacinian corpuscles in connective tissues, ligaments, and joints, and the primary endings of the muscle spindles that are particularly sensitive to vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The restorative effect of rhythmic low-frequency mechanical oscillations is frequently attributed to improvements in circulation, enhanced capillary permeability, and the transport of metabolites accumulated during previous work. Some have hypothesized that vibration-induced increased ROM could be due to reduced passive muscle stiffness through a decreased number of residual cross-bridges, some of them being broken by the mechanical vibratory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Some researchers have reported anesthetic effects due to the vibrational massage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our findings of pain desensitization, manifested as decreased subjective pain threshold pre- to post-self-treatment on the treated leg, corroborate these findings in the literature.</p><p id="Par70">The PSQ values describing the treated leg as more relaxed, light, and stable are consistent with the findings of other studies describing a general relaxation, relaxation of myofascial tissues, a decrease of emotional tension, and general sedative effect through application of a roller massager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Possible Effects Due to Leverage</title><p id="Par71">Participants were able to apply the pressure using their own hands. An individual modification of the pressure could be moderated according to the perceived subjective pain pressure. Comparing the present self-help tool with other SMR tools, such as foam rolling, the entire body weight has to be applied and modification of weight is more difficult to regulate. Consequently, in order to hold one&#x02019;s own body weight over the treatment duration in other SMR tool applications, such as foam rolling, proper shoulder and core muscle stabilization and sufficient strength in the upper extremities are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is a popular treatment for myofascial restriction. IASTM uses specially designed instruments to provide a mobilizing effect to scar tissue and myofascial adhesions. Several IASTM tools and techniques are available, such as the Graston&#x000ae; technique (GT). In comparison to the self-help methodology of the Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae;, the GT needs to be applied by a trained clinician and, as yet, has not been adapted for self-application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The GT treatment is thought to stimulate connective tissue remodeling through resorption of excessive fibrosis, along with inducing repair and regeneration of collagen secondary to fibroblast recruitment. This, in turn, results in the release and breakdown of scar tissue, adhesions, and fascial restrictions. The Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae; tool may operate in a similar manner, as it is also applied with pressure and incorporates specific edge features. As these tools differ in a number of key respects (i.e., material, technique, and treatment protocol), comparative analyses will need to be designed in a way that takes these differences into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Possible Effects Due to The Specific Edges</title><p id="Par73">The Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae; tool has four different edges in order to reach different parts of the myofascial tissue depending on the desired technique, fast versus slow. Clinicians may consider the fast shearing technique of the Fascia-ReleaZer&#x000ae; a form of gua sha, but the treatment rationale, goals, and application differ. Gua sha, therapeutic surface frictioning that intentionally raises transitory petechiae and ecchymosis, is a traditional East Asian healing technique. A smooth, rounded edge is press-stroked into the flesh enough to contact the fascial layer but not so firm that it causes pain or discomfort. Modern studies confirm a thermoregulatory function involving surface microcirculation, wherein increased skin blood flow in subpapillary tissue layers effectively conducts away heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our hypothesis assumes that increased blood circulation is stimulated in order to improve the metabolism and blood flow of the treated structures. The significant thermometer temperature increases as well as our thermography findings support this notion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par74">The vibro-shearing manipulation with a muscle-fascia tool resulted in significant improvements in the objective mechanical tissue properties. Pain desensitization, range of movement, and thermography improved significantly as well. The fact that mood states remained relatively constant suggests that reactivity or demand effects were not in operation. Tool-assisted self-treatment with the Fascia ReleaZer&#x000ae; shows preliminary evidence of being an effective treatment modality, one that warrants further research, with a possible next step being application with a clinical population. Assuming effectiveness within a clinical setting, another further direction might involve a component or dismantling design to help pinpoint the relative contributions of the various features of the device. Investigations aimed at providing greater understanding of effects on the cellular level seem worthy of pursuit as well. Finally, although not feasible in this study, use of assessors blind to condition would add increased rigor in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
