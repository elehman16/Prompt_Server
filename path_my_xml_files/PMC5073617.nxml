Crowdsourcing is the process of giving individual tasks to a large group, often involving open contests and enabled through multisectoral partnerships. Here we describe one crowdsourced video intervention in which a video promoting condom use is produced through an open contest. The aim of this study is to determine whether a crowdsourced intervention is as effective as a social marketing intervention in promoting condom use among high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender male-to-female (TG) in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>We evaluate videos developed by crowdsourcing and social marketing. The crowdsourcing contest involved an open call for videos. Entries were judged on capacity to promote condom use, to be shareable or &#x02018;go viral&#x02019; and to give value to the individual. 1170 participants will be recruited for the randomised controlled trial. Participants need to be MSM age 16 and over who have had condomless anal sex in the last 3&#x02005;months. Recruitment will be through an online banner ad on a popular MSM web page and other social media platforms. After completing an initial survey, participants will be randomly assigned to view either the social marketing video or the crowdsourcing video. Follow-up surveys will be completed at 3&#x02005;weeks and 3&#x02005;months after initial intervention to evaluate condomless sex and related secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include condom social norms, condom negotiation, condom self-efficacy, HIV/syphilis testing, frequency of sex acts and incremental cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approval was obtained from the ethical review boards of the Guangdong Provincial Center for Skin Diseases and STI Control, UNC and UCSF.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but men who have sex with men (MSM) infrequently use condoms in China.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> The resulting high incidence of HIV and STDs among MSM suggests the need for novel health promotion campaigns. One systematic review<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and one literature review among MSM<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> demonstrate that social marketing campaigns are effective in promoting condom use, but the persistence of these behavioural changes over time is unclear. We propose that crowdsourcing may substantially improve on existing methods for developing condom promotion campaigns.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Crowdsourcing</title><p>Crowdsourcing is the process of giving individual tasks to a large group, often involving open contests and enabled through multisectoral partnerships. While the process originated in the private sector,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> intended to aid research, development and dissemination, it has since been widely adopted. In 2010, the Executive Office of the President of the USA urged federal agencies to use crowdsourcing as a method to develop innovative approaches to governmental initiatives.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A crowdsourcing method differs from a social marketing method in several ways.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Crowdsourcing is a bottom-up approach, using the community for idea generation through implementation rather than relying on the expertise of public health experts. This ensures a higher degree of community engagement than approaches using social marketing do, which tends to be a top-down approach. Crowdsourcing promotes innovation because it removes cognitive fixation, in which innovation is hampered due to new ideas being strongly influenced by prior examples.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref> By engaging more people with less experience, this phenomenon is avoidable and allows for a more creative process.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Our team has previously used crowdsourcing successfully to develop an effective HIV testing promotion video and images promoting sexual health.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p><italic>Specific aim 1</italic>: To compare the effect of a crowdsourced 1&#x02005;min video to a social marketing 1&#x02005;min video in promoting condom use among MSM and transgender male-to-female (TG) in China.

The study is projected to run from November 2015 to February 2016.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Setting</title><p>This study survey will be made available to MSM across China through a popular online portal, Danlan and gay mobile dating app, Blued. Danlan.com is an online gay community that allows MSM to connect with each other for relationships, events and communication. The website is maintained by a private corporation, Danlan, which also developed the for-profit app Blued. Blued has become very popular among the MSM population, recently reaching 15 million users.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> User personal information is protected and secure. Studies have shown that the internet has become a popular method for MSM to find partners, with a reported 28.3&#x02013;88.4% of MSM using the internet to seek sexual partners.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> While internet-based interventions have yet to be widely dispersed in mainland China, early studies show that such e-technology-based approaches would be well received.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited using a banner link on a popular MSM app &#x02018;Blued&#x02019; (Danlan, Beijing, China), as well as through announcements sent via Danlan's social media (Weibo, a microblogging platform; WeChat, a messaging platform and QQ, a messaging platform). Blued is China's most popular social networking mobile application among MSM. Blued has 15 million followers with 24% (3.6 million people) daily activity rate.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Danlan has over 17&#x02005;000 followers on social media platform Weibo and forwards news via WeChat and QQ to over 429&#x02005;000 followers.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Eligibility</title><p>The survey is voluntary, and to be eligible, participants must state that they were born biologically man, had anal sex with men at least once during their lifetime, have had condomless anal/vaginal sex in the past 3&#x02005;months, are at least 16&#x02005;years of age and able to complete an online written survey in Chinese. All participants must agree to an online informed consent and provide their cell mobile number. Participants who do not meet these criteria will not be allowed to proceed with the survey.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Formative work</title><p>Prior to survey development, we will interview key informants specifically about conducting an internet survey among MSM in China. Survey development will be performed drawing on previous surveys and a review of existing literature, focusing on English and Chinese language studies. The survey will be developed in English and Chinese but conducted entirely in Chinese. The Chinese version of the survey will be piloted online with 150 volunteers to gauge postintervention condom usage rates and to estimate the necessary sample size for the non-inferiority study. The survey will also be piloted with Danlan to ensure there are no problems with distribution. Feedback will be solicited online regarding question wording and interpretation. Pilot data will not be included in the final analysis. The purpose of this extensive formative research is to ensure that the online survey is simple and easy to complete. The CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist for online surveys<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> will be used to ensure completeness. The online survey will be created using Qualtrics Survey Software (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah, USA), and the videos will be hosted on Tencent Video (Tencent, Shenzhen, China).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Interventions</title><p>The development of the crowdsourcing video was publicised via open contest. We posted a public call on social media platforms (Weibo, WeChat) for videos promoting condom use awareness. For further promotion, we hosted in-person events at several different college campuses in Guangzhou, China, and worked with local community-based organisations to publicise the contest. In-person events included didactic sessions, interactive feedback sessions and community-driven events. Ten judges, including community health leaders, doctors, business leaders and researchers, evaluated the videos. Each judge scored the video entries on a scale of 1&#x02013;10 (10 the highest score), and a single winner was identified. The winning video will be included in the survey as the intervention arm of the randomised control trial (RCT). The 1&#x02005;min video depicts a group of men dressed as cartoon villains attempting and failing to break down a wall, followed by an image of condoms. Our team will delay public announcement of the contest winner to allow time for adequate intervention implementation and comparison. The winning video will be publicly announced 2&#x02005;weeks after the intervention is evaluated using the 3-month follow-up survey.</p><p>The social marketing video was commissioned from a working group in Jinan. This 1&#x02005;min video contains audio of two men about to engage in intercourse, but stopping to discuss condom use and sexual health as a symbol of love. The script of the video was written by experts in San Francisco and modified by experts and the gay community in Jinan and Qingdao. The video was shot by an advertising company based in Jinan.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Data collection</title><p>A survey will be developed using the Qualtrics survey tool. Participants will answer 150 questions on sociodemographic information, sexual behaviour, social norms, condom self-efficacy, HIV testing and community engagement. At the end of the survey, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention arms, the crowdsourcing video or social marketing video, and will view the appropriate video. Participants will not be informed of the video options on randomisation and will not see the alternate intervention video. Participants will provide mobile telephone numbers and will receive text message reminders 3&#x02005;weeks after initial survey completion to complete the 3-week follow-up survey. After completion of the 3-week survey, participants will be compensated for the first portion of the study (about US$15.87). Three months after completion of the initial survey, participants will again receive a mobile telephone reminder to complete the 3-month survey. After completion, participants will receive the second portion of their compensation (about US$7.93).</p><p>Participants will register for our survey using a mobile number. Following completion of data collection, data entries will be screened for duplicate mobile numbers, and the second entry will be excluded. Entries with invalid mobile numbers will also be excluded.</p><p>A data monitoring committee will not be required as this study employs low risk behavioural interventions. All participants will provide consent prior to taking part in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Measures</title><p>Data from survey items on sociodemographics and sexual behaviours will be collected using standardised survey instruments immediately before video watching, at 3&#x02005;weeks after video watching and at 3&#x02005;months after video watching.

A participant is counted as having had condomless sex if they participated in any act of sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal) that has taken place without use of a condom. Using a postintervention survey, participants will be asked with what frequency they have used condoms since watching the video: all, most, some or none of the time (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary file 2</xref>). The 3-week follow-up survey will ask about the 3&#x02005;weeks following the intervention, and the 3-month follow-up will cover the 3&#x02005;months following the intervention.
