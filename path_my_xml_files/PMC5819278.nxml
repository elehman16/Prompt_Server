The exact global burden of dengue is not known, but there are estimates of about 390 million infections annually, of which only a minority (~&#x02009;25%) manifest clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Yearly mortality figures of &#x0003e;&#x02009;20,000 deaths have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dengue fever and other arboviral diseases, such as Zika and chikungunya, are transmitted to humans primarily by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue and only recently has a vaccine been licensed, but it does not confer full protection for all virus serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even with effective therapies and vaccines, vector control will likely remain important to curtail disease incidence and outbreaks. Perennial dengue incidence varies seasonally, and dengue outbreaks occur periodically in most endemic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Infection of one of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1&#x02014;4) typically confer lifelong protective homotypic (type-specific) immunity as well as production of more time-limited cross-reactive heterotypic neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however, antibody-dependent enhancement may result in a second DENV serotype infection inducing a more severe clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">For improved dengue control, reliable epidemic forecasting systems for early detection of temporal anomalies in disease incidence are needed, as well as more effective control strategies that affect both entomological and epidemiological endpoints. Sensitive surveillance tools do not exist today, and only a small handful of new control strategies are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, although temephos &#x02014; the most commonly used chemical-based vector control method, used against immature mosquito stages &#x02014; may be effective in reducing entomological indices, there is no evidence showing it reduces dengue transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">There is a compelling need to develop cost-effective approaches and practical tools that can reliably measure real-time dengue transmission dynamics that enable more accurate and useful predictions of outbreaks. Currently, there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This complicates the interpretation of early detection of cases that exceed expected normal seasonal variations. In many endemic countries, a dengue outbreak is declared when the number of reported cases during a specific time period (week or month) surpasses the historical average of the preceding 5 to 7 years above two standard deviations (SD), known as the <italic>endemic channel</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Outbreak definitions vary depending on how the historical average is calculated, which may involve, for example, the number of years used, type of mean (e.g., monthly or moving mean), whether or not outbreak years are included, how the critical threshold is calculated (e.g., &#x000b1;2 SD), and criteria used to define the outbreak (e.g., time above the threshold before a response is triggered) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Ideally, when an outbreak alert has been triggered, standard vector control strategies should be implemented. However, current early warning systems and detection of outbreaks are usually neither accurate nor timely enough to initiate effective control interventions (outbreak response) to curb increased transmission after it has begun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Various entomological indices are used to measure dengue vector infestation in and around structures (homes, buildings, etc.). However, these indices are seldom sensitive enough to precisely estimate dengue transmission risk or predict impending outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Stegomyia indices, i.e., House index (HI, proportion of <italic>Aedes</italic> positive houses) and Container index (CI, proportion of <italic>Aedes</italic> positive containers) were developed nearly a century ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], followed by the Breteau index (BI, number of <italic>Aedes</italic> positive containers per 100 houses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These three measures are currently the most commonly used indices to assess dengue vector larval habitat infestations. They are relatively easy to measure, but are generally not correlated with disease incidence or outbreak risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the 1990s, Focks et al. explored the use of pupal surveys as a potentially more epidemiologically relevant index, correlating total pupal densities with resultant adult densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This led to further development of entomological thresholds using a pupal/demographic method, ambient temperature, and seroprevalence of dengue antibodies in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a result, container-specific, targeted source reduction was proposed by identifying the relative importance of major types of container habitats with high pupal productivity that contribute significantly to the transmission threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it remains unclear if targeting only containers that are responsible for the vast majority, say 80&#x02013;90%, of the pupal production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is sufficient to have an epidemiological impact on transmission. Other aquatic habitats may be important, such as unusual and cryptic sites, which are typically overlooked during vector control interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, in many settings, such as in northeastern Thailand and southern Laos, as many as eight to ten of the most productive container types might only produce &#x0003c;&#x02009;70% of all pupae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although there are perceived benefits to targeting only the most productive containers, such as reduced time and effort, they may not compensate for ignoring control of other less obvious breeding habitats. The difficulty in finding and effectively treating such cryptic sites can be addressed by using pyriproxyfen, a potent insect growth regulator, which can be transferred between habitats by female <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes during oviposition, a strategy called auto-dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">A recent study from Iquitos, Peru investigated the relationship between several indicators of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> abundance and DENV infection in humans using more than 8000 paired serological samples with corresponding entomological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The researchers found that indicators based on cross-sectional entomological surveillance, i.e., data from a single survey observation, are of little practical use. On the other hand, longitudinal-based, household-level entomological indicators using data from up to three yearly visits before a 6-month seroconversion period showed that the presence of adult female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in a household increased the risk of DENV seroconversion by approximately 29% compared to households without mosquito vectors. The authors therefore challenged the assumption that most common <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> indicators provide adequate proxies for DENV risk and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The general response by national dengue control programs to indications of increased disease transmission and possible outbreaks mainly consists of reactive vector control. Typically, control activities involve application of temephos (an organophosphate compound) to domestic water storage containers for larval control and/or peridomestic space spraying with an insecticide, most commonly a pyrethroid-based formulation, for adult control. Although, these interventions may reduce vector populations dramatically, there is no evidence that they reduce dengue transmission substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other possible options for vector control are community-based source reduction campaigns, application of bacteria-based larvicides, larvivorous fish, or copepods, or combinations of these approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Newer paradigms for <italic>Aedes</italic> vector control include microbial control of human pathogens in adult vectors, such as <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria that shorten the lifespan of mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and release of transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> engineered to carry a dominant lethal gene that suppresses mosquito populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These novel approaches are currently not recommended for full-scale programmatic deployment by the World Health Organization (WHO) Vector Control Advisory Group, but rather implemented as carefully planned pilot interventions under operational conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The effectiveness of many vector control interventions is fraught with inherent weaknesses, e.g., widespread insecticide resistance, quality of delivery, and other operational issues, such as availability and cost of insecticide, dedicated and trained personnel, and appropriate application equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The WHO Global Strategic Framework for integrated vector management (IVM) was released in 2004 and recommends a range of interventions, in combination, to increase impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This means there is no single vector control method that is effective enough to control both vector populations and disease transmission. Combinations of larval control interventions, such as mixtures of pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator) and spinosad (a biopesticide) have been evaluated. This combination reduced larval and pupal relative densities by 90% for at least 4 months in the French West Indies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Pyriproxyfen, even in minute doses, can induce complete inhibition of adult emergence for several weeks after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Pyriproxyfen used alone and applied to storm drains in Colombia reduced dengue cases by 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The benefit of using these two compounds in combination is that they have different modes of action and that pyriproxyfen targets the pupal stage while spinosad is active against larval stages. Both compounds have very low toxicity for humans and most other non-target fauna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The WHO draft on global vector control response for 2017&#x02013;2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] builds on the IVM approach but places stronger emphasis on enhancing human capacity and health education, increasing research and innovation by strengthening infrastructure, and increasing intersectoral and interdisciplinary action. The targets of the global response are to reduce mortality and incidence due to all vector-borne diseases globally relative to 2016 by at least 75% and 60%, respectively.</p><p id="Par43">In view of the preceding discussion, this study aims to assess a specific vector control intervention and to contribute to the development of a practical early warning system that can more accurately predict changes in dengue transmission and impending outbreaks. The trial will determine the efficacy of a pyriproxyfen/spinosad combination in water storage containers to reduce entomological risk indicators and dengue incidence. The hypothesis is that the study arm receiving the combination treatment in household water storage containers will have a lower density of adult female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> per house, both indoors and outdoors, compared to the study arm receiving an alternative intervention involving normal governmental action. Furthermore, the study aims to determine one or more entomological indices and an immunological index that best predicts dengue incidence for the study area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par44">The specific objectives of this trial are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par45">Assess the effect of periodically treating water storage containers with a pyriproxyfen/spinosad combination on entomological and epidemiological outcomes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Determine the most accurate and precise index or indices to predict variation in dengue incidence in time</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par47">A stratified, cluster-randomized controlled trial is designed to study the effect of a vector control intervention in households located in pre-selected clusters in two urban areas in northeastern Thailand. Each cluster is randomized to one of two arms: intervention clusters receiving treatment of water containers with a pyriproxyfen/spinosad combination, and control clusters not receiving any intervention from this project. Control areas will rely on normal operational vector control interventions performed by the local public services. Randomization of arms is stratified by city (Khon Kaen and Roi Et, i.e., two levels). Stratification is done because there are potential differences between the two cities that may affect the outcomes (e.g., population size, and regional importance in terms of travel, commerce, services, health care, and education); therefore, stratification may reduce the residual statistical error when one compares the two arms. Including two cities may also alleviate problems of low incidence caused by the spatial and temporal variation in dengue transmission; i.e., one area functions as a backup if there are few cases in the other. Including two cities should also increase the generalizability of the trial.</p><p id="Par48">A cluster design is considered the best option because the intervention is not performed on the individual level, but is rather a spatial, area-wide approach involving treatment of containers in and immediately around each house and property in a study area (cluster). Within a household, it is not feasible to randomize some individuals to one intervention and other individuals to another. Furthermore, the entomological outcomes, both primary (Adult index) and secondary (e.g., Pupal index per person, and the Breteau index), will be estimated on a household level. We are using the larger clusters rather than single houses because (1) there may be mass (area) effects of the interventions, whereby entomological indices in each house may depend partly on the abundance of mosquitoes in neighboring ones, and (2) entire clusters having the same intervention more closely resembles how the intervention would be implemented, should it be scaled up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par49">The trial is carried out in two urban areas, Khon Kaen (N16.440236, E102.828272) and Roi Et (N16.055637, E103.652417) cities in northeastern Thailand (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Khon Kaen is the capital city of the province with the same name.

In each stratum, villages are randomly sampled based on probability proportional to population size, i.e., the population of occupied houses (the target denominator of the primary endpoint). These selected villages will be randomly allocated between the arms (see the section on <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Assignment of interventions</xref> below).</p><p id="Par57">Villages are normally much larger than the target cluster size (10 houses); therefore, to select a starting point for the house selection, a 50 &#x000d7; 50 m grid and a 100-m buffer zone inside of the village perimeter will be superimposed over each village map. The buffer zone of approximately 100 m on the inside of each village border is applied to reduce potential &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; (in-flying mosquitoes) from neighboring villages. A random grid cell is selected in each village and 10 houses nearest the centroid of that cell selected. This procedure is followed in each village in this manner as far as practically possible. For example, if a selected household does not want to participate in the study, a neighboring house will be selected.</p><p id="Par58">Informational meetings are held at the sub-district and village administrative levels to provide information about the project and benefits to the communities.

This enumeration will be done three times during the study, allowing monitoring of potential participants&#x02019; discontinuation in the trial. Data on discontinuation, whether due to movement outside the study area or withdrawal of consent, are relevant for the secondary outcomes of DIR and MEI. Reasons for potential discontinuation will be monitored and taken into account in communication strategies to promote retention. In addition, a minor monetary compensation for those who provide blood samples for the mosquito exposure study will promote participant retention to complete follow-up of individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par59">Following approximately 10&#x02013;12 months of baseline data collections, household interventions will begin in the selected intervention clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The intervention specifically targets mosquito immature stages by applying a mixture of pyriproxyfen and spinosad to all permanent household containers, whether indoor or outdoor, found to contain water up to a 10-m perimeter from the house. Pyriproxyfen is an insect growth regulator (insect juvenile hormone analog) that is active against pupal stages, resulting in the inhibition of adult development (preventing emergence). It has low mammal toxicity and is recommended by WHO for vector control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Spinosad is a natural insecticide produced by the soil bacterium <italic>Saccharopolyspora spinosa</italic>. It has a neurotoxic mode of action in insects, but with low mammal toxicity, and it is also recommended by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The doses recommended by WHO for <italic>Aedes</italic> immature mosquito control are 0.01 mg/L active ingredient (a.i.) pyriproxyfen (applied as a 0.5% granule formulation) and 0.1&#x02013;0.5 mg/L a.i. spinosad (also a 0.5% granule formulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Both pyriproxyfen and spinosad have also been assessed and approved by WHO for use in drinking water containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The reasons for selecting this novel intervention are that the combination of pyriproxyfen and spinosad has not yet been tested in a national dengue vector control program; that it should be effective, easy, and practical to use for national control authorities; and that its combined use reduces the risk of resistance development. The interventions will be implemented by project staff from the Ministry of Public Health, thereby ensuring adherence to intervention protocols.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Time schedule of enrollment, interventions, and pre- and post-allocation data collections (based on SPIRIT 2013 figure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>])</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2490_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">The combination larvicide will be applied simultaneously to containers every 3 months. A buffer zone of approximately 100 m will be established around the selected intervention clusters. All selected households and other households inside this buffer zone will be treated. As far as feasibly possible, abandoned households, non-permanent households, non-occupied properties, and vacant lots inside the buffer zone will be treated in the same manner.</p><p id="Par61">The households in the other half &#x02014; the control arm clusters &#x02014; will not receive any specific intervention initiated by the project. However, for ethical reasons, the comparator, i.e., the control arm, will receive normal governmental dengue control activities. Therefore, during the study period, both intervention and control clusters may be subjected to governmental action as part of the existing national dengue control program response. This may consist of space spraying with pyrethroids in and around a household where a dengue (index) case has been reported, including surrounding houses within a radius of 100 m from an index case. Additionally, larval control with temephos applied to household water-holding containers may occur. Larval control activities depend on the availability of staff, insecticides, and time. Although space spraying can be used in clusters of either arm (e.g., if a dengue case is detected), temephos will not be applied in the intervention clusters to avoid biased results and concerns from the public about potential negative effects on water quality. The pyriproxyfen/spinosad combination may be more effective than temephos, particularly since temephos resistance has been detected in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in several sites in Thailand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sequence generation and implementation</title><p id="Par62">The assignment of intervention (allocation) and control to clusters will be accomplished by two open public lottery events, one in each city (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

The lottery events will be carried out just before the first intervention. Representatives from each respective sub-district and village, including householders, district village heads, VHVs, and sub-district hospitals, will be invited to attend. Information about dengue and the purpose of the project will be provided. The reasons for randomization, its procedures, and the concepts of intervention and control will be explained. Attendants will also have a chance to ask questions about dengue, vector control, health-seeking behaviors, personal experiences of dengue, and specific details about the project.</p><p id="Par63">Each of the two lotteries will be performed as follows. Small pieces of paper, of the same color and size and thus indistinguishable from one another, numbered from 1 to 18, will be folded and placed in small opaque envelopes and then placed in a bowl. Each number represents a cluster (village). A large screen with the numbered list of village names (from 1 to 18) will be shown above the bowl and visible to all. A person not involved in the study, and accepted by all participants, will be selected to make the draw. Two flip boards with large sheets of paper will be placed on either side of the bowl with the respective headings &#x0201c;Intervention&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d; (in Thai). The village on the first paper drawn will be assigned to the intervention arm, the village on the next paper drawn will be assigned to the control arm, and so on. Following the draw, the implications of being in either of the two arms will be discussed and the roles of participants, health volunteers, and sub-district hospital staff will be reviewed. By following this lottery scheme, the interventions are allocated at the same time as the sequence is generated, obviating the need for allocation concealment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par64">This study is unblinded for both participants and data collectors because of the nature of the intervention and because it is neither practical nor financially feasible to obtain placebo (blank) granules of pyriproxyfen and spinosad to serve as a control. However, although knowledge of treatment allocation could affect mosquito endpoints (e.g., differential collection efforts), the MEI, which relies on the antibody response to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> saliva, should not be affected significantly. In terms of performance bias (i.e., systematic differences in care), dengue incidence is an endpoint, and dengue may initiate contact with health care personnel. However, the subsequent course of the episode does not affect any of the endpoints.

Pupae per person (number of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pupae/person) will be analyzed similarly to the AI. The denominator of the PPI is the number of persons present per cluster summed over time. For the BI (number of containers with <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> immatures/100 houses) the denominator for each cluster is the number of house collections during the intervention period.

Such objectives are in harmony with recent published recommendations on global frameworks on vector control and contingency planning for dengue outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] as well as recommendations from several review papers on these topics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. If successful, results from this study will provide important information on dengue vector control and contribute to the further development of early warning systems and deployment of effective responses to dengue outbreaks.</p><p id="Par109">Currently, the primary vector control methods used by the majority of public-funded dengue control programs are treatment of water storage containers with a larvicide (commonly temephos) and/or peridomestic space spraying of insecticides. Additionally, source reduction practices through community-based clean-up campaigns are common vector control interventions. Although these standard interventions are recommended by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], there is currently no clear evidence that they have any demonstrable effect on reducing dengue transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par110">A systematic literature review on the effectiveness of temephos found that as a single community-based intervention it controlled larvae for 2&#x02013;3 months, depending on study design, local circumstances, water turnover rates, and season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, temephos appears not to work well in combination with other interventions, possibly due to an inordinate trust in (or reliance on) its effectiveness when used alone, poor implementation and coverage, and low acceptability for its use in drinking water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The review concluded that many factors could influence the effectiveness of temephos, such as the degree of intervention coverage, quality of implementation and sustainability, how often treated water is exchanged, and characteristics and use of the target container itself.</p><p id="Par111">A systematic review on the effectiveness of peridomestic space spraying (using pyrethroids, pyrethrins, or organophosphates) showed reductions in various entomological indices; however, the effect dissipated within a few days or weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The authors concluded that the effectiveness of space spraying in reducing dengue transmission could not be confirmed and recommended more detailed research on its utility as a practical public health intervention. Container clean-up campaigns might be effective, although such interventions are often confounded by other simultaneous interventions, thus obscuring the effect of the source reduction campaign itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p id="Par112">It appears that most current dengue vector control methods lack clear evidence of their effectiveness, which does not necessarily mean they are ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. There have been few well-designed trials, and most have focused on measuring larval and pupal densities, which may not be epidemiologically reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The current trial is therefore of great interest to the international dengue control community, as it will look at a much wider range of measures, including adult vector densities. Moreover, the novel use of a pyriproxyfen/spinosad combination in household water storage containers is a promising alternative to conventional vector control methods. Combining the two compounds in a large field trial under natural conditions has not yet been attempted. Furthermore, the two compounds complement each other in that one targets the mosquito larval stage (spinosad) and the other the pupal stage (pyriproxyfen); thus, they potentially provide long-term control in the environment and disease reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In Vietnam, pyriproxyfen used together with insecticide-treated covers of water storage containers successfully inhibited mosquito breeding for 5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. A small, simulated field trial using a pyriproxyfen/spinosad mixture reported that the mixture was effective for at least 8 months compared with 3 months for spinosad alone and 5 months for pyriproxyfen alone. In natural breeding sites the mixture remained effective for 4.5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Both compounds are not toxic to humans or most non-target fauna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Pyriproxyfen also has an additional advantage in that it can be disseminated to other larval habitats by adult mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par113">This trial is also designed to identify practical and sensitive entomological and immunological indicators for prediction of dengue transmission and increased risk for dengue outbreaks. The more accurate, timely, and site-specific the prediction, the greater the likelihood a control response would mitigate, if not prevent, the outbreak from occurring. The originality of this trial is that virological and immunological methods are used in combination with standard entomological measures in both intervention and control clusters. The Peru study mentioned previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] investigated the relationship between indicators of mosquito abundance and DENV infection. Although, it is probably one of the most comprehensive studies to date, such abundance-based indicators are not likely to be sensitive enough to detect changes in intensity of transmission. A better indicator would be to monitor adult mosquitoes for dengue viral infection, similarly as is done to assess malaria transmission risk using the entomological inoculation rate. RDTs can be used as a simple method to detect DENV antigen in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. New methods to monitor DENV-infected adult <italic>Aedes</italic> densities using various trapping designs and RDTs have been proposed as a new paradigm in <italic>Aedes</italic> surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].</p><p id="Par114">Another potentially promising indicator is to measure the exposure of people to mosquito bites using human antibody response to mosquito salivary protein. A recent study carried out along the Thai-Myanmar border areas demonstrated that levels of IgG response were positively associated with anopheline vector abundance and the entomological inoculation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The antibody response to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> whole saliva has been shown to be a quantitative biomarker of human exposure in Africa and South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. More recently, a salivary peptide (Nterm-34 kDa) was identified as a specific <italic>Aedes</italic> biomarker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The IgG immune response to Nterm-34 kDa salivary peptide is not expected to last for more than 15&#x02013;30 days; hence, it represents a relevant temporal biomarker to assess recent relative exposure of humans to <italic>Aedes</italic> bites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. This peptide was used successfully as a short-time indicator to evaluate vector control interventions against <italic>Aedes</italic> exposure in R&#x000e9;union Island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p><p id="Par115">In this trial, DENV detection in adults and pupae will be assessed in relation to the number of recent and subsequent confirmed dengue incidents in humans in the same locality. Human exposure to <italic>Aedes</italic> bites measured by IgG antibody response will be examined for correlation with dengue cases. Data will be analyzed to include socioeconomic factors and influence of environmental and seasonal fluctuations, such as rainfall, relative humidity, and ambient temperature. These parameters and specific measures have so far not been fully integrated in epidemiological risk assessments and epidemic forecasting.</p><p id="Par116">The permanent staff of local public health departments, sub-district hospitals, and VHVs will collect data for all listed outcomes, thereby minimizing involvement of full-time trial project staff. This is intended, as much as possible, to allow national authorities to emulate the project procedures in follow-on surveillance and intervention activities or adoption of these methods into routine vector control program activities. The exception to this is molecular-based assay confirmation of DENV in human blood and mosquitoes and human antibody response to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> salivary peptides; this testing will be conducted by project staff.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par117">Several potential limiting factors may affect study outcomes. High spatial and temporal variation in dengue transmission dynamics may result in an insufficient number of incident infections to allow reliable associations between indices and dengue risk. This is why collections will be conducted over a 2-year period and in two urban areas to increase the potential of witnessing an upsurge in transmission as opposed to an interepidemic period. Nevertheless, the sample size required to detect significant differences in dengue incidence between the intervention and control arms was deemed unfeasibly large, thus relegating dengue incidence as a secondary outcome. Conversely, a dengue outbreak could likely overwhelm data collection systems used in the trial and further compel public health authorities to intervene with standard vector control interventions on a broad scale, thus potentially interfering with study outcomes. If outcome measures are substantially suppressed, this would negatively affect the power of the study.</p><p id="Par118">Lastly, the proportion of asymptomatic (inapparent) and infectious persons in the study area may affect prediction outcomes, because they will not be captured by the data collection procedures used in the trial, although they may contribute to transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Although the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases can be as high as 14:1 or higher, the epidemiological role of asymptomatic infections remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par119">At the time of submission of this manuscript, the trial has enrolled village clusters, requested household participation, and started baseline data collections in Khon Kaen (but not yet in Roi Et).

Ethical review of the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Section B, South East Norway (REK) is ongoing. Any follow-on protocol amendments will be reviewed and approved by these committees. The ISRCTN trial registry will also be informed in a timely manner of such amendments.</p><p id="Par123">All subjects will be engaged in a process of documented informed consent, and assent where appropriate, before participating in any study activities (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These processes will be conducted by staff of the Office of Disease Prevention and Control in Khon Kaen supervised by Khon Kaen University. There will be three consent processes in this trial:</p><p id="Par124">1. <italic>Request for household participation in a research project</italic>. Before starting the baseline data collections, households will be informed about the trial, and the household head will sign a consent form requesting his/her household to participate in the trial. Household agreement to participate means that its members may be subjected to individual request for participation, as stated in the following two points.</p><p id="Par125">2. <italic>Request for individual participation in a research project</italic>. Individual consent, and assent if appropriate, to participate will be sought from each household member at the time when they have been identified as having a fever during the study observation period. Fever cases will be identified by the VHVs.</p><p id="Par126">3. <italic>Request for blood spot collections</italic>. Consent (assent) will be sought from the two persons per household identified and selected for regular monthly blood spot collections each time blood spots are requested. These two individuals will be provided a small monetary compensation (50 baht = USD 1.50) for each blood sample.</p><p id="Par127">Each of the three consent processes will take place at the households. Informed consent will be documented by means of a written signed and dated consent form after (1) a full description of the study on the information sheet is given to the participant, and (2) the procedures, advantages, disadvantages, and responsibilities and participant&#x02019;s rights to withdraw at any time have been discussed, clarified, and fully understood by the participant. All forms and questionnaires are translated from English into the Thai language and tested for accuracy and interpretation before use.</p><p id="Par128">Children will be given a chance to decide for themselves whether they want to participate or not without pressure or coercion from parents or project staff. The assent forms, adapted to the children&#x02019;s ability to read and write, provide a simple and general overview of what participation in the project entails. The children will also be informed about the project verbally in easy-to-understand language. Children will sign the forms before their parents or legal guardians sign. The assent form is for children 7&#x02013;13 years old. Children 14&#x02013;17 years old will use the same consent form as that for adults, which has space for both children and parents/guardians to sign. Although the age of majority in Thailand is 20 years, 18 is commonly used as an age of consent for treatment purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. All consent and assent forms explain the risks and benefits of the study. For participants who cannot read, the entire informed consent form will be read and explained by the project staff in the presence of a community witness. After consenting, these people will mark an inked thumb impression on the form, and the witness will be asked to sign it. Consent and assent forms approved and stamped by the KKUEC are used in accordance with the Ethics Committee&#x02019;s guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par129">All authors have consented to publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par130">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar10"><title>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</title><p id="Par131">Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO.
