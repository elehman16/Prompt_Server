The efficacy of aclidinium bromide 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily in patients with stable COPD has been established in two phase III studies (ACCORD COPD I and ATTAIN) and a phase IIIb active-comparator study.

The questionnaire included one item that asked patients if they experienced symptoms during the night and one item that asked about their symptoms since they got out of bed to start the day.</p><p>In the active-comparator study, morning symptoms were assessed using a 9-item COPD symptom questionnaire, completed daily by patients between 7:00 am and 11:00 am using an electronic diary. Early morning was defined as the time from when patients got out of bed to start the day until they started their daily activities. One item of the questionnaire was related to the presence of a range of early-morning symptoms, including cough and phlegm, with five items related to the severity of these symptoms.

To investigate the reliability of different measures of cough symptoms used in these analyses, a post hoc analysis assessed the correlation between changes from baseline in E-RS cough and sputum domain scores in those patients who had &#x02265;1 exacerbation event in the ATTAIN study, and the severity of morning cough (based on the symptom questionnaires) at week 6 in the active-comparator study.

The results of the ATTAIN, ACCORD COPD I and active-comparator studies provide evidence that aclidinium is effective at reducing the severity and frequency of cough and sputum symptoms in patients with COPD, with improvements in E-RS total and E-RS cough and sputum scores as well as in evaluations of morning and night-time symptoms. These improvements were seen throughout the day and irrespective of the assessment tools used. Furthermore, aclidinium has previously been shown to be well tolerated in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>

The few trials that have assessed the efficacy of a LAMA on cough and sputum symptoms to date have reported negative results. In phase III studies, there was no significant difference in physicians' assessment of cough symptoms between patients receiving tiotropium and those receiving placebo.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Furthermore, no effect on mucociliary clearance was observed with ipratropium or tiotropium in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The prevalence and severity of cough symptoms at the start of the day may relate to periods of increased activity associated with getting washed and dressed, whereas the night-time cough and sputum symptoms may be a consequence of mucus hypersecretion or reduced ciliary activity. In the analyses reported here, treatment with aclidinium significantly reduced the percentage of days and nights with symptoms of coughing and bringing up phlegm or mucus. The severity of morning and night-time cough and sputum symptoms was also found to be reduced. Treatment approaches that impact on cough and sputum symptoms throughout the whole 24-hour day may provide clinical benefits to some patients in terms of their overall well-being, particularly in the morning and night-time when patients report that these symptoms are most troublesome.</p><p>In the active-comparator study, while both LAMAs had an effect, the magnitude of improvement in overall symptoms and cough and sputum symptoms was greater with aclidinium compared with tiotropium. The reasons for this are unclear; however, the fact that both LAMAs improved symptoms of cough and sputum suggests that these may be class effects. Precisely how these compounds might exert an effect on cough and sputum is unclear, but there is an emerging body of preclinical evidence suggesting that multiple pathways may be involved. For example, there is evidence that muscarinic antagonists reduce experimental cough,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and that tiotropium and ipratropium act on TRPV1 to reduce the cough response in preclinical models.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In addition, a 2016 preclinical study in rabbits showed that, further to their anticholinergic activity and any action on TRPV1 receptors, aclidinium and tiotropium may also have antitussive actions involving mechanoreceptors and acid-sensing ion channels.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> These studies provide preclinical evidence of LAMA antitussive activity; however, it is not yet clear how this may translate into clinical practice.</p><p>Studies of capsaicin responsiveness suggested an increased cough reflex in patients with COPD;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> however, a recent study which evaluated predictors of cough frequency found no significant relationship between cough frequency and capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In contrast, cough frequency was independently associated with being a current smoker, smoking history, sputum production and neutrophilic inflammation.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> A recent study has demonstrated that M3 receptors may play a proinflammatory role in cigarette smoke-induced inflammation in animal models of COPD, suggesting another potential mechanism by which LAMAs may improve cough in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> This is further supported by preclinical studies that have shown LAMAs can reduce neutrophils and inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b3;, in cigarette smoke-exposed animal models.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The efficacy of LAMAs to improve cough and sputum symptoms requires further investigation to determine if the effects observed with aclidinium are also seen with other drugs in this class.</p><p>The E-RS and night-time symptoms of COPD questionnaires are validated tools for assessing cough and sputum symptoms in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The observed improvements in E-RS cough and sputum symptoms with aclidinium 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g in ATTAIN (0.7 decrease from baseline in 24&#x02005;weeks) and the active-comparator study (0.6 decrease from baseline in 6&#x02005;weeks) compare well with the recently proposed minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of &#x02265;0.7 decrease from baseline.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The lack of a validated MCID in the other tools used in these studies may be considered to be a potential limitation of this analysis. However, the significant correlation between improvements from baseline in E-RS cough scores and the severity of morning cough symptoms assessed using symptom questionnaires in the active-comparator study supports the clinical utility of these tools to assess cough symptoms.</p><p>This study has other potential limitations. It should be stated that none of the three phase III studies reported here was powered to detect differences in cough and sputum symptoms, and the studies were not specifically designed to assess these symptoms. Furthermore, there was no prespecified minimum level of symptoms in any of the studies, meaning the population was relatively heterogeneous in terms of symptoms. Clinical trials designed specifically to assess the effects of treatments on cough and sputum symptoms in patients with COPD, using a combination of patient-reported outcomes, cough-specific quality-of-life measures and objective measures of cough and sputum symptoms, are needed to fully understand the efficacy of novel treatments on these symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While few studies have investigated the effect of bronchodilators on cough and sputum symptoms, the results reported here suggest that in addition to improving lung function, LAMAs, such as aclidinium, can improve cough and sputum expectoration compared with placebo in patients with COPD. As cough and sputum symptoms impact negatively on overall patient well-being, controlling these symptoms may represent an important additional therapeutic benefit of this class of drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all of the patients and their families, the team of investigators, research nurses and operations staff involved in these studies.
