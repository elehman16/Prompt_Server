Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was incorporated as non-invasive treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions. However, the effects of ESWT on coccydynia are less discussed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ESWT on the outcomes of coccydynia. Patients were allocated to ESWT (n = 20) or physical modality (SIT) group (n = 21) randomly, and received total treatment duration of 4 weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and self-reported satisfaction score were used to assess treatment effects. The VAS and ODI scores were significantly decreased after treatment in both groups, and the decrease in the VAS score was significantly greater in the ESWT group. The mean proportional changes in the ODI scores were greater in the ESWT group than in the SIT group, but the between-group difference was not statistically significant. The patients in the ESWT group had significantly higher subjective satisfaction scores than SIT group. We concluded that ESWT is more effective and satisfactory in reducing discomfort and disability caused by coccydynia than the use of physical modalities. Thus, ESWT is recommended as an alternative treatment option for patients with coccydynia.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02313324?term=NCT02313324&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02313324</ext-link>

Pain in these conditions is associated with coccygeal instability or subluxation, and patients develop subsequent coccydynia [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The radiographic orientations of the coccyx were introduced by Postacchini and Massobrio [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], who observed that patients with symptoms of coccydynia showed more mobility over the first intercoccygeal joint. The pain drawings were used to identify the correct symptoms and offer valuable methods for relieving the symptoms of coccydynia.</p><p>Patients with coccydynia often complain of pain and local tenderness around the coccyx [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Surgical interventions with the excision of the mobile coccyx or a total coccygectomy relieve approximately 80% to 90% of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The most common complication of coccygectomy is wound infection; therefore, the surgery is rarely performed, and nonsurgical strategies remain the major treatment for coccydynia. Management typically includes medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), gentle massage over the ligaments attached to the sacrococcygeal joint [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], manual manipulation for mal-alignment of the coccyx [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], local steroid injections combined with anesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and physical therapy with interferential current (IFC) [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or shortwave diathermy (SWD) [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SWD is used to provide heat to deep tissues [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and is useful in relieving pain and muscle spasms in inflammatory tissue [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SWD is regarded as an effective treatment modality for chronic osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and is used for somatic pain generated by the ligamentous and muscular elements inserted into the coccyx [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SWD can be effective for the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and was reported to reduce pain in patients with coccydynia [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IFC has been reported to reduce inflammation-induced central sensitization [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and reduce low back pain [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Combined with other physical modalities, IFC showed better outcomes in reducing the pain intensity associated with musculoskeletal disorders [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been suggested for non-invasive treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions, including plantar fasciitis [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], epicondylitis [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and shoulder calcification [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The effectiveness of pain relief with ESWT might be due to stimulation analgesia [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and increased tissue regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the effects of ESWT on low back pain and coccydynia are less discussed till now. Lee et al. reported exercise program combined with ESWT relieved chronic low back pain and improved dynamic balance more than exercise program with conservative physical therapy [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There is only one recent report by Marwan et al., presenting 2 cases with coccydynia, and reported three sessions of ESWT effective in relieving pain, and the pain did not recur during one year follow-up period [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Most patients prefer conservative treatment with non-invasive methods for coccydynia, including physical modalities and ESWT. There are few studies comparing the effects between ESWT and SWD combined with IFC therapy (SIT) in patients with coccydynia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of non-invasive ESWT on the outcomes of coccydynia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Study population</title><p>This clinical study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (IRB number: KMUH-IRB-20120218). The study was carried out from November, 2012 to November 2013 according to the IRB approval of the study period. This clinical study was conducted after the approval of IRB for its study design and ethical concerns, without initial registration as clinical trial, since researchers can start recruiting subjects and executing clinical studies once the clinical studies are approved by the IRB. The study was later registered on ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol and Results Registration System (registration number: NCT02313324) as suggested. The authors confirmed that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. The CONSORT checklist for randomized trial is included in Supporting Information (<xref rid="pone.0142475.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). The patients with first-time diagnosis of coccydynia with pain score ranging from 1 to 10 were enrolled at the rehabilitation outpatient department (OPD). Patients with a history of direct traumatic events to the buttocks, such as falls or slipping, were also included. The physiatrists of rehabilitation OPD were responsible for patient enrollment. A total of 50 participants were screened. After providing informed consent in written form, the patients&#x02019; histories were taken, and they underwent physical examination to identify the tender area and bony position. Roentgenography was used to assess the coccyx position and rule out major coccyx dislocations. Patients with cardiac pacemaker, tumors of the cauda equina, pelvic surgery, herniation of the lumbosacral disc, internal procidentia, genitourinary or gastrointestinal complaints or psychogenic factors were excluded. The basic demographic features and duration of coccygeal pain were recorded. Finally, 42 patients met the inclusion criteria, and were randomly allocated to 2 groups with allocation ratio of 1:1. The CONSORT diagram was shown in <xref rid="pone.0142475.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

Disability and pain were measured using a spinal disorder-specific questionnaire, the Oswestry disability index (ODI, in Chinese) [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There are six statements to be ranked on a scale of 0 to 5 in each of the 10 sections of the questionnaire. The contents relate to impairments such as pain intensity and abilities in personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and traveling. The patients were asked to identify the corresponding level of disability in each section. The total score ranges from 0 to 50; 0 represents the highest level of function, and 50 indicates completely disabled. In addition to the evaluations of the VAS and ODI prior to treatment, the scores were followed at the 5<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> week post-enrollment follow-up visits. Self-reported satisfaction scales were used to assess the general condition at the 8<sup>th</sup> week.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Interventions</title><p>The patients were randomly allocated to two parallel groups sequentially in a 1:1 ratio, the SIT group and the ESWT group, at the initial OPD visit. The enrolled patients were asked to discontinue analgesics or other physical modalities for pain one week prior to and after the treatments. The patients in the SIT group received combined therapy with SWD and IFC performed by the same physiotherapist at each treatment session. The SWD treatments followed the method described in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The SWD (Cosmogamma, Italy, SW500) mode was the inductive mode with a coil at a frequency of approximately 27.12 MHz. The patients were maintained in the prone position with two pillows under the abdominal area, and the sacrococcygeal area was covered with a towel to absorb sweat. The SWD applicator was placed over the sacroccygeal area. The treatment duration was 20 minutes. After completing the SWD treatments, the patients received the IFC (Minato, Japan) treatment. IFC provides deeper electrical stimulation. For this treatment, the skin overlying the sacral area was wiped with alcohol, and the electrical current was applied to the gluteal area using four electrodes from 2 channels of the stimulator. The four electrodes were set in a therapeutic way such that the two channels crossed each other with specific regions of interest concentrated on the gluteal area. The carrier frequency, typically 4000 Hz and 4100 Hz and designed to interfere with each other, resulted in a beat frequency of 100 Hz within the treated area. The treatment duration was 20 minutes. The protocol was set as 3 times a week for a period of 4 weeks.</p><p>The ESWT was performed by the same physiatrist, who was blinded to patients&#x02019; enrollment, and was not involved in further follow-up assessment. A BTL-5000 radial ESWT with a median head applicator was used (BTL Industries Inc. Columbia, South Carolina, USA). The patients were maintained in the prone and knees separated position with a pillow under the abdominal area. The patients received 2000 shots of ESWT in the coccyx area per session for four sessions (one session a week for 4 consecutive weeks). The frequency used was 5 Hz and the pressure was 3&#x02013;4 bar. The detailed descriptions of the study protocol are included in the Supporting Information, both in original and translated forms (<xref rid="pone.0142475.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142475.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Texts).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results were assessed by another therapist who was blinded to the patient&#x02019;s treatment method. All of the statistical analyses were performed by a statistician.

Studies have shown that ESWT could enhance tendon repair and decrease pain. The success rate for tendinopathy ranges from 60% to 80% [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the mechanism of ESWT in pain relief is not completely understood, and many theories have been proposed to explain the effects of ESWT. One proposed mechanism for the effectiveness of ESWT in tendinopathy is increased tissue regeneration through the induction of mechanotransduction on the cytoskeleton and the stimulation of protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. ESWT facilitates tendon repair through up-regulating extracellular matrix biosynthesis and increasing the expression of TGF&#x003b2;1 and IGF-I [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ESWT also decreases the levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukins and matrix metalloproteinases) [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and promotes vascularization of the injured tendon junction [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to promote tissue healing [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. ESWT has an effect on pain transmission by acting on substance P [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. ESWT can promote neovascularization by increasing the expression of factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Patients with coccydynia show inflammatory changes in the area of the coccyx [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and pain syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a report evaluating the treatment and outcome analyses of patients with coccydynia, 66% of patients experienced significant improvement with conservative management using medication and/or local steroid injections [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Conservative treatments are generally recommended before surgical intervention with coccygectomy in the treatment of patients with coccydynia. Considering the effect of ESWT on reducing the inflammatory response, this non-invasive treatment modality might be beneficial for treating patients with coccydynia. There is only one recent report evaluating the effects of ESWT on pain relief in patients with coccydynia. Marwan et al. reported that three sessions of ESWT were effective in relieving pain, and the pain did not recur during a one-year follow-up period [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our study randomized patients to ESWT or physical modality treatment to compare the treatment outcomes. In addition to pain evaluation, we included a disability rating scale for a more comprehensive evaluation of the treatment outcomes. The results suggested favorable outcomes in patients treated with ESWT regarding the degree of improvement in pain, disability and subjective satisfaction. We concluded that ESWT could be an alternative treatment option for patients with coccydynia and have a satisfactory treatment response. Patients receiving ESWT visited the hospital once each week for 4 weeks. Conversely, patients receiving physical modalities visited the hospital 3 times per week. The patients&#x02019; subjective satisfaction was better in the ESWT group, most likely because they had better treatment outcomes with fewer hospital visits and less time spent.</p><p>To determine the degree of functional improvement after different treatment modalities, the ODI score was evaluated in our study. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) score is a key element in determining the response to specific treatment modalities [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, there continues to be a lack of clarity for the suggested MCID score for the ODI [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study population, the initial scores suggested moderate disability in both the ESWT and SIT groups [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Regarding the percentage of change in the ODI score after treatment, both groups had scores with a more than 30% change at the 5<sup>th</sup> week assessment, reaching a clinically meaningful improvement as reported by Ostelo et al [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. At the 8<sup>th</sup> week follow-up, the patients receiving ESWT showed further improvement in their disability scores, reaching a more than 50% change in the ODI score, a threshold improvement considered a successful outcome in low back pain patients as reported by Fritz et al [<xref rid="pone.0142475.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This result suggested that ESWT provides a good treatment response for patients with coccydynia. The different recommended threshold improvements reported were mainly based on chronic low back pain populations; whether these thresholds are valid for the assessment of patients with coccydynia awaits further clinical studies.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. The diverse etiologies of coccydynia should be studied with different treatments. The initial disability index differed between groups before therapy; however initial VAS scores were comparable between groups. The number of enrolled cases was not sufficiently large for etiological subgrouping, and further study with a larger number of cases is needed to compare ESWT with other treatment options, such as local steroid injections. Moreover, longitudinal follow-up over a longer period is indicated to evaluate the long-term effects of ESWT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, ESWT appeared to be useful in relieving the pain of coccydynia and more effective in reducing pain syndromes than the use of physical modalities.
