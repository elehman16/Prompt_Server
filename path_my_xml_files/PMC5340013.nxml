Intermittent claudication (IC), a manifestation of PAD in the lower limbs, causes sufferers to experience cramping pain in the affected muscles, most commonly the calves, which occurs after walking a short distance and increases in intensity until the person stops, where the pain then gradually subsides. PAD can be limiting or occasionally debilitating and has been shown to have considerable deleterious effects on patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>There is a 15-fold increase in mortality secondary to cardiovascular disease in symptomatic patients with severe large vessel PAD; therefore, treatment is based around minimising cardiovascular risk factors and reducing risk of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With conservative management strategies a proportion of patients will remain with stable symptoms, whilst a minority will deteriorate and require intervention in the form of an endovascular or open vascular surgical procedure.</p><p>The physiological negative effects caused by PAD are hypothesised to be due in part to recurrent episodes of ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which occurs as claudicants exercise (ischaemia) and rest (reperfusion). IRI causes progression of atherosclerosis, as well as endothelial dysfunction and end organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. During ischaemic episodes and subsequent reperfusion, leucocytes become activated, resulting in release of proteolytic enzymes, cytokines and reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>A shockwave is described as a transient short-term acoustic pulse with a high peak pressure. This waveform generation and rise to peak pressure occur within nanoseconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Biological effects of shockwaves on human tissue were first documented during World War II when severe lung injuries secondary to water bombs were noted within casualties who did not display any evidence of external injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The medicinal use of high energy extracorporeal shockwaves did not develop until the 1980s, when they were targeted to fragment urinary stones (lithotripsy); results led to this technique becoming the gold standard treatment option for urolithiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. From this point the developing use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) followed an interesting course which started after an incidental finding of iliac bone thickening in patients undergoing lithotripsy, which proposed the potential osteoblastic effect of shockwave therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Researchers confirmed these observations through a number of clinical trials using shockwave therapy on delayed non-union fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Observational improvements to soft tissue wounds overlying these fractures treated with ESWT then encouraged research into the benefits of shockwave therapy in hard-to-heal chronic soft tissue wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The exact mechanism of action of ESWT on soft tissue is not fully understood, although the principle of mechanotransduction is thought to be responsible for the biological changes that take place. Mechanotransduction is the transfer of mechanical stimuli into chemical signals; this takes place at a cellular level where mechanosensory components within the cell wall are stimulated, which activates gene expression of growth factors and cytokines as well as cell proliferation or differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The mechanical force is a secondary effect of cavitation which can be visualised in water by the creation of cavitation bubbles that then emit secondary shockwaves. This physical force can also be seen when shockwaves are directed over a thin aluminium foil, which show the effect of cavitation bubbles collapsing on or near the foil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Increased expression of growth factors such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) have been demonstrated following treatment of soft tissues with ESWT during various studies both in vivo and in vitro. However, the majority of this evidence is from animal studies, and further investigation is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Due to these findings, further applications of ESWT are beginning to be explored. One such application included the use of ESWT to treat ischaemic heart disease where focussed shockwaves were directed at ischaemic areas of myocardium. This demonstrated some positive findings with notable results including improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ventricular wall thickening, reduced symptoms, reduced nitroglycerine use and again increased upregulation of growth factors and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A further use has potentially been found with small trials commencing in ESWT for peripheral vascular disease, which has led to the development of this current protocol.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Summary of current evidence</title><p>To date, four studies have investigated ESWT in claudicants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). They include one randomised control trial of 22 patients with 12 patients receiving treatment and 10 receiving a sham control. This study targeted ESWT at a stenotic plaque lesion within lower limb arteries and demonstrated significant reduction in degree of arterial stenosis, significant improvement in pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and reduction in pain severity. These findings were also coupled with a significant reduction in Fontaine staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Human studies related to ESWT for peripheral arterial disease</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study/author(s)</th><th>Type</th><th>Sample size</th><th>Methods</th><th>Significant results</th><th>Limitations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ciccone MM, Notarnicola A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</td><td>Randomised control trial</td><td>

</p><p>Another study was a small prospective non-randomised pilot study of 10 patients which aimed to prove safety; its primary end point was observation of adverse events. This study found no adverse events secondary to shockwave therapy. The secondary end point was a measure of tissue perfusion using scintography, laser Doppler and measurement of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO<sub>2</sub>). The use of scintography demonstrated significantly improved tissue perfusion in the dorsum of the foot; however, perfusion was unchanged in the lower leg region. Maximum TcPO<sub>2</sub> increased significantly in both the calf region and dorsum of the foot. Skin perfusion pressure measured using the laser Doppler showed increases in both regions, but neither was significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Another prospective study of 32 patients underwent EWST for critical limb ischaemia with both rest pain and localised distal necrosis. Outcomes included PFWD, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, laser Doppler skin perfusion, partial pressure of oxygen and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. All of these outcomes demonstrated significantly improved measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Finally a further two prospective non-randomised trials by Serizawa et al. with a total of 6 patients and then 12 patients with Fontaine stage II PAD were treated with ESWT and demonstrated significantly improved maximum walking distance, shorter recovery time and improved walking impairment questionnaire scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>This study aims to compare the effects of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) to the use of a sham control group on walking distances in subjects with lower limb intermittent calf claudication.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome is the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in comparison to sham treatment on the maximum walking distance (MWD) &#x02014; the distance covered before the subject is unable to continue &#x02014; at baseline and at 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary outcomes are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Claudication distance, i.e. distance covered prior to onset of any symptoms, at baseline and at 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), measured at baseline and at 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient reported walking distance at baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of life as measured by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) at baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5 domains questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;weeks post therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subject tolerance of treatment, measured by VAS after each individual treatment session</p></list-item></list>

<italic>Adverse event</italic> (<italic>AE</italic>): An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject to whom a medicinal product has been administered as part of a research study, including occurrences which are not necessarily caused by or related to an investigational medicinal product (IMP).</p><p>
<italic>Adverse reaction</italic> (<italic>AR</italic>): An AR is any untoward and unintended response in a subject to an IMP which is related to any dose administered to that subject.</p><p>Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also be considered serious.</p><p>
<italic>Serious adverse event</italic> (<italic>SAE</italic>): An SAE is an event not related or unlikely to be related to the IMP. An adverse event becomes serious if it:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Results in death</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is life-threatening</p></list-item><list-item><p>Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>
<italic>Serious adverse reaction</italic> (<italic>SAR</italic>): A SAR is a serious event which is suspected (possibly, probably or definitely) to be related to an IMP and expected for the IMP.</p><p>
<italic>Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction</italic> (<italic>SUSAR</italic>): A SUSAR is a serious event which is suspected (possibly, probably or definitely) to be related to an IMP and unexpected for the IMP, i.e. not previously documented in any of the IMP information (investigator brochure, Summary of Product Characteristics, patient information leaflet) or protocol on device deficiencies.</p><p>
<italic>Device deficiency</italic>: A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance. All device deficiencies will be recorded and reported accordingly.</p><p>
<italic>Anticipated and unanticipated serious adverse device effects</italic> (<italic>SADE</italic>/<italic>USADE</italic>): There are no known SADEs with this device; therefore, all SADEs are, by definition, unanticipated.</p><p>If a USADE is suspected, no additional patients will be enrolled until the cause of the event and its relationship to the study device have been determined. If the event is device-related, the following action will be necessary.

Concurrent medical events that do not interfere with scheduled testing and that are judged by the Investigator to not have an effect on the outcome measures will not disqualify a subject from continuing in the study. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, treatment discontinuation must be explained on the Adverse Event page of the CRF.</p><p>Patients will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason or, if necessary, the Investigator may withdraw a subject from the study to protect the subject&#x02019;s health. The Investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if it is considered that the scientific, and therefore, ethical standards of the study are compromised. Patients may also be withdrawn for not complying with study procedures. The type and timing of the withdrawal for withdrawal will be fully recorded on the CRF.

However, only several small, low-level research trials have investigated the use of ESWT in patients with peripheral arterial disease and, more specifically, intermittent claudication. Non-invasive management of patients suffering from intermittent claudication consists of best medical treatment plus supervised exercise programmes (SEPs). Unfortunately, uptake and adherence to SEPs is extremely poor in most centres; therefore, there is potential for an alternative non-invasive treatment option. The purpose of this study is to firstly investigate whether this treatment is safe and well tolerated by patients when applied to the calf muscle bulk, and also to study whether the angiogenic response seen in soft tissue research relating to ESWT has a positive effect on this cohort of patients and whether it is significant enough to improve clinical outcomes such as maximum walking distance, pain-free walking distance and ankle-brachial pressure index.</p><sec id="Sec47"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial remains in the recruitment phase.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec48"><title>Additional file</title><p>

The Informed Consent Form is included as part of the submission to the REC.</p><p>The Informed Consent Form and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject&#x02019;s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and/or the written Informed Consent Form. The investigators will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confirm their continued participation in the study by their signature on the revised Informed Consent Form. Any revisions to the written Informed Consent Form and written information will receive main REC approval in advance of use.</p><p>Patients will be free to withdraw at any time without affecting their healthcare or legal rights.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Study sponsor</title><p>Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust will act as the study Sponsor, as the study takes place on an NHS hospital site.
