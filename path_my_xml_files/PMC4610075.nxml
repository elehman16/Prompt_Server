In contrast to the gamma-amino butyric acid agonists and opiates, dexmedetomidine has a unique mechanism of action. It combines sedative, anxiolytic, sympatholytic, anti-delirious and analgesic sparing properties with minimal respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Whilst no single agent has all the desirable properties of an ideal agent, an ideal strategy would provide effective analgesia, anxiolysis, and reduce the risk of delirium and agitation with minimal cardio-respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Recommended practice is to give a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10-20 min. In a study of 66 postsurgery patients receiving this loading dose, 11 out of 18 unwanted hemodynamic effects (mean arterial pressure &#x0003c;60 mmHg or heart rate &#x0003c;50 beat/min) occurred during loading.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A reduction in loading dose was suggested following a study in medical patients, especially if other sedative agents had been used prior to starting dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>We conducted this study to determine the analgesic efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a continuous infusion without loading dose in postcardiac surgery patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The Hospital Ethics Committee approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Study was conducted between October 2012 and January 2013. Patient's inclusion criteria were: Age over 18 years, elective cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) including coronary artery bypass graft, valve surgery, and atrial septal defect closure. Patients with elevated serum creatinine, ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%, arrhythmias, deranged hepatic function and known allergy to current medication were excluded. Apart from the study drug, all other management was according to unit protocols. All patients received a standard premedication oral gabapentin 600 mg 45 min before shifting to operating room and general anesthesia consisted of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg, fentanyl 10 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 100ug/kg/min and vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg. All patients were monitored with routine cardiac surgery hemodynamic monitoring. All patients were operated under normothermic, nonpulsatile CPB.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Sample size estimation showed that approximately 32 patients were needed to detect a clinically relevant reduction of the pain level by 25%, with a power of 0.80 and alpha of 5%. Sixty-four patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery consented to participate in the study. After surgery, patients were transferred intubated and ventilated to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) and then were prospectively randomized in a double-blind fashion into one of the two groups using computer. Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 32) received a 12 h infusion of normal saline and Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 32) received a 12 h infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h without a loading dose. Postoperative pain was supplemented with intravenous fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g intermittent bolus, whenever the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score was more than 5. Total fentanyl consumption, hemodynamic monitoring, VAS pain rating and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) were charted every 6<sup>th</sup> hourly for 24 h postoperatively and followed-up till recovery from ICU. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) was used to categorize delirium.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results on continuous measurements are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and results on categorical measurements are presented in a number (%).

This was predictable from the known properties of &#x003b1;2 agonists and might have been avoided by omitting the loading dose and commencing the infusion while in the operating theatre. The protocol allowed neither boluses of study drug nor exceeding the maximum infusion rate (0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h dexmedetomidine). The hypotension and bradycardia occurring during the loading dose phase of the dexmedetomidine was only seen in cardiac patients. This is probably directly attributable to stimulation of the central postsynaptic &#x003b1;2 receptors causing inhibition of sympathetic activity or augmentation of parasympathetic activity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Hall <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated in a randomized, double-blinded study involving small population of volunteers with healthy cardiovascular systems that small doses (0.2 and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusions, small and moderate doses respectively) of dexmedetomidine provided significant sedation and analgesia to the conventional pain therapy. Cardiovascular stability and respiratory function were both well maintained.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Shehabi <italic>et al</italic>. on tertiary general ICU patients, unique feature was the omission of dexmedetomidine loading dose. Dexmedetomidine was started at 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h in all patients then increased (maximum of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) or decreased (minimum of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) every 15 min as deemed clinically necessary.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial in 306 cardiac surgery patients showed that dexmedetomidine, at a median dose of 0.49 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, provided effective sedation and targeted analgesia without an increase in hypotension or vasopressor requirements. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine treatment significantly reduced the duration of delirium and promoted early extubation when compared with morphine based regimen.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine can be used in patients expected to be ventilated for up to 48 h after complex surgery. The dose range is 0.2-0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h without the use of a loading dose.

None of their patients had a clinically significant bradycardia, and only six patients (12%) required the introduction of a pressor for management of low blood pressure. However, the absence of a control group makes it difficult to identify a direct cause and effect in this group of patients where significant fluid shifts, blood loss and dynamic changes are likely to be occurring in the postoperative period. Postoperative warming in the cardiac surgery group and the concurrent use of inotropes and pressors may mask the true effect on blood pressure. They demonstrated that by avoiding a loading dose of dexmedetomidine, unwanted cardiovascular effects can be substantially minimized.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there were no significant hemodynamic changes in the dexmedetomidine group when compared to the saline group.
