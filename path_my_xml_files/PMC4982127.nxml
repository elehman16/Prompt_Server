However, relatively few qualitative studies have investigated the phenomenon of PIP and its underlying processes from the perspective of general practitioners (GPs). The aim of this paper is to explore qualitatively, GP perspectives regarding prescribing and PIP in older primary care patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with GPs participating in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to decrease PIP in older patients (&#x02265;70&#x000a0;years) in Ireland. Interviews were conducted with GP participants (both intervention and control) from the OPTI-SCRIPT cluster RCT as part of the trial process evaluation between January and July 2013. Interviews were conducted by one interviewer and audio recorded. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted (13 male; 4 female). Three main, inter-related themes emerged (complex prescribing environment, paternalistic doctor-patient relationship, and relevance of PIP concept). Patient complexity (e.g. polypharmacy, multimorbidity), as well as prescriber complexity (e.g. multiple prescribers, poor communication, restricted autonomy) were all identified as factors contributing to a complex prescribing environment where PIP could occur, as was a paternalistic-doctor patient relationship. The concept of PIP was perceived to be of variable usefulness to GPs and the criteria to measure it may be at odds with the complex processes of prescribing for this patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several inter-related factors contributing to the occurrence of PIP were identified, some of which may be amenable to intervention. Improvement strategies focused on improved management of polypharmacy and multimorbidity, and communication across primary and secondary care could result in substantial improvements in PIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN41694007">ISRCTN41694007</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP)</kwd><kwd>Older patients</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Qualitative analysis</kwd><kwd>Polypharmacy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001590</institution-id><institution>Health Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRC/2007/1</award-id><award-id>PHD/2007/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fahey</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>People over the age of 65&#x000a0;years have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity (commonly defined as the presence of two or more chronic medical conditions), requiring multiple medications (polypharmacy) to manage symptoms and prevent future events.. These combined health care needs, coupled with age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics make prescribing in this population a complex task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, evidence indicates that prescribing in older people is often suboptimal, with an increased risk for adverse outcomes including drug-drug interactions, adverse drug reactions and potentially inappropriate prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) comprises a number of suboptimal prescribing practices, including inappropriate dose or duration of medication, drug&#x02013;drug interactions, drug&#x02013;disease interactions, and use of medications that have a significant risk of an adverse drug event (ADE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, PIP in older patients has become an important public health concern, and a significant body of research has emerged on the topic. A recent systematic review identified 36 published tools to assess PIP in older people, the majority of which were explicit (i.e. lists of drugs to avoid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is little overlap between the tools in terms of which medications are considered inappropriate but commonalities include the use of long-acting benzodiazepines, the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with other medications (e.g. warfarin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Quantitative studies have estimated the prevalence of PIP in primary care between 20 - 50&#x000a0;% in older patients, depending on which of these tools has been applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Commonly reported consequences of PIP include increased morbidity, ADEs, hospitalisations, and lower health related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The most important risk factor for having PIP is polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Polypharmacy may describe prescribing of many drugs (appropriately) or too many drugs (inappropriately) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in primary care have found pharmacist interventions, computerised decision support systems (CDSSs) and multifaceted interventions (involving more than one intervention component) to be somewhat effective in reducing PIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Relatively few qualitative investigations into the phenomenon of PIP and the processes underlying it have been published to date. A recent meta -synthesis identified seven papers exploring PIP in older people qualitatively, highlighting that some doctors have self-perceived restrictions with regard to prescribing appropriately because of a combination of factors such as patient expectation, tension between experience and guidelines and prescriber fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The majority of the included studies in this meta -synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] focused on the experience of prescribing based on single medications (e.g. benzodiazepines) rather than polypharmacy or PIP and only three included perspectives of general practitioners (GPs), highlighting a dearth of information in this area. While it is crucial to determine the prevalence of PIP, the consequences of PIP, and how best to reduce it, it is also essential to explore the perspectives of clinicians in relation to PIP to better inform interventional strategies. The aim of this paper is to explore GP perspectives regarding prescribing and PIP in older primary care patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Context and study setting</title><p>This study is part of a larger research project conducted in Irish primary care: the OPTI-SCRIPT study (OPTImizing PreSCRIbing for Older People in Primary Care, a clusTer randomized controlled trial). The detailed trial methods and results have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Briefly, this was a cluster RCT involving 21 GP practices and 196 patients which found that a multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing PIP in the intervention group. The intervention comprised: academic detailing with a pharmacist on conducting GP-led medicines review with participating patients; medicines reviews supported by web-based pharmaceutical treatment algorithms for GPs providing evidence-based alternative treatments for specific PIP medicines identified per patient by the research pharmacist (see <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> for full list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]); and tailored patient information leaflets. A mixed methods process evaluation was conducted as part of the trial. The process evaluation explored the implementation of the intervention, the experiences of those participating in the RCT, and lessons for future implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The qualitative component of this evaluation provided an opportunity to explore aspects of PIP and prescription medication use qualitatively with GPs using a thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>All interview participants were recruited from the OPTI-SCRIPT study between January and July 2013. The lead study GP in all 21 participating practices, in both the intervention and control arms, was asked to participate in a semi-structured interview, 17 of whom were available for interview (two were on leave and two were unable to schedule an interview within the study time frame).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected from one to one semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews were the preferred method of data collection as it is a flexible approach, allowing interviewers to alter the sequence of questions or the way in which they are phrased in response to the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All interviews were conducted either in person (in a setting of the participants preference) or via telephone. Telephone interviewing is generally used where time or costs are issues, and there is evidence that there is little difference in the quality of the data obtained this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The interview topic guide covered aspects of the trial evaluation, as well as prescribing related issues. In particular, the following broad sections were pertinent to this current study: reflections on prescribing for older patients in primary care; GPs&#x02019; attitudes to the concept of PIP and its perceived relevance in primary care, as presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

All participant data were pseudo-anonymised by assignment of a unique study ID. A thematic analysis was conducted following a six-step process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Three inter-related themes emerged, namely a complex prescribing environment, paternalistic doctor-patient relationships, and a limited relevance of the PIP concept for GPs. GPs highlighted that prescriber (e.g. multiple prescribers) and patient (e.g. multimorbidity) factors, and characteristics of a paternalistic doctor-patient relationship, contributed to a complex environment in which potentially inappropriate prescribing could occur. However, the utility of the PIP concept, and the criteria to measure it, was questioned by GPs as it often failed to take this complexity into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Consistent with previous qualitative explorations, this study has highlighted that multiple, inter-related factors influence PIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Polypharmacy, multimorbidity, and fragmentation of care have all been identified as contributing to a complex prescribing environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These factors are common risk factors for PIP, some of which may be amenable to intervention. At the patient level, polypharmacy is one of the most consistently reported predictors of PIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Appropriate polypharmacy may be improved through a number of interventional strategies such as the involvement of pharmacists in pharmaceutical care and strategies focusing on deprescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, the evidence base supporting the mechanisms of how to deprescribe is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Improving the management of patients with multimorbidity through multifaceted interventions targeted at risk factors or specific functional difficulties may potentially improve prescribing, however, the evidence to date is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. At the prescriber level, the number of prescribers involved in patient care has been identified as an important predictor of PIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our findings suggest that fragmentation of care between multiple prescribers results in poor communication of up-to-date patient medication information - a finding which resonates with previous qualitative investigations on treating patients with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Improving communication systems throughout a healthcare system is likely to be a difficult task as it represents a larger system/policy level change. Improving medicines reconciliation represents one feasible mechanism to decreasing medication errors at transitions of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Over the last century, the conceptualisation of the doctor-patient relationship has altered, moving towards models of shared decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Consistent with previous qualitative findings in a hospital population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], our study provides evidence for the continued existence of a paternalistic doctor-patient relationship in older patient groups. However, GPs may view this relationship structure as necessary due to patient confusion with their complex medication regimens, a passive approach to medication management, and/or attempts to preserve their prescribing autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Promoting involvement of older patients in prescribing decisions, or shared decision-making, may impact on PIP, as exemplified by the recent findings of the EMPOWER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This study found that a patient educational tool aimed at engaging older adults in discussing the harms of benzodiazepine use with their physician and/or pharmacist, resulted in significant reductions in benzodiazepine use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, shared decision-making in this group is likely to be complicated by polypharmacy, the involvement of multiple prescribers, and patient knowledge of medication which is often poor in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. GPs reported feeling restricted in terms of prescribing autonomy with the choice of treatment often limited by prescriptions from specialist clinics. In circumstances like this, shared decision-making regarding prescription medication use is likely to be difficult and restricted in scope.</p><p>Consistent with previous qualitative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], GPs in this study reported a limited knowledge of PIP and published PIP criteria. GPs accepted that PIP may be occurring, however, there was disagreement between these participants as to how useful it was to refer to it as such. A number of GPs found the terminology adversarial and critical. As well as questioning the terminology, a number of GPs were critical of PIP criteria, highlighting that it failed to adequately take into consideration the complexity of an older heterogeneous patient profile, a common criticism of such criteria. Consequently, the criteria are often perceived to be limited in terms of clinical utility and relevance in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In complex patients perceived as stable, GPs have been found to prefer to &#x02018;maintain the status quo&#x02019;, sometimes referred to as clinical inertia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Our result confirmed this, highlighting that particularly in the cases of medications such as benzodiazepines, where the risk of stopping the medication is perceived as worse than continuing it, GPs did not find PIP criteria useful. To be effective, such tools need be applicable in routine clinical practice, not only in a research environment. However, as our study indicates, this gap may not have yet been successfully bridged in primary care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study is an important contribution to the limited qualitative data in this area. The qualitative methodology used allowed an exploration of the complexity of PIP in primary care not accessible in the numerous quantitative, prevalence studies in the current literature. However, the present study has a number of limitations. These interviews were conducted as part of the OPTI-SCRIPT trial process evaluation, which limits the findings in two main ways. Firstly, the process evaluation was designed to explore elements of intervention implementation and study participation. Therefore, the topic guide was not designed to explore the issues outlined in this paper solely, and interviews were shorter on average (14&#x000a0;minutes) than may be expected to explore prescribing as a topic. While the themes presented here emerged strongly from the data, arguably, a more detailed interview on prescribing and prescription medication use alone may have produced a more nuanced account. Secondly, the sample was limited to only those GPs who participated in the OPTI-SCRIPT trial. While this resulted in a good response rate, the participants may not be representative of GPs nationally. Study participants were predominantly male, and urban based and as volunteers to this study, may be more informed about PIP than the general population. However, when compared to a national sample of GPs, the participants were broadly similar. Overall, d our results are consistent with the limited number of qualitative studies in this area, increasing confidence in the findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PIP is common in older populations in primary care. This study identified several inter-related factors that contribute to the occurrence of PIP including a complex prescribing environment, paternalistic doctor-patient relationships and limited relevance of the PIP concept for GPs. Several of these have been highlighted as amenable to intervention, including improved management of polypharmacy and multimorbidity and decreasing PIP. However, there is a need for stronger evidence of the effectiveness of such interventions in resulting in clinically significant patient improvements in patient primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The concept of PIP is perceived to be of limited usefulness to GPs and the criteria to measure it may be at odds with the complex processes of prescribing for this patient population. Future strategies for improving PIP need to be cognisant of such barriers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CME, continuing medical education; GMS, General Medical Services; HRB, Health Research Board; OPTI-SCRIPT, OPTImizing PreSCRIbing for Older People in Primary Care, a clusTer randomised controlled trial; PILs, patient information leaflets; PIP, potentially inappropriate prescribing; PPI, proton pump inhibitor; RCT, randomised controlled trial</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix</title><p><table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Selected Prescribing Criteria/Prescribing Indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Criteria</th><th>Concern</th><th>Estimated prevalence in Ireland<sup>a</sup>
