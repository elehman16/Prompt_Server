Smoking cessation interventions in our country will be the most cost effective of all interventions considering that the cost incurred on the three main tobacco related illnesses (COPD, CAD, and Cancer) being around Rs 27,761 crore in the year 1999.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Matrials and Methods</title><p>A double blind placebo controlled trial was conducted to see the efficacy of Bupropion in smoking cessation. Smokers with current depression were excluded. The subjects (n = 30) were randomly assigned to receive Bupropion SR 300 mg/day or placebo for seven weeks. Target quit date was preferentially 8<sup>th</sup> day of starting the treatment. Intensive counseling was provided by the physician at the baseline and brief counseling at every visit weekly during the treatment phase and at weeks 12 and 16. Self reported abstinence was confirmed by a carbon monoxide concentration in expired air of less than 10 ppm.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The seven-day point prevalence abstinence rate at the end of week 2 and week 16 in the drug group was 46.67% and 53.33 % respectively and in the placebo group was 13.33% and 20% respectively with the &#x02018;<italic>P</italic>&#x02019; value of 0.04 and 0.05 respectively. Rates of continuous abstinence at weeks 4, 7 and 16 were 46.67%, 40% and 33.33% in the drug group and 13.33%, 13.33% and 13.33% in the placebo group respectively. The rates were significantly higher in the drug group till week 4 starting from week 2 of the treatment phase. The mean weight gain in drug group was found to be significant less as compared to the placebo at week 16 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025) The mean change of depression scores from the baseline was not significantly different between the two groups at any point of time. The withdrawal symptom score increase from the baseline was not significantly higher at any point of time in the drug group but in the placebo group the increase was significantly higher for seven days after target quit date and at weeks 3 and 4 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The most common adverse events in the drug group were insomnia, which was seen in 6 (40%) patients and dry mouth and/or altered taste in 4 (26.67%) patients, which was significantly higher as compared to placebo. </p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Predictors of Outcome:</title><p>The univariate predictors of a successful outcome were the point prevalence abstinence at week 16 were older age (&#x0003e;40 years), (<italic>P</italic> = 0.044) and quitter status at week 2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Multivariate predictors in order of importance were Quit status at 2nd week (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and Age &#x0003e;40 years (<italic>P</italic> = 0.031). The combined predictive value of these two variables was found to be 86.3%.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bupropion helps in smoking cessation. This has been proved by three large multicenter randomized controlled trials. This study has also reflected the same result in the form of significantly high seven-day point prevalence abstinence at week 16 in the Bupropion group as compared to placebo. Bupropion has a beneficial effect on weight gain and withdrawal symptoms and the benign adverse effects of insomnia and dry mouth or altered taste make it a very effective and cheap treatment for nicotine addiction in smokers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Bupropion quit rate</kwd><kwd>nicotine addiction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates around 1.1 billion smokers worldwide constituting one-third of the entire population aged 15 years and above. 47% of the men and 12% of the women smoke globally.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] It is predicted that by year 2020, tobacco will become the single leading cause of death, causing one in eight deaths.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>]</p><p>Tobacco use in India among the male and female population has been estimated at around 23.2% and 4% in urban and 33.6% and 8.8% in rural areas respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] The mortality burden of tobacco related deaths have been estimated at 800,000 deaths annually.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] The burden of three main tobacco related illnesses i.e. COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD) and cancer is also immense. 4.2 million existing cases of CAD, 1,50,000 annual cases of cancer and about 12.5 million cases of COPD put an immense burden on the health infrastructure.

Subjects who missed a follow-up, discontinued treatment or were lost to follow up were considered to be smoking. The Chi Square analysis was used to determine the difference between these rates in two groups at various points of time. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed at baseline, daily for the first week after target quitting date and weekly at weeks 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. A composite withdrawal score was calculated as a mean of nine withdrawal symptoms. The mean withdrawal score in each group at the various points of time was compared to the baseline by repeated measures analysis of variance. Body weight and symptoms of depression were assessed in subjects who completed 16 weeks of follow up. It was measured at baseline, week 7 and week 16. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to assess the change. The rates of adverse events in two groups were compared with Chi Square analysis. Predictors of outcome were studied using Univariate analysis and a step wise multiple logistic regression analysis to study the multivariate predictors of quitting.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the two groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drug group n = 15</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo group n = 15</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (in years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.87 &#x000b1;

motivated patients attending the anti smoking clinic at Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi over a period of one year. The baseline characteristics of the patients did not differ significantly. Except for one female in the placebo group, all the patients in both the groups seeking help for smoking cessation were males despite a considerable percentage (about 6%) of female smokers in urban areas. This highlights the fact that the female coming out with their smoking habit is considered a social stigma and this problem needs to be addressed if they are to benefit from the tobacco cessation interventions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>]</p><p>According to a study done to determine the patterns of smoking in Delhi, smoking was most prevalent among the illiterates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] In the present study only two of the 30 patients seeking help were illiterates, thus making this group least likely to seek help as compared to those with a minimum of elementary education. There is a need for tobacco cessation programs to target this group so that it gets its fair share of opportunity in participating in such programs. Most of the smokers seeking help (&#x0003e;50%) were either professionals, or self-employed belonging to middle or the higher income group.</p><p>Although bidi is the most common tobacco product smoked in India yet only 30 percent of smokers in the present study were bidi smokers and cigarette smokers formed the rest 70%.</p><p>All the smokers who had a prior quit attempt did so on their own without any help from the physician or use of any medication that is all tried quitting cold turkey. This is very important as physician advice regarding quitting is not been given as frequently as it should be and anti smoking advice as part of patient management is still provided rarely, this in spite of the fact that five per cent of smokers will quit only on their physicians advice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Awareness regarding the harmful effects and the ban on smoking at public places was found to be quite high exceeding 90% in both the groups. This could be attributed to the fact that except two illiterate smokers, all the smokers have had at least primary level of education.</p><p>The seven-day point prevalence abstinence rate at the end of week 2 in the drug group was 46.67% and in the placebo group was 13.33% and former being significantly higher than the latter (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The rates at the end of treatment phase i.e. week 7 and at weeks 8, 12, 16 were 53.33%, 33.33%, 46.67% and 53.33% in drug group and 40%, 40%, 20% and 20% in placebo group respectively. The rates were higher in the drug group at all points of time but reached statistical significance only at week 16 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). The seven-day point prevalence rate in various studies has ranged from 32 to 50% with Bupropion and the observed seven-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 53.33% in this study is in line with those studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>Rates of continuous abstinence at weeks 4, 7 and 16 were - 46.67%, 40% and 33.33% in the drug group and 13.33%, 13.33% and 13.33% in the placebo group respectively. The rates were significantly higher in the drug group till week 4 starting from week 2 of the treatment phase. The continuous abstinence rate of 33.33% at week 16 in the drug group was more than twice that in the placebo group i.e. 13.33%.</p><p>These rates are comparable to the studies where continuous abstinence rates at week 7 ranged from 24 to 35 % while those at week 16 ranged from 22% to 35%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>The mean weight gain in the drug group was 2.11 kg while that in the placebo group was 2.77 kg.

The mean weight gain in drug group was found to be significant less as compared to the placebo at week 16 by using the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025). This is in line with various studies reporting beneficial effects of Bupropion on weight gain in the post cessation period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>The depression scores decreased from the baseline in both the groups and at week 7 the mean depression score in the drug group (5.33 &#x000b1; 0.87) was significantly less than the baseline (7.11 &#x000b1; 1.76). The mean change of depression scores from the baseline was not significantly different between the two groups at any point of time. This is in agreement with the studies wherein Bupropion SR was found not to have a significant beneficial effect on depression scores over the placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>Withdrawal symptom scores increased from baseline in both the groups at all points of time in the post cessation period.

This highlights the beneficial effect of Bupropion in reducing the withdrawal symptoms as compared to the placebo and hence helps the patient in the quitting process. It has been brought out by various studies that Bupropion reduces the withdrawal symptom scores significantly better than placebo and NRT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p><p>The most common adverse events in the drug group were insomnia, seen in 6 (40%) patients and dry mouth and/or altered taste in 4 (26.67%), which was significantly higher compared to placebo.

The combined predictive value of these two variables was found to be 86.3%. In other words if a smoker had quit at second week of treatment he was most likely to remain abstinent till 16<sup> th</sup> week. Similarly older age (&#x0003e;40 years) also predicted that patient had significant chances of quitting and remaining abstinent till the 16<sup>th</sup> week. Other predictors of outcome in studies on Bupropion such as lower smoking rates, periods of abstinence, previous quit attempts, and male gender were not found to be significant in present study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>]</p><p>The main limitation of the study was a small 'number of patients (n)' as the 'n' required to detect a significant difference in abstinence rates between Bupropion group and placebo group at a nominal <italic>P</italic> of 0.05 and power of 80% based on stipulated abstinence rates in previous studies was found to be at least 400 and such a large 'n' was not possible in the present study considering the time constraint of one year and a long follow up of 16 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The study was done on smokers attending the anti smoking clinic.

Bupropion has a beneficial effect on weight gain and withdrawal symptoms and the benign adverse effects of insomnia and dry mouth or altered taste make it a very effective and cheap treatment for nicotine addiction in smokers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>World Health organization</article-title><source>Tobacco or health: A global status report</source><year>1997</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peto</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Smoking and death, past 40 years and the next 40</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>1994</year><volume>309</volume><fpage>937</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7950669</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fagerstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Smoking cessation treatment with sustained releaseBupropion Optimising approach to management</article-title><source>Drugs</source><year>2002</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>1S</fpage><lpage>70S</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>McNeil</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Smoking cessation guidelines for health professionals: Anupdate</article-title><source>Thorax</source><year>2000</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>987</fpage><lpage>99</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11083883</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fiore</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jorenby</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Smoking status as a new vital sign: effects on assessment and intervention in patient who smoke</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>1995</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>209</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7861807</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fiore</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorfman</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Gritz</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Smoking cessation clinical practice guidelines No 18, Rockville (US Dept of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Agency
