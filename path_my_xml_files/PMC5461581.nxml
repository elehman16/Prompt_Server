The aim of this study was to compare ovarian function in patients who undergo hysterectomy for benign reasons with or without bilateral salpingectomy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was a clinical-trial study on patients undergone hysterectomy with/without bilateral salpingectomy in Al-Zahra Hospital, in 2015&#x02013;2016. Demographic information (age, height, and weight) were recorded. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured in 2&#x02013;5 days of menstrual cycle before operation. Patients were asked to refer in 6 months for follow-up, including FSH and LH re-measurement and also menopausal status examination. Patients were divided into age groups of 39&#x02013;45, 46&#x02013;50, and &#x02265;51 and also groups of body mass index including 18.5&#x02013;24.9, 25&#x02013;29.9, and 30&#x02013;34.9.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 37 patients divided into two groups, including 22 patients undergone hysterectomy without salpingectomy (H) and 15 undergone hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy (H-bS).

Patients undergone hysterectomy without salpingectomy are at higher risk of hydrosalpinx, due to the closure of both sides of ovarian tubes, in comparison to those undergone hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy (H-bS).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Due to the common blood supply of ovaries and fallopian tubes, some gynecologists prefer preserving ovaries in a hysterectomy, especially for benign reasons, to conserve ovarian function. Based on this fact, numerous studies have been conducted for evaluating the effect of salpingectomy on ovarian function.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In the case of confirmation that salpingectomy may not affect ovarian function negatively, gynecologists can operate salpingectomy during hysterectomy surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Another important point that should be considered is ovary preservation benefits in women with low risk of ovarian cancer like those who do not carry BRCA. The advantages and disadvantages of tubal preservation during hysterectomy for benign reasons has not been widely assessed, and results are controversial, also the number of studies conducted in Iran are rare.</p><p>As bilateral salpingectomy during hysterectomy for benign reasons is controversial, we have decided to conduct the current study. In this study, we also assessed the effect of body mass index (BMI) and age of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) change in patients underwent salpingectomy and those whose salpinx were saved. Since the race and ethnicity is important, we compared ovarian function in patients who undergo hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingectomy and also compare FSH and LH change in different BMI and ages in these two methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a clinical-trial study on 37 patients undergone hysterectomy with/without bilateral salpingectomy for benign reasons in Al-Zahra Hospital (affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences), 2015&#x02013;2016.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were (1) regular menstruation cycle, (2) no history of malignancy, (3) not being menopause, (4) underlying reason of myxomatosis uterus or menorrhagia, and (5) Exclusion criteria were (1) operation canceling, (2) not the accessibility of hormone measurement before or after operation due to any reason and (3) postsurgical pathology of malignancy.</p><p>Numbers of 43 patients were candidate for hysterectomy.

A few numbers of studies have evaluated LH and FSH for ovarian function assessment while anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), estradiol and inhibin B, as direct markers of ovarian function are used more frequently. Specificity of AMH in ovarian function prediction is 84%, whereas FSH is 82%, on the other hand, FSH checking cost is remarkably lower and it is more accessible, thus we decided to assess FSH levels for ovarian function prediction.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we found that level of both LH and FSH rose significantly after hysterectomy with/without salpingectomy by 6 months but only a patient in group of hysterectomy with salpingectomy had FSH &#x0003e;45. This finding may reflect ovarian reserve has decreased regardless type of surgery. Our results are consistent with the study of Atalay <italic>et al</italic>. that presented elevated levels of FSH and LH within 6 months after surgery[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but is inconsistent with the study of Song <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>FSH and LH changes neither in Group H, nor in the other group were not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.17, 0.166 for FSH and LH, respectively). These results manifest that type of surgery is not in association with postsurgical ovarian function. This finding is consistent with the study of Findley <italic>et al</italic>. in which they measured AMH for ovarian function assessment and found no significant difference in postsurgical level of AMH whether in hysterectomy or H-bS.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Posthysterectomy menopause has been mentioned as one of the complications of this procedure.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the current study, three of patients showed whether signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings (FSH &#x0003e;45) of menopause that might be induced by surgery.</p><p>Postsurgical FSH and LH levels were not in association with patients&#x02019; age, neither in Group H nor in Group H-bS. Other study has reported similar result for patients&#x02019; undergone hysterectomy that found no correlation between patients&#x02019; age underwent hysterectomy and level of markers showing ovarian function. However, this effect in hysterectomy versus hysterectomy with salpingectomy was not compared.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Atalay <italic>et al</italic>. reported the same results among patients &#x0003e;40 years versus &#x0003c;40 years undergone total abdominal hysterectomy-bilateral salpingectomy or laparoscopic hysterectomy-bilateral salpingectomy.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The most LH and FSH change occurred among patients &#x02265;51 years that may be due to low number of patients in this group or being near to their menopause.</p><p>Both FSH and LH increase were positively affected by age and also BMI. LH relation with age and BMI was not statistically significant, but FSH was, although this significance is probably affected with low number of sample. These findings are presenting a need for more considerations in limited ages or BMIs in further studies.</p><p>In summary, H-bS has some advantages in comparison with tube preservation and based on our study, resection of tubes during hysterectomy had not significantly posed menopausal status.</p><p>Furthermore, there was no difference in various ages and BMIs. Thus, hysterectomy with salpingectomy is recommended in order of reducing complications and also the risk of serous ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the current study, it seems that bilateral salpingectomy during hysterectomy with the aim of ovarian cancer prevention would not increase risk of ovarian dysfunction.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Higher number of participants can improve validity of further studies.
