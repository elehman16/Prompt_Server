We assessed effects of deworming on physical fitness and strength of children in an area in Yunnan, People's Republic of China, where soil-transmitted helminthiasis is highly endemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between October 2011 and May 2012. Children, aged 9&#x02013;12 years, were treated with either triple-dose albendazole or placebo, and monitored for 6 months post-treatment. The Kato-Katz and Baermann techniques were used for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infections. Physical fitness was assessed with a 20-m shuttle run test, where the maximum aerobic capacity within 1 min of exhaustive exercise (VO<sub>2</sub> max estimate) and the number of 20-m laps completed were recorded. Physical strength was determined with grip strength and standing broad jump tests. Body height and weight, the sum of skinfolds, and hemoglobin levels were recorded as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Children receiving triple-dose albendazole scored slightly higher in the primary and secondary outcomes than placebo recipients, but the difference lacked statistical significance. <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic>-infected children had 1.6 ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) less increase in their VO<sub>2</sub> max estimate and completed 4.6 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04) fewer 20-m laps than at baseline compared to non-infected peers.

However, the assessment of the burden due to intestinal worms is difficult, and thus, the benefits of deworming are unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of deworming on the physical fitness and strength of 9- to 12-year-old children in Yunnan, China, where intestinal worms are common. Children were treated with triple-dose albendazole or placebo and monitored over a 6-month period. Stool samples were collected for the diagnosis of intestinal worm infections. Physical fitness was estimated with a 20-m shuttle run test and physical strength was assessed with grip strength and standing broad jump tests. Children receiving triple-dose albendazole scored slightly higher values in the primary and secondary outcomes than those children who were given placebo. However, the differences were not significant. We also found that children infected with intestinal worms performed significantly worse in the physical fitness and strength tests than their non-infected counterparts. In particular, the negative impact of whipworm infection on physical fitness warrants further investigation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study received financial support from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, Switzerland and the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center of Diseases Control and Prevention in Shanghai, P.R.

Infections are largely chronic and usually asymptomatic, and hence the study and quantification of the morbidity associated with soil-transmitted helminth infections are difficult, and only few studies have ventured to do so. In particular, no conclusive evidence has yet been established whether reduced physical fitness or strength are a consequence of soil-transmitted helminth infections. Physical fitness has been positively correlated with academic performance through enhanced memory and attention <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Niederer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while physical strength is demanded in labor-intensive agriculture jobs, which often provide the main source of income in rural communities of the developing world <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Fenwick1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A lack in both attributes due to soil-transmitted helminthiasis could arguably prevent school-aged children living in impoverished conditions from realizing their full potential and perpetuate their entrapment in the vicious cycle of poverty and poor health <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Hotez3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Based on the rationale that lowering infection intensity would help to control morbidity associated with chronic helminth infection, and that morbidity is infection intensity-dependent, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates periodic deworming of at-risk populations (e.g., school-aged children and pregnant women) with single-dose albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg) <xref rid="pntd.0002983-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Keiser1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

The study was conducted in a highly endemic area in the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) and assessed the effects of triple-dose albendazole on physical fitness and strength of initially soil-transmitted helminth-infected children.

Each child had two tries (with a 15-sec rest in between), but only the maximum reading was recorded, to the nearest 0.1 kg. For the standing broad jump test, each child, standing behind a straight line, had two tries (with a 15-sec rest in between) to jump as far forward as possible with both legs. The jumps were recorded to the nearest 1 cm and the longer jump considered for an individual. The distance of the jump was measured from the starting line to the heel of the most back foot.</p><p>For the measurement of body height and weight, children were asked to take off their shoes and sweater before standing on a digital weighing scale (Model RCS-150; Nantong Xineng Ltd., Jiangsu, P.R.

In a sub-analysis, changes in the means of physical fitness and strength indicators between baseline and follow-up were compared among children of distinct soil-transmitted helminth infection status regardless of treatment status. To further explore the effect of infection intensity on these measurements, distinct groups of children were identified using principal component and cluster analysis, based on species-specific soil-transmitted helminth log transformed egg counts at baseline and at the 1- and 4-month follow-ups. Changes in the means of physical fitness and strength indicators between baseline and follow-up were compared among six biologically meaningful groups of varying soil-transmitted helminth infection intensity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002983-g001">Figure 1</xref>, an overall compliance of 92% was achieved with only nine children lost to follow-up over the 6-month trial period.

For example, in the current randomized controlled trial, we found baseline prevalence of <italic>T. trichiura</italic>, <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, and hookworm at 94.5%, 93.3%, and 61.3%, respectively. Therefore, an intensive de-worming regimen, consisting of triple-dose albendazole <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Yap2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Steinmann3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, was employed to allow children a fair chance of developing their physical fitness unaffected by intestinal helminth infections. Re-infection with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> occurred more rapidly than expected and the prevalence of <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> reached 80% of the pre-treatment prevalence 4 months after treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Yap2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Despite triple-dose albendazole treatment, a low cure rate of 19.6% was obtained against <italic>T. trichiura</italic>, corroborating previous conclusions that <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infection is particularly hard to cure with current anthelmintic drugs <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Keiser1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Knopp1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002983-Speich1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Such re-infection dynamics have complicated the evaluation of the potential health benefits of deworming and rendered the grouping of the children according to intervention near-irrelevant as the treated children might not have benefited from a meaningful helminth-free period for substantial catch-up growth. This finding further suggests that in our study area, the current WHO recommendation of single-dose albendazole (400 mg) twice yearly <xref rid="pntd.0002983-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> might be insufficient for controlling soil-transmitted helminthiasis.</p><p>In a recently published trial conducted in India <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, where 1 million preschool-aged children, 1 to 6 years old at baseline, were treated with albendazole every 6 months for 5 years, no statistically significant difference in anthropometric measurements was detected between the albendazole and control groups. In our study, even though a trend toward higher values was observed for the treated cohort, no statistically significant difference in most primary and secondary outcomes between the albendazole and placebo groups was detected during the 6-month follow-up period. However, we did find one statistically significant, and biologically important, difference in the VO<sub>2</sub> max estimate at 1-month follow-up between the albendazole and placebo groups despite the relatively small sample size. It is interesting to note the variation in hemoglobin levels for both groups throughout the follow-up period and this could probably be due to seasonal dietary changes or the presence of other infections. In addition, we observed a general learning effect with the physical fitness and strength tests, especially the 20-m shuttle run test, amongst the children, but this was mitigated in the analysis by having a control group.</p><p>In the sub-group analysis, we found that soil-transmitted helminth-infected children had performed significantly worse in the physical fitness and strength tests than their non-infected peers. When we grouped children according to their infection status at each follow-up, we observed that <italic>T. trichiura</italic>-infected children performed worse in the 20-m shuttle run than their non-infected peers. This confirmed the results from a cross-sectional study conducted by our group where <italic>T. trichiura</italic>-infected children were found to complete, on average, 6.1 20-m laps less and have a VO<sub>2</sub> max estimate which was 1.9 ml kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lower than their non-infected counterparts <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. To survive in a host, adult <italic>T. trichiura</italic> worms anchor their whip-like anterior end into the wall of the large intestine and caecum by secreting pore-forming proteins. Such an invasive mechanism causes inflammation and bleeding, resulting in abdominal pain in the short term, and anemia and rectal prolapse in the long term, especially when large numbers of worms are present <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A significant change in physical fitness already at the 1-month follow-up could indicate that removing abdominal pain alone through the expulsion of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> might enhance the host's endurance in exhaustive exercises, such as the 20-m shuttle run. Hookworm-infected children were also found to have a significantly lower increase from baseline in their VO<sub>2</sub> max estimates than children not infected with hookworm at the 6-month follow-up. Although anemia is a known symptom of hookworm infection and would be a plausible cause for reduced VO<sub>2</sub> max estimates <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Bustinduy1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, it was detected in only 10.7% of the hookworm-infected children and no significant association was found between any soil-transmitted helminth infection and hemoglobin level. The migration of the hookworm larvae through the pulmonary blood vessels, where they bore into the alveoli, could offer an alternative explanation to this observation. Although the larvae of <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> undergo a similar migratory process <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, no reduction in VO<sub>2</sub> max estimates was observed in children infected with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>. In terms of grip strength, the increase from baseline among <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>-infected children was significantly lower, while hookworm-infected children had a higher increase from baseline, when compared to their non-infected peers. As there is currently limited evidence on the association of soil-transmitted helminth infection and grip strength, these inconsistent findings warrant further investigation.</p><p>When children were grouped according to infection intensity, we were able to take into consideration the degree of infection at baseline, 1-month, and 4-month follow-ups, and the extent of multiparasitism for each child. These analyses revealed that individuals with a combination of no or minimal <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and hookworm re-infection achieved higher improvements during the follow-ups in the 20-m shuttle run, as compared to peers with high infection intensity of all species. In addition, children with no or minimal <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and hookworm re-infection performed better in the standing broad jump than their counterparts with high infection intensity of all species. These findings provide further evidence of the impact of soil-transmitted helminth infections on the physical fitness and strength of school-aged children.</p><p>The anthropometric and physical strength findings from this trial should be viewed in the light of the following limitations. A follow-up period of 6 months is probably too short for an accurate evaluation of anthropometric gains and physical strength increments from longer-term physical growth due to deworming. Taking into account that keeping controls untreated for a long period would be difficult due to ethical considerations, a 3- to 5-year prospective cohort study, where children are treated regularly to ensure that they are helminth-free, and the changes in anthropometric indicators and physical strength from baseline are monitored and compared with changes in soil-transmitted helminth infection intensity over time, could be a more appropriate study design. Finally, catch-up growth after anthelmintic treatment can only occur if the diet is sufficient <xref rid="pntd.0002983-Hall2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Based on the investigators' observations in the field, most of the children's diet consists mainly of white rice with little protein sources. Dietary improvements, in addition to deworming, are therefore necessary in the current setting for catch-up growth to occur and perhaps to aid in the absorption of albendazole, and should be considered in future, more comprehensive studies.</p><p>We conclude that there is no strong evidence for significant improvements in physical fitness and anthropometric indicators due to deworming with triple-dose albendazole. This might be partly explained by the rapid re-infection observed with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and low cure rates with <italic>T. trichiura</italic>. However, negative impacts on the physical fitness and strength were observed in school-aged children infected with soil-transmitted helminths in sub-group analyses. In particular, the clear effects of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infection on physical fitness in this trial is intriguing as the public health burden of this helminth species is currently not as well defined as that of the other two species. The fact that <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infection had the strongest negative impact on the physical fitness of the children but was hardly cured with triple-dose albendazole is another major concern. Finally, we also showed that the observed morbidities were infection intensity-dependent and in order to control them, regular deworming, coupled with dietary improvements and water, sanitation, and hygiene development, should be considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002983.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
