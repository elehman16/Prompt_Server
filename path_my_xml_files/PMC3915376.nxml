These drawbacks taken into consideration by many investigators and include its granular consistency,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] slow setting time,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and porosity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In addition, the sealing ability of MTA in low pH environment has been questioned. In an acidic environment, the sealing properties of MTA might be compromised due to a decrease in surface hardness[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which can cause lower push-out bond strength.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have reported on attempts to modify this Portland cement to improve on its shortcomings. Bioaggregate (BA) is one calcium silicate&#x02013;based material that has been reported as a modified version of MTA.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It is composed of tricalcium silicate (C3S), dicalcium silicate (C2S), calcium phosphate monobasic, and amorphous silicon dioxide with the addition of tantalum pentoxide, instead of bismuth oxide in MTA for radiopacity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This newly introduced cement is aluminium free and displays biocompatibility similar to WMTA.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, dislodgment resistance of BA in low pH compared with WMTA has been discussed by others.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A new version of MTA was prepared by reducing the size of particles and adding small amounts of zeolite and strontium.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This cement was claimed to overcome some limitations of the original MTA, such as long setting time and decreased resistance to solubility in low pH environments.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The main ingredients of WMTA, nano WMTA, and BA are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Forty-eight moulds were cleaned with acetone in an ultrasound bath for 15 min. All moulds were weighed three times before use (accuracy, 0.0001 g) on a Mettler AE-163 (Mettler Toledo) balance, which was used throughout the experiment. The moulds were divided into three groups of A, B, and C (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Each group contained 15 moulds and an empty mould was used as control. Every experimental group was subdivided into three subgroups: 1, 2, and 3; each with 5 moulds. The moulds were placed on a glass plate in order to be filled to slight excess with the mixed materials. The first subgroups of each group (A1, B1, and C1) were filled with WMTA, while the second subgroups (A2, B2, and C2) were filled with BA, and the third subgroups (A3, B3, and C3) were filled with nano WMTA. Each material was mixed and placed according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.</p><p>In group A, samples in each subgroup were wrapped with gauze soaked in butyric acid buffered with synthetic tissue fluid (STF) at pH 4.4. In groups B and C specimens were wrapped with gauze soaked in STF buffered in potassium hydroxide at pH of 7.4 and 10.4, respectively, for 24 h. Following exposure to the acidic STF, the weight of specimens was recorded to determine the amount of solubility. Loss of cement was identified by the decline in mass of specimens stored in deionized water. The weight of particles detached from the cement during the experiment was also recorded according to the ISO 6876. The plates with filled mould were weighed and 60 mL of distilled water (pH = 7.1, 37&#x000b0;C) was spread with a Luer-Lock syringe over the plate so that the lower and upper surfaces of the cement were completely covered with water (100% relative humidity). The sets were placed in an oven at 37&#x000b0;C from which they were retrieved at the indicated time intervals. Fifteen moulds were used for each experimental group and studied for up to 28 days. The moulds were hung over a Petri dish and both sides were gently rinsed with distilled water to collect the residues.</p><p>Samples were dried in desiccators and the moulds were weighed after 28 days. An industrial microwave vacuum drying system (Yantai Care Microwave System, China) was used to eliminate all free water trapped in the cement tablets to establish a consistent net weight. The initial amounts of cement inside the moulds were determined by subtracting the weight of the mould-Petri dish from the weight of the filled mould-Petri dish. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc statistical tests were used to detect any statistically significant differences among the groups/subgroups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The means &#x000b1; standard deviations (SDs) of the cement loss of the experimental groups were as follows:</p><p>

It is obvious that WMTA might undergo structural changes in the presence of low pH resulting in altered sealing ability.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>BA is another modification of MTA, which is composed of C3S, C2S, calcium phosphate monobasic, amorphous silicon dioxide, and tantalum pentoxide for radiopacity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The manufacturers indicate that C-S-H and CH are formed during the hydration phase, while in the presence of amorphous silicon dioxide the CH byproduct further reacts to form C-S-H. This reaction results in lower amount of CH in BA after setting.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Grattan-Bellew <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that CH can be responsible for the weakness of the mixed cement and others indicated that more resistance to an acidic environment may be enhanced by reducing the amount of CH in BA.</p><p>In the current study, moulds filled with BA after exposure to different pH showed more solubility especially at pH 4.4 compared to WMTA and nano WMTA, which is found on literature as the same results achieved by evaluating the displacement property.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Previous studies indicated that BA initially is not affected by acidic environment and its dislodgement resistance is higher than WMTA. However after 34 days, WMTA showed significantly higher bond strength than BA.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This issue was also observed in the present study, where after 28 days the cement loss in WMTA was lower than BA. To explain this, we should note that MTA undergoes a hydration phase which can promote the strength and retention characteristics of this cement. Thus, this nanomodification of MTA has superior property to form hydroxyapatite crystals.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>A new version of MTA, nano WMTA was introduced by Saghiri <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and they claimed that by modifying the size of the constituents of WMTA, the surface area of the powder might be increased. In addition, reducing the size of particles and their uniform distribution within the product is reported to play an important role in shortening the setting time and increasing the microhardness even at low pH [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The present study evaluated the solubility of this new root-end filling material exposed to different pH compared to WMTA and BA. The results of this investigation showed that nano WMTA had less solubility than WMTA in low pH. This finding may be explained by the characteristics of nano WMTA particle form, size, and different composition of this new cement. As indicated above, the uniform distribution of particles, and the increased surface area observed in nano WMTA, results in less porosity and better interlocking of particles in the set nano WMTA and reduced solubility of this cement in long-term.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of particles and reaction of cements before and after hydration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-17-13-g003"/></fig><p>Nano WMTA contains additive ingredients except from basic materials found in other two cements.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These substances are as follows: Tricalcium aluminate, calcium sulfate, zeolite, and strontium carbonate. Tricalcium aluminate in Portland cement causes an &#x0201c;interstitial phase&#x0201d; which is beneficial due to facilitating the formation of the desired silicate phases. It reacts most strongly with water of all the calcium aluminates, and it is also the most reactive component of the Portland clinker phases. Its hydration to phases of the form Ca<sub>2</sub>AlO<sub>3</sub>(OH)&#x00387;nH<sub>2</sub>O leads to the phenomenon of &#x0201c;flash set&#x0201d; (instantaneous set). Due to this advantage, it was reported that tricalcium aluminate is associated with adverse effects that can reduce the durability of concrete by following effects:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Heat release: A large amount of heat is generated during the phenomenon of &#x0201c;flash set&#x0201d; which can cause spontaneous overheating in large masses of concrete. In order to overcome this negative effect first, tricalcium aluminate levels are reduced and secondly small amount of calcium sulfate (typically 4-8%) is added to the cement. Sulfate ions in solution form an insoluble layer of ettringite (3CaO&#x00387;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x00387;3CaSO<sub>4</sub>&#x00387;32H<sub>2</sub>O) on the surface of the aluminate crystals, passivize them and slightly contribute to the strength of the cement[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sulfate attack: The elimination of the sulfate corrosion may be ensured by using low tricalcium sulfate content cement or by adding zeolite to the cement. Zeolite is composed of crystalline hydrated aluminosilicate of alkaline metals and metals of alkaline soils (Ca, K, Na, Mg).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Adding zeolite could decrease the volume of tricalcium aluminate in the cement. Authors have indicated that zeolite, beside anticorrosive action against sulfate, can be regarded as a stabilizing agent for cements. Previously done study[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] also confirmed that zeolitic cement can replace Portland cement in many applications with the advantage of higher resistance to acidic and sulfate attack, which could reduce the solubility of the applied cement. These findings confirmed the results of the present study where it was shown that Nano WMTA containing zeolite had better acidic resistance in comparison with BA or WMTA.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>According to the recent patent, the amount of zeolite in nano WMTA is 2% in order to prevent its adverse effect on the compressive strength of cement.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, others acclaimed that the benefits of adding zeolite in durability of the cement far outweigh the slow rate of strength development at early age, or a modest strength reduction of 20-30%.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to this comparative investigation, the authors have concluded that:</p><p>
