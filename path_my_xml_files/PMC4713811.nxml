exercise and resistance exercise in improving the on the static balancing ability by
applying them to patients with scoliosis and to compare the effects of the interventions.
[Subjects] Forty scoliosis patients were divided into a Swiss ball exercise group (SEG, N
= 20) and a Resistance exercise group (REG, N = 20) randomly. [Methods] SEG conducted
chest stretching, trunk exercise using the Swiss ball. REG conducted chest stretching,
trunk exercise with therapist&#x02019;s resistance. Both groups received training 30&#x02005;min per day,
five times per week, for eight weeks. [Results] Both SEG and REG showed significant
differences between pre- and post-mediation in terms of weight distribution, sway area,
sway length, sway speed, and limit of stability. Sway speed and limit of stability had
increased more significantly in REG than in SEG. [Conclusion] According to the result of
this study, both Swiss ball exercise and chest Resistance exercise were effective for
improving on the static balancing ability. But we suggest resistance exercise is more
efficient to increase of sway speed, limit of stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Swiss ball exercise</kwd><kwd>Resistance exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The term scoliosis was first used by Galen (AD 131&#x02013;201)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and is defined as one or more than two spines lean laterally and
placed on the side or rotate. Bunnell<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>
defined the structural change of Cobb angle over 10 degrees as idiopathic scoliosis. In
addition, it is accompanied by coronal deformity in which the spine curves or deviates
laterally from anatomical center with rotated centrum deformation. Moreover, the spine loses
its normal curve on the sagittal plane, leading to three-dimensional deformity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Scoliosis is accompanied by the following symptoms: tilted head caused by unbalanced hip
joint and distorted trunk, unbalanced neck line due to tilted trunk, and scapular winging.
Moreover, it can cause disparity of pelvis and shoulder height as well as in length of legs.
Severe scoliosis can cause decreased muscle strength and flexibility as well as muscle
rigidity and pain, so that a patient may experience fatigue when sitting or standing for a
long time, and cardiopulmonary function may decrease. Scoliosis may also cause problems in
external appearance, resulting in psychological and social problems<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spinal deformation changes the characteristics of muscles around the spine and decreases
the number of muscle spindles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As well as
altering normal posture alignment, which in turn changes the shape of the trunk, it also
changes interactions between body segments, causing standing instability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Guo et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients exhibit a
different postural sway as compared to the norm, which is why balance should be considered
at an early stage when diagnosing scoliosis. Their findings indicated that understanding a
patient&#x02019;s postural sway characteristics can help with prevention and treatment of
scoliosis.</p><p>There have recently been an increasing number of reports on postural balancing in standing
position of idiopathic scoliosis patients. Scoliosis patients show a much greater trunk sway
area, as well as more sway, surging, and sway radius<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study comparing standing position balancing ability of
scoliosis and normal patients, trunk sway among scoliosis patients was 44% bigger than
normal; average trunk surging among scoliosis patients was set back by 1.2&#x02005;cm as compared to
normal, with instability in standing position<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Scoliosis can be treated using both surgical and non-surgical methods. The surgical method
is effective in aligning the spine, but it is not an efficient way of addressing the
patient&#x02019;s posture and movement when the cost of surgery is taken into account. One widely
used non-surgical method is active exercise treatment, which allows continuous muscle
contraction and improves efficiency of movement. For these reasons, the exercise program is
the most accessible and preferred method of treatment. The exercise method includes postural
exercise, stretching, muscle strengthening exercises, respiratory training, and muscle
strength imbalance correction exercises. These exercises improve spinal flexibility,
strengthen muscles around spine, and correct muscle imbalance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various exercise programs have previously been studied and their
effects reported<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. For such programs,
equipment such as the Swiss ball and the sling are quite often used. However, few studies
have compared exercise programs and active exercise programs in terms of their use of
equipment, how well they stimulate muscle contraction, and whether they are effective in
improving scoliosis patients&#x02019; balancing ability. For that reason, the present study
investigates the effect of Swiss ball exercise and resistance exercise on the static
balancing ability of scoliosis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were outpatients at N Hospital in Daegu who had been diagnosed
with scoliosis and agreed to participate in the study. From 57 scoliosis patients&#x02019; chest and
waist X-ray results, 43 patients were identified with between 10 and 20 degrees of Cobb&#x02019;s.
Of these, 40 patients who were willing to participate and met the study requirements took
part in the experiment. The inclusion criteria were absence of any special lung diseases
before scoliosis, no congenital chest deformation or rib fracture, and the ability to sit
independently. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided their
written informed consent prior to their participation in the study, in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The participants (N = 40) were randomly divided into the Swiss Ball Exercise Group (SEG, n
= 20) and the Resistance Exercise Group (REG, n = 20). Both groups completed 30 minutes of
exercise each day, 5 times a week for 8 weeks.</p><p>The SEG performed a warm-up, stretching, main exercise, and cool-down exercises as
described previously by Kim and Yang<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Chest and waist stretching were performed for 5 minutes each, focusing on stretching the
concave side. Stretching was conducted in two positions. First, the patient lay on one side
to perform stretching. Next, they dropped to their knees while holding a Swiss ball, bent
their waist, and turned in the opposite direction from the convex side. They maintained the
stretching position for 10 seconds each time. Main exercises were performed for 20 minutes.
The patient put both hands on their head, lay on a Swiss ball on the opposite side of the
superior convex side, and twisted their trunk toward the opposite side. Next, they sat on a
ball, put their hands on their pelvis, placed both feet on the ground, and bounced using the
elasticity of the ball. Patients put both legs on the ball, supporting themselves on the
ground using their hands, and moved their legs and the ball from side to side. In the
side-lying-on-elbow position, the patient supported themselves with one hand on the ground
and pushed a ball using the other hand, stretching their trunk. Thoracic resistance exercise
was performed for 10 minutes. The patient lay on one side, and the therapist placed their
hands on the part of the patient&#x02019;s chest on which they wished to focus. In synchrony with
the patient&#x02019;s respiration rhythm, the therapist exerted pressure while tracing an arc along
the costal line in a downward and inward direction. The diaphragm movement was facilitated
by a therapist. The therapist directly facilitated the diaphragm using their thumb or other
fingers to push below the thorax upward and outward. Resistance was provided to the
contracting diaphragm&#x02019;s movement, downwards and stretching. For indirect facilitation, the
therapist placed both hands on the abdomen and applied light pressure toward the upper side
while the patient inhaled.</p><p>Meanwhile, the REG performed stretching, main exercises, and cool-down as described
previously by Rhim et al<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. All exercises
were performed under a therapist&#x02019;s guidance.</p><p>Chest stretching and waist stretching were performed for 5 minutes each. The patient lay on
their side with the convex side of chest and waist below, with a thick towel at the apex of
the curve. The waist remained in contact with the ground, and the patient held their arms up
to stretch. The stretching position was maintained for 10 seconds and repeated 15 times.
Next, main exercises were performed for 15 minutes.</p><p>In the supine position, the patient bent both legs such that they could pull them toward
the chest. The therapist held the patient&#x02019;s knees to provide resistance, enabling the
patient&#x02019;s abdominal muscles to be fully stimulated. In the hook lying position, patients
performed a bridge exercise designed to lift the hips. The therapist held the patient&#x02019;s
pelvis and induced posterior tilt to provide resistance. In the side-lying position, the
patient raised their leg on the upper side. The therapist held the femoral region, providing
resistance as the patient moved and stimulating movement. In a sitting position, the patient
bent the knee on the waist on the concave side to 90&#x000b0;, and the therapist provided resistance
to raise the leg. Thoracic resistance exercise was performed for 10 minutes. The patient lay
on one side, and the therapist placed their hands on the part of the patient&#x02019;s chest they
wished to focus. In synchrony with the patient&#x02019;s respiration rhythm, the therapist exerted
pressure while tracing an arc along the costal line in a downward and inward direction. The
diaphragm movement was facilitated by a therapist. The therapist directly facilitated the
diaphragm using his thumb or other fingers to push below the thorax in an upward and outward
direction. Downward resistance was provided to the contracting diaphragm&#x02019;s movement to
induce stretching. For indirect facilitation, the therapist placed both hands on the abdomen
and applied light pressure toward the upper side while the patient inhaled.</p><p>All participants underwent preliminary evaluation before the exercise program and were
evaluated again after 8 weeks. For measurement of balance ability, a biofeedback analysis
system (AP1153 Biorescue, France) was used to determine center of gravity (COG) and limit of
stability in a static standing position.</p><p>Subjects&#x02019; general characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A paired
t-test was used to assess any difference between pre- and post-experiment. Independent
sample t-testing was used to assess any difference between the two groups. Significance
level was set at p&#x0003c; 0.05. SPSS v. 12.0 was used for statistical analysis of the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference in general characteristics was found between SEG and REG (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of subjects (M&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEG (n=20)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">REG (n=20)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.39&#x000b1;1.15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.78&#x000b1;1.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.88&#x000b1;8.54</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.38&#x000b1;7.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.68&#x000b1;10.77</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.66&#x000b1;6.03</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>M&#x000b1;SD: mean&#x000b1;standard deviation, SEG: Swiss ball exercise group, REG: Resistance

rotation and departs from the vertical line. It is generally related to rotation of spine.
When the vertebral angle is at least 10 degrees or more on the front back radiography, it is
defined as scoliosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many
causes of scoliosis, and the curve appears to be a secondary cause. Deformation of the spine
and asymmetry of the chest wall and back generally appear in similar manner. Scoliosis is
identified by the patient, their parents, by school examination programs or by orthopedics.
According to earlier studies, secondary problems can occur when scoliosis accompanies muscle
strength imbalance and abnormal posture, requiring patients to actively participate in
voluntary exercise programs.</p><p>There are many treatments and methods of mediation for scoliosis. The various treatment
methods include therapeutic exercise, orthosis, electrical stimulation, manual therapy,
physical therapy, and foot adjusters. Some of these are not adequate as treatments; for
example, electrical stimulation is not effective in stopping curve increase or turning the
curve to the opposite side. However, exercise-based treatment has attracted increasing
interest in the literature and there is some evidence of its effectiveness.</p><p>The present study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of Swiss ball exercise and
resistance exercise on scoliosis patients&#x02019; balancing ability, and to compare the effects of
the two exercise programs.</p><p>To check balancing ability, the study measured weight distribution difference, sway area,
sway length, sway speed, and limit of stability. Shin and Song<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted research with 20 idiopathic scoliosis patients
on balancing while standing. The subjects performed a waist stabilization exercise for 40
minutes, 3 times a week for 3 weeks. When pre- and post- treatment performance was compared,
improved balancing ability was reported, due to decreased sway length and sway speed. Gong
Won Tae et al<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted research on 20
normal people balancing while standing. The subjects performed waist stabilization exercises
for 30 minutes, 3 times a week for 3 weeks. When they compared the experimental group with
the control group (who did not perform the exercise), the experimental group showed a
significant increase in balancing ability. Park<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> employed a sling with scoliosis patients performing a waist
stabilization exercise. The subjects showed significantly decreased sway and surging, both
with eyes opened and eyes closed. Lim<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
conducted 12 weeks of lower limb-strengthening training and gait pattern training with
female scoliosis patients who were high school students. In her study, plantar pressure
difference between left and right as well as body balancing ability improved significantly
after training.</p><p>In the present study, SEG and REG both showed significant improvement in weight
distribution difference, sway area, sway length, sway speed, and limit of stability after
the exercise program, which is similar to results from preceding studies.</p><p>Improved balancing ability indices after the Swiss ball exercise seem to be the result of
improved adaptability in unstable posture, as the Swiss ball exercise is conducted on a
dilatational ball. These findings are also in line with Creager&#x02019;s<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> study, which reported that Swiss ball exercise is
effective in developing muscle strength around the waist, increasing waist flexibility and
improving coordination, and stimulating proprioceptors and the cardiovascular system.</p><p>In the present case, balancing ability indices were found to have improved after the
resistance exercise. This seems to be explained by improved trunk stability and symmetric
development supported by strengthened muscles around the spine. Shortened muscles were
stretched and weakened muscles provided with resistance were strengthened by means of muscle
strengthening exercises.</p><p>In addition, the study results show that sway speed and limit of stability significantly
improved in REG as compared to SEG. It seems that application of direct resistance by the
therapist may have been more effective for symmetric development of muscles around the spine
and for trunk stability.</p><p>Future studies should be conducted with more patients and over a longer period of time. In
addition, it will be necessary to evaluate the level of improvement of muscle strength
related to trunk stability, as well as the effect on muscle activity. It will also be
important to establish how long the effects of exercise last.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that Swiss ball exercise and resistance exercise can
both improve scoliosis patients&#x02019; balancing ability. Although resistance exercise was found
to be the more effective method, both Swiss ball exercise and resistance exercise are
considered to be effective mediation methods for improving scoliosis patients&#x02019; balancing
ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradford</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: Moe&#x02019;s Textbook of scoliosis and other spinal deformities.
