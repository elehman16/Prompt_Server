It can also result in the disturbance of behavioral or emotional functioning. These impairments may be either temporary or permanent and cause partial or total disability or psychosocial maladjustment. To the World Health Organization,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] TBI is a public health issue because it is one of the largest causes of brain injury, resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, with modern medicine and the progress of techniques for acute treatment of TBI victims, their survival rate is increasing. Consequently, the number of patients who survive with physical and cognitive impairment is growing.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Whiteneck <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that approximately 65% of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI report long-term problems with cognitive functioning. Cognitive deficits can impact an individual's ability to perform usual roles at work or homes and thus lead to disability. Selassie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that about 43% of moderate-to-severe TBI patients experience disability in long term, characterized by functional limitations, postinjury symptoms of limit activities, cognitive complaints, and/or mental health problems. In long run, TBI-related cognitive deficits can impair a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) such as driving, meal preparation, and handling money. Although TBI can cause sensory and motor deficits, cognitive and behavioral changes persist for long term.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In general, cognitive deficits, rather than any residual physical impairment <italic>per se</italic>, contribute most to the disruption of meaningful life activities for people with TBI.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Deficit in problem-solving has been identified as a significant obstacle to the community integration of TBI survivors.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Intact problem-solving abilities are necessary to maintain a home, function in the community, or return to work;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] therefore, deficits in such abilities may prevent individuals with TBI from returning to productive personal and vocational lives.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, in rehabilitation process of patients with TBI, the ultimate aim is their community integration. However, successful community integration is underpinned by the quality, uptake, and success of rehabilitation interventions addressing specific life skills (i.e., memory, communication, and motor and social functioning) that assist individuals to regain participation in the society.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>To achieve this, neuropsychological rehabilitation (NR) can be a solution and this can be best achieved through a comprehensive/holistic approach to the treatment of cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments and disability. Evidence exists that holistic/integrated rehabilitation that includes both individualized cognitive and psychosocial interpersonal therapies produces the greatest overall improvements in functioning by persons with TBI.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This study was thus targeted to rehabilitate neuropsychological deficits of patients with TBI and to see its impact on ADL and community reintegration. Few studies of comprehensive integrated TBI rehabilitation have assessed treatment effectiveness at the level of community integration and social participation. Sander <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] using the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), evaluated treatment effects for 24 persons with TBI who were admitted for comprehensive integrated, postacute rehabilitation (including neuropsychological rehabilitation) within 8 months of injury. They found significant improvements after an average of 4 months of treatment on the CIQ total score and on the three subscales measuring home integration, social integration, and productivity. A subsequent analysis of 71 persons with TBI who participated in this program again showed significant improvements on all of the CIQ subscales. The analysis of clinically significant change for individual participants indicated that 46% of the total sample improved on total CIQ scores from pre- to posttreatment, 49% did not make significant change, and 4% showed clinically significant worsening. Thus, the study aims to investigate the impact of neuropsychological rehabilitation on ADL and community reintegration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample</title><p>Based on a purposive sampling technique, ten right-handed patients with open/closed head injury, aged 20&#x02013;40 years, of either sex, with a significant neuropsychological deficit and with a minimum gap of 1 year after injury, having as a minimum secondary education and with English as the medium of instruction, were chosen from All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH), Mysuru, India.

However, in posttest, it was found that after intervention, there was significant integration of patients back to their community, i.e., their home, society, and work. In contrast, there was no improvement found in control group after 6 months of gap as suggested by their mean rank.</p><table-wrap id="T12" position="float"><label>Table 12</label><caption><p>Within-group comparison of traumatic brain injury survivors on Cognitive Symptoms Checklist</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPsy-60-38-g012"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The study reveals that there were major neuropsychological deficits in patients with TBI as deciphered through LNNB-A [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>]. Major deficits have been found in various scales such as motor, visual, expressive speech, writing, reading, memory, arithmetic, and intelligence scales, and also significant deficits have been seen in various factor scales such as fine motor speed, visual acuity and naming, visual spatial organization, reading complex material and spelling, verbal memory, complex and visual memory, and simple and complex arithmetic. The association between neuropsychological deficits and ADL is clearly visible through the results of CSC. Though cognitive deficits are a sort of invisible injury, their impact is clear in day-to-day skills. The results of the study reveal that patients with TBI have difficulty in daily skills which require cognitive competence. In consistent to the above findings, Kaplan and Corrigan[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have also found cognitive functions and motivation as strong predictors of functional outcome in terms of ADL. Kathleen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that cognitive impairment can result in significant impairment in all aspects of clients&#x02019; life, i.e., self-care, independent living skills, work, leisure, and social and interpersonal skills. Researchers have reported that cognitive impairment was a major reason for dressing difficulties in patients with acquired brain injury in acute phase.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The level of orientation influences basic ADL, instrumental ADL, and social activities in acute as well as chronic patients with acquired brain injury.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In a study conducted by Mokashi[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to find correlation between cognition and ADL in patients with acquired brain injury, it was found that there was a positive correlation between cognition and ADL with significance of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T11">Table 11</xref> further reveals improvements in experimental group in various tasks of CSC; however, there was no significant improvement in control group on various tasks. Improvement in various tasks of CSC can be directly associated with NR as there was significant improvement in experimental group in various areas of LNNB-A [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">10</xref>]. These results are consistent with the findings of Ho and Bennett[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] who found that after cognitive rehabilitation there was significant improvement in cognition and functional performance as indicated by ratings on the behavioral rating scales, i.e., individuals who participated in rehabilitation treatment showed a significant improvement in their ADL and cognitive functioning on selected neuropsychological tests. Similarly, an ECRI Institute[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] evidence report evaluated the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) therapy for the treatment of mild, moderate, or severe TBI and its impact on ADL. The analysis included twenty published articles from 18 randomized controlled trials (<italic>n</italic> = 1088). It was found that adults with TBI who received comprehensive, holistic CR reported significant improvement on the measures of quality of life and ADL, compared to patients who received a less intensive form of therapy.</p><p>In contrast to the above findings, there are studies which reported noneffectiveness of NR on ADL. Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] conducted a systematic review to determine whether interventions for cognitive impairment following acquired brain injury may improve functional performance of basic and/or instrumental ADL. Four studies with 376 participants were included in the review. There was no statistical difference between groups in basic ADL performance in any of the four studies, or in instrumental ADL. It is thus evident that there exists contradictory evidence in support of effectiveness of NR in improving ADL. However, the current study supports the view that NR improves ADL of patients with TBI.</p><p>The current study also found that, after TBI, patients had difficulty in integrating back to community life [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>]. CIQ reveals that patients with TBI had maximum impairment in their productivity, i.e., work and in their social life. Home integration was also affected, but it was comparatively better than the other two areas. There were slight variations in the present result as reported by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Gontkovsky <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] they found that patients with TBI had maximum impairment in productivity followed by home integration and finally social integration. This inconsistency in finding can be the result of cultural variations. If we analyze the items of subsection home integration, it contains items which involve cooking and taking care of children; however, in Indian culture, males are not supposed to carry out these activities at home and they are more involved in social activities. Carrying out household activities is the job of females of the family. This is the reason that patients have lesser problem in integrating in their home and more problems in social integration. However, there is no doubt that TBI survivors have problems in integrating back to work. It decreases their probability of employment after injury, lengthens the timing of their return to work as full time professional, and decreases the likelihood that they will return to the same position.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] They also avoid participating in any volunteer activity. Social isolation is the next profound life change for persons with TBI; it leads to deterioration in their ability to maintain friendships/form new social relationships[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and enjoy leisure time or perform public activity such as paying the bill. The study also indicates that impairment in community integration persists years after injury. In the current study, the minimum time gap since injury was 1 year and maximum was 3 years, but all the patients had the same amount of deficit in reintegrating back to community, indicating that there is no major improvement in community reintegration in patients with TBI (when not exposed to any intervention). This is consistent with the findings of Willemse-van Son <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] they found that several domains of CIQ had shown small improvements between years 1 and 3 postinjury, but the improvements seen were transient and nonsustained at 36 months after injury. In addition, most domains never reached back to their preinjury levels.</p><p>The results of the present study also reveal that after NR there was significant improvement in community reintegration of patients with TBI [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>]. The role of NR in work-related activity is obvious as cognition is very important for any work, the person should attend the stimuli, retain the information in his/her mind, plan it, organize it, and finally execute the task. If any one of the tasks is missing, the job remains incomplete. It is justifiable to understand the role of NR in productivity subscale.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Once the person is able to work properly, it improves the self-confidence and self-esteem of the person which in turn motivates him/her to mingle and interact with people around and therefore improves social reintegration of patients with TBI. Improvement in cognition improves judgment, decision-making, and role understanding, and thus helps in home integration of patients with TBI. Improvement in community integration after comprehensive neuropsychological/cognitive rehabilitation is consistent with the study of Cicerone <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Malec.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Similarly, Sander <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] using the CIQ, evaluated treatment effects for 24 persons with TBI who were admitted for comprehensive integrated, postacute rehabilitation within 8 months of injury. They found significant improvements after an average of 4 months of treatment on the CIQ total score and on the three subscales measuring home integration, social integration, and productivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The study thus clearly indicates that neuropsychological deficits have an impact on ADL and community reintegration of patients with TBI, and NR is effective in improving neuropsychological deficits of patients with TBI which in turn improves the ADL and community reintegration of patients with TBI. It can thus be concluded that NR should be incorporated in rehabilitation goals of patients with TBI so that these patients can achieve all-round improvement, and an attempt is made to help patients to reach to their premorbid level. The study has to be, however, extended to larger sample size and maintenance effect of NR has to be evaluated. The effects of co-existing factors such as anxiety and depression were also not controlled in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
