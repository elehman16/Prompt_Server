However, despite best available therapy, symptoms of exertional dyspnoea and fatigue are commonly reported and result in a reduced capacity to perform daily activities and impaired quality of life. Exercise training has demonstrated efficacy in individuals with other respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Historically, however, exercise training has not been utilised as a form of therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension due to the perceived risk of sudden cardiac death and the theoretical possibility that exercise would lead to worsening pulmonary vascular haemodynamics and deterioration in right heart function. Now, with the advances in pharmaceutical management, determining the safety and benefits of exercise training in this population has become more relevant. Only three studies of supervised exercise training in pulmonary arterial hypertension have been published. These studies demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life, in the absence of adverse events or clinical deterioration. However, these studies have not utilised an outpatient-based, whole body exercise training program, the most common format for exercise programs within Australia. It is uncertain whether this form of training is beneficial and capable of producing sustained benefits in exercise capacity and quality of life in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Design/Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will determine whether a 12 week, outpatient-based, supervised, whole body exercise training program, followed by a home-based exercise program, is safe and improves exercise capacity and quality of life in individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This study aims to recruit 34 subjects who will be randomly allocated to the exercise group (supervised exercise training 3 times a week for 12 weeks, followed by 3 sessions per week of home exercise for 12 weeks) or the control group (usual medical care). Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will determine whether outpatient-based, whole body exercise training is beneficial and safe in individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additionally, this study will contribute to clinical practice guidelines for this patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12609000502235.aspx">ACTRN12609000502235</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterised by pathological changes in the pulmonary vasculature that cause an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) thereby restricting blood flow through the pulmonary circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To maintain blood flow, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Disease progression leads to right ventricular dysfunction and right heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The physiologic response of the pulmonary vasculature to exercise is markedly different from normal in individuals with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The pulmonary arteries and arterioles have an impaired capacity to vasodilate and distend, and the increase in cardiac output required to accommodate the metabolic requirements of exercise is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As a result, oxygen delivery to the peripheral muscles is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], contributing to the symptoms of muscle fatigue and dyspnoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Whilst the impairment in cardiac output to meet peripheral oxygen demands during exercise largely contributes to the reduction in exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], skeletal muscle dysfunction may also be implicated in the exercise limitation experienced by individuals with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated significant morphological and functional changes in skeletal musculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which may be related to the decrease in systemic oxygen transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Changes such as muscle atrophy, decreased oxidative enzymes and increased proportion of type II muscle fibres lead to the early onset of lactic acidosis and a reduced aerobic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p><p>Despite advances in pharmaceutical therapies, which have resulted in improvements in exercise capacity, haemodynamics and outcome in patients with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], exertional dyspnoea and fatigue continue to result in difficulty performing activities of daily living, lead to the avoidance of physical activity and adversely impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This inactivity and the resultant physical deconditioning are likely to further exacerbate the functional limitations associated with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Whilst there is a paucity of studies in the PAH population, the benefits of exercise training in individuals with other cardiopulmonary conditions are well established. Specifically, improvements in symptoms, exercise capacity, peripheral muscle function and HRQoL are well documented following exercise training in chronic left-sided heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], populations that both report exertional symptoms similar to PAH. These benefits have been achieved following supervised exercise training, 2 to 3 times per week for a period of 6 to 12 weeks, which comprised endurance exercise at a target intensity of between 40 and 80% of peak exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake [VO<sub>2</sub>] or maximum heart rate [HR]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In COPD, programs of 12 weeks duration have been shown to produce greater and more sustained improvements in exercise outcomes when compared to programs of shorter duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Historically, exercise training has been discouraged as a therapy for patients with PAH due to the perceived risk that exercise could lead to sudden cardiac death or worsening pulmonary vascular haemodynamics, acceleration of vascular remodelling and deterioration in right heart function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Some evidence exists to suggest that exercise training can be performed without adverse events or detriment to cardiac function or pulmonary haemodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], however, the efficacy of exercise training in PAH warrants further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To date, only three prospective studies of exercise training in PAH populations have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These studies recruited subjects with idiopathic PAH or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, who were stable on medical therapy and were in WHO functional classes II to IV. The exercise training regimen varied in these studies in terms of the frequency of sessions each week (ranging from 3 to 7), duration (7 to 15 weeks) and the exercise modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The types of exercises performed included cycle ergometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], peripheral muscle training (i.e. quadriceps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], breathing exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], upper limb exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and mental conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. All three studies demonstrated significant improvements (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in exercise tolerance as measured by an increase in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or endurance time on a cycle ergometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], one study reporting improvements in muscle strength and endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Improvements in HRQoL (SF-36 component summary scores) were also reported in one study (p &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.</p><p>The studies to date have demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], however these studies have some limitations in the application of exercise training in Australia. Uchi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] recruited subjects who had recently commenced intravenous PAH therapy and thus it is not possible to differentiate between the benefits of exercise and those attributed to the medication. The training programs have included a variety of modalities such as mental training and yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], interventions that do not form part of most cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs. Within Australia, most rehabilitation programs designed for cardiac or respiratory populations consist of whole body exercise training and take place in hospital outpatient departments or in community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This contrasts with the study by Mereles et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] in which subjects were admitted for a 3 week inpatient training program prior to performing a 12 week home exercise program. In Australia, the resources for providing inpatient exercise training to individuals who are stable on medical therapy are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The study by de Man et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] evaluated a 12 week outpatient exercise training program which comprised cycling and quadriceps training. The specificity of lower limb exercise training in this study is likely to account for the large increase in endurance cycle time and may explain the non-significant improvement in 6MWD.</p><p>To date, the studies have only reported the immediate effects of exercise training and thus it remains unknown whether the benefits are maintained following cessation of supervised training. It is also unknown whether an outpatient-based, whole body exercise training program is beneficial in patients with PAH and whether this type of program is capable of producing sustained benefits in exercise capacity and HRQoL.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the benefits of a 12 week hospital outpatient-based, individualised exercise training program involving supervised exercise sessions, followed by a 12 week home exercise program, for a cohort of subjects with PAH.</p><p>We hypothesise that:</p><p>(i) A 12 week individualised, whole body exercise training program will improve:</p><p>&#x02022; Exercise capacity (as assessed by peak VO<sub>2</sub>; anaerobic threshold; endurance time measured during the constant-workload cycle ergometry test)</p><p>&#x02022; HRQoL</p><p>(ii) Exercise training is safe and improvements in exercise capacity will be achieved without evidence of clinical worsening</p><p>(iii) An additional 12 week home exercise program will maintain or further improve the benefits gained during the 12 week, supervised, outpatient program.</p></sec><sec><title>Design/Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a prospective, single blind, randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-four subjects will be recruited from the Western Australian State Pulmonary Hypertension Service, at Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.</p><sec><title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Subjects will be included in the study if they: have a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic or familial PAH or PAH associated with connective tissue disorders, based on elevated pulmonary artery pressures measured by right heart catheterisation at rest; are in WHO functional class II or III (receiving PAH-specific pharmaceutical therapy); are medically stable and have been on PAH-specific pharmaceutical therapy for 3 months prior to enrolment into the study, and, are willing to complete the supervised and home exercise training programs.

Adverse events comprise: (i) an incident requiring a medical emergency team call (according to Royal Perth Hospital criteria); (ii) exercise-related incident requiring presentation to the Emergency Department or General Practitioner; (iii) hospital admission due to PAH or worsening right heart failure; (iv) an incident resulting in the patient ceasing exercise during class (chest pain, syncope, worsening dyspnoea despite rests, hypotension/hypertension, bradycardia/tachycardia (as measured by a polar monitor and confirmed by palpation), nausea (associated with sweating, pallor and/or tremor), vagueness, vasovagal, arrhythmia); (v) death.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes of this study will be:</p><p>(i) Peak VO<sub>2</sub>;</p><p>(ii) Anaerobic threshold;</p><p>(iii) Endurance time measured from the constant workload cycle ergometry test;</p><p>(iv) HRQoL measured using the CAMPHOR and SF 36 Version 2;</p><p>(v) The number of reported acute adverse events (i) reported during exercise training and (ii) resulting in the withdrawal of a subject from the study.</p><p>The secondary outcomes of this study will be:</p><p>(i) Ventilatory variables at isotime during the constant workload cycle ergometry test (ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide [VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>] and end tidal carbon dioxide [PetCO<sub>2</sub>] to describe gas exchange);</p><p>(ii) Change in WHO functional class;</p><p>(iii) 6MWD (measured from the best of two 6MWTs at each assessment);</p><p>(iv) Worsening clinical status (see withdrawal criteria).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Improvements in endurance time following exercise training have recently been reported in the PAH population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] reported a mean increase in endurance time, as measured from a constant workload cycle ergometer test, of 270 seconds. The constant workload tests were set at 75% of the peak workload achieved during the incremental CPET, which is consistent with our study's protocol. The mean endurance time (standard deviation) at baseline and post-training were 390 (40) and 660 (60) seconds respectively.</p><p>Conservative sample size calculations have been performed using a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, assuming that the actual distribution is a double exponential. Group sizes of 14 will achieve 91% power to detect a difference of 200 seconds between the null hypothesis that both group means are 600 seconds and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 400 seconds with estimated group standard deviations of 180 and 120 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.01.</p><p>A total of 34 subjects (17 in the exercise group and 17 controls) will be recruited to allow for 20% attrition of subjects from the per protocol analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data will be analysed using SPSS software (Version 17.0; SPSS Inc; Chi). Data that are not normally distributed will be transformed and if transformation fails to satisfy normality, non-parametric tests will be used. The primary and secondary outcomes in the exercise and control groups will be compared using two-way analysis of variance to account for group and time interactions. Statistical relationships between outcome variables will be analysed using Pearson's or Spearman's correlations as appropriate. Data will be analysed using (i) per protocol analysis and (ii) intention-to-treat analysis. Per protocol analysis will be restricted to the data from subjects who complete all assessments and for the exercise group who attend at least 75% of their exercise classes. The required number of sessions must be achieved within a period of 15 weeks for both the supervised and home exercise training programs, allowing for intercurrent illness and other factors that may impact on an individual's ability to attend sessions. The last-observation-carried-forward method will be used to impute missing data at 12 and 24 weeks for the intention-to-treat analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The Berger-Exner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] test will be carried out to determine whether selection bias has been introduced into the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the physiological, clinical and psychological changes that occur following outpatient-based, whole body exercise training in PAH. We hypothesise that exercise training will improve exercise capacity and HRQoL. Adverse events and clinical worsening will be monitored in order to address theoretical safety concerns regarding the potential deleterious effects exercise may have on the pulmonary vasculature and right heart function. Assessment of the subjects following 12 weeks of home exercise program will determine whether the subjects were able to safely maintain the benefits achieved during the supervised exercise training period. Furthermore, this study will contribute to clinical practice guidelines, which will have important implications for the future management of patients with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LG, SJ, RF, PW, DL, KG and EG designed this study protocol.
