Although ranolazine is not approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, in post hoc analyses of pivotal angina trials, ranolazine was associated with reductions in percent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increased in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and such patients also have increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), CAD-related death, and stroke (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The presence of type 2 diabetes is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with stable and unstable CAD (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, it may be desirable to have drugs that target both type 2 diabetes and CAD.</p><p>Ranolazine is a first-in-class antianginal drug with cardioprotective properties that does not affect heart rate or blood pressure (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The proposed mechanism of its anti-ischemic effects is inhibition of late sodium current due to blockade of the cardiac isoform of the sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ranolazine has been shown to be safe and effective in treating chronic angina both as monotherapy (Monotherapy Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina [MARISA] trial) and in combination with commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina [CARISA] and Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina [ERICA] trials) in subjects with established CAD, including subgroups of those with diabetes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In clinical trials in chronic angina, ranolazine treatment was associated with significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Data from the CARISA study showed that ranolazine, in a dose-dependent manner, lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub> in subjects with chronic angina and type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Data from the MERLIN-TIMI-36 study revealed that ranolazine lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub> in subjects with diabetes and reduced the incidence of newly elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub> in initially normoglycemic subjects (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In nonclinical studies, ranolazine was found to lower fasting and nonfasting glucose levels and preserve pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells in streptozotocin-treated mice and Zucker diabetic fatty rats (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). More recent data show that ranolazine inhibits glucagon secretion by blocking the Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 isoform of sodium channels in pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells, leading to glucagon- and glucose-lowering effects in animal models of diabetes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Given that increases in glucagon secretion by &#x003b1;-cells and the failure of glucagon suppression following oral glucose are well documented in type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), these data suggest a novel and plausible mechanism for ranolazine&#x02019;s putative antidiabetic properties.</p><p>Although the HbA<sub>1c</sub>-lowering effect of ranolazine has been observed in four previous clinical studies, those studies were not prospectively designed to determine the effect of ranolazine on glycemic parameters. In addition, the effect of ranolazine on HbA<sub>1c</sub> in these trials was studied in the presence of other antidiabetic medications (which were not controlled). We present the first double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ranolazine monotherapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p content-type="flushleft">The ranolazine monotherapy study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01472185) was one of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical trials conducted to investigate the effect of ranolazine on glycemic control.

Other inclusion criteria included a BMI of 25&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a fasting serum C-peptide &#x02265;0.8 ng/mL. Key exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction (MI), ACS, coronary revascularization, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 3 months, inadequately controlled hypertension (i.e., &#x0003e;160/100 mmHg), a QT interval &#x0003e;500 ms, bariatric surgery or significant weight change within 2 months, an estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003c;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and prior ranolazine treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Study Design</title><p content-type="flushleft">The study consisted of a screening period, a 14-day qualifying period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 14-day safety follow-up period. Potentially eligible subjects had to be either treatment na&#x000ef;ve or washed off of all antihyperglycemic therapy for 90 days (24 weeks for thiazolidinediones). During the qualifying period, subjects were treated with single-blind placebo, receiving one tablet twice daily. At the end of the qualifying period, subjects who were &#x02265;80% compliant with dosing and continued to meet all eligibility criteria (including HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7&#x02013;10% and FSG 130&#x02013;240 mg/dL) proceeded to randomization.</p><p>Subjects entering the treatment period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ranolazine or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02264;8 vs. &#x0003e;8% [64 mmol/mol]); enrollment of subjects with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;8% was capped at half the total enrollment. Ranolazine was started at 500 mg twice daily and then uptitrated to 1,000 mg twice daily after 7 days. Subjects taking placebo were given matching tablets during treatment. Subjects took 1,000 mg twice daily throughout the treatment period but were permitted to downtitrate to 500 mg twice daily (or matched placebo) for tolerability at the discretion of the site investigator. Subjects who continued to experience intolerance to study drug underwent an early termination (ET) visit and were discontinued from the study.</p><p>During the treatment period, subjects returned to the clinic for efficacy and safety assessments at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 and ET visits for subjects who prematurely discontinued the study. HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FSG, fasting serum insulin, fasting serum C-peptide, fasting plasma glucagon, and safety laboratory values were measured. In addition, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), fasting lipid profiles, and mixed-meal tolerance testing (MMTT) were performed at weeks 12 and 24 and at ET visits.</p><p>For the MMTTs, subjects were required to fast for 8 h and take their dose of study drug (single-blind placebo at randomization, double-blind ranolazine, or placebo at weeks 12 and 24 and ET visits) at the study site 60 min prior to the MMTT. Subjects consumed a standard glucose-containing drink (i.e., Boost Plus) containing 15% protein, 50% carbohydrate, and 35% fat, with a caloric content of 360 kcal per 240 mL. Serial postprandial blood samples were collected 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 150, and 180 min after the meal for determination of serum glucose, serum insulin, serum C-peptide, and plasma glucagon.</p><p>During the treatment period, subjects found to be persistently hyperglycemic were given open-label rescue medication, in addition to their blinded treatment regimen, to treat ongoing hyperglycemia. Eligibility for hyperglycemic rescue therapy consisted of two consecutive FSG measurements &#x0003e;270 mg/dL spaced &#x02264;7 days apart from day 1 to week 6, or two consecutive FSGs &#x0003e;240 mg/dL spaced &#x02264;7 days apart from weeks 7 to 24. Subjects who continued to be hyperglycemic and required the addition of a second antihyperglycemic agent were discontinued from the study.</p><p>Following the last completed visit (week 24 or ET), subjects were contacted 14 days after the last dose of study drug. In addition, randomized subjects who discontinued the study early were contacted 24 weeks after the first dose of study drug for ascertainment of vital status.</p><p>The study was conducted according to the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol, amendments, and associated materials were approved by relevant regulatory agencies, institutional review boards, and ethics committees.

Although subjects taking ranolazine had decreased body weight at week 12 (LSM difference &#x02212;0.49 kg vs. placebo; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0388), this difference was not sustained through week 24. During ECG monitoring, ranolazine had no effect on PR, RR, or QRS; a 7-ms increase in QTc was seen in the ranolazine group, consistent with prior observations (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s19"><title>Conclusions</title><p content-type="flushleft">CAD and diabetes are nominally two distinct disease entities; however, the two are mechanistically and epidemiologically linked. It is well appreciated that the metabolic derangements inherent in diabetes (including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and excess free fatty acids) lead to endothelial dysfunction, impaired vascular smooth muscle function, and hypercoagulability, conditions that ultimately lead to atherogenesis and coronary events (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It has been estimated that 5.7 million U.S. adults &#x02265;35 years with diabetes have coincident cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A more recent analysis in 1,957 adults with CAD from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort revealed that 619 (28%) had a diagnosis of diabetes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Of these, 44% also had angina, suggesting a significant overlap in the patient populations affected by these two diseases. Such overlap substantially increases the complexity of the management of patients with both conditions. For instance, although &#x003b2;-blockers are an established cornerstone of antianginal therapy, to varying extents they also worsen glycemic control and mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). On the other hand, the development and use of effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes has been limited by concerns over the cardiovascular safety of such agents (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Hence, given the high prevalence of CAD and diabetes in contemporary society, there is thus a need for antianginal and antihyperglycemic medications that do not have the safety and tolerability liabilities associated with currently available agents. In concert with the results of the Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine in Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina (TERISA) clinical trial (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which demonstrated the antianginal efficacy of ranolazine in subjects with comorbid type 2 diabetes, the results of the current study suggest that ranolazine could potentially address both needs. It should be noted, however, that ranolazine is not approved for the treatment of diabetes.</p><p>This study is the first to demonstrate that ranolazine monotherapy reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a measure of ambient glycemia assessed prospectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled fashion in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This effect was seen by 12 weeks in the absence of other glucose-lowering medications and was sustainable up to 24 weeks. In addition, the percentage of subjects achieving a guideline-directed HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal of &#x0003c;7.0% was nearly twice as high with ranolazine as placebo. This level of glycemic control is accepted by the ADA as a reasonable goal for most patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Overall, ranolazine proved safe, with a low dropout rate that was similar between groups.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effects of ranolazine has been described in detail in a recent preclinical study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Ranolazine was shown to inhibit glucagon secretion from pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells by inhibiting their electrical activity via blockade of sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 isoform) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In animal models of diabetes, ranolazine lowered postprandial and basal glucagon levels, which were associated with a reduction in hyperglycemia and lowering of HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The current study provides analogous findings in a population of subjects with type 2 diabetes, suggesting confirmation of this proposed mechanism of action in the clinical setting.</p><p>The relationship of glucagon to type 2 diabetes merits discussion, as this would suggest that ranolazine exhibits antihyperglycemic effects via a novel mechanism. Hyperglucagonemia increases the rates of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), thereby increasing hepatic glucose production in both fasting and postprandial states, ultimately leading to increases in both fasting glucose and PPG levels (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The importance of hyperglucagonemia as a contributor to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) is further highlighted by the finding that glucagon receptor deficiency is sufficient to abolish hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia seen in fat-fed and leptin receptor&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The concomitant reduction of both glucagon and glucose by ranolazine in this trial suggests that ranolazine might reduce blood glucose by decreasing glucagon secretion from &#x003b1;-cells, as described above, and lowering circulating glucagon levels. Additional effects of ranolazine on other elements known to influence either glucose or glucagon levels (such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4) have not been ruled out.</p><p>Notably, ranolazine had a relatively greater effect in lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with the reductions in FSG or PPG. This raises the question as to whether ranolazine lowers HbA<sub>1c</sub> via one or more mechanisms other than reducing glucose levels. However, several lines of evidence argue against such alternate mechanisms. First, direct interference by ranolazine on the HbA<sub>1c</sub> assay was investigated and eliminated in experiments measuring HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the presence or absence of ranolazine (Gilead Sciences, data on file). Second, ranolazine does not affect the glycation of hemoglobin independent of changes in glucose concentration (Gilead Sciences, data on file). Third, ranolazine has not been associated with anemia in this study or other clinical trials (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), making increased red cell turnover an unlikely cause for the association. Fourth, ranolazine has little to no effect on patients with lower blood/plasma glucose (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Finally, there are greater ranolazine-associated reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> seen in patients with higher glucose levels and more severe type 2 diabetes (insulin use vs. nonuse) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Importantly, FSG and PPG as measured in this study may not be ideal surrogates for mean glucose. Considering that the elimination half-life of ranolazine is 7 h, a blood sample drawn 12 h after dosing of ranolazine (i.e., at trough level) might yield a minimal reduction in glucose relative to samples drawn at earlier time points (at higher drug concentrations). Future studies evaluating glucose more intensively, either through multiple-point testing or continuous glucose monitoring, should be considered to fully understand ranolazine&#x02019;s effect on glucose. The totality of current evidence suggests that the lowering of HbA<sub>1c</sub> by ranolazine is likely due to reductions in glucose. Regarding the management of patients with type 2 diabetes, the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend using HbA<sub>1c</sub> as the primary target for glycemic control.</p><p>To have a complete picture of ranolazine&#x02019;s antihyperglycemic properties, it is important to evaluate its efficacy not only as monotherapy but also as an add-on to established therapies such as biguanides and sulfonylureas. Trials evaluating ranolazine on a background of either glimepiride (NCT01494987) or metformin (NCT01555164) have been conducted. The results of these two studies are available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, with publication of their results forthcoming.</p><p>In summary, in subjects with type 2 diabetes on no glucose-lowering pharmacological agents, ranolazine lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub> by a mean difference of &#x02212;0.56% with a near doubling of subjects achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%. Ranolazine also decreased fasting glucose and PPG and fasting and postprandial glucagon levels. The results of this study suggest ranolazine could be an option for the management of patients with concurrent chronic angina and type 2 diabetes. Given the neutral-to-negative glycemic effects of currently available antianginal drugs, such patients may be uniquely suited to be managed with ranolazine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Duality of Interest.</bold> R.H.E. has received consulting fees from Amgen, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Esperion, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Novo Nordisk, FoodMinds, Regeneron, Sanofi, Vivus, and Eli Lilly and Company and has received research funding from GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Esperion, and Janssen.
