transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the recovery of the upper extremity
function of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects] Twenty-seven patients at least 6 months
after stroke onset were divided randomly into an experimental group (14 patients) and a
control group (13 patients). [Methods] All subjects received tDCS for 20&#x02005;min followed by a
5&#x02005;min rest. Then the experimental group received MT while the control group conducted the
same exercises as the experimental group using a mirror that did not show the non-paretic
upper extremity. The groups performed the same exercises for 20&#x02005;min. All subjects received
this intervention for 45-min three times a week for 6 weeks. [Results] After the
intervention, the experimental group showed significant improvements in the box and block
test (BBT), grip strength, and the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), and a significant decrease
in the Jebsen-Taylor test. The control group showed a significant increase in grip
strength after the intervention, and a significant decrease in the Jebsen-Taylor test.
Comparison of the result after the intervention revealed that the experimental group
showed more significant increases in the BBT and grip strength than the control group.
[Conclusion] These results show that MT with tDCS has a positive effect on the functional
recovery of the upper extremity of stroke patients, through activating motor regions in
the brain, and thus plays an important role in recovery of neuroplasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>tDCS</kwd><kwd>Mirror therapy</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The clinical symptoms of stroke patients are subluxation of the shoulder joint, abnormal
muscle tone and decreased motor control ability, decreased coordination ability, associated
reaction, pain in the musculoskeletal systems, weakness of muscle strength in the upper
extremity, and sensory disorder<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus,
stroke causes decreased motor control of the upper extremity resulting in disability in
independent daily living such as putting on clothes, eating, and personal management<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy approaches that aim to
improve upper extremity motor function of stroke patients are used in clinical practice.
However, with most intervention methods, patients do not achieve full regeneration or
activation of the central nervous system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recently, scientific advances, have allowed attention to be paid to direct and selective
stimulation of the brain using methods based on neuroplasticity of the central nervous
system.</p><p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) activates the brain non-invasively without
pain and can change neural structures in the motor cortex, there by inducing
neuroplasticity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, tDCS
stimulates the damaged area of the brain of stroke patients with 1&#x02013;2 mA current, resulting
in polarization of cranial nerves, which improves motor learning and functions<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mirror therapy (MT) uses visual feedback to
induce recovery of motor functions in the upper extremity. Movements of the non-paretic hand
of a stroke patient are reflected in a mirror to create an optical illusion as if the
paretic hand moves normally. This means that neuroplasticity can be changed by activating
the mirror neuron system involved in motor learning and imitation by observing actions
without physical movement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies of tDCS and MT have mainly been conducted with subacute stroke patients within 6
months after stroke onset when neurological recovery can occur quickly after stroke.
However, few studies have been conducted of tDCS, a method for stimulating the central
nervous system which is effective at eliciting functional recovery in stroke patients, in
parallel with MT, which is a simultaneous visual illusion effect. Thus, this study aimed to
determine the effect of MT with tDCS on functional motor recovery of the upper extremity of
chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 27 stroke patients with hemiplegic symptoms. Subjects were
randomly divided into two groups: 14 patients in the experimental group (MT with tDCS) and
13 patients in the control group (without mirror + tDCS). The selection criteria were as
follows: a score of 24 or higher on the Mini Mental State Examination-K (MMSE-K) indicating
no cognitive impairment, stroke onset more than 6 months earlier, and no orthopedic or
neurological disease history. Participants who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to
participate in the study received a general explanation of the trial, and gave their written
informed consent. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee of Eulji University Hospital. The subjects were randomly divided into an
experimental group and a control group. All the subjects received tDCS for 20&#x02005;min followed
by a 5-min rest. Then the experimental group received MT, while the control group performed
the same exercise as the experimental group using a mirror that did not show the non-paretic
upper extremity. The groups performed the same exercise for 20&#x02005;min. All subjects received
this intervention for 45-min three times a week for 6 weeks. Originally, 30 subjects
participated in this study, but one patient with cognitive disability and two patients who
complained of headache and during the tDCS application were retired from the study during
the experiment.</p><p>Subjects were seated on a chair in a comfortable position with both arms on the armrest in
a relaxed position. A sponge electrode of 7&#x000d7;5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> (area; 24&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>) for
tDCS (Phoresor II Auto model PM 700, IOMED, Salt Lake City, USA) was soaked in 0.9%
physiological saline and applied to the head of the patient using as tight a band as
possible without creating discomfort. The anode electrode was attached to C3 and C4, the
primary motor cortex (M1), while the cathode electrode was attached to the supraorbital area
of the non-paretic side according to the International 10/20 system. Stimulation was applied
with 2 mA stimulus intensity for 20&#x02005;min<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The paretic hand was hidden behind a 35&#x000d7;35&#x02005;cm mirror, and the non-paretic hand was put in
front of the mirror. Subjects looked at the upper extremity of the non-paretic side
reflected in the mirror and observed the movement. The MT program consisted of pronation,
supination, flexion, and extension of both wrists, flexion and extension of the fingers, and
flexion and extension of the elbows. One set consisted of 20 repetitions of each motion.
Subjects performed 10 sets and rested for 2&#x02005;min between sets. To help the subjects
concentrate, every time a set was completed, a verbal compliment was given once. The total
program time was 20&#x02005;min<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The box and
block test (BBT), which measures the manual dexterity of stroke patients, counts the number
of blocks that can be moved from one box to another box in 1&#x02005;min. Each block is a 1 inch
cube. Subjects were requested to move the blocks as quickly as they could with motivational
compliments. The wooden blocks were moved one at a time. The test-retest reliability is very
high r=0.96 for: the right hand, and r=0.94 for the left hand<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure hand grip strength, a JAMAR hand dynamometer (Sammons
Preston Rolyan, Illinois, USA) was used. The measurement was conducted while the subjects
were seated on a chair with their upper arms close to the body, their elbows flexed at 90&#x000b0;,
and the wrist in the neutral position. The mean value of three measurements was used in the
analysis. The reliability of grip strength measurement has been reported as r=0.99, which is
very high<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Jebsen-Taylor test is an
objective assessment tool that measures the functional hand tasks that are most widely used
in daily living. Each test consists of writing, turning over a card, stacking checkers,
picking up small common object, simulated feeding, picking up a large light tin can, and
picking up a large heavy tin can. The assessment measure the time (seconds) taken to perform
each task. The reliability of this assessment tool has been reported as r=0.99, which is
very high<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Fugl-Meyer assessment
(FMA) assesses the motor functions, balance, and senses of stroke patients. In this study,
detailed items of the upper extremity function were used as the main assessment index,
without functional assessment of the lower extremity, and the coordination ability among the
shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand was examined. The reliability of this assessment
tool has been reported as r=0.94, which is very high<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For statistical analysis in this study, SPSS 18.0 was used to
calculate the mean and standard deviation. The data are expressed as mean &#x000b1;standard
deviation Within-group and between-group comparisons for all variables were performed by
using TwoWay ANOVA. A statistical significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 was used in all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The homogeneity test of age, height, weight, and disease history between the experimental

months, neurological function has recovered; therefore, the physical therapeutic approach is
the focus during this period<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
study aimed to determine the effect of MT with tDCS on functional motor recovery in the
upper extremity of chronic stroke patients. The results show that the interventions had
positive effects.</p><p>Although many studies have been conducted of recovery of motor function of the upper
extremity, stroke patients with decreased physical function have difficulty performing tasks
as well as decreased motivation for rehabilitation. Therefore, a cognitive intervention that
increases the motivation of stroke patients is necessary. As a cognitive intervention
method, MT activates the frontal or parietal lobe in the corresponding motor region only
observing the behavior of others, and this area is called the mirror neurons. Therefore, MT
could play an important role in learning a new skill or understanding others&#x02019; behavior,
which can be used to motivate stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, tDCS, which performs non-invasive stimulation in the
brain of stroke patients, can elicit structural changes in neuroplasticity, thereby helping
stroke patients recover motor function in the upper extremity. The neurological mechanism of
tDCS is hyperpolarization of neurons in the brain by cathode stimulation, which reduces the
excitatory response in the cerebral cortex, while anode stimulation elicits depolarization
increasing the excitatory response<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After the main intervention of this study, the experimental group showed a more significant
increase in BBT and grip strength than the control group did. This result is consistent with
the results of another study in which MT application improved stroke patients motor function
and senses in the two limbs of the paretic side<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that MT improved functional recovery in the
upper extremity and performance of daily living activities of subacute stroke patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result was attributed to the optical
illusion of movement of the non-paretic side activating mirror neurons through mirror
reflection, thereby improving the movement of the paretic side.</p><p>It was also reported that when 1mA anode direct current stimulation was applied to the
primary motor region of the brains of chronic stroke patients for 20&#x02005;min, hand motor
functions improved in the Jebsen-Tayler test<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that tDCS activated the damaged cerebral
cortex, thus helping positive functional recovery of the upper extremity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results are similar to those of our
study indicating that depolarization of cell membranes is induced when the microcurrent of
tDCS is applied to cortical areas, changing the NMDA receptors and activating the cerebral
cortex<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study demonstrated that, applying tDCS has a positive effect on the motor function
recovery of stroke patients in addition to the effect of MT. The visual illusion effect of
MT activated the damaged cerebral cortex directly, but selective stimulation of the central
nervous system helped activate the corticospinal tract of stroke patients.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, due to the small number of subjects, it is
difficult to generalize the results to all stroke patients. Second, we could not control
therapy duration other than the intervention duration. Third, we did not separate subjects
by functional performance level and performed only simple tasks. Therefore, these
limitations should be addressed in the future by including more subjects and studying tDCS
and MT simultaneously for a longer duration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Wonkwang Health Science University in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dijkerman</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ietswaart</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Does motor imagery training improve hand function in
