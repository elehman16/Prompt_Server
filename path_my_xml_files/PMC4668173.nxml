neuromuscular facilitation integration pattern (PIP) and Swiss ball training on balance
and pain in elderly patients with chronic low back pain. [Subjects] Participants were
randomly assigned to a PIP training (n=24) and a Swiss ball training group (n=24).
[Methods] The training was performed for 30 minutes per day, three times a week for 6
weeks. Outcome measures included the mean velocity in the X and Y directions using the
Good Balance System<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, functional reach test, timed up and go test, and visual
analogue scale. [Results] After completion of training, mean velocity in the X and Y
direction, and the functional reach test, timed up and go test, and visual analogue scale
results showed statistically significant improvements in the PIP and Swiss ball training
groups. However, there was no significant difference in the functional reach test, timed
up and go test, and visual analogue scale results between the two groups. [Conclusion]
This study indicated that PIP training improved the balance ability of elderly patients
with chronic low back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Back pain</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Swiss ball</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic back pain primarily limits the range of motion and waist movement; moreover, it
reduces trunk muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility. Due to these physical
disabilities, patients with back pain experience difficulties in daily living and social
activities, which may lead to mental and psychological problems such as reduction in the
quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bed rest; treatment using heat, ultrasound, electrical simulation, or traction; joint
mobilization; manipulation; massage; and exercise therapy can be used as conservative
treatment for back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, passive
treatments have been used less frequently in recent years. Instead, exercise treatment,
which is an active treatment, has become a mainstream therapy for promoting early recovery
and preventing recurrence or slowing progress toward chronic pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most treatments for back pain in elderly individuals are based on the use of medications
such as analgesics, anti-inflammatories, and muscle relaxants to relieve pain. Considering
that the major cause of back pain is an imbalance of posture and muscles, such drug
treatments may be helpful to temporarily relieve pain, but an exercise program that can help
to correct posture in daily living should also be utilized for ultimate back pain
management<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is the ability to maintain the line of gravity within the base of support of the
body weight, and can be divided into static and dynamic balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static balance refers to the ability to stand without
postural sway on a fixed surface<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance
ability is affected by various factors, including age, gender, cognition ability,
musculoskeletal disorders, sensory disturbances, and muscle tone. A reduction in balance
ability restricts the range of daily activities that patients can perform and increases the
risk of falling<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation integration pattern (PIP) is a proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)-applied cross training program that stimulates the
proprioceptors in the muscles and tendons to improve their functions, as well as muscle
activity, flexibility, and stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. If
various patterns are applied simultaneously, more force can be used, thereby affecting
muscle strength and stability further. Dietz proposed gait analysis and treatment by
integrating individual patterns of PNF into the exercise pattern and motions occurring
during the gait period<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. PIP improves
trunk stability and the proprioceptive senses of the limbs; moreover, it can improve static
balance when it is applied for normal healthy persons<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study aimed to determine the effect of a PIP exercise program
on pain relief and improvement in the balance ability of elderly persons with chronic back
pain, as well as its applicability as a clinical therapeutic exercise program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 48 elderly persons with chronic back pain who were admitted
to an aged care hospital in G City. It was approved by the hospital, and all the
participants provided written informed consent. The 48 subjects were randomly assigned to
the PIP and Swiss ball training groups. The selection criteria were as follows: back pain
for six months or longer, no back pain-related diseases or complications, no serious
cardiopulmonary problems, and ability to exercise for 30&#x02005;min or longer and walk 30&#x02005;m or more
without assistance. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics

in the present research.</p><p>Subjects in the PIP training group were given pattern and return pattern training prior to
the experiment by a specialized therapist who understood the integration pattern well. The
Swiss ball exercise group carried out balance training on a Swiss ball. The sessions were
50&#x02005;min long and were held three times a week for 6 weeks.</p><p>For static balance ability, the Good Balance System<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Metitur Oy, Palokka,
Finland, 2003) was employed. Indexes that can represent static balance ability such as a
shift in the center of pressure (COP) in the anterior-posterior direction, a shift of COP in
the medial-lateral direction, and shift in the path of COP, were used to measure postural
sway.</p><p>For the dynamic balance test, the functional reach test (FRT) and timed up and go (TUG)
test were conducted. The FRT can measure an individual&#x02019;s balance and flexibility while
performing tasks<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Meanwhile, the TUG
test measures the time it takes for an individual to rise from sitting in a standard arm
chair, walk 3 m, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure pain.</p><p>The data collected in this study were analyzed using SPSS statistical program for Windows
version 18.0. A paired t-test was used to measure balance significance within groups, and
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for comparison between groups. The level of
statistical significance, &#x003b1;, was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results before and after the intervention are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the normal standing eyes open (NSEO) posture, the PIP
training group exhibited differences in mean velocity along the X and Y axes and velocity
moment (p&#x0003c;0.05). Meanwhile, the Swiss ball training group demonstrated a difference in
mean velocity along the X and Y axes (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the normal standing eyes closed (NSEC)

the X and Y axes and velocity moment (p&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, the Swiss ball training group
exhibited a difference in mean velocity along the X and Y-axes (p&#x0003c;0.05). In the

back pain, improvements in balance ability and reduction in pain were achieved. In a study
on the application of a PNF integration pattern to stroke patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, 18 training sessions were conducted over 6 weeks. The
results indicated a greater improvement in static and dynamic balance after PNF integration
pattern exercises than after general exercise treatment. A study on 18 applications of a
sprinter pattern lasting 30&#x02005;min in patients with hemiplegia showed that a course of sprinter
pattern exercise improved balance ability significantly more than in the control group,
which carried out general exercise treatment<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study on back muscle strengthening training for 12 weeks also
showed that the experimental group experienced a reduction in pain and the Oswestry
Disability Index, as well as an increase in back muscle strength, in comparison to the
control group<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study on PIP training
and Swiss ball training applied to 40 patients with chronic back pain showed that the PIP
training group experienced reduced pain and improved muscle activities to a greater extent
than the Swiss ball training group<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
study comparing PNF training and a trunk exercise program for chronic back pain patients
showed that both groups improved in terms of balance ability, but the PNF group improved
significantly more than the trunk exercise group.</p><p>For the Swiss ball exercise group, the FRT results were 24.93&#x000b1;7.05&#x02005;cm and 27.18&#x000b1;6.90&#x02005;cm
before and after the exercise program, respectively, while for the PIP training group, the
FRT results were 21.97&#x000b1;4.97&#x02005;cm and 23.76&#x000b1;5.21&#x02005;cm before and after the exercise. This
indicates that both groups exhibited a significant difference in increases in distance, but
no significant difference was shown between groups. A study on elderly persons divided into
a PNF lower extremity pattern group and a control group for 4 weeks showed that the PNF
group had a significantly higher FRT result, indicating that balance training using muscle
strength enhancement was more effective in this group than in the control group, which is
consistent with the present study result<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the comparison of TUG results, the PIP and Swiss ball exercise groups exhibited a
significant difference in reduced TUG time before and after the exercise, but no significant
difference between groups was observed. In a study using TUG in stroke patients divided into
trunk stabilization and general balance exercise groups, both groups exhibited a significant
difference before and after the exercise program, but no significant difference between
groups was found<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it reported
that stroke patients&#x02019; time to stand and walk was reduced significantly, thereby improving
their dynamic balance ability. Geiger and Allen<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the TUG result reduced from 23.08&#x000b1;13.7 sec before the
exercise to 14.62&#x000b1;11.18 sec after the exercise, which was consistent with the present study
result. A study by Song et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that PIP training improved gait velocity in elderly persons who experienced a fall, and
improved fall efficacy, indicating a positive effect of PIP training on these
parameters.</p><p>The PIP and Swiss ball exercise group exhibited a significant reduction in the VAS score
from before to after the exercise, but no significant difference between groups was
observed. Based on the above results, PIP can induce significant improvements in balance
ability and pain for elderly persons with chronic back pain.</p><p>In this study, psychological and physiological factors that can affect balance ability and
pain, as well as daily activities, could not be controlled for completely, and
within-subject factors that can influence balance ability and pain cannot be completely
excluded. Thus, it is a limitation of this study that the results cannot be generalized to
all elderly patients with chronic back pain. Nevertheless, the present findings showed that
PIP training as a self-exercise program can provide foundational data for clinical use in
both self-exercise programs and group exercise programs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Piironen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Paananen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Haapea</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Transcultural adaption and psychometric properties of the
