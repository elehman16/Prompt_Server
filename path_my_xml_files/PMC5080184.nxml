Height insoles
are also used to counteract foot deformities and enhance balance; however, there is little
evidence of the beneficial effects of height insoles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, since insoles alter the plantar pressure distribution,
improper use of insoles can cause deformities in a normal foot<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Height insoles also retain the ankles in a plantar flexion
position, which places the mechanical state of the ankles in the open-packed position and
can have negative effects on balance ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been demonstrated that wearing shoes

while wearing height insoles, after performing ankle exercises in bare feet, or while
wearing shoes with low heels. The present study examined the effects of ankle exercises on
improving the balance ability of an individual wearing height-increasing insoles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty adults in their 20s who were students at Youngdong University in North Chungcheong
Province, South Korea, participated in the present study. Participants were randomly chosen
from a cohort of individuals who did not exhibit skeletomuscular or neurological disorders,
and they were randomly divided into experimental and control groups (n=15/group). The
average age, height, and weight of the experimental group were 20.86 &#x000b1; 1.35&#x02005;years, 174.75 &#x000b1;
4.34&#x02005;cm, and 67.13 &#x000b1; 9.54&#x02005;kg, respectively. Those of the control group were 21.46 &#x000b1;
1.55&#x02005;years, 174.71 &#x000b1; 4.89&#x02005;cm, and 71.07 &#x000b1; 12.11&#x02005;kg, respectively. There were no significant
differences between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). Ethical approval for the present study was
granted by the Institutional Review Board of Youngdong University. All subjects were
informed of the objectives and methods of the study beforehand and gave informed consent to
participate in the experiments.</p><p>Height-adjustable silicon insoles measuring 3, 5, and 7&#x02005;cm were used. The experimental
group participated in a total of 12 sessions of an exercise program, which was performed
three times per week for four weeks. The program consisted of stretching exercises,
resistance training, and a balance exercise. The stretching exercises involved four
stretching routines: (i) plantar flexion active stretches, (ii) dorsiflexion active
stretches, (iii) a stretch that involved tracing letters in the air with the foot while in a
prone position with the leg on a pillow, and (iv) a calf muscle stretch with one leg forward
and the other back whist bending the upper body forward and keeping both heels on the
ground.</p><p>Stretching was performed, alternating between legs, for three 30-s sets with a break of
15&#x02005;s between the sets. Stretching exercises were followed by a 1&#x02005;min break, after which
resistance training was performed. Resistance training routines consisted of, (i) performing
plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion in a prone position while changing
the position of a TheraBand&#x02122;, which was anchored to a sturdy object and wrapped around the
foot; (ii) using the foot to pick up a towel while seated; and (iii) heel raise exercises in
a standing position. Resistance training was performed, alternating between legs, for three
20-s sets with a break of 15&#x02005;s between the sets. Resistance training was followed by a 1&#x02005;min
break, after which the balance exercise was performed. For the balance exercise, subjects
were asked to stand on one leg on an air cushion for 1&#x02005;min. While they could use the wall
for support if required, participants were encouraged to stand on the cushion without
support. The balance exercise was performed, alternating between legs, for three 1-min sets
with a break of 15&#x02005;s between the sets. A Biodex Balance System&#x02122; was used to assess the
balance ability of all 30 subjects in order to determine how height-increasing insoles
affected the balance ability with and without ankle exercises. Subjects were asked to stand
on one leg on the platform of the Biodex Balance System&#x02122; for 30&#x02005;s whilst wearing a blindfold
and crossing both arms, with both hands placed on the shoulders. Balance ability was
assessed three times, once before the exercise program and twice after the exercise
program.</p><p>An independent t-test was performed to compare the balance ability of the experimental
group with that of the control group. A paired t-test was used to investigate alterations in
the balance ability of each group before and after the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A significant improvement was detected in the balance ability of the experimental group in
all height-increasing insole subgroups (3, 5, and 7&#x02005;cm) after the exercise program as
compared with before the exercise program (p&#x0003c;0.05). There was no significant improvement
in the balance ability of the control group in any of the height insole subgroups (3, 5 and,
and 7&#x02005;cm) after the exercise program as compared with before the exercise program
(p&#x0003e;0.05). The experimental group exhibited a significant improvement in balance ability
following the exercise program for all the height insoles as compared with the control group

of individuals wearing height-increasing insoles. Height-adjustable silicon insoles
measuring 3, 5, and 7&#x02005;cm were used. A height-increasing shoe insole between 3 and 5&#x02005;cm was
found to be ideal, whereas a shoe insole measuring &#x0003e;5&#x02005;cm could excessively shift the
plantar pressure to the front of the foot<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although individuals endeavor to be healthy, occasionally they put
beauty before health<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example,
individuals wear height-increasing shoe insoles despite knowing that wearing these insoles
may decrease their balance ability. Reduced balance ability can lead to ankle joint damage,
which may result in a chronic disease that ultimately undermines the individual&#x02019;s quality of
life<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although it is important to
recommend that individuals refrain from wearing height-increasing shoe insoles, it is also
important that individuals who do wear these insoles wear them correctly and identify,
develop, and perform exercises that can help maintain or improve balance ability. According
to the results of the present study, active ankle exercises may be helpful in preventing
ankle joint damage, as they improve balance ability. These findings may also be applied to
people who wear high-heeled shoes. While the present study focused on young adults in their
20s high-heeled shoes are worn by people across the age spectrum. The present study was
unable to determine which of the three exercises (stretching, resistance training, and
balance exercises), contributed the most to the improvement in balance ability. In order to
fully elucidate the effect of ankle exercises on balance ability, future studies should
focus on how diverse age groups, different shoe types, and more specialized exercise
programs affect balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Urabe</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Kato</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of shoe insole for prevention and treatment of
