In addition to being noninvasive, previous reports have shown that RI measurements provide useful diagnostic information regarding various renal diseases, including type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, even minimal changes in respiration or position can influence the Doppler waveforms and thus the successful measurement of RI [<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, both the time needed for Doppler assessment and the quality of the scan are largely dependent on the ability of the patient to hold his or her breath for the required duration.</p><p>We recently observed that cooperation during Doppler ultrasonography is better when the patient can hear the sound of the pulses. Thus, the purpose of this study was to prospectively determine the clinical effectiveness of real-time feedback using audible pulses in renal Doppler ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital. Written informed consent was provided by all participants at enrollment.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Study Population</title><p>From February to March 2012, healthy volunteers were enrolled using the following inclusion criteria: (a) aged 20&#x02013;55 years, (b) absence of renal symptoms or known renal disease, and (c) no history of dyspnea. We recruited volunteers who responded to personal solicitation and agreed to participate in the study. The risks and benefits of participation were discussed with each volunteer as part of the informed consent process, as required by our hospital&#x02019;s institutional review board. Volunteers received fee-free abdominopelvic ultrasonography in exchange for their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Imaging and Interpretation</title><p>Doppler sonography was performed using a LOGIQ E9 scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) with a 1- to 5-MHz convex probe. The operator was an abdominal radiologist with 2 years of teaching experience.</p><p>Sonography consisted of two sessions using audible and inaudible pulses. Using the LOGIQ E9, the association between the sound volume and the gain of the Doppler wave can be uncoupled. Thus, during the monitoring of waveforms of the same intensity, the volume could be lowered to zero during the inaudible sessions and made sufficiently audible during the audible sessions. This allowed the radiologist to ask that the volunteers wait for the sound, without any loss of Doppler gain.</p><p>For this randomized cross-over study, all volunteers participated in both the audible and inaudible sessions at 1-week intervals. Except for the 1-week interval between sessions, the order of audible and inaudible sessions was arranged randomly to avoid learning or memory bias in the volunteers.</p><p>The right and left kidneys of all volunteers were evaluated in each session, and the scan time to obtain waveforms for each one was recorded separately. Doppler sonography was performed at the upper pole, the interpolar region, and at the lower pole of each kidney. Waveforms were obtained at the segmental arteries using a 2-mm Doppler gate. They were optimized for measurement using the lowest pulse repetition frequency without aliasing, the highest gain without obscuring flow by surrounding background noise, and the lowest wall filter.</p><p>Each session was considered complete when reproducible waveforms were obtained for 5 s in each of the three regions. Since variations in heart rate can affect the time needed for sonography, a full frame of uniform waves for 5 seconds was obtained, rather than a fixed number of waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163953.g001">Fig 1</xref>). If within those 5 seconds the waveforms changed because of respiration or movement by the participants, a new waveform was obtained.</p><fig id="pone.0163953.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0163953.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Full frame of uniform waves for 5 seconds.</title><p>The Numbers of waves are different by the heart rates of participants (A, 48 beats per minute; B, 72 beats per minute).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0163953.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using commercial software (STATA, release 11; Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). A paired t-test was used to compare the duration of the audible and inaudible sessions and the scan times needed for the right and left kidneys.

Since then, many studies have reported the potential of Doppler sonographic assessments in this setting [<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mancini et al. found that diabetic patients with higher RI values had a higher degree of proteinuria, which suggests the value of this measurement in the early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy [<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In our institution, we routinely measure renal RI in diabetes mellitus patients as a means to predict diabetic nephropathy [<xref rid="pone.0163953.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To obtain an adequate measurement of RI, patient breath-holding is necessary. However, this can be difficult, since most patients are unaware of the significance of breath-holding during the examination and how it is achieved. Thus, patients may move their abdomen or breathe unconsciously, despite attempts at breath-holding. We recently observed that cooperation is better when patients can hear the sound of the pulses during Doppler ultrasonography. Because the sound provides feedback, at the sound of the pulse, the patient can try to maintain its uniformity, which is a more concrete and specific task than breath-holding. The results of this study showed that RIs can be obtained much faster when volunteers are able to hear the pulse sound. We think that the shortened scan time reflects an improvement in efficiency of the renal Doppler ultrasonography.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, because all examinations were performed by a single radiologist, interobserver variability was not assessed. Second, for obvious reasons, the radiologist could not be &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; as to whether each session was an audible or inaudible one. This is a potential source of bias and may have been more likely to shorten the scan time in the audible session. Third, the study population was limited to healthy volunteers, and the effect of an audible pulse on RI measurements in elderly or obese patients was not determined. There will be the need for further study in more challenging individuals to establish the utility of these measurements.</p><p>Nonetheless, our study supports the use of real-time feedback using an audible pulse to encourage patient cooperation during breath-holding, as it can shorten the time needed to perform Doppler ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0163953.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>26 Volunteers&#x02019; Clinical Dataset.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0163953.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0163953.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Buscemi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Verga</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Batsis</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cottone</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mattina</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Re</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
