Most parents/caregivers selected goals targeting aspects of gait improvement as most relevant. Mean (95% confidence interval) Goal Attainment Scaling T scores at week 4 were higher for both abobotulinumtoxinA groups versus placebo (treatment difference vs placebo: 10 U/kg/leg: 5.32 [2.31, 8.32], <italic>P</italic> = .0006, and 15 U/kg/leg 4.65 [1.59, 7.71], <italic>P</italic> = .0031). Superiority of both abobotulinumtoxinA doses versus placebo was maintained at week 12. Best goal attainment T scores were higher in the abobotulinumtoxinA groups versus placebo for the common goals of improved walking pattern, decreased falling, decreased tripping, and improved endurance. These findings demonstrate that single injections of abobotulinumtoxinA (10 and 15 U/kg/leg) significantly improved the ability of pediatric cerebral palsy patients to achieve their functional goals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abobotulinumtoxinA</kwd><kwd>Dysport</kwd><kwd>cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>equinus foot</kwd><kwd>goal attainment scaling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Spasticity is a prevalent and frequently disabling motor disorder in children with cerebral palsy. Spasticity of the gastro-soleus muscle complex is common and often results in equinus foot posturing during the stance phase of gait.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This causes patients to frequently trip, fall, and also interferes with shoe wear and use of orthosis. Treatment of spasticity in these muscles aims to improve gait patterns, thereby improving motor function and mobility.

The implementation of Goal Attainment Scaling in our protocol involved extensive training to ensure that all investigators set goals in a consistent way. This process required us to develop our goal-setting and negotiation skills into a very structured process, which takes into account what is important to the patient and what the physician and therapist believe is achievable. In our experience, the use of Goal Attainment Scaling necessitated that we modify what could be very broad goals into predefined measurable steps that enabled a better judgment of treatment response. For example, instead of setting a goal of &#x0201c;improved walking pattern&#x0201d; in a child who is constantly toe walking, the use of Goal Attainment Scaling meant that this broad goal could be broken down into objective steps such as toe walking for 50% to 75% of the time (expected attainment), toe walking for 25% to 49% of the time (somewhat better than expected attainment), and not toe walking (much better than expected attainment). Although this approach admittedly involved more time at the initial visit, the early efforts invariably saved time during the follow-up visits.</p><p>Importantly, these data confirm our clinical experience of good functional benefits with botulinum toxin type A treatment but contradict an evidence base that has often failed to show significant efficacy of a botulinum toxin type A product in improving patient function.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This may, in part, be because few previous study protocols have included the extensive training and standardization as described above.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> It may also reflect the fact that the use of Goal Attainment Scaling allows a range of assessment measures that are individualized to the patient (rather than one measure for all). The diagnosis of cerebral palsy is very diverse in terms of the impairments and limitations a child may experience (even within the limits of study inclusion criteria) and these differences emphasize the need for a more flexible and sensitive measure that evaluates the impact of treatment for children with cerebral palsy in a more meaningful fashion.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, we used a list of 12 predefined Goal Attainment Scaling goals that have previously been reported to be responsive to treatment and well accepted by patients and their families (B.R., unpublished data, 2009). Although the scale included a list of 12 predefined goals, it is clear that most parents/patients chose an improved walking pattern, improved balance, and/or decreased frequency of falling as very important or important goals. Because these types of goals typically require significant physical input (eg, strength and/or balance), our findings suggest that the injections &#x0201c;enabled&#x0201d; patients to progress toward reaching their goals (vs a direct effect of the toxin). Although other goals such as reduced foot pain and easier AFO use are often cited as reasonable &#x0201c;indications&#x0201d; for starting therapy with botulinum toxin type A,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> they were much less commonly chosen by the parents/patients themselves. Of note, in the 15 U/kg/leg group, the goal of &#x0201c;improved balance&#x0201d; was not attained at week 4. However, by week 12, the percentage of responders in the 15 U/kg/leg group had increased from 39% to 56%. The lack of improvement at week 4 was not unexpected (indeed, the results for the 10 U/kg/leg are the more surprising) since balance improvement usually requires improvements in strength and muscle coordination, which require additional physical input and take longer to achieve.</p><p>To account for the fact that some goals were expected to take more than 4 weeks after botulinum toxin therapy to achieve; we performed a preplanned analysis of the best scores for each goal during the study. In this second analysis, better goal attainment was achieved in both abobotulinumtoxinA groups as compared to placebo. The good results at week 12 clearly demonstrate that the duration of treatment benefit exceeds the time that the toxin is active in the muscle (maximum benefit from chemodenervation is usually achieved within 4-6 weeks). Indeed, it is notable that almost three-quarters (74%) of patients were retreated at 16 weeks or later, and almost 1 in 5 patients did not require retreatment until at least 28 weeks after abobotulinumtoxinA injection, suggesting that these patients were able to meet their goals of treatment over this extended period of time.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the large study size, multicenter design (which supports the benefits of this treatment approach across different cultures), the double-blind design that allowed assessment of Goal Attainment Scaling in a nonbiased way, and the significant training given to investigators to perform a standardized Goal Attainment Scaling assessment. Limitations include the lack of tailoring of the injection schema according to the patient profile and goals selected. This study only assessed the efficacy of a single injection cycle. Achievement of mobility goals require a long-term commitment to therapy,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0883073816686910" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and further assessment of goal attainment in the long-term open-label extension study will provide better insights into the long-term efficacy of repeated injections.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first placebo-controlled study to demonstrate that single injections of abobotulinumtoxinA (10 or 15 U/kg/leg) significantly improve the ability of pediatric patients with cerebral palsy to achieve their functional goals that are important to the patients and their families. Goal Attainment Scaling is a useful measure to include in the routine clinical assessment and management of children with cerebral palsy and has the potential to improve current practice. Realistic goals and expectations should be established with the patient and family before treatment, and the therapy should be tailored to their individual needs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the study investigators, as well as Anita Chadha-Patel, PhD (ACP Clinical Communications Ltd funded by Ipsen Pharma) for editorial support (literature searching, editing, and final styling of the paper for submission) in the development of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0883073816686910"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> ATil and MRD drafted the initial manuscript.
