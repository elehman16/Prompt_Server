Subjects self-dosed once daily, beginning 1 day before undergoing cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation (day &#x02013;1) and again on the day of surgery (day 0) and for 14 days postoperatively. Follow-up was on days 1, 3, 8, and 15. The outcome measures included the percentage of subjects with zero-to-trace anterior chamber cells at each visit, as determined by the percentage of subjects with &#x02264;5 anterior chamber cells, overall anterior chamber cell grades, and summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS) (combined anterior chamber cell and flare scores).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of subjects with zero-to-trace anterior chamber cells was significantly higher in the bromfenac 0.07% group compared with the placebo group as early as day 3 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0007), continued at day 8 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and through day 15 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). At day 15, 80.2% of subjects in the bromfenac 0.07% group achieved zero-to-trace anterior chamber cells compared with 47.2% of subjects who did so in the placebo group. The overall anterior chamber cell scores were significantly lower in the bromfenac 0.07% group compared with the placebo group at days 3, 8, and 15 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 at each visit). The SOIS were also significantly lower in the bromfenac group compared with the placebo group at days 3, 8, and 15 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 at each visit).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.07%, dosed once daily was clinically effective in achieving zero-to-trace anterior chamber cell severity after cataract surgery and was superior to placebo in all anterior chamber cell severity and inflammation outcome measures.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ocular inflammation</kwd><kwd>anterior chamber inflammation</kwd><kwd>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory</kwd><kwd>cells and flare</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgical procedure worldwide.<xref rid="b1-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> With improvements in surgical techniques, patients&#x02019; expectations have risen proportionally;<xref rid="b3-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> however, differences in surgical technique impact the severity of surgical trauma and postsurgical recovery.<xref rid="b2-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The amount of postsurgical ocular pain and inflammation a patient has will play a significant role in his/her perception of the surgical success. Prospective studies assessing the incidence of postoperative pain have reported that one-third of patients experience pain in the early hours following cataract surgery, and the majority of those patients (79%) continued to experience pain after leaving the surgical facility.<xref rid="b4-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Anterior chamber ocular inflammation, clinically assessed as anterior chamber cell counts and flare, is also common following cataract surgery. However, postoperative inflammation is frequently viewed as an acceptable risk that is largely outweighed by the numerous benefits of cataract surgery.<xref rid="b3-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The management of postoperative inflammation is essential, both to ensure rapid recovery following the surgery as well as to prevent or decrease the potential for long-term complications, such as cystoid macular edema.<xref rid="b5-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Postoperative pain and inflammation following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation are often managed with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recently, this management regimen has been extended to include dosing prior to and on the day of surgery, to potentially improve analgesia, reduce intra- and postoperative inflammation, and to minimize the risk of postoperative complications.<xref rid="b6-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Bromfenac ophthalmic solution has been evaluated in numerous clinical studies in both Japan and the United States (US)<xref rid="b7-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). The COX enzyme promotes prostaglandin synthesis by converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin, a necessary component for the onset of inflammation.<xref rid="b15-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> By blocking both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, the release of potent inflammatory mediators located primarily in the iris and ciliary body, such as prostaglandin E2, is prevented. In vitro studies have shown the IC<sub>50</sub> values (the concentration of NSAID needed to inhibit 50% of either COX-1 or COX-2) are even lower for COX-2, the inducible enzyme primarily responsible for prostaglandin E2, a potent inflammatory mediator in surgical trauma.<xref rid="b16-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b18-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Bromfenac sodium is designated chemically as sodium 2-amino-3-(4-bromobenzoyl) phenylacetate sesquihydrate.<xref rid="b20-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The addition of a bromine atom improves the absorption and penetration into ocular tissue and allows for an increased duration of effect.<xref rid="b21-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The inclusion of bromine also increases the potency against the COX-2 enzyme by providing an approximate tenfold greater lipophilicity.<xref rid="b23-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Bromfenac ophthalmic solution was first commercially available in Japan as Bronuck<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Senju Pharmaceuticals Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and was approved for the treatment of blepharitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, and postoperative inflammation.<xref rid="b24-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.09% (Xibrom&#x02122;; ISTA Pharmaceuticals Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), with no predosing and twice-daily administration for 14 days, was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in March 2005, for the treatment of ocular inflammation after cataract surgery with posterior chamber IOL implantation; this was amended, in January 2006, to include the reduction of postoperative ocular pain.<xref rid="b25-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This initial bromfenac 0.09% solution was formulated with a pH of 8.3.</p><p>The reduction of ocular inflammation in the bromfenac 0.09% twice-daily clinical trials assessed zero-to-trace inflammation (0&#x02013;5 cells and no flare in the anterior chamber).<xref rid="b9-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Subsequent trials assessing the reduction of anterior chamber inflammation following cataract surgery, with bromfenac 0.09% dosed once daily (which also had a pH of 8.3), found the agent to be effective in the complete clearance of inflammation at all-time points (days 3, 8, and 15) compared with placebo, as well as in reducing ocular inflammation to zero-to-trace levels.<xref rid="b10-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The US FDA approved bromfenac 0.09% (Bromday<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; ISTA Pharmaceuticals Inc.) on October 16, 2010; this was the first once-daily ophthalmic NSAID for the treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract extraction with posterior chamber IOL implantation.<xref rid="b20-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Overall, since its initial approval, bromfenac has been a beneficial addition to the standard of care in the reduction of ocular inflammation.</p><p>Following the approval of Xibrom and Bromday, an advanced formulation of bromfenac ophthalmic solution was developed to improve ocular penetration, thereby allowing for a reduction of the concentration of the active ingredient, bromfenac, to 0.07%. The pH was reduced, from 8.3 in the 0.09% concentration to 7.8 in the 0.07% concentration, in order to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule. The reduction in pH to a more physiologic level, closer to that of normal tears, may also improve ocular comfort upon instillation. The hypothesis for the current clinical trials was that the once-daily bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.07% would be effective in reducing ocular inflammation and pain after cataract surgery. The specific intent of the analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of bromfenac 0.07% for reducing the level of postoperative anterior chamber inflammatory cells to trace or better. Of note: at the time of these studies, bromfenac 0.09% once daily (Bromday) was marketed in the United States; since the US regulatory approval of bromfenac 0.07% (PROLENSA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Bausch + Lomb, Bridgewater, NJ, USA), Bromday has been discontinued.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The current analyses comprised of two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled,clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01367249;<xref rid="b26-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> approval received from Sterling Institutional Review Board, Atlanta, GA, USA) that evaluated 440 subjects.

However, the overall results with both the once- and twice-daily versions of bromfenac 0.09%, as well as the once-daily dosing of bromfenac 0.07%, reconfirm the potency of the bromfenac molecule in reducing inflammation in the postcataract surgery population. This analysis also indicates that a lower concentration of bromfenac solution could be as efficacious in reducing cell and flare as a higher concentration of bromfenac solution.</p><p>Most importantly, by maintaining the efficacy of already-approved bromfenac 0.09% formulations and potentially improving the absorption across the hydrophobic corneal barrier, via the pH adjustment, to a more physiologic pH, once-daily bromfenac 0.07% solution may improve comfort and tolerability, particularly at the corneal and/or ocular surface level. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the bromfenac 0.07% group than in the placebo group and similar to those of earlier formulations of bromfenac.</p><p>Safety profiles among ophthalmic NSAIDs are important as the early 1990s taught us a valuable lesson about topical NSAID safety in terms of corneal AEs, such as corneal melts.<xref rid="b29-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Corneal infiltrates and ulcerative keratolysis were associated, in 117 cases, to either diclofenac (27%&#x02013;61%) or ketorolac (12%) in the early 2000s.<xref rid="b6-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The reported incidence of serious AEs over the course of 6 years in patients who used bromfenac has been found to be extremely low, at 0.0002%.<xref rid="b30-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The limitations of the current clinical trials have been previously reported<xref rid="b27-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and include a smaller sample size than in other clinical trials evaluating higher concentrations of bromfenac and an overwhelming number of Caucasian subjects in the bromfenac 0.07% arm. These factors prevent us from making direct comparisons with other clinical trial results.</p><p>In summary, the clinical trials clearly demonstrated that the proportion of subjects with zero-to-trace anterior chamber cells was significantly higher in the bromfenac 0.07% group, while the overall anterior chamber cell severity and SOIS were significantly lower in the bromfenac 0.07% group compared with placebo. Based in part on these results of the Phase III clinical trials, on April 5, 2013, the US FDA approved once-daily use of bromfenac 0.07% (PROLENSA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery.<xref rid="b32-opth-8-965" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In future clinical assessments, bromfenac 0.07% may be further evaluated in other ocular inflammatory disorders where NSAID use may be potentially beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Sharon M Klier, MD, for contributions to the protocol conception and design, and data acquisition; and Michelle Dalton, BS, ELS, for medical writing assistance.
