Secondary outcomes are lethal pulmonary hypoplasia, non-lethal pulmonary hypoplasia, survival till discharge from NICU, neonatal mortality, chronic lung disease (CLD), number of days ventilatory support, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) more than grade I, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) more than grade II, proven neonatal sepsis, gestational age at delivery, time to delivery, indication for delivery, successful amnioinfusion, placental abruption, cord prolapse, chorioamnionitis, fetal trauma due to puncture.

Respiratory complications are frequent after periviable PPROM, as well as sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Among respiratory complications pulmonary hypoplasia is an important cause of death. Other respiratory complications consist of pneumonia, Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).</p><p>PPROM before 26&#x000a0;weeks can delay lung development and can cause pulmonary hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a term to describe an altered pulmonary development characterised by a reduction in the number of pulmonary alveoli or in bronchial branching. In fetal lung development a critical interval, the canalicular phase, exists between 16 and 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation. Gestational age at rupture of membranes has been shown to be inversely related to the risk of pulmonary hypoplasia.</p><p>Pulmonary hypoplasia results in severe respiratory failure leading to early neonatal death, respiratory insufficiency with pulmonary haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or sub-acute lung disease, or sometimes in mild transient respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Perinatal mortality approximates 70% in most series (55-100%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In a review of 11 studies on midtrimester PPROM, the reported incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to midtrimester PPROM ranged widely from 1% to 48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A review of 6 studies on PPROM before 24&#x000a0;weeks reported an incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia of 19% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;120) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These percentages do not represent the true natural history, given the limitations of these reviews, summarising only retrospective cohorts from tertiary care centres. The wide range in prevalence is partly explained by the absence of uniform pathological and clinical definitions. Histological findings form the basis of the diagnosis pulmonary hypoplasia, however complete autopsy data were often not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. An international recognized definition of pulmonary hypoplasia is lacking, and it rather is a diagnosis by exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Congenital pneumonia, infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and pulmonary hypoplasia sometimes occur simultaneously, and have overlapping symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, there were methodological problems in the reviews, such as differences in follow-up and lack of blinded assessment of the endpoints.</p><p>Pregnancies complicated by midtrimester PPROM are associated with high immediate and long-term costs. These are caused by extended maternal hospital admissions, increased incidence of premature delivery, and frequent neonatal complications hereafter requiring NICU-admission.</p><p>Amnioinfusion might improve fetal outcome by preventing pulmonary hypoplasia, by preventing neurological complications, increasing time to delivery interval, and improving fetal biophysical profile through prevention of umbilical cord compression. It also might prevent fetal deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Porat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reviewed serial transabdominal amnioinfusion and meta-analysed observational as wel as randomised studies. The only two included randomised studies however were on women with PPROM between 24 and 34&#x000a0;weeks whereas the critical interval for development of pulmonary hypoplasia, the canalicular phase, exists between 16 and 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation. One quasi-randomised study included women with PPROM before 24&#x000a0;weeks. There were two observational studies on PPROM before 24&#x000a0;weeks. Recently, Roberts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] published the only randomized trial on PPROM between 16 and 24&#x000a0;weeks. They found no difference in the primary outcome (perinatal mortality 19/28 vs. 19/28; RR 1.0; 95% CI0.70-1.43), maternal or neonatal morbidity. The observed difference in long term outcome (4/28 morbidity free survival at 2&#x000a0;years in the treatment group vs 0/28 in the group with expectant management) justifies further study.</p><p>Adverse events after antepartum transabdominal amnioinfusion have been reported. It is not clear which adverse effects are to be attributed to the procedure rather than to the condition of PPROM and oligohydramnios, since conservatively managed PPROM carries high risks inherent to the condition itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Waters and Mercer recently reviewed perinatal mortality after conservatively managed PPROM &#x0003c;26&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Meta-analysis of 6 studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;275) shows a perinatal mortality of 54%, (if restricted to &#x0003c;24&#x000a0;weeks this incidence is 57%). These data are biased by the fact that patients not amenable to continued expectant management were often excluded (i.e. stillbirths, pregnancy terminations), and therefore survival is likely to be overestimated.</p><p>A retrospective analysis by Van der Heijden et al. on outcome after PPROM in three tertiary centres in The Netherlands was recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Their study included 14 multiple pregnancies. When these were excluded, in 164 singleton pregnancies with PROM before 24&#x000a0;weeks there was a perinatal mortality of 71% Of all mortality 38% occurred in the neonatal period (data not published). It can be questioned whether all pregnancies with PROM &#x0003c;24&#x000a0;weeks have been referred. Lethal pulmonary hypoplasia was documented in only 16 cases (10%), which is probably an underestimation as discussed before (personal communication by Van der Heijden).</p><p>In summary, midtrimester PPROM is associated with a high incidence of perinatal mortality, pulmonary hypoplasia and other neonatal complications. Exact incidences are difficult to obtain because of selection biases, probably leading to substantial underreporting. Diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia is difficult due to overlapping symptoms and absence of uniform definitions. Amnioinfusion might be beneficial, however there is no solid evidence to incorporate this seemingly safe procedure in daily practice. Therefore we believe there is the need to assess the role of amnioinfusion after midtrimester PPROM. We are currently conducting a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. This study is conducted within the Dutch Obstetric Consortium, a collaborative effort of obstetric clinics in The Netherlands to perform clinical trials. Seven Dutch perinatal centres with NICU facilities participate in this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of amnioinfusion compared to expectant management for relieving oligohydramnios in women with midtrimester PPROM occurring before 24&#x000a0;weeks gestational age in reducing perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidities.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants/eligibility criteria</title><p>All women with a singleton pregnancy who are first diagnosed between 16 and 24&#x000a0;weeks gestational age with oligohydramnios secondary to PPROM, at least 72&#x000a0;hours after PPROM was diagnosed, but no longer than 21&#x000a0;days after the diagnosis of oligohydramnios, are eligible for the trial. Women with oligohydramnios secondary to iatrogenic PPROM are also eligible.</p><p>We will exclude women with signs of uterine contractions, (8 uterine contractions per hour) intrauterine infection (temperature&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;38&#x000b0;C plus fetal tachycardia or uterine tenderness or foul/purulent amniotic fluid), a pregnancy complication (hypertension, HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia or other) in which there is a need for termination of pregnancy, placental or major structural fetal anomalies, signs of cervical incompetence (visible cervical dilatation or a cervical length of &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;mm), and women whose child has signs of fetal distress (abnormal biophysical profile).</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures, recruitment, randomisation and collection of data</title><p>The research nurse and/or the staff of participating hospitals will identify eligible women. Prior to randomisation, in all patients amniotic fluid loss will be objectified by sterile speculum examination for visible fluid loss from the cervical os, by a nitrazine- and/or ferning test. Speculum examination will be performed to exclude signs of cervical incompetence (visible dilatation). Hereafter patients will undergo an ultrasound examination to determine the single deepest pocket (SDP) of amniotic fluid and to exclude placental and or fetal structural anomalies. At this time ultrasound measurements used in the prediction of pulmonary hypoplasia - TC/AC (thoracic circumference/abdominal circumference), TC/FL (thoracic circumference/femur length), Doppler measurement of pulmonary artery proximal branch peak systolic velocity, 3D lung volume measurement -, will be performed by specialized personnel.</p><p>If oligohydramnios is present (SDP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;cm) patients will be counselled for the study. Randomisation, will take place immediately after informed consent has been obtained, at least 72&#x000a0;hours after diagnosis of PPROM.

The investigators will publish the results of the study in a peer reviewed medical journal as soon as appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention being evaluated is trans-abdominal amnioinfusion. After sterile preparation of the abdomen, a pocket of fluid is identified by ultrasound guidance after which a needle is advanced into this pocket. After insuring proper placement by withdrawing a small amount of fluid, the desired volume of fluid (Ringers lactate), defined by the number of weeks of gestational age times 10 millilitres, is infused manually. This procedure is repeated on a weekly basis if oligohydramnios re-occurs or persists.</p><p>If, after initial amnioinfusion, uterine contractions and signs of infection have been excluded, discharge is optional. Fluid retention will be assessed by measurement of SDP 48&#x02013;72&#x000a0;hours after first amnioinfusion. Five to seven days after initial amnioinfusion, SDP is reassessed, as well as infection parameters (white cell count and CRP). Measurement of TC/AC, TC/FL, Doppler measurement, 3D lung volume measurement, will be performed by specialised personnel. If persisting or re-occurring oligohydramnios is diagnosed, amnioinfusion will be repeated. The same procedure will be repeated on a weekly basis until 28&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation.</p><p>Patients randomised to expectant management will undergo the same clinical and ultrasound examination bi-weekly (once a week measurement of SDP, TC/AC, TC/FL, Doppler, 3D lung volume, infection parameters, and on the second weekly visit assessment of fetal well-being and measurement of SDP). These patients can, if signs of premature labour or infection have been excluded, at the discretion of the local physician, be discharged as well (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All discharged patients will be instructed to take their temperature twice daily and contact the hospital in case of fever (temperature&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;37.8&#x000b0;C, rectally measured) or suspected infection. Patients with midtrimester PPROM are usually hospitalised after 24&#x000a0;weeks in a tertiary centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of co-intervention</title><p>Corticosteroids are given according to local protocol, usage will be recorded in the case report form.

Using a two-sided test, with a &#x003b2;-error of 0.20 and an &#x003b1;-error of 0.05 a sample size of 56 women (28 in each arm) is needed.</p><p>An interim analysis is planned after the follow up data of the first 28 women that have been included. The analysis will be performed using the O&#x02019;Brien-Flemming alpha spending function meaning a nominal P value of less than 0.005 will be considered to indicate statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. If there is a significant difference in the primary outcome the trial will be stopped.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis of the randomised clinical trial will be performed on an intention-to-treat principle. The differences between the amnioinfusion and expectant management will be assessed by calculating the ratio of the outcome rates in the two groups. Hence, the measure of association is a relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated using a log-binomial model. Time to delivery will be evaluated by Cox proportional hazard analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimates and tested with a log rank test.</p><p>In case of equivalence between outcomes, the analysis will be repeated on an &#x0201c;as-treated&#x0201d; basis. Subsequently, primary and secondary outcomes will be described in a subgroup of women with successful amnioinfusion (retention of infused fluid first 48&#x000a0;hours). All analyses will be adjusted for the fact that an interim analysis will be performed using the O&#x02019;Brien-Flemming alpha spending function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consequently, a nominal P value of less than 0.049 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are signs that pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios after midtrimester PPROM might benefit from amnioinfusion. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend this procedure. The benefits might be increased neonatal survival and decreased pulmonary complications, especially pulmonary hypoplasia. Potential harms include placental abruption, premature labour and delivery, cord prolapse, chorioamnionitis, fetal loss, fetal trauma due to puncture. Of these, only the last mentioned is not a known potential complication of the underlying condition itself as well (midtrimester PPROM). Expectant management indeed carries these same risks. At present, there is no evidence on which a rational choice between expectant management or therapeutic amnioifusion can be based.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>3D: 3-dimensional; AC: Abdominal circumference; AE: Adverse event; BPD: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia; CCU: Cardiac care unit; CLD: Chronic lung disease; CRP: C-reactive protein; CTG: Cardiotocography; DSMB: Data Safety Monitoring Board; FL: Femur length; GA: Gestational age; IRDS: Infant respiratory distress syndrome; IVH: Intraventricular haemorrhage; METC: Medical research ethics committee (MREC); in Dutch: medisch ethische toetsingscommissie (METC); NEC: Necrotizing enterocolitis; NICU: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PPROM: Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes; PVL: Periventricular leucomalacia; SAE: Serious adverse event; SDP: Single deepest pocket (amniotic fluid); TC: Thoracic circumference; US: Ultrasound; WMO: Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (Wet Medisch-wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met Mensen).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ASPvT, DPvdH, EP, CW, JGN, SvK, ES, ALMM and BWM are member of the PPROMEXIL study group and were involved in conception and design of the study.
