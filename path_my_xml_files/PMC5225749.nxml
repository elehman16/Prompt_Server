It may also be influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Common conditions that cause CPP are endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, adenomyosis, fibroids, adhesions, celiac disease, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, fibromyalgia, degenerative disk disease, and chronic urinary tract infection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The common presentations of CPP are noncyclic lower abdominal pain seen in about 80% of women, congestive dysmenorrhea in 26%, and pelvic tenderness in 20% of cases.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Symptoms of depression, anxiety, low QOL, low productivity, decreased energy, sexual dysfunction, and relationship problems are also present in these patients of CPP.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The treatment of CPP entails two aspects, one is the treatment of chronic pain, and the other is the treatment of the underlying cause. In most cases, an effective treatment can be achieved by using both approaches. The treatment can be medical or surgical but for those women in whom a definitive diagnosis cannot be reached (61% of women with CPP reported that the etiology was unknown), it requires a multidisciplinary approach, i.e., addressing dietary, social, environmental, and psychological factors in addition to standard medical therapy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Yoga is an effective, time-tested method for improving overall health and managing psychosomatic and chronic degenerative disorders.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Practicing yoga regularly has shown improvement in QOL and pain reduction in chronic low back pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain (neck pain and lower back pain) was found to be lower in dentists with regular yoga practice as compared to dentists practicing other physical activities or with no physical activity.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Yoga therapy has shown a reduction in severity and duration of pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Literature survey however has shown a paucity of studies on the beneficial effects of yoga on pain and QOL in females with CPP.</p><p>We hypothesized that the use of yogic intervention used along with conventional therapy in CPP patients will help in improving visual analog scale (VAS) score and QOL as compared to conventional therapy alone.

Eighty CPP patients were recruited from gynecology outpatient department. All subjects underwent complete physical and clinical assessment prior to the participation. Subjects with CPP were randomly divided into two groups Group I and Group II. Simple randomization was done using a computer-generated random number table, and allocation was done by sealed envelope technique. However, nine subjects in Group I could not come for follow-up and ten subjects in Group II showed poor compliance to the yoga regimen. Hence, we selected thirty subjects in each group to participate in our study. Prior to the participation, all the subjects were explained the purpose of study in detail and a written informed consent was taken. This research proposal was approved by the Institutional Research Protocol and Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Gender: Females</p><p>Age: 18&#x02013;45 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>

It is a unidimensional measurement tool that can be applied to measure pain intensity and pain relief.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The scale comprises a 10 cm straight line with verbal anchors that define boundaries. The score is obtained by measuring the distance in millimeters from left to right. It is quick and relatively easy to use.

In addition, it also includes two questions for &#x0201c;overall quality of life&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;general health&#x0201d; facets. The domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e., higher scores denote higher QOL). Responses are scored via five-point response scales with various anchor statements (e.g., from 1 [Very dissatisfied] or/[Very poor] to 5 [Very satisfied] or [Very good]). The WHOQOL-BREF can be scored in three ways; through raw scores and two transformation methods; the first that creates domain scores within the range of 4&#x02013;20 and the second that creates domain scores within the range of 0&#x02013;100. The internal consistency of WHOQOL-BREF ranged from 0.66 to 0.84 (Chronbach's alpha coefficient).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The WHOQOL-BREFs psychometric properties have been analyzed using cross-sectional data from 11,830 adults from 23 countries and are a valid assessment across cultures and socioeconomic status.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The Hindi version of the WHOQOL-BREF has been developed which can be used for intervention studies and drug trials.

However, no significant changes in VAS scores were seen in CPP patients receiving only conventional therapy (Group I). The difference in VAS scores between CPP patients on conventional therapy (Group I) and CPP patients on conventional + yoga therapy (Group II) postintervention were also significant. Decrease in VAS score is suggestive of decrease in pain intensity after 8 weeks of yoga therapy. Pain relief in gynecological conditions after yoga therapy has been reported in many studies. On extensive literature survey, we could not come across any of the study highlighting the role of yogic intervention on CPP patients. Hence, we do not have a similar study to compare our results. However, yoga nidra therapy of 6 months significantly reduced the pain symptoms in women with dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Moreover, practicing yoga poses (asana) significantly reduced severity and duration of dymenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Other studies showing the effect of yoga on other painful conditions are also available. Yoga therapy for 5 times, 4 weeks a week, significantly improved VAS score in patients with myofascial pain syndrome.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Practicing yoga asana for 4 weeks led to significant reduction of VAS scores in chronic low back pain patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Moreover, yoga training reduced the intensity and frequency of headaches in patients suffering from migraine.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] After 12 weeks of yoga intervention, which included various asana, women with chronic low back pain showed a significant reduction in VAS scores of pain, significant increase in back flexibility, and significant increase in brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). This increase in BDNF could be attributed to pain reduction in patients with chronic pain.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Yoga therapy enhances the tone of muscles and helps in releasing of muscle tension. Relaxation exercises performed during yoga leads to reduction of stress-related muscle tension and also modify neurobiological pain perception which could be a mechanism for pain reduction.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Increase in BDNF and improvements in the pelvic muscle tone after yoga therapy might be responsible for pain relief in CPP patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Yoga and quality of life in chronic pelvic pain patients</title><p>There was a significant improvement in QOL after 8 weeks of yoga therapy. Improvement was seen in all domains, i.e., physical, psychological, social, and environmental domain. However, no significant change in QOL scores was seen in CPP patients receiving only conventional therapy (Group I). The difference in QOL scores between CPP patients on conventional therapy (Group I) and CPP patients on conventional + yoga intervention (Group II) posttreatment was also significant in physical, psychological, and social domain. Studies have shown that practicing yoga causes a significant improvement of QOL not only in painful conditions but also in various other medical illnesses. It was seen that yogic intervention (comprising of asana, pranayama, meditation, and lectures on yoga philosophy) in patients with chronic low back pain led to improvement in the QOL in all the four domains of WHOQOL-BREF.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Yoga training was helpful in improving QOL in all domains of women with perimenopausal symptoms.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Reduction in the pain intensity and frequency might have led to the improvement of QOL in physical domain and increase in brain GABA levels may be a cause for psychological and social QOL improvement.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Hence, improvement in pelvic and abdominal muscle tone and increase in the levels of BDNF along with brain GABA levels (as shown by previous studies) by yoga therapy may perhaps be attributed for the significant reduction in VAS score and improvement in QOL in CPP patients on yoga therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From this study, it can be concluded that after 8 weeks of yoga therapy, Group II CPP subjects had lesser intensity of pain as shown by significantly reduced VAS scores and improved QOL with a significant increase in physical, psychological, and social domain scores of WHOQOL-BREF. Hence, yoga regimen used in our study can be a used as add-on treatment for the pain relief and for improving QOL in patients of CPP. Better pain management with yoga can help reduce dependence on NSAIDS and its associated side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Limitations of our study</title><p>This study was conducted in limited time period and the assessment of the parameters was done twice before and after study. If the study had been of a longer duration, multiple assessments would have been possible at regular intervals and then the trends of changes and long-term effects on yoga on CPP patients could have been determined. Further, we could not assess the levels of biochemical markers, i.e., brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and GABA because of resource crunch. Levels of these markers would have helped us to validate our findings more scientifically. Further work needs to be done in this field with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up to increase the efficacy and therapeutic value of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>My sincere thanks to Dr. Jyoti Chauhan, Mr. Ashish Mishra, Dr. Krishan Kumar Goswami, and Mr. Tika Ram at Yoga and Naturopathy OPD and Lifestyle Intervention Center, UCMS and GTB Hospital, Delhi under Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, Ministry of AYUSH for teaching and supervising the subjects doing yoga.
