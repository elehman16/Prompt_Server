Many do not tolerate oral iron or adequately respond. Intravenous (IV) iron is commonly used as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; data on the use of IV iron monotherapy in these patients are limited. This study aimed to evaluate IV ferumoxytol for the treatment of cancer patients with IDA with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy or in whom oral iron could not be used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This post hoc analysis of pooled data from two multicenter, randomized, controlled, Phase III trials evaluating IV ferumoxytol (510 mg &#x000d7;2) vs placebo or iron sucrose (200 mg &#x000d7;5) included a subgroup of 98 patients with cancer that the investigator identified as the primary cause of their IDA, or with cancer whose IDA was attributed to another comorbid condition (ferumoxytol, n=75; iron sucrose, n=13; placebo, n=10). Gastrointestinal cancers were most common (42), followed by breast (14), cervix (ten), and lung (nine). The primary endpoint was the mean change in hemoglobin (Hgb) from baseline to week 5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 5, both ferumoxytol and iron sucrose produced significant increases in Hgb from baseline (1.8 g/dL [<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001] and 1.9 g/dL [<italic>P</italic>=0.002], respectively). During the studies, 45 patients received chemotherapy, 19 with platinum-based regimens. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses were neither increased &#x0003e;20% nor initiated in any treatment group. Overall rates of adverse events and serious adverse events in the cancer subgroup mirrored those in the overall study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monotherapy with IV iron appears to be an effective option for cancer patients with IDA who do not respond to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>ferumoxytol</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>intravenous iron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Cancer- and Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia report that 32%&#x02013;60% of patients with cancer have iron deficiency.<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Anemia is frequently observed as a comorbidity in patients with cancer, and it is estimated that 30%&#x02013;90% of patients with cancer are also anemic.<xref rid="b2-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients with anemia have poorer rates of survival and local tumor control compared with similar non-anemic cancer patients.<xref rid="b2-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The causes of anemia in patients with cancer may be difficult to evaluate as they are often multifactorial and may result from bleeding, nutritional deficiencies, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, hereditary disease, anemia of chronic disease, or a combination of these comorbidities.<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, malignant cancer cells may exacerbate anemia through various mechanisms of action including direct suppression of hematopoiesis via bone marrow infiltration or cytokine-induced suppression of iron sequestration (ie, cancer-related inflammation).<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Anemia may also result from anticancer therapies, including antineoplastic drugs (via either direct myelotoxicity<xref rid="b4-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or diminished renal erythropoietin production because of nephrotoxicity [eg, cisplatin]).<xref rid="b6-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Newer targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors can also induce anemia, although mechanisms are not fully established.<xref rid="b8-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Possible explanations include an effect on hematopoiesis via FLT3 and c-Kit receptor blockade, chronic bleeding resulting from anti-angiogenic drugs, and thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.<xref rid="b8-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Anemia is typically managed by the treatment of its underlying cause, transfusion with packed red blood cells, or the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which may be used in conjunction with iron supplementation.<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> NCCN guidelines recommend considering supplementation with intravenous (IV; preferred) or oral iron without an ESA for patients with absolute iron deficiency, defined by the NCCN as serum ferritin levels &#x0003c;30 ng/mL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels &#x0003c;20%.<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> If oral iron is used and no response is seen after 4 weeks, a trial of IV iron should be considered.

Both studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments and endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint of this subgroup analysis was the mean change in Hgb from baseline to week 5. Other efficacy endpoints included the mean change in Hgb from baseline at earlier time points, receipt of blood transfusion, and changes in patient-reported fatigue. Safety was assessed throughout the 5-week follow-up period and included the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), study drug-related adverse events (AEs) and SAEs, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, as well as AEs of special interest (predefined as moderate-to-severe hypotension occurring on the day of dosing and moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions), composite cardiovascular AEs (predefined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, moderate-to-severe hypertension, and hospitalization due to any cardiovascular event), and deaths. AEs were assessed by the investigators for severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and potential relationship to study medication. AEs were considered &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; if they resulted in death, were life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or were considered an important medical event (ie, one that was not immediately life-threatening but clearly jeopardized the patient and/or required intervention). Laboratory and safety data were pooled for this analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The safety population included all randomized patients who had any exposure to the study drug and was based on actual treatment received. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included any randomized patient who had any exposure to the study drug (IV ferumoxytol, IV iron sucrose, IV saline placebo) and was based upon randomized treatment assignment. The safety and ITT populations were identical in this analysis. Demographics and baseline characteristics were compared between treatment groups using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables (sex, race, type of cancer, history of IV iron use, and Hgb category) and analysis of variance for continuous variables (Hgb, TSAT, and serum ferritin). In the overall study population, changes from baseline in continuous variables were compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance controlling for baseline Hgb value, using an imputed value of 0 for change from baseline for missing post-baseline values. In this cancer subgroup analysis, within-group differences in change from baseline Hgb and FACIT-F were analyzed with a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.

Mean increase in Hgb from baseline to week 5 for the total pooled populations was 2.7 g/dL for both ferumoxytol and iron sucrose treatment arms.

The changes among patients with cancer were generally similar to those seen for the overall patient populations in these studies for TSAT, while the changes for ferritin were somewhat greater among patients with cancer. Mean TSAT for the total pooled populations in these studies increased from 6.7% at baseline to 20.9% at week 5 in the IV ferumoxytol group and from 5.5% at baseline to 18.0% at week 5 in the iron sucrose group, compared with a small change for those in the placebo group (5.4% to 5.8%, respectively). For the total pooled populations, median ferritin levels increased from 4.5 ng/mL at baseline in both the IV ferumoxytol and iron sucrose groups to 291.0 ng/mL and 145.0 ng/mL, respectively, at week 2, decreasing to 73.1 ng/mL and 65.2 ng/mL, respectively, at week 5.</p><p>Among the cancer subgroup, one patient in the IV ferumoxytol and one patient in the placebo group continued to receive treatment with an ESA (epoetin alfa) during the study.

Two SAEs (hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction) in IV ferumoxytol-treated patients with cancer were considered drug related. There was one patient death in the ferumoxytol treatment group (duodenal obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor) that was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.

The results indicate that cancer patients with IDA, who had not tolerated or responded to oral iron, responded to both IV ferumoxytol and iron sucrose with a significant increase from baseline in Hgb (1.8 g/dL and 1.9 g/dL, respectively). Similar to the overall study population, the increase in Hgb was accompanied by a significant improvement in patient-reported fatigue. Among the ferumoxytol treatment group, the lower bound CI of change from baseline (mean, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.8, 8.8); <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) was above the 3-point minimum important difference for the FACIT-F scale, suggesting a clinically meaningful improvement.</p><p>The increase in mean Hgb at week 5 was somewhat lower in the current post hoc analysis of the pooled cancer patient subpopulation for patients receiving IV ferumoxytol (ie, 1.8 g/dL) than that observed for the total patient population in the original Studies 1 and 2 (2.7 g/dL in each).<xref rid="b14-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Similar results were seen for patients receiving iron sucrose with a smaller, but still substantial, mean increase in Hgb of 1.9 g/dL from baseline to week 5 for the cancer patient subpopulation compared with an increase of 2.4 g/dL for the total patient population in the original Study 2 publication.<xref rid="b14-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In general, cancer patients with anemia of inflammation<xref rid="b1-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> are expected to achieve a much smaller increase in Hgb than other patient groups. Notably, mean serum ferritin levels among those in the cancer subgroup receiving ferumoxytol were substantially higher at baseline (121 ng/mL) compared with levels in the overall populations in Study 1 (22.6 ng/mL)<xref rid="b15-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Study 2 (24.5 ng/mL).<xref rid="b14-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The higher baseline ferritin values in patients with cancer reflects the fact that ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that can be artificially elevated in inflammatory conditions and underscores its limited utility as a marker of IDA in patients with chronic disease.</p><p>For ferumoxytol-treated patients, the overall incidence of AEs was somewhat higher in the cancer subgroup compared with the pooled overall study population; however, treatment-related AEs tended to be lower among those in the cancer subgroup. There were too few patients in the cancer subgroup receiving either iron sucrose or placebo to make meaningful comparisons regarding relative rates of AEs between treatment groups. There was a higher incidence of serious AEs overall in the cancer subgroup, although most of these events were not considered related to study treatment. Similarly, a slightly greater proportion of patients with cancer receiving ferumoxytol or iron sucrose had AEs of special interest, defined as hypotension or hypersensitivity, compared with patients in the pooled overall study population, although the absolute numbers were small. Rates of individual AEs for patients receiving IV ferumoxytol were generally similar between the cancer subgroup and the pooled overall study population, with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea (all 5.3%) most common in the cancer subgroup and headache, nausea, and dizziness (5.3%, 3.8%, and 3.3%, respectively) most common in the pooled overall study population.</p><p>Although ESAs are recommended for the treatment of CIA, only 40%&#x02013;70% of patients have been shown to respond to ESAs with a substantial increase in Hgb.<xref rid="b16-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition, ESA therapy is associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism.<xref rid="b17-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The mechanism underlying this increased risk has not been established; however, results from a study by Henry et al suggest that ESA-associated venous thromboembolism in patients with CIA may be related, at least in part, to the thrombocytosis caused by ESA-induced iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and that this effect may be countered by IV iron supplementation.<xref rid="b18-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Several clinical trials have shown that IV iron improves response rates when coadministered with an ESA and may avoid iron-restricted erythropoiesis.<xref rid="b16-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b19-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, there are few randomized studies evaluating the use of IV iron mono-therapy in patients with anemia and cancer. Two randomized studies evaluated the use of iron monotherapy (iron sucrose) in patients with anemia and gynecologic cancer; however, these were very small, including a total of 52 patients receiving iron therapy.<xref rid="b21-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In one study, treatment with IV iron sucrose was shown to reduce the incidence of red blood cell transfusion among patients with anemia and gynecologic cancer receiving platinum-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving oral iron (5/22 vs 14/22 patients [22.7% vs 63.6%], respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="b22-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Significantly higher mean Hgb and hematocrit levels were reported after the first week of treatment among patients receiving IV iron sucrose compared with those receiving oral iron therapy, which persisted until the next cycle of chemotherapy. Similar results were shown in an earlier study evaluating monotherapy with IV iron sucrose in 30 patients with anemia and cervical cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy compared with 45 patients receiving no iron therapy.<xref rid="b21-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In that study, administration of IV iron sucrose resulted in reduced red blood cell transfusions (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) and reduced mean transfusion volume (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). A randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of IV iron isomaltoside with oral ferrous sulfate in patients with cancer and anemia found that iron isomaltoside was noninferior to oral iron in change in Hgb concentration from baseline to week 4 (difference estimate 0.016, 95% CI &#x02212;0.26 to 0.29, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), with no significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event noted between treatment groups (72% [165/229] in the iron isomaltoside group vs 70% [78/112] in the oral iron group).<xref rid="b23-jbm-8-199" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Results from the current study provide additional evidence of the efficacy and safety of IV iron therapy in cancer populations.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the retrospective design and the small number of patients in the iron sucrose and placebo groups, which limits the ability to draw any comparative conclusions. A strength of this study is that the vast majority of patients (98%) did not receive concomitant ESAs. While none of the published clinical trials of IV iron in cancer-related anemia have shown any increase in tumor progression among patients receiving IV iron treatment, long-term follow-up data are still lacking. Larger, longer term studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety results and further define the responses achievable with iron monotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the current study indicate that cancer patients with IDA, who had not tolerated or responded to oral iron, respond to both IV ferumoxytol and iron sucrose with a significant increase in Hgb. Based on these findings, IV iron monotherapy may offer a potentially effective treatment option for the management of IDA in patients with cancer who do not respond to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><sec><title>Names of each approving institutional review board and ethics committee</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ajou University Hospital Institutional Review Board SF, annex, Ajou University Hospital, Korea;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Arrowhead Regional Medical Center Institutional Review Board, USA;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Centre For Digestive Diseases Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Christiana Care Health Services Institutional Review Board, USA;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Columbus Regional Healthcare System, USA;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Azienda Ospedaliera - Universita di Padova, Italy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comite de Protection des Personnes Ile de France X, France;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comite Etico de Investigacion Clinica Centro Medico Teknon, Spain;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dispur Hospitals Ethics Committee, India;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethics Committee for Clinical Research at Development Society of Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital, Latvia;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethics Committee Kodlikeri Memorial Hospital (K.M.H) &#x00026; CIIGMA Hospital, India;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethics Committee of Bangalore Medical College &#x00026; Research Institute and Associated Hospitals, India;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethics Committee Poona Hospital and Research Centre Poona Hospital and Research Centre, India;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethics Committee, Lifeline Multi Specialty Hospital No 5/639 Rajiv Gandhi Salai (OMR), India;</p></list-item><list-item><p>G.
