For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.comObjective. To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and corticosteroid use in patients with moderate to severely active SLE enrolled in two international, multicentre, randomized controlled trials of epratuzumab (ALLEVIATE-1 and -2) and a long-term extension study (SL0006).Methods. Ninety ALLEVIATE patients (43% BILAG A, mean BILAG score 13.2) were randomized to receive 360 mg/m2 (n = 42) or 720 mg/m2 (n = 11) epratuzumab or placebo (n = 37), plus standard of care, in 12-week cycles. Corticosteroid use, patient and physician global assessments of disease activity (PtGA and PGA) and 36-item Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36) results were recorded at baseline and every 4 weeks. Both trials were prematurely discontinued due to a drug supply interruption; patients followed for &#x02265;6 months were analysed. Twenty-nine patients continued in SL0006, with interim analysis at a median exposure of 120 (range 13&#x02013;184) weeks.Results. At week 12, proportions of patients with a PGA &#x02265;20% above baseline or with a PtGA improvement greater than or equal to the minimum clinically important difference were higher in the epratuzumab arms than the placebo arm. PGA and PtGA improvements were sustained but did not reach statistical significance. At week 24, mean cumulative corticosteroid doses with epratuzumab 360 and 720 mg/m2 were 1051 and 1973 mg less than placebo (P = 0.034 and 0.081, respectively). At week 48, SF-36 scores approached or exceeded US age- and gender-matched norms in five domains with the 360 mg/m2 treatment. Improvements were maintained in SL0006 over &#x0223c;2 years.Conclusion. Epratuzumab treatment produced clinically meaningful and sustained improvements in PGA, PtGA and HRQOL and reductions in corticosteroid doses.epratuzumabCD22ALLEVIATElupusSLEHRQOLSF-36corticosteroidsclinical trialmonoclonal antibody) --><volume>53</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>502</fpage><lpage>511</lpage><history><date date-type="received"><day>6</day><month>6</month><year>2012</year></date><date date-type="rev-recd"><day>27</day><month>9</month><year>2013</year></date></history><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; The Author 2013.

Patient survival has improved over the past two decades, making outcome measures other than mortality increasingly important [<xref rid="ket378-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, developing effective treatments for SLE has proved difficult [<xref rid="ket378-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has improved little in recent years [<xref rid="ket378-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. HRQOL, including physical, social and emotional well-being, is recommended by OMERACT as a domain for assessment in SLE randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref rid="ket378-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>].</p><p>Patients with SLE report worse HRQOL than healthy controls [<xref rid="ket378-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or those with other chronic diseases, such as coronary artery disease [<xref rid="ket378-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A contributing factor is that currently available treatments are often associated with adverse effects, which often can be severe [<xref rid="ket378-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the Lupus European Online survey, 2070 patients with SLE reported impairments in all domains of the Lupus Quality of Life questionnaire, including 82.5% with fatigue [<xref rid="ket378-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In another survey by the Lupus Foundation of America and Lupus Europe in 2009 in 914 self-identified lupus patients, 49.3% of respondents indicated they were satisfied or very satisfied with their current treatment regimen, with a majority reporting that side effects, especially those associated with the use of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives reduced their physical well-being (88.4%) and negatively impacted everyday activities (82.1%) [<xref rid="ket378-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In five RCTs, patients with SLE reported large decreases in HRQOL at baseline by the 36-item Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form questionnaire (SF-36). Lower scores across all domains were highly correlated with a history of renal disease, presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, higher disease activity by Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) and/or SLEDAI scores, hypocomplementaemia, African American ethnicity and age [<xref rid="ket378-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There is a clear need for new therapies for SLE. However, the complexity and heterogeneous manifestations of SLE, and its variable clinical course, pose challenges in the assessment of disease activity and clinical trial design [<xref rid="ket378-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One promising new therapeutic target is CD22, a 135-kDa transmembrane sialoglycoprotein that is differentially expressed during B cell differentiation and regulates B cell activation and interaction with T cells [<xref rid="ket378-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Epratuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD22, has shown evidence of therapeutic potential in SLE [<xref rid="ket378-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], presumably modulating proliferation and trafficking of activated B cells [<xref rid="ket378-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Two similarly designed, international, multicentre RCTs [ALLEVIATE-1 (SL0003) and ALLEVIATE-2 (SL0004)] were initiated in patients with moderate to severely active SLE and were prematurely discontinued due to interruption of the drug supply. Available data were pooled to increase the number of observations to enable preliminary analyses of efficacy, safety and HRQOL. The primary efficacy and safety results are described in a separate manuscript [<xref rid="ket378-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Patients at sites in the USA who participated in either RCT were allowed inclusion in an open-label, long-term safety study, SL0006.

For ALLEVIATE-1, patients were also excluded if they had active severe central nervous system and/or renal disease (BILAG A). For ALLEVIATE-2, patients were excluded if they had a BILAG A score in any organ system.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>The ALLEVIATE trials were international, multicentre, 48-week, phase II/III RCTs. The study designs were almost identical with regard to visit intervals, treatment cycles and scheduled assessments of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. ALLEVIATE-1 was conducted at 16 sites in six countries (Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA) and ALLEVIATE-2 was conducted at 28 sites in six countries (Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA). Patients in ALLEVIATE-1 were randomized to either standard of care (SOC) plus repeated administrations of 360 or 720 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of epratuzumab or placebo (1:1:1). Patients in ALLEVIATE-2 were randomized to SOC plus repeated administrations of epratuzumab 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or placebo (1:1). In both RCTs, epratuzumab or placebo were administered intravenously in 12-week cycles for up to 48 weeks (four infusions at weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3 for cycle 1; two infusions at weeks 0 and 1 for subsequent cycles).</p><p>At study entry, patients initiated a protocol-prescribed corticosteroid regimen and continued SOC without change. For ALLEVIATE-1, patients received a flare regimen of oral or i.v. corticosteroids (1 g methylprednisolone, 150 mg dexamethasone, or equivalent) administered three times in &#x0003c;1 week, followed by oral corticosteroids. The oral corticosteroid dose was selected by the investigator on an individual patient basis (0.5&#x02013;0.8 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent, not exceeding 60 mg/day), with tapering from 4 weeks onwards as clinically indicated, and a goal of 7.5&#x02013;10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) by weeks 20 and 24. In ALLEVIATE-2, patients increased their oral steroid dosage by 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), again maintained for &#x02265;4 weeks, with a goal of 5&#x02013;7.5 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) by weeks 20 and 24. No other means of corticosteroid administration were allowed in this study.</p><p>Recruitment started in the spring of 2005. Dosing and enrolment in both trials were prematurely discontinued on 1 September 2006 due to interruption of the drug supply. Patients were followed for &#x02265;6 months. The primary endpoint was prospectively revised prior to unblinding, based on combined data from the two RCTs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical efficacy endpoints</title><p>Disease activity in each trial was measured every 4 weeks by BILAG and centrally graded by an independent, blinded reviewer [<xref rid="ket378-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The pre-specified three-category primary efficacy endpoint in both RCTs was revised to the BILAG response at week 12 before the trials were unblinded. The BILAG response required all BILAG A scores at entry reduced to a B or lower, or both BILAG B scores at entry reduced to C or lower, with no new BILAG A and less than two new BILAG B scores in other organ systems; plus no new or increased use of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressants above baseline dose before week 12.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included PGA and PtGA, scored on a category scale of 1&#x02013;5 (1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good, 5 = very good), at 4-week intervals throughout the study. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis of the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the PtGA was defined as an improvement of &#x02265;1 point (20%) on the 5-point Likert scale [<xref rid="ket378-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and &#x02265;5 points in SF-36 domain scores. The percentage of patients reporting such improvements by PtGA were compared with those considered &#x02265;20% improved by PGA.</p></sec><sec><title>HRQOL assessments</title><p>HRQOL was evaluated by SF-36, which includes eight domains: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and mental health (MH), scored from 0 to 100. Normalized and <italic>z</italic>-transformed domain scores are grouped into physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS, respectively) scores. PCS positively weights PF, RP, BP, GH and VT, while MCS positively weights VT, SF, RE and MH [<xref rid="ket378-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pre-specified endpoint evaluated was the percentage of patients reporting clinically meaningful improvements greater than or equal to MCID from baseline to week 48 in PCS (defined as changes of &#x02265;2.5 points overall and changes of &#x02265;5.0 points in eight domain scores of the SF-36); this was a planned endpoint, but was evaluated for the pooled ALLEVIATE population following termination of the studies.

The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of epratuzumab 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. All patients were assigned to receive this dose in 12-week maintenance cycles (two infusions, on weeks 0 and 1 of each cycle). Because of interruption of the drug supply, there was a median delay of 165 (range 1&#x02013;400) days between completion of the ALLEVIATE studies and entry into the SL0006. Safety and efficacy assessments in the SL0006, similar to those in the ALLEVIATE RCTs, were performed at 4-week intervals [<xref rid="ket378-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An interim analysis was conducted to obtain preliminary long-term safety and efficacy data, with a cut-off of 31 December 2009, representing a median 120 weeks of exposure (range 13&#x02013;184).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Ninety patients were randomized in the ALLEVIATE RCTs before the latter were prematurely terminated.

In this analysis, numeric differences between the epratuzumab arms and the placebo group in PGA, PtGA and SF-36 persisted throughout the study but did not achieve statistical significance. However, the magnitude of some of these changes suggests clinical relevance. For instance, in patients receiving epratuzumab 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, SF-36 scores at week 48 met or exceeded age- and gender-matched norms in five domains in those receiving epratuzumab 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, despite low baseline scores [<xref rid="ket378-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Improvements in SF-36 domain scores were maintained over the 2 years of follow-up in SL0006.</p><p>In addition, at week 24 in the two ALLEVIATE trials, more patients met the pre-specified corticosteroid dose reduction criterion in the epratuzumab groups than the placebo group. Differences in cumulative corticosteroid doses between epratuzumab 360 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and placebo at week 24 were also statistically significant, which would be expected to reduce the adverse effect burden of treatment. Most patients also experienced further reductions in corticosteroid use during SL0006.</p><p>The outcomes of the analyses reported here are consistent with the primary efficacy and safety results of the ALLEVIATE RCTs [<xref rid="ket378-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Of interest, given prior recognized discordance, patients and physicians reported similar numbers, with &#x02265;20% improvement in disease activity. The correspondence between these measurements is notable: patient-reported outcomes are strongly predictive of subsequent morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="ket378-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but frequently do not correlate well with physician assessments in SLE [<xref rid="ket378-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As evident in surveys of patients with SLE [<xref rid="ket378-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>], they focus more on functional limitations resulting from SLE and/or co-morbid conditions (such as fibromyalgia), whereas physicians focus on clinical and laboratory assessments [<xref rid="ket378-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In surveys, patients also consistently report dissatisfaction with their treatment, in particular with adverse effects associated with corticosteroid use [<xref rid="ket378-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], ubiquitous in patients with moderate to severely active disease [<xref rid="ket378-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Although regulatory agencies encourage the use of patient-reported outcomes in RCTs, they are often not included in SLE trials, in contrast with other chronic rheumatic diseases [<xref rid="ket378-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ket378-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The value of the assessment of HRQOL, especially in view of the broad impact of active disease on physical, emotional and social functioning, is significant and supports inclusion of patient-reported outcomes alongside measures of disease activity and damage in clinical trials.</p><p>The endpoints reported in this article are based on a pooled analysis of two interrupted RCTs. The two RCT protocols were very similar, HRQOL and corticosteroid dosing endpoints reported here were pre-specified and the combined analysis was revised before unblinding of the studies. Interpretation of the results is limited by differing inclusion criteria, the small number of patients involved and the fact that statistical analyses of secondary endpoints were not adjusted for multiple testing. Results from the SL0006 extension must also be interpreted with caution, given that it was open label and that 8 of 29 patients had previously received placebo.</p><p>Nevertheless, in these analyses epratuzumab treatment was associated with large and clinically meaningful improvements in HRQOL and PtGA of disease activity over weeks 12&#x02013;48 and clinically meaningful reductions in corticosteroid doses. These early improvements were maintained over 2 years of follow-up. Although most endpoints in these analyses did not achieve statistical significance, taken together with the primary efficacy and safety results, these data support continued development of epratuzumab as a treatment for patients with SLE. Phase 3 studies are under way in patients with moderate to severely active SLE.</p><p><boxed-text id="ket378-BOX1" position="float"><caption><title>Rheumatology key messages</title></caption><p>
