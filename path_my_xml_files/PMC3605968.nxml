The study began in May 2009 and the last subject involved finished the 18-month follow-up period in December 2011.</p><p>Women, 18 years old or older, with uterine fibroids were eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria were: symptomatic uterine fibroids, fertile age, use of a non-hormonal contraceptive method, willingness to keep a monthly record of all vaginal bleeding episodes during treatment and of mifepristone side effects, willingness to undergo ultrasound examination at each evaluation and monitoring check-up, and agreement to at least two endometrial biopsies being performed. Women who were pregnant or wished to become pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormonal contraception or who had received hormonal therapy in the last 3 months, had signs or symptoms of pelvic inflammation, adnexal masses, abnormal or unexplained uterine bleeding, suspicion or diagnosis of malignant neoplasm, signs or symptoms of mental illness, adrenal disease, sicklecell disease, hepatic disease renal disease, bleeding disorders, had any other serious illness, and/or anti-progesterone contraindications were excluded from participating. Once the inclusion and exclusion criteria had been evaluated and all information needed for participating in the study was obtained, subjects gave their informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Number of subjects</title><p>Endometrial thickness was the variable used to calculate the size of the study sample. Based on the results of a previous study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijwh-5-115">5</xref> in which 10 mg mifepristone was used to treat uterine fibroids, it was assumed that after 9 months&#x02019; treatment, the average endometrial thickness would be 14.0 &#x000b1; 3.5 mm and 11.0 &#x000b1; 3.5 mm in the 10 mg and 5 mg mifepristone groups, respectively. With 30 subjects in each treatment group, 60 subjects total, it would be possible to detect that difference with a Type I margin of error of 5% and power of 90%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijwh-5-115">17</xref> The study sample was increased by approximately 15% to 35 subjects in each group (70 study subjects in total) to offset potential dropouts during the mifepristone treatment course.</p></sec><sec><title>Assignation to treatment groups</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups according to the order of the assignation list drawn up by a computer. This was carried out as follows: staff not directly involved in the study prepared sealed opaque envelopes, numbered in consecutive order; each envelope contained a card indicating the treatment assigned to the subject. Once the subject had been evaluated in line with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and had signed informed consent, the envelope corresponding to the subject&#x02019;s numbered incorporation into the study was opened and she was included in the treatment group indicated on the card contained in the envelope &#x02013; &#x0201c;mifepristone A&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;mifepristone B,&#x0201d; where A corresponded to one of the mifepristone doses used in the study and B to the other. As the study was double blind, neither the doctor nor the subject knew which mifepristone group she had been assigned to.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>One group was treated with one 10 mg capsule of mifepristone per day taken orally over 9 months (the 10 mg group) and the other with one 5 mg capsule of mifepristone per day taken orally over 9 months (the 5 mg group). The mifepristone was supplied by Zizhu Pharmaceutical Laboratory, Beijing, People&#x02019;s Republic of China. The 5 mg and 10 mg capsules of mifepristone were prepared by L Amig&#x000f3; Pharmacy, Valencia, Spain. The 5 mg and 10 mg capsules of mifepristone were identical in appearance, size, shape, and color and could only be distinguished by a code that was destroyed once the study was over.</p></sec><sec><title>Examinations performed</title><p>Complete gynecological examination and abdominal or vaginal ultrasound examination of the uterus was undertaken in each subject before start of treatment, then after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment. The posttreatment follow-up did not form part of the clinical study protocol, so as not to excessively inconvenience the subjects by making them attend appointments at which they would not receive treatment and it was left up to them whether to attend control visits every 3 months once the mifepristone treatment was over.</p><p>The subjects who attended follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after termination of treatment were also subject to a complete gynecological examination plus abdominal and vaginal ultrasound examination of the uterus. Uterine volume was calculated using the formula 0.524 A &#x000d7; B &#x000d7; C, where A, B, and C are the diameters of the sphere in each of the three planes expressed in centimeters cubed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijwh-5-115">10</xref> If the subject had more than one myoma, the largest was measured and its variations were used to evaluate effectiveness. The total uterine volume was calibrated using the previously described formula. Ultrasonography was used to calculate endometrial thickness in millimeters. All ultrasound data were obtained with an Aloka SSD-4000 ultrasound diagnostic machine (Tokyo, Japan) and two doctors specializing in ultrasound carried out the measurements. Calibrations taken at different stages of the study were performed with the sonographers blind to previous measurements and knowing only the localization of the myoma to be measured in case the subject had more than one such myoma.</p><p>Blood samples were taken for hematological tests and hepatic function at the first visit and after 3, 6, and 9 months&#x02019; treatment; furthermore, hemoglobin (Hb) was evaluated at the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-month follow-up visits.

In each of these visits, the subject was given the mifepristone tablets that she needed until the following visit. Once treatment was over, the subjects were evaluated 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months later. During the follow-up period, no other treatment or placebo was administered that might shroud fibroid evolution or symptoms - thus, any chance of a placebo effect as a possible explication of an improvement sustained in the prevalence and intensity of symptoms was eliminated.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables to evaluate efficacy</title><p>Changes in endometrial thickness measured by ultrasound (mm) were evaluated at the beginning, at every visit during treatment, at the end, and every 3 months, up to a maximum of 18 months, following treatment. Mifepristone side effects - amenorrhea, hot flushes, nausea, sickness, vomiting, fatigue/tiredness &#x02013; were also assessed. Any changes in hepatic transaminases prior to initiating treatment and over 3-month intervals until finalization of treatment were evaluated. Frequency of endometrial change associated with the administration of PRMs (ie, PAECs), and incidence of irregular bleeding during treatment were also recorded. These variables were measured at each visit during treatment and until its termination.</p><p>It was agreed to define &#x0201c;amenorrhea&#x0201d; as the non-existence of bleeding greater than spotting; that is to say, subjects experiencing no heavier bleeding than spotting were considered to suffer from amenorrhea. &#x0201c;Irregular bleeding&#x0201d; was defined as bleeding including both spotting and more copious bleeding that did not surpass the subject&#x02019;s habitual menstrual intensity and duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables to evaluate effectiveness</title><p>The variables to evaluate efficacy were the percentage changes in fibroid and uterus volumes before treatment start, after 3, 6, and 9 months&#x02019; treatment, and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after termination of treatment. Other variables used to estimate efficacy were percentage changes in the prevalence of symptoms: pelvic pain, lumbar pain, rectal pain, pelvic pressure, urinary symptoms, dyspareunia, hypermenorrhea, and metrorrhagia. All these variables were measured in each of the study evaluation periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of quality of life</title><p>Subjects completed the UFS-QOL questionnaire before and after treatment.

It should be pointed out that at the beginning of the study, the average uterine volume was significantly greater in the 10 mg group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006). The average fibroid volume in the 10 mg group differed asymptotically from the 5 mg group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.073). At the beginning, the main differences between the two treatment groups were that there was a greater proportion of white subjects in the 10 mg group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007), a greater proportion of subserous fibroids in the 5 mg group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025) and of intramural fibroids in the 10 mg group (<italic>P</italic>= 0.026), and a greater proportion of pelvic pressure symptoms in the 10 mg group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><sec><title>Transaminases</title><p>The number of cases, 5/66 (7.6%), with elevated transaminases is comparable to the results published in other studies;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijwh-5-115">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijwh-5-115">7</xref> however, these five cases occurred between 6 and 9 months of treatment &#x02013; during the first 6 months, there was not a single case of elevated transaminases. Further, it should also be pointed out that the elevation was minimal, with the maximum score 56 UI for ASAT and 62.8 UI for ALAT. None of the five cases had simultaneous elevations of both transaminases; only one of the two was elevated at any one time, the other being inside normal values.</p></sec><sec><title>Hot flushes</title><p>In this study, hot flush frequency evaluated over the 3-month treatment periods was quite similar to that obtained in our previous studies in both treatment groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijwh-5-115">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijwh-5-115">6</xref> When this parameter was evaluated globally over the 9 months, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least the occasional hot flush rose to 41% and 25.5% in the 10 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively. While it is a limitation of this study that neither the intensity nor the duration of the hot flushes was measured, it should be noted that this symptom did not result in any subjects dropping out or requesting such. This is compatible with the subjective opinion of medical researchers that the light hot flushes experienced as a side effect of mifepristone treatment are less intense than those experienced during the menopause or those brought on by other medicines such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs; this is logical if one realizes that the serum rate of estradiol with 5 mg of mifepristone is at the same level as in the early or mid-follicular phase, even when ovulation is inhibited by the mifepristone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijwh-5-115">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijwh-5-115">24</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Amenorrhea</title><p>After 9 months&#x02019; treatment, the 5 mg group had a higher percentage of amenorrhea than the 10 mg group with <italic>P</italic> = 0.010. However, we believe this may be a somewhat accidental finding, probably due to the combination of the smaller fibroid size, greater significant proportion of subserous fibroids (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025), which should not provoke bleeding, and the smaller increase in endometrial thickness in the 5 mg group.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological changes (endometrial biopsy) and endometrial thickness</title><p>The PAEC percentages obtained in this study in the 6-month biopsies were superior in both groups to those obtained in our previous study after 6 months&#x02019; treatment;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijwh-5-115">5</xref> however, unlike in that study, where there was a significant difference between the percentages obtained in the 10 mg and 5 mg groups, 44.3% and 27.9%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), in the present study that difference was not present, as the PAEC percentages were equal in both groups. Increasing treatment by 3 months from 6 to 9 months did not seem to be accompanied by a significant increase in the number of PAECs in either of the two groups, with the greater proportion of PAECs in the 10 mg group catching up with respect to the proportion in the 5 mg group.

This difference disappeared when the subjects began to menstruate following termination of treatment, with endometrial thickness values falling to &#x0003c;8 mm in both mifepristone groups. A significant direct relationship was observed between the higher endometrial thickness scores and diagnosis of PAECs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in the 10 mg group, unlike in the 5 mg group, although an opposite tendency was observed that might become significant if the sample size had been greater. To sum up, in both groups there was an increase in endometrial thickness, which, in turn, may have caused irregular bleeding and a histological diagnosis of PAECs when a biopsy was performed; this was significantly more frequent in the 10 mg mifepristone group.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of life</title><p>Subjects&#x02019; quality of life improved notably as a result of the treatment, with an increase of 22.1% and 24.3% in the 10 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively, in the total score obtained from the UFS-QOL questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijwh-5-115">15</xref> There did not seem to be any statistically significant differences between the two mifepristone groups with respect to this quality of life evaluation.

This very long follow-up period is probably the reason why participation was reduced so extensively at the end, thereby limiting the scientific value of any conclusions and tendencies that may have been observed had this not been the case. The fact that the follow-up was not an obligatory protocol may also have played an important role in the attrition rate. Thus, the data afforded in the follow-up period, especially in the final phase, does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusions due to the high percentage of follow-up dropouts, since this represents a significant bias and it is not clear why participants chose to continue or drop out.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the 5 mg daily dose over 9 months was safer than the 10 mg dose.
