We aimed to evaluate a prototype portable calf active compression brace (ACB) designed to improve orthostatic haemodynamic control. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over, double-blind study. Testing consisted of head-upright tilting and walking on a treadmill conducted on two consecutive days with a pair of ACBs wrapped around both calves. The ACB was actuated on one test day, but not on the other (placebo). Wearability, comfort, and ambulatory use of the ACB were assessed using questionnaires. The average calf pressure exerted by the ACB was 46.3&#x000b1;2.2 mmHg and the actuation pressure was 20.7&#x000b1;1.7 mmHg. When considering the differences between ACB actuation and placebo during tilt after supine rest there were trends for a larger stroke volume (+5.20&#x000b1;2.34%, p = 0.05) and lower heart rate (-5.12&#x000b1;2.41%, p = 0.06) with ACB actuation, with no effect on systolic arterial pressure (+4.86&#x000b1;3.41%, p = 0.18). The decrease in stroke volume after ten minutes of tilting was positively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = 0.464; p = 0.029; n = 22; both conditions combined). The increase in heart rate after ten minutes of tilting was negatively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = -0.485; p = 0.022; n = 22; both conditions combined) and was positively correlated with the average calf circumference (r = 0.539; p = 0.009; n = 22; both conditions combined). Participants reported good ACB wearability and comfort during ambulatory use. These data verify that the ACB increased stroke volume during tilting in healthy controls. Active calf compression garments may be a viable option for the management of orthostatic intolerance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>Carlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>Carlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>Carlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claydon</surname><given-names>Victoria E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaber</surname><given-names>Andrew P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaber</surname><given-names>Andrew P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claydon</surname><given-names>Victoria E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Canada Research Chair (CRC) program.

The principal causes of syncope are classified as reflex (neutrally-mediated), cardiac (cardiovascular) and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension (OH) [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. OH has been defined by consensus as a fall in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients suffering from OH may feel dizzy, weak or faint upon standing due to an excessive fall in cardiac output (CO) or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Approximately 30% of all instances of syncope are due to OH, affecting 5% to 11% of the middle-aged adult population and 15% to 30% of individuals aged 65 years and older [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In patients with OH, applying external compression to the lower limbs or abdomen might diminish venous pooling and capillary filtration, and so assist venous return and the maintenance of CO [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Static external compression stockings are commonly recommended for the management of syncope. They are prescribed for those suffering from orthostatic intolerance, where the external counter-pressure of the lower limbs or abdomen can reduce venous pooling and capillary filtration, thus increase venous return [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Garments that compress the abdomen have shown greater efficacy compared to calf compression stockings in the prevention of orthostatic intolerance [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, they are reported to be uncomfortable, hard to put on and remove, and are associated with poor patient compliance [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For this reason, much of the recent focus on compression garments has been on calf compression. Undoubtedly, pooling and filtration in the legs can be significant, with 500 ml of blood accumulation in the static calf within just 10 minutes of 60&#x000b0; head-upright tilting [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the efficacy of static calf compression stockings in the management of orthostatic intolerance has been challenged [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, intermittent pneumatic pressure pumps have shown strong potential for the improvement of orthostatic tolerance. They have been shown to improve arterial flow, increasing venous outflow from the lower limbs, venous blood flow velocity and venous pressure [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, they restrict patient mobility and are not portable. Considering the concerns raised regarding the poor efficacy and suitability of current compression garments, we believe there is a need for novel ambulatory compression devices that provide the desired haemodynamic benefit for the patients, are comfortable and wearable, and can produce intermittent pressure.</p><p>We recently developed an active compression brace (ACB) for the calf that utilizes artificial muscle technology. This ACB has been prototyped using smart alloy technology and its performance has previously been investigated in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, shape memory alloy (SMA) wires were used as actuators in the ACB and produce pressure when actuated. SMAs, including NiTi wires, are a group of metallic alloys that exhibit the characteristics of either large recoverable strains or large force due to temperature and/or load changes. NiTi is one of the most studied SMAs and is commercially available [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NiTi wires can have high force per unit area (exceeding 200 MPa), and can be actuated using Joule heating via an applied current [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The prototyped ACB can be wrapped around the calf area of the leg and applies adjustable initial pressure similar to medical compression stockings using a Boa closure system [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187885.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The pressure can then be increased by increasing the electrical current applied to the SMA wires.</p><fig id="pone.0187885.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187885.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Active compression brace (ACB).</title><p>The ACB consisted of thin layer of Teflon on top of a protective layer of Neoprene as the body of the brace and SMA wires as the actuators.

We compared responses with the device activated and with it wrapped but actuation pressure not applied (placebo). We measured the compression on the calves exerted by the ACB and obtained cardiovascular and lower limb circumference changes through beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiography (ECG), and leg strain gauge plethysmography. We hypothesized that during orthostasis the actuated ACB would reduce the leg volume change, and increase venous return, with an associated increase in SV and decrease in heart rate (HR). We also evaluated the effect of walking on the compression pressures applied, as well as on calf volume changes and cardiovascular responses. Finally, we evaluated the ACB viability, comfort and wearability during ambulation based on participant surveys.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>After the details and procedures of the study had been fully explained to them, all participants gave written informed consent to participate.

Each participant completed testing on two consecutive days with a pair of ACBs wrapped around both legs. The ACB was not actuated on one testing, and it was actuated on the other testing. The ACBs were placed around the widest part of the calf. The wrapping pressure was adjusted to 15 mmHg in the supine resting position. For the test where we had the ACB actuated, an electrical current of 180 mA per SMA wires was applied to each of the ACBs. Testing was conducted in a randomised double-blind fashion, at the same time of day. Female participants were tested in the same phase of their menstrual cycle by testing on consecutive days.

Smart material technology, specifically SMAs, were utilized in the ACB design as the actuator. The SMA wires that were selected were 102 &#x003bc;m diameter low temperature Flexinol actuator wires (Dynalloy, Inc. Irvine, California, USA). The fabricated ACB also included a Boa closure system with a steel lace. The Boa system (Boa Technology Inc. Denver, Colorado, USA), shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187885.g001">Fig 1</xref>, was placed at the two ends of the brace to fasten the ACB, which had negligible strain when tensioned. The ACB consisted of a thin layer of Teflon on top of a protective layer of Neoprene (forming the body of the brace) with SMA wires as the actuators. The 3D printed guides and fixtures held the SMA wires in place. The wires were fixed at the end of the brace by small washers and a conductive plate for electrical connection. The detailed conceptual design of the ACB is described in our previous works [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>As an electrical current was applied to the SMA wires of the ACB, their module of elasticity increased and started to reduce in length&#x02013;this in turn exerted a pressure on the calf via the Teflon sheet. Pressure exertion from the ACB consisted of two components: mechanical pressure and actuation pressure. The <italic>mechanical pressure</italic> was the initial pressure produced by wrapping the ACB around the leg firmly and fastening the Boa lace, which provided initial stress to the SMA wires. The <italic>actuation pressure</italic> resulted from the SMA wires when a current was applied to them. The total pressure exerted by the ACB on the calf was determined by summing the two components&#x02013;mechanical pressure and actuation pressure&#x02013;together.</p><p>Two PicoPress (MediGroup Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) pressure sensors were used to continuously measure the pressure exerted on both legs by the ACBs. A thin circular probe was attached to the pressure sensor. The probes were placed between the ACB and the calves of the participant at the center of the ACB, which was positioned over the maximal circumference of the calves.</p><p>The experimental setup included a driver circuit, which was coupled to a data acquisition system (DAQ) and a developed LabVIEW software, to pass the required current through to the ACB and receive the measurement signal. All signals were recorded using a NI 9205 analog input module (National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA). The LabVIEW code performed multiple functions: it measured and recorded the applied current of the ACB, it determined the required voltage to be applied based on the test protocol at specific timing during the tests, it recorded the beat-to-beat arterial pressure signals, and it measured and recorded the calibrated strain-gauges plethysmography data.</p><p>Using this experimental approach, we were able to continuously target, and measure, the mechanical and actuation pressures. The pressure exerted by the ACB on the underlying PicoPress sensor was visualized using the PicoPress program. The ACB was then adjusted through the Boa system until the pressure while the limb was in a relaxed stationary supine position was consistent at 15mmHg. This pressure was considered to be the applied mechanical pressure, and would be subject to change in different phases during the muscle movement. For tests where the ACB was actuated, the actuation pressure was regulated by applying an electrical current of 3.6&#x000b1;0.08 A (180&#x000b1;4 mA per SMA wires), achieved by altering the output voltage to the ACBs using the DAQ and the LabVIEW program through the driver circuits. This applied current was the same for all participants, and was kept constant throughout the test. This means that the actuation pressure might be different for different shapes and compliances of the participants&#x02019; legs, and might change in different phases of the test (for example due to alterations in the heat loss rate for the SMA wires). It should also be noted that the actuation pressure is mainly result of an increase in the elastic modulus of the SMA wires due to the martensite to austenite phase transformation. For these reasons, we measured mechanical and actuation pressures throughout testing for each participant and present these data as group means.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Hemodynamic monitoring</title><p>Throughout testing we continuously recorded non-invasive beat-to-beat finger arterial pressure (Portapres, Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), which is based on photoplethysmography. The finger cuff was placed on the middle phalanx of the middle finger on the left hand. Alterations in finger pressure imposed by changes in the position of the hand with respect to heart level were compensated using the in-built height correction system. Continuous internal calibration was also conducted using the in-built Physiocal algorithm.

Multiple regression analyses were used to develop a predictive model for efficacy of the ACB, change in SV and HR, from selected anthropometric characteristics and ACB condition (wrapped or actuated). Two linear regressions were conducted for the initial sudden change, and the delayed gradual change of the calf circumference in HUT1.

The test protocol was designed to investigate the efficacy of the ACB during passive head-up tilting, in which blood pooling occurs, and walking, in which the skeletal muscle pump increases venous return.</p><sec id="sec033"><title>ACB pressures applied</title><p>The ACB can apply a desired wrapping compression similar to commercial compression stockings, 15 mmHg, and when altering the compression by actuation, can apply pressure up to 27.3&#x000b1;1.6 mmHg, in the supine resting position. In both HUT 1 and 2 phases applied pressures showed a significant increase compared to the baseline phase (p&#x0003c;0.05). This could be because of the muscle movements, contraction, and an increase in calf circumference. The maximum applied pressure was observed in HUT1 and HUT2 phases when the actuated ACB applied pressure of 46.3&#x000b1;2.2 and 44.8&#x000b1;2.1 mmHg respectively. The walk phase showed lower applied pressure as a result of a drop in calf circumference. This decrease could be because of an increase in venous return due to the muscle pump. It should be mentioned that walking also altered the performance of the ACB due to increased heat loss in the SMA wires. Walking increases the convective heat transfer coefficient because of the air flow, which decreases the degree of actuation (phase transformation) in the SMA wires. In fact, this alteration could potentially be useful as a self-regulatory factor of the ACB since during walking, the muscle pump mechanism is active and there might be less of a need for compression.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Calf volume changes</title><p>In both HUT1 and HUT2 phases there was an initial rapid and secondary gradual increase in calf circumference that is thought to be due to venous pooling and capillary filtration respectively [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the walking phase, it was observed that the calf circumference decreased due to muscle contractions and enhanced venous return. There were no significant differences in either calf volume changes, or changes attributed to venous pooling or capillary filtration, between the actuated and wrapped conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Cardiovascular responses</title><p>CO was maintained throughout each test, except during walking, when it increased markedly. The maintenance of CO in the HUT1 and HUT2 phases likely reflects the intact baroreflex response in these healthy control volunteers, whereby reductions in SV were accompanied by compensatory increases in HR and vascular resistance. Indeed, the increases in HR during the tilted phases closely matched the decreases in SV. This is compatible with a reduced venous return when upright, secondary to venous pooling and plasma filtration [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a consequence decrease in SV.</p><p>There were significant main effects of test condition on changes in SV and HR during tilting, whereby the SV was lower and HR higher in the wrapped than the actuated conditions. This effect was less clear when the walking phase was incorporated, presumably because in this case SV volume was mainly maintained because of the muscle pump mechanism and the impact of device actuation was reduced. These data highlight the need for compression garment paradigms that can be applied selectively, only during passive orthostasis, and not during active orthostatic manoeuvres such as walking when any deficits in cardiovascular reflex control may be offset by the action of the skeletal muscle pumps [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>There was no significant effect of the actuation condition on blood pressure responses or orthostatic burden (SAP AUC). This also likely reflects the intact baroreflex response in healthy volunteers, in whom blood pressure is well maintained during brief mild orthostatic stresses such as those encountered in the present study. However, the higher associated stroke volume and lower heart rates during orthostatic stress in the actuation condition suggest that this maintenance of blood pressure was achieved with a smaller baroreflex response, compatible with the actuation condition augmenting stroke volume, and presumably, venous return.</p><p>When considering the possible relationships between SV, HR changes and anthropometric variables we first examined interactions between the main conditions (ACB wrapped/actuated) and each variable during initial passive orthostatic stress. Since we found no differences in the slopes of these relationships between the two test conditions, we combined data for the two ACB conditions. We showed that individuals with larger calf circumferences had higher heart rate responses to orthostatic stress, associated with larger reductions in SV. Therefore, is tempting to speculate that those with larger calf circumferences would be poised to benefit most from ACB actuation; however, because there were no differences in the slopes between the regressions for actuated and wrapped conditions, this is not the case. The relationships between haemodynamic parameters and anthropometric variables were no longer significant during the second tilt phase, which was preceded by walking. Presumably there is an effect of walking and associated autonomic and muscle activation on either orthostatic haemodynamic control or calf circumference that persists for some time (at least ten minutes) after termination of the activity. This has implications for the use of the device during activities of daily living&#x02013;device actuation may not be necessary during walking because the enhanced skeletal muscle pumping and autonomic activity seem sufficient to maintain cardiovascular control. We suggest that actuation of the device upon cessation of activity would be of more benefit.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>The ACB comfort and wearability</title><p>Overall the ACB comfort and wearability evaluation showed a low level of concern in all the domains considered. Although overall the device was well tolerated, some participants expressed discomfort, and priority areas for improvement in this regard were identified (attachment and perceived change, and to a lesser extent, harm and movement).</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our physiological tests were designed to be double-blind in the sense that the primary investigator was unaware of the test condition during data collection and analysis, and the participants were not told what to expect from the compression conditions. However, although participants were not informed whether the ACB was actuated or not on each test day, nor were they told the expected outcome of the experiment, it is possible that the study was not truly double-blinded. The ACB gets a bit warm when it is actuated, and participants may have been aware of a different sensation due to the higher compression.</p><p>It is possible that we have underestimated the impact of ACB actuation, because we compared it to a wrapped condition, which also applied a low level of pressure, and may itself have reduced orthostatic fluid shifts and enhanced orthostatic cardiovascular control. Comparisons of ACB actuation with no pressure application might show even greater benefit. However, we wished to compare whether our device provided additional benefit over and above conventional strategies that employ a low level of calf compression similar to our wrapped condition. In addition, use of a wrapped condition had the benefit that for participants and experimenters the protocol was the same for both tests, enhancing our ability to blind the study. Additional considerations for future study might also include the incorporation of a true placebo condition in which no compression was applied.</p><p>We tested healthy volunteers, and we can not be certain if the results would extend similarly to a patient population. For example, in healthy controls pooling and filtration is lower during orthostatic stress than in patient populations [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and so the potential to improve cardiovascular control by ameliorating these effects might be expected to be reduced. However, we believe our results may extend to patients with orthostatic intolerance, because a few of our control participants actually showed high calf volume changes more comparable to those inpatient populations. Furthermore, other non-pharmacological approaches to prevent or delay syncope apply equally well to both patients and controls [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>We had a relatively small sample size in this preliminary study proof-of-concept study, with an obvious impact on statistical power. As a consequence, we only considered the main effects of the test condition and phase, and not the interaction effects. Future studies should further elucidate these interactions.</p><p>It may be that the application of compression stockings prior to rising in the morning would have a greater effect, due to the &#x02018;&#x02018;water jacket effect&#x0201d;, whereby oedema accumulating during the day restricts further venous pooling [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, it has been shown that 20 minutes of supine rest is sufficient to normalise any prior venous pooling/capillary filtration effect [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], at least in control participants, so we consider this unlikely. The possibility for distal oedema below the compression level should also be considered in future work.</p><p>We evaluated the efficacy of the ACB on improvement of SV and calf volume changes, and accordingly our results may not extend to other compression garments. The existing literature suggests that compression garments extending to the thigh and abdomen may be more effective at preventing orthostatic intolerance [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but are associated with poor patient satisfaction and compliance [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Future studies may wish to examine the optimum compromise between efficacy, comfort, and patient compliance.</p><p>Our limited sample size in this preliminary evaluation precluded the evaluation of potential sex differences in terms of blood pooling and cardiovascular response to ACB actuation. Comparison between male and female participants&#x02019; responses and the efficacy of ACB should be considered in future, particularly given the known differences in venous pooling and capillary filtration between men and women [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and increased susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance in women [<xref rid="pone.0187885.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec038"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This paper showed the feasibility of an ACB to achieve the desired external calf pressure, and demonstrated an enhancement of stroke volume and reduction in orthostatic tachycardia during device actuation.
