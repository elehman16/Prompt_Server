Mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) combination therapy was recently approved for the treatment of persistent asthma. The objective of this analysis was to examine the effect of MF/F on health-related QoL at the approved doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data from 2 phase III studies investigating the effects of MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g (study P04334) and MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g (study P04431) were included. All subjects were &#x02265;12 yeara and not well controlled on medium dose (P04334) or high-dose (P04431) inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). After 2 to 3 weeks of run-in on twice-daily (BID) MF 200 &#x003bc;g (P04334) or 400 &#x003bc;g (P04431), subjects were randomized to 26 weeks of BID MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g, MF 200 &#x003bc;g, F 10 &#x003bc;g, or placebo (PBO) in P04334; or 12 weeks of BID MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g, MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g, or MF 400 &#x003bc;g in P04431. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (AQLQ [S]), consisting of 4 domains (Symptoms, Activity Limitation, Emotional Function, and Environmental Stimuli), was used to assess QoL. AQLQ(S) score changes from baseline were assessed; a difference &#x02265;0.5 was considered clinically meaningful. Study protocols were approved by IRBs; written informed consent was provided by all subjects or a parent/guardian.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In P04334 (n = 781), subjects receiving MF/F 200/10&#x003bc;g experienced significant improvements in total score (13.1%) and the 4 domain scores of the AQLQ (S) at endpoint vs those receiving PBO (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.005) or F 10 &#x003bc;g (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.024). Clinically meaningful improvements in total AQLQ (S) from baseline to week 26 were observed in patients receiving MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g (0.61). In P04431 (n = 728), subjects receiving MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g experienced significant improvements in total score (12.8%) and the Symptoms and Activity Limitation domain scores of the AQLQ (S) at endpoint vs those who received MF 400 &#x003bc;g (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.017). Clinically meaningful improvements in total AQLQ (S) from baseline to week 12 occurred in patients receiving MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g (0.61), MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g (0.51), or MF 400 &#x003bc;g (0.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients with persistent asthma receiving MF/F had statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements in QoL in 2 phase III studies. These data suggest that MF/F combination therapy improves the health-related QoL of patients with persistent asthma who are inadequately controlled on medium- or high-dose ICS.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
