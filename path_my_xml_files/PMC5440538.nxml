Children and adults with stages 3&#x02013;5 CKD frequently develop secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) with an elevated intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level due to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SHPT may contribute to bone disorders, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unlike in adults, CKD-MBD in children often results in growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Serum levels of iPTH are commonly used as a noninvasive measure of CKD-MBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The safety and efficacy of intermittent intravenous dosing of paricalcitol as therapy for SHPT in children with CKD undergoing dialysis have been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Children receiving hemodialysis treated with intravenous paricalcitol had a statistically significant decrease in iPTH levels from baseline compared with their counterparts receiving placebo (164&#x000a0;pg/mL decrease vs. 238&#x000a0;pg/mL increase, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several studies in adults with stages 3 and 4 CKD and SHPT have demonstrated that intravenous paricalcitol efficacy in reducing iPTH is comparable with that of calcitriol, but with a reduced likelihood of serum calcium and phosphorus elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A retrospective study reported similar results in children with SHPT undergoing dialysis who were treated with intravenous paricalcitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>We report here the results of two prospective, phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of oral paricalcitol in reducing iPTH levels in children with stages 3&#x02013;5 CKD. These studies were part of a postmarketing requirement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to evaluate paricalcitol in the management of CKD in pediatric patient populations. Using dosages derived from an initial pharmacokinetic portion, the stage 3/4 CKD study further examined paricalcitol efficacy and safety in children. The stage 5 CKD study evaluated the efficacy and safety of paricalcitol capsules for the treatment of SHPT in children with stage 5 CKD undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Stage 3/4 CKD study</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The stage 3/4 CKD study (NCT01020487) was conducted in two parts. Part 1 was an open-label, nonfasting, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in 10- to 16-year-old children with stage 3 or 4 CKD, conducted at investigative sites within the USA. Blood samples for the determination of paricalcitol serum concentrations were drawn at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48&#x000a0;hours following paricalcitol dosing. In Part 2, conducted at investigative sites within the USA (including Puerto Rico), Spain, Germany, Portugal, the UK, and Singapore, the safety and efficacy of oral paricalcitol for decreasing elevated serum iPTH levels in 10- to 16-year-old children with stage 3 or 4 CKD were compared with placebo. The duration of treatment was a minimum of 24&#x000a0;weeks. Part 2 included two treatment periods. The first was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study in which children were randomized 1:1 to receive paricalcitol capsules or placebo. In the second treatment period, children who completed the first treatment period received open-label paricalcitol for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks. In Part 2, children received the study drug for a minimum of 24&#x000a0;weeks in total; children continued into a follow-up phase until all enrolled children had completed 24&#x000a0;weeks on study drug.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although CKD differs in adults and children, the pathophysiology of SHPT, which is characterized by elevated iPTH levels and parathyroid gland hyperplasia, is an early and common complication regardless of age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The occurrence of elevated iPTH levels is the major contributor to the high-turnover bone disease seen in both adults and children and to the clinical symptoms of extraskeletal calcification, bone pain, and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Unlike in adults, the complications of bone disease in children with CKD also manifest clinically as growth retardation and musculoskeletal deformities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Clinical studies in adult patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD have shown that paricalcitol capsules significantly reduce iPTH levels, with no significant difference between paricalcitol capsules and placebo in terms of incidences of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated calcium&#x02013;phosphorus product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, limited clinical data are available for the use of paricalcitol in children with SHPT associated with CKD.</p><p>In our study, C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, t<sub>max</sub>, and t<sub>1/2</sub> values for paricalcitol appeared to be similar in children with stage 3 or 4 CKD. The exposure (AUC) of paricalcitol in children with stage 3 or 4 CKD was numerically higher than that observed in adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on prospectively defined criteria for the selection of the paricalcitol dose for Part 2 of the stage 3/4 CKD study, we selected a dose of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g paricalcitol TIW as the initial dose in the efficacy and safety portion of the study, and the results support an initiating dose of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g paricalcitol TIW in future paricalcitol studies in children aged 10&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years, as well as in clinical practice. The population pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in pediatric patients with stage 5 CKD appeared to be similar to those observed in pediatric patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD (data on file). These analyses indicate that renal function does not impact paricalcitol exposure in pediatric patients, which is also consistent with the findings in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Paricalcitol was effective in reducing iPTH levels in the children with stage 3 or 4 CKD enrolled in our study, and there was a statistically significantly greater proportion of children who achieved two consecutive reductions of &#x02265;30% from baseline in iPTH levels with paricalcitol treatment compared with placebo. Overall, there was a greater reduction in iPTH levels from baseline to final assessment in the paricalcitol treatment group than in the placebo arm. The fact that most children enrolled in the study did not have severe SHPT and had well-controlled mineral metabolism may explain the observed moderate decrease in iPTH. The effect of paricalcitol treatment was sustained in children with stage 3 or 4 CKD for approximately 20&#x000a0;weeks. The decrease in suppression of iPTH observed at week 24 in the open-label study supports ongoing monitoring of iPTH levels in children treated with paricalcitol. Adjustment of paricalcitol dosage to maintain reductions in iPTH levels should take into account concurrent calcium and phosphorus levels.</p><p>In the stage 3/4 CKD study, there was no difference between treatment groups in the proportion of children who achieved final iPTH, calcium, or phosphorus levels within KDOQI targets. Changes in laboratory values were also similar between the paricalcitol and placebo groups. The iPTH results suggest that a larger study population may have yielded a significant difference in the achievement of KDOQI target range between groups. A high proportion of children in the placebo group achieved calcium and phosphorus levels within KDOQI ranges, suggesting that a significant improvement with paricalcitol treatment may be unlikely. Both eGFR and creatinine levels remained stable throughout the course of the 12-week double-blind portion of the stage 3/4 CKD study, suggesting that renal function was not significantly affected by paricalcitol treatment.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, hypercalcemia events with paricalcitol treatment were rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Overall, paricalcitol was well tolerated in children with stages 3&#x02013;5 CKD. Most AEs were mild, with few serious or severe events, and no new clinically concerning safety signals were observed in either study.</p><p>The results presented herein are consistent with those of Greenbaum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] who demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous paricalcitol. Previous studies have demonstrated that calcitriol and doxercalciferol exhibit efficacy in lowering PTH levels and help to control bone turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; however, it has also been reported that intermittent high-dose calcitriol may adversely affect linear bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Paricalcitol is effective in reducing iPTH levels without typically elevating the levels of calcium and phosphorus and may have an even greater potential to control bone turnover while minimizing the risk of adverse effects on linear bone growth. Future studies will be required to evaluate the efficacy of paricalcitol in controlling bone turnover.</p><p>Both studies share the limitations inherent in trials of short duration or limited number of patients that seek to determine differences in outcome measurements and identify potential safety concerns. Despite the limited number of patients, completion rates in the stage 3/4 CKD study (80.5% in the double-blind phase) and stage 5 CKD study (84.6%) were high compared with other studies of this type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A larger and longer study may have allowed for detection of differences in efficacy and safety between children with stage 3 and stage 4 CKD. It is also possible that larger studies of longer duration would have increased the potential for observation of infrequent AEs. Inclusion of children with stage 3 CKD who were vitamin D replete may have limited the potential to markedly reduce iPTH levels in the study population. In children with stage 3 CKD with adequate levels of calcifediol, active vitamin D supplementation may not be necessary to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In summary, data from these studies demonstrate that the treatment of children aged 10&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years with stages 3&#x02013;5 CKD with oral paricalcitol was effective in lowering iPTH levels and was well tolerated over extended trial periods. Additionally, the administration of paricalcitol capsules for the treatment of SHPT in pediatric patients aged 10&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years with stage 3 or 4 CKD appears to be similar to that observed in adult patients. These results support an initiating dose of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g paricalcitol TIW in future paricalcitol studies in children 10&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years of age with CKD, as well as in clinical practice. Future studies will need to evaluate dosing, efficacy, and safety of oral paricalcitol in younger children with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="467_2017_3579_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 238 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
