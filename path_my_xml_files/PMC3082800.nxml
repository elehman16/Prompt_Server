A variety of energy drinks are currently available on the market today and are publicized to increase the energy level of the individuals consuming it. Sport drinks, such as Gatorade and Powerade, have been designed to refuel athletes during and after their performance. Specifically, they are designed to have optimal levels of carbohydrate for glycogen replenishment, electrolytes for ion maintenance, and prevent dehydration. Contrary, energy drinks are reported to increase mental alertness and physical performance during exercise. This is because energy drink manufacturers add ergogenic ingredients such as carbohydrates, caffeine, taurine and vitamins. These ingredients have been proposed to interact with each other to provide a stimulant effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref> Furthermore, the manufacturers of these drinks claim a variety of benefits in their advertisements and although energy drinks have been sold worldwide for more than a decade, there is a paucity of evidence supporting their effectiveness of enhancing aerobic performance in athletes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref></p><p>Gei&#x000df; et al (1994)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> and Alford et al (2001)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> have shown beneficial effects of Red Bull on performance. Gei&#x000df; et al (1994)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> reported improved endurance time and lower heart rates on Red Bull which was attributed to increased catecholamine circulation while, Alford et al (2001)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> indicated improved aerobic, anaerobic and psychomotor performance. Taken together, these results suggest that Red Bull has the potential to improve physical and mental performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> Baum et al (2001) found improvement in cardiac contractility of endurance trained subjects after consumption of Red Bull. The authors reported improved cardiac output which they attributed to a reduced end systolic volume.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref> Umana-Alvarado et al (2004) reported lower rating of perceived exertion and also no improved run times in 11 male endurance runner when consuming 6 ml/kg 
<sup>-1</sup>body weight of an energy drink 30 minutes before the two 10 km cross-country races.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref> Byars et al (2006) reported the pre-exercise drink positively influenced energy and endurance on indices of maximal cardiorespiratory fitness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref></p><p>There are a limited number of studies supporting the use and qualitative ranking of these products. Several studies have been done among Iranian athletes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref> Furthermore, dietary intakes of Iranians have its own unique characteristics and it remains unknown whether consumption of these drinks would be of any benefit among athletes consuming Iranian dietary patterns or not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> Therefore, the effectiveness of two caffeine and taurine-containing energy drinks (Red Bull produced in Austria and Hype produced in Netherlands) on VO<sub>2max</sub>, time to exhaustion, and heart rate variables and blood lactate levels in male athletes was evaluated. In addition, it was tested to see if the combined constituents of these drinks have ergogenic effects on exercise performance.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>After filling out questionnaires related to health and exercise history, from eligible athletes (healthy and active), ten male athlete students of Tehran University in the field of &#x0201c;physical education&#x0201d; (age: 22.4 &#x000b1; 2.1 years, height: 180.8 &#x000b1; 7.7 cm, weight: 74.2 &#x000b1; 8.5 kg) were volunteered to take part in this study. The type of exercise they performed was regular aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Each male had given informed consent to participate in this research. Subjects included in this study if they were physically active and moderate caffeine users, and had no known sensitivity to test components or to any ingredient contained in the energy drinks.

The Bruce protocol is started at stage 1 with a speed of 2.74 km/h and grade of 10%. Every three minutes speed and grade were adjusted until the participants can no longer perform, ideally between 9 and 15 minutes. For example, stage 2 should be 4.02 km/h and 12% grade, stage 3 should be 5.47 km/h and 14% grade, and so on.

Results of this study indicated that ingestion of Red Bull and Hype prior to exercise testing is effective on some indices of cardiorespiratory fitness but not on the blood lactate levels.</p><p>In the present study it was observed that Red Bull and Hype energy drinks caused an 11.5% and 9.9% increase in VO<sub>2max</sub>vs. placebo, respectively. Potentially, caffeine could have a number of actions that affect skeletal and heart muscle. It can inhibit adenosine receptors, increase sympathetic activity, and has direct intracellular action. The increase in VO<sub>2max</sub>may be attributed to ingredients such as caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and B group vitamins in these beverages. Caffeine has been shown to have desirable effects for performing athletes fighting fatigue, increasing energy, enhancing fatty acid metabolism and increasing skeletal muscle contractility. The stimulant effect of caffeine could make it effective for increasing alertness while performing in a fatigued state. The increased metabolism of free fatty acids has been proven to be useful during endurance exercise because of the glycogen sparing effects allowing an athlete to increase exercise time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref> Taurine can also aid in the contractile function of skeletal muscle. Taurine works to increase calcium content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum providing increased ability of the muscle to contract, amplifying muscle force generation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref> This may also reflect the action of glucuronolactone in providing additional energy resource.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> The Red Bull and Hype energy drinks contain also B group vitamins. Intake of B vitamins containing drinks or supplements can act to help replenish intermediates within the Kreb&#x02019;s Cycle allowing for increased ATP production and potentially increase in energy supply to the working athlete, allowing for increased exercise time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref> The previous study of Baum et al (2001) supports this hypothesis suggesting that increases in VO<sub>2max</sub>might occur because the effects of caffeine and taurine may have on cardiac contractility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref></p><p>In this study it was found that Red Bull and Hype energy drinks caused up to 10.5% and 9.7% increase in time to exhaustion vs. placebo. The findings of Umana-Alvarado et al (2004) don&#x02019;t support the present results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref> However, the present findings are in agreement with results of Gei&#x000df; et al (1994).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> The increase in time to exhaustion may be due to absence of carbohydrate, caffeine and taurine. It is well established that carbohydrate is the preferred fuel for short-duration, high-intensity exercise and longer duration, higher intensity exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref> and that depletion of muscle glycogen and blood glucose limit exercise duration and performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref> Caffeine ingestion may enhance time to exhaustion because as mentioned earlier it has been implicated in increasing lipolysis from adipose tissue and thus enhancing fat oxidation resulting in spared stored glycogen during intense and prolonged exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref> Results of Zhang et al (2004) indicated significant increases in VO<sub>2max</sub>, time to exhaustion and maximal workload in exercise-test when consuming a taurine supplement. The authors postulate that this could be due to taurine attenuating exercise-induced DNA damage and increase of the capacity of exercise because of its cellular protective properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref></p><p>In the present study, consumption of energy drinks did not affect our subjects HR. These findings support the results of Baum et al (2001), Bichler et al (2006) and Alford et al (2001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref> In contrast, lower HRs in endurance athletes after consuming of Red Bull energy drink has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> The lack of change in heart rate in the current study may be due to combination of taurine with caffeine in these beverages. No increase in HR when consuming caffeine suggest that taurine within the beverages may be doing something to alter cardiovascular physiology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT26">26</xref> Blood lactate levels changed after the current exercise test, but the change between groups were not significant.
