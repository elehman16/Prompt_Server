Posttraumatic stress disorder (PSD) occurs in 33-56% of the patients who have experienced awareness during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Choosing the anesthesia technique in Cesarean cases depends on several factors, such as, the emergency rate, the status of the mother and fetus, and mother's request.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] General anesthesia is selected more in emergency cases, such as, fetus distress and severe bleeding or in cases where local anesthesia is contraindicated.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, due to its effect on the fetus, the type of anesthetic drug is very important and now, two anesthetic drugs &#x02014; propofol (Infusion) and isoflurane (inhalation) &#x02014; are usually used in the anesthetic process.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The aim of general anesthesia includes preventing intraoperative pain and creating relaxation, sleep and anesthesia, so that the patient does not remember the surgery, but if the depth of anesthesia is not appropriate, it leads to awareness during surgery.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] If the depth of anesthesia is high, complications of anesthesia occur in the patient; therefore, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate depth of anesthesia, especially during the Cesarean section.</p><p>Recollection of intraoperative events, which may be spontaneous or by asking questions of the patient, can be very uncomfortable, and in the most severe cases, it may lead to posttraumatic stress disorders.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In recent studies, the incidence rate of awareness during general anesthesia, in Cesarean section has been reported to be between 0.1 and 7%, which can exert extensive psychological consequences on the patient.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, by using various drugs, minimization of these events has been tried, while the appropriate depth of anesthesia is also maintained.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have shown that in intravenous anesthetic drugs (propofol), for maintaining anesthesia, the incidence rate of intraoperative awareness is higher than in inhalation drugs (isoflurane).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] On the other hand, given the concern of the crossing of drugs from the placenta and their effect on the infant, anesthesia induction has particular significance in patients undergoing Cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The apgar index system is one of the clinically useful techniques to identify infants requiring resuscitation and also to assess the quality of resuscitation techniques based on five parameters, which are evaluated in the first and fifth minutes after birth.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The anesthesiologist must diagnose the risk of intraoperative awareness under general anesthesia; and reducing neonatal complications must be balanced with this risk.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The lack of using opioids and benzodiazepines before induction of anesthesia, the restricted consumption of inhalational agents, and applying rapid induction techniques are reasons that cause this group of patients to be exposed to the complication of intraoperative awareness.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Some experts offer BIS (Bispectral Index), as an assessment process of the electroencephalogram, allowing the anesthesiologists to regulate the dose of the anesthetic drug during surgeries, so that he/she assures enough depth of anesthesia, without increasing the risk of awareness, as also neonatal complications.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Thus, the type of anesthetic drug used in Cesarean section is very significant. Hence, the present study aims to determine and compare the effect of two anesthetic techniques &#x02014; propofol and isoflurane &#x02014; on the incidence rate of intraoperative awareness and the Apgar index of infants, in an elective Cesarean section, in the Alzahra University Hospital, Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study is a clinical trial study conducted in the Isfahan Alzahra Hospital, in 2011.</p><p>Prior to the study, all the patients signed an informed written consent.</p><p>In this project 90 pregnant women, 18-35 years old, were included for elective Cesarean section, with normal Body Mass Index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes 1 and 2.</p><p>The sample size was estimated based on a power calculation, which showed that at least 43 patients per group were necessary to achieve 80% power, to detect a 20% difference between the groups. We recruited 45 patients per group, to compensate for any exclusion.</p><p>Patients were randomly entered into one of the two groups (by random allocation software prepared in a sealed envelope) for receiving isoflurane (manufactured by Piramol Critical Care Inc., USA) and propofol (manufactured by Claris Lifescience Limited, India), by one of the investigators who was not related to data collection, monitoring or conduct of anesthesia. In cases where the patients had a history of seizure or neurological problems, were with the need for sedative drugs, with head trauma requiring hospitalization, surgical procedures, previous brain surgery or addiction, they were not taken into the groups. Also, mothers who suffered from severe changes in hemodynamics (20% higher than the initial condition) during anesthesia or if the dose of the prescribed medications was changed for any reason, they were excluded from the study (one patient was excluded due to profound hypotension, from the Isoflurane group) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Flow Chart 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Flow Chart 1</label><caption><p>Study flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-234-g001"/></fig><p>In both groups, the same anesthesia induction was done with 1.5 mg/kg propofol and 2 mg/kg succinylcholine, following and maintaining anesthesia was performed with 100 Propofol in Group 1 and 1 Isoflurane MAC in Group 2.</p><p>In both groups, the patients&#x02019; hemodynamic status was evaluated before and immediately after anesthesia induction, and every 15 minutes during surgery and after end of surgery, till the time of recovery.</p><p>In both groups, the frequency of the incidence of hypotension (SBP &#x0003c; 90), bradycardia (HR &#x0003c; 60), hypertension (BP &#x0003e; 140/90), and tachycardia (HR &#x0003e; 100) were recorded and compared.

When the spontaneous breathing was acceptable, and if there was no any sign of hypoxia, the patient was extubated and transferred to the Recovery Room.</p><p>In both groups, the extubation duration was recorded and compared. The incidence of intraoperative awareness was recorded during recovery, with a few short questions based on recalling the intraoperative events in both groups, and for its assessment, the index of BIS, EMG, and SQI were used every five minutes from the time of anesthesia induction to the end of the surgery. The apgar indices were evaluated and recorded in both groups at the first and fifth minutes after birth, according to the related table. The duration of recovery time was assessed based on the Aldrete criteria and patient satisfaction was recorded using the Likert scale in both groups.</p><p>Subsequently, by collecting the statistical results gathered during and after surgery to the end of recovery, the obtained data were analyzed with the help of the SPSS software Version 20, the statistical Chi-square, <italic>t</italic>-test, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, or the replication of the observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 90 pregnant women candidates for elective cesarean section were randomly enrolled into two groups (of 45 each).

In our study, two Cesarean section groups underwent general anesthesia by intravenous and inhaled techniques. They were compared, and both the mentioned groups were similar in terms of basic variables such as age distribution, pregnancy age, and ASA. However, in our study, the frequency distribution of intraoperative awareness had no significant difference in the two groups under anesthesia, either with propofol or isoflurane. However, except for the type of anesthetic drug, other factors such as the depth and duration of anesthesia also have an effect on intraoperative awareness. As anesthesia induction usually has side effects on the infant, care is taken to induce the most safe drug, with minimal depth of anesthesia, and for the least possible time, to the mother undergoing Cesarean, and for this reason, the intraoperative awareness in the Cesarean section is higher than in other surgical procedures. According to other studies, during general anesthesia, the incidence rate of awareness has been reported to be between 0.1 to 7% in Cesarean surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, in maintaining anesthesia with isoflurane or propofol, the incidence rate of intraoperative awareness is effectively reduced. In the study by Tsai <italic>et al</italic>., the effect of propofol and isoflurane anesthesia was examined, as the anesthesia was maintained by combining O<sub>2</sub>33%-N<sub>2</sub> O67%, in two groups of 12 pregnant mothers, who were candidates for Cesarean section. The results were similar to those obtained in our study, and according to it, the Apgar index, change in hemodynamic status, and BIS index were the same in both groups.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the Abboud <italic>et al</italic>. study, a comparison was performed between the effect of propofol and isoflurane as anesthesia maintenance on 74 pregnant women, who were candidates for Cesarean section, in two groups. In the study, the incidence rate of intraoperative awareness and duration of recovery did not differ. The Apgar index was good in both groups, but in the isoflurane group, the hypertension response at intubation was less than in the propofol group, and propofol was mentioned as a more reliable anesthesia than isoflurane.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In contrast, in the Ashworth and Smith study conducted on isoflurane and propofol in Outpatient surgeries, the intraoperative awareness was not seen in anesthesia with propofol and isoflurane, but sufficient depth of anesthesia could hardly be maintained by propofol.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>According to the results obtained in our study, the SQI indices, EMG percentage, and BIS did not show a significant difference from the fifth to sixtieth minute in the two groups. Also, the hemodynamic variables included blood pressure and heart rate, which showed no significant difference in both groups from before anesthesia to the sixtieth minute of recovery. On the other hand, due to weakening of the uterine contractions in 25% of mothers in the isoflurane group, the application of this drug for anesthesia maintenance in delivery is questioned.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, ultimately, given that the incidence rate of intraoperative awareness, the Apgar index of the infant and the hemodynamic variables had no significant difference in the two groups under anesthesia with isoflurane and propofol. Each mentioned drug could be used in general anesthesia for Cesarean section according to the patient's condition, anesthesiologist's diagnosis, and other criteria, such as, the price and availability of drugs.</p><p>The <italic>small sample size</italic> is a significant <italic>limitation</italic> of this <italic>study</italic>. <italic>This may cause some bias in our study</italic>, so further work is required to determine the exact incidence of awareness, especially in high-risk patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to all those who made it possible for them to complete this research.
