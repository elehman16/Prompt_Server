Laser platforms for cataract surgery are now available, the anticipated advantages of which are broad and may include better visual outcomes through greater precision and reproducibility, and improved safety. FACT is a randomised single masked non-inferiority trial to establish whether laser-assisted cataract surgery is as good as or better than standard manual phacoemulsification.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>808 patients aged 18&#x02005;years and over with visually significant cataract will be randomised to manual phacoemulsification cataract surgery (standard care) or laser-assisted cataract surgery (intervention arm). Outcomes will be measured at 3 and 12&#x02005;months after surgery. The primary clinical outcome is uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA, logMAR) at 3&#x02005;months in the study eye recorded by an observer masked to the trial group. Secondary outcomes include UDVA at 12&#x02005;months, corrected distance visual acuity at 3 and 12&#x02005;months, complications, endothelial cell loss, patient-reported outcome measures and a health economic analysis conforming to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research Ethics Committee Approval was obtained on 6 February 2015, ref: 14/LO/1937.

Although cataract surgery is a relatively safe operation, serious complications that may affect recovery and are associated with poorer long-term outcomes occur in 2% operations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Posterior capsule rupture/vitreous loss (PCR/VL) is the most frequently occurring serious complication and is associated with an eight times higher risk of postoperative endophthalmitis and a 42 times higher risk of undergoing retinal detachment surgery within 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The surgical learning curve for phacoemulsification is associated with complications, with a 3.7 and 1.6 times higher risk of PCR/VL for junior surgical trainees and senior surgical trainees, respectively.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In cases with PCR/VL, one-third of patients still have symptoms about their eye and vision 3.5&#x02005;years after surgery.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Laser platforms for cataract surgery are currently available from five manufacturers. They can make the corneal incisions, open the lens capsule and fragment the cataract in 1&#x02005;min, leaving only removal of lens fragments and insertion of the lens implant to be performed by the surgeon. The potential advantages are broad and may include better visual outcomes through greater precision and improved safety. These systems are expensive, however costs may be mitigated by fewer complications and improved outcomes. The absence of robust evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of laser-assisted surgery from large randomised controlled trials was highlighted in a review article<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and by the National Institute of Health Research Horizon Scanning Centre. The topic is a research priority as identified by the national James Lind Alliance Sight Loss and Vision Priority Setting Partnership (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fightforsight.org.uk/sightlosspsp">http://www.fightforsight.org.uk/sightlosspsp</ext-link>). A 1050 patient multicentre randomised economic evaluation is currently underway in France with planned primary completion in July 2015.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> To date, data from large comparative case series suggest visual outcomes from laser cataract surgery are similar to, or possibly better than, those from manual phacoemulsification.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

Patient recruitment will take place over the first 18&#x02005;months, and collection of the data will continue for a further 12&#x02005;months. The trial will be considered closed when the last patient has reached this time-point, all data is complete and all data queries have been resolved. The REC will be notified within 90&#x02005;days of the end of the trial and sent a summary report of the research within 12&#x02005;months of the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary clinical outcome is UDVA (logMAR) at 3&#x02005;months in the study eye recorded by an optometrist or technician masked to the trial group. A change in visual acuity of 1 line of the chart is considered to be clinically important. One logMAR line is 5 letters (each letter is 0.02 logMAR) and the test-retest variability is reported as about 0.07 logMAR on letter-by-letter scoring.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> If there is truly no difference in mean logMAR between the two groups, then 432 patients (216 per group) would provide 90% power to be sure that a 95% two-sided CI would exclude the non-inferiority limit of 0.1 logMAR, assuming a common SD of 0.32. The SD is from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists&#x02019; National Ophthalmic Database UDVA data.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>However, although treatment is delivered on an individual basis, each patient cannot be assumed to generate independent information since they will be clustered within surgeons. To take account of clustering by surgeon (ie, the variation between surgeons in the treatment effect) the sample size must be increased by an inflation factor f=1+(m&#x02212;1)&#x000d7;p. Assuming a total of 16 surgeons contribute and an average cluster size (m) of 50 (patients/surgeon) and an estimated ICC (p) of 0.012, this yields an f of 1.59. A total of 688 patients (344 per group) would enable the trial to take account of clustering by surgeon. To allow for an anticipated 15% dropout rate (the mean age of patients undergoing cataract surgery is 75&#x02005;years old and many have significant systemic comorbidities) the total sample size required is 808 patients (404 per group).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Recruitment plan</title><p>All patients presenting to the recruitment centres with visually significant cataract who have elected to undergo cataract surgery will be considered for enrolment. All potential participants will be provided in advance with a copy of the trial participant information sheet (see online supplementary files for model copy of the trial participant information).</p><p>Eligible patients will be identified by an ophthalmologist at the time of listing for cataract surgery and if willing to join the study, informed consent will be obtained and physical baseline measurements taken after standard clinic listing and surgical consent for cataract surgery by a trained member of the trial team. All patients will be given as much time as they require and offered separate alternative day enrolment appointments (see online supplementary files for model copy of the trial consent form).</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>Patients will be randomised to laser-assisted cataract surgery or manual phacoemulsification cataract surgery (standard care) in equal proportions. Randomisation will be performed by a member of the trial team on the day of surgery and as close to the time of surgery as possible. A web-based randomisation application will be used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sealedenvelope.com/uclctu/">https://www.sealedenvelope.com/uclctu/</ext-link>). The randomisation algorithm will use treatment centre, surgeon and one or both eyes eligible as minimisation stratifiers.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Masking</title><p>Owing to the nature of the intervention, neither the trial participants nor the treating clinician will be masked to the treatment allocation.</p><p>To ensure masking of the outcomes data; visual acuity, refraction, corneal measurements and endothelial cell count measures at 3 and 12&#x02005;months follow-up visits will be performed by a trial optometrist or technician without reference to previous patient medical notes or trial case report forms. After these measures have been completed, complications data will be collected by patient medical notes review, for which masking is not possible. Each site will be responsible for putting into place a procedure to ensure the optometrist is kept masked at all times, and will remind each patient not to reveal their treatment to the optometrist at these two visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Withdrawal</title><p>Patients may withdraw at any time. All withdrawals from randomised treatment will be reported. The investigator may withdraw patients from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, AEs, SAEs, protocol violations, administrative or other reasons. All data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Data management</title><p>All study data will be managed as detailed in the full trial protocol and in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. The trial database and coding frames have been developed by the Clinical Trial Manager in conjunction with CCTU. The database software provides a number of features to help maintain data quality, including; maintaining an audit trail, allowing custom validations on all data, allowing users to raise data query requests and search facilities to identify validation failure/ missing data.</p><p>Requests for access to trial data will be considered, and approved in writing where appropriate, after formal application to the Trial Management Group/ Trial Steering Group. Considerations for approving access are documented in the Trial Management Group/Trial Steering Committee Terms of Reference.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary analysis will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle where all randomised patients are analysed in their allocated group whether or not they receive their randomised treatment. Baseline characteristics will be summarised for each treatment groups. Continuous data will be summarised using means and SDs if data appear Gaussian, or medians and IQRs. Binary data will be reported as frequencies and percentages. All statistical tests will use a two-sided p value of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. All CIs presented will be 95% and two sided. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed for approval by the Trial Steering Committee and review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and finalised before the first substantive statistical analysis.</p><p>The primary outcome is UDVA in the study eye 3&#x02005;months after randomisation, measured in logMAR using an ETDRS chart at a starting distance of 4&#x02005;m. A two-sided 95% CI for the mean difference in UDVA between treatment groups will be estimated using regression analysis adjusting for baseline habitual logMAR visual acuity and the randomisation stratifiers (treatment centre, surgeon and whether or not patients have one or both eyes eligible).</p><p>We will include trial site in our regression models as a fixed effect and surgeon as a random effect. If the upper end of the 95% CI for the difference between means does not cross the non-inferiority limit of 0.1 logMAR, then laser surgery will be regarded as non-inferior. If the mean difference is negative and its 95% CI lies wholly to the left of zero, then we can conclude that laser surgery is superior to manual surgery. We will perform sequential testing of the non-inferiority and superiority hypotheses.</p><p>Secondary continuous outcomes such as UDVA at 12&#x02005;months, CDVA and patient-reported Catquest-9SF<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> will be analysed in a similar fashion. The percentage of study eyes (and patients) experiencing adverse events (eg, posterior capsule tears, dropped lens) in the two groups will be compared using Fisher's exact tests.</p><p>In addition regression analyses will be performed for continuous outcomes such as CDVA at 12&#x02005;months for all operated eyes (ie, including the second eye for patients having bilateral surgery), adjusting for baseline habitual logMAR visual acuity, the randomisation stratifiers (centre and surgeon) and time since surgery, including patient as a random effect. No additional research visits are planned for patients having surgery on both eyes.</p><p>Pearson's correlation coefficients (or Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, depending on the distribution of the data) will be used to assess the relationships between continuous outcome measures.</p><p>Planned subgroup analyses will be conducted to investigate possible interactions between treatment effects and whether or not surgery was required on both eyes, with separate estimates and CIs being reported for such patients. We will also investigate a possible interaction between treatment effect and trial site as a prespecified subgroup analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Missing data</title><p>While there is no planned research visit between surgery and the postoperative visit at 3&#x02005;months, it is likely that patients will attend standard NHS visits following surgery. If data are missing for the primary end point because patients do not attend for follow-up at 3&#x02005;months, visual acuity data will be extracted from patient records and inputted for the primary analysis. If after retrieving the NHS records a substantial proportion of primary outcome data remains incomplete, then missing data will be dealt with using multiple imputation by chained equations. Results will be combined using Rubin's rules. Data will be assumed to be missing at random, in essence the data available for patients before they drop out will be used to predict the end point. The imputation will be performed following a prespecified procedure and conducted separately for each trial group. Reasons for missingness may be important and these will be investigated using logistic regression of covariates on an indicator of missingness. Sensitivity analysis will investigate the validity of the missing at random assumption.</p></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>We will undertake a detailed analysis of the costs and the cost-utility of laser-assisted phacoemulsification cataract surgery compared with manual phacoemulsification cataract surgery (standard care). The analyses will conform to accepted economic evaluation methods (eg, NICE methods guidance). All costs will be assessed from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services. Secondary analysis will consider patient and societal costs. We will estimate cost and cost-utility (1) for the &#x02018;within-trial&#x02019; period, based on the clinical and health-related quality of life results at baseline and follow-up and (2) over the expected lifetime of the patients. We have selected the EQ-5D-3L+vision bolt-on question (EQ-5DV)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> as the most appropriate instrument for use in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s2s"><title>Within-trial analysis</title><p>The units of outcome for the within-trial cost-effectiveness analyses will be the incremental cost per unit change in the uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) in the study eye and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. QALYs will be calculated based on the responses to the EQ-5DV collected at baseline and follow-up. Patient-specific utility profiles will be constructed assuming a linear change in utility values measured using the EQ-5DV questionnaire at baseline and 6-week, 3-month, 6-month and 12&#x02005;month follow-up time points. Utility estimates will be calculated according to the area under the curve approach, adjusting for baseline differences in patients in the trial arms if necessary. Missing EQ-5DV and resource use data will be addressed using appropriate statistical methods in consultation with the trial statistician.</p></sec><sec id="s2t"><title>Model-based analysis</title><p>In the lifetime model, cost-effectiveness will be calculated in terms of the incremental cost per QALY gained. A review of previous cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted to identify any existing modelling work that may be drawn on for developing the model structure and informing model parameters. The specific details of the data required to populate the model will be determined following the development of the model structure. We will undertake deterministic (one, two and multiway) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the latter assuming appropriate distributions and parameter values that will also be used to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec id="s2u"><title>Health economic analysis plan</title><p>All analyses will be undertaken within a Bayesian framework.

We will also subject the results to extensive deterministic (one, two and multiway) sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Cost components included in the analysis will consist of (but not necessarily be limited to) the cost of surgery for both arms of the trial, complications arising from surgery, all relevant diagnostic investigations, revision surgery where necessary, hospital length of stay, outpatient attendances, hospital readmissions, primary care contacts, A&#x00026;E attendances and prescribed medications. The volume of resource use for each cost component will be measured by a patient completed questionnaire and from medical records. Patients will be asked for details of any health and social care resources used during the study period, as well as out of pocket payments and the impact of their condition on their employment.
