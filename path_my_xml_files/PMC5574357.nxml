exercise therapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. [Subjects and Methods]
Sixty male patients aged 55&#x02013;65&#x02005;years with benign prostatic hyperplasia were invited to
participate in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to Group A (n=20; patients who
received pulsed electromagnetic field in addition to pelvic floor and aerobic exercises),
Group B (n=20; patients who received pulsed electromagnetic field), and Group C (n=20;
patients who received placebo electromagnetic field). The assessments included post-void
residual urine, urine flow rate, prostate specific antigen, white blood cells count, and
International Prostate Symptom Score were weighed, before and after a 4-week intervention.
[Results] There were significant differences in Group A and B in all parameters. Group C
showed non-significant differences in all measured variables except for International
Prostate Symptom Score. Among groups, all parameters showed highly significant differences
in favor of Group A. There were non-significant differences between Group A and B and
significant difference between Groups A and C and between Groups B and C. [Conclusion] The
present study demonstrated that electromagnetic field had a significant impact on the
treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Accordingly, electromagnetic field can be
utilized alone or in combination with other physiotherapy modalities. Moreover, clinicians
should have the capacity to perceive the advantages accomplished using extra treatment
alternatives. Electromagnetic field is a safe, noninvasive method and can be used for the
treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Benign prostatic hyperplasia</kwd><kwd>Pulsed electromagnetic field</kwd><kwd>Pelvic floor exercises</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is defined as the origination of smooth muscle
enlargement and proliferation of epithelial cells within the transitional area of the
prostate gland. Enlargement of the gland might manifest in the lower urinary tract in two
ways: (1) critical bladder outlet blocking due to enlarged tissue; and (2) increased tone of
the diseased smooth muscle as well as the resistance inside the gland<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Voiding dysfunction might also be an obstructive
characteristic of an enlarged prostate, while overactive bladder is thought to be a
prominent reason for the storage symptoms observed in the lower urinary tract<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The challenges created by lower urinary
tract symptoms due to enlarged prostate in elderly men might be increasing and lead to this
primitive diagnosis in public health<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The central plan of BPH treatment involves reducing the troublesome lower urinary tract
symptoms that occur due to prostatic augmentation. Treatment should be adjusted as the
disease progresses and getting away of complexities that can be joined with BPH<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Different pharmacologic groups including
alpha-adrenergic blockers, 5-alphareductase suppressors, cholinergic inhibitors, and
phytotherapeutics were used<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Determining
the correct therapeutics for BPH is difficult. In the treatment of troublesome lower urinary
tract symptoms, that is basic for healthcare professions as the manifestations may occur due
to synergies between the pelvic organs and the central nervous system<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treatment strategies also involve the surgical removal of all or part of the prostate
gland, which can provoke uncontrolled urinary or sexual impediments<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises before and after surgery can have positive
impacts on restoring function, especially managing incontinence. Pelvic floor exercises
deliver distinctive unmistakable effects on the prostate, particularly in individuals who
present with BPH<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise can enhance blood circulation to the pelvic region, enabling the body to actively
eliminate harmful agents and waste products; decrease pressure, therefore decompressing
prostatic tissue<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>; and lessen abdominal
overweight, which enhances the lower body stress and consequently loosens the
prostate/rectal zone, promoting blood stream toward and outside these sites<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The physiological impacts of low-frequency electromagnetic field (EMF) have been suggested
to include the possibility of different considerations since they could enter through the
body tissues. The EMF is thought to have the ability to affect the cells that induce
different cellular changes including cell reproduction and differentiation<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, programmed cell death, new DNA formation,
RNA synthesis, protein formulation, protein phosphorylation, redox-mediated increases in
inflammatory cells, increased microvesicular motility, ATP production, hormone secretion,
increased antioxidant activity of enzymes, enhanced cellular metabolic action, and hindered
adherence activity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The organization of
restraining action and signal augmentation on organic activity has earlier been speculated
to be induced only through biochemical carriers and receptors; however, present studies
prove that molecular synergies may not remain the unique determinants implicated in the
biological interface. Chemical agents are possibly the particle ingredients accentuated by
directing energy fields carrying signal transduction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMF possesses numerous well-reported biological effects including
inflammation and pain suppression. This therapy is noninvasive, secure, and easy to use for
treating the origin of discomfort, damage, and inflammation<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Actually, there were limited number of studies conducted that
investigated the effects of EMF in the treatment of BPH. Furthermore, the present study adds
exercises therapy in the form of pelvic floor and aerobic exercises. Therefore, this study
aimed to investigate the effect of pulsed EMF with or without exercise therapy in the
treatment of BPH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized clinical study was performed according to rules, guidelines, and measures
for research concerning humans, and written informed consent was obtained from each
participant. The patients participated voluntarily without monetary compensation and the
study was performed in agreement with the human rights legislation from the Declaration of
Helsinki (1979). The data obtained were gathered between April and October 2016 in Cairo
University Hospitals, Department of Urology, Cairo, Egypt.</p><p>A total of 60 male patients were invited to join the study; the inclusion criteria were:
age 55&#x02013;65&#x02005;years; diagnosis of BPH; prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#x0003c;4 ng/ml; no clear
abnormalities on urological examination; and the ability to communicate, comprehend, and
agree to the study protocol. The exclusion criteria included symptoms for &#x0003c;6 months,
acute or chronic urethritis, urinary stones, bacterial or inflammatory chronic prostatitis
or chronic pelvic pain syndrome, bladder cancer, urethral strictures, neurogenic bladder
dysfunction, restricted mobility, and antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory medication up to 4
weeks before study enrollment.</p><p>Study design: Double-blind controlled randomized comparative study. Each subject underwent
the same evaluation that was performed by the same therapist at the beginning and end of the
study (after 4 weeks). All subjects were asked to maintain their activity levels during the
study period to exclude the personal variations of the results.</p><p>After the baseline evaluation, patients were randomly assigned to Group A (n=20; patients
who received pulsed EMF in addition to pelvic floor and aerobic exercises), Group B (n=20;
patients who received only PEMF), or Group C (n=20; patients who received placebo PEMF).</p><p>A DANTIC UD 5000/5500 Urodynamic examination system was utilized to perform the urodynamic
investigation and measure post-void residual urine and urine flow rate for each patient pre-
and post-treatment. Also, the prostate specific antigen (PSA), white blood cell (WBCs)
count, and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were assessed before and after a
4-week intervention.</p><p>An EMF device (PMT-120 Desktop, ElectroMeds, USA) was worked with impact to patient with
damped trains of magnetic oscillations with a period of 20&#x02013;1,100 nanoseconds and an
intensity of 0.12&#x02013;18 microtesla and a decreased damping of at least 0.05 and a repetition
rate between the trains in the range of 25&#x02013;30&#x02005;Hz. The application was directed to the
perineum with the patient lying in the lateral recumbent position. The treatment was
conducted for 30 minutes for each day, five times each week for 4 progressive weeks.</p><p>After the treatment protocol achievement (4 weeks of treatment), patients were re-assessed
using total PSA, complete blood count values, post-void residual urine, estimated urine flow
rate, and IPSS.</p><p>Aerobic exercises: regular aerobic exercise for 20&#x02013;60 minutes undertaken five times each
week at 55&#x02013;90% of the maximal heart rate is estimated as 220 &#x02212;age in years. Aerobic
exercises consist of moderate effort walking very briskly (4 mph) and bicycling with light
exertion (10&#x02013;12 mph) in addition to strenuous exercises consisting of jogging at 6 mph and
bicycling quickly (14&#x02013;16 mph) and flexibility exercises for major muscles consisting of two
to four sets of each exercise two to three times each week.</p><p>Pelvic floor exercises: The patients were instructed to empty their bladders before the
treatment sessions in an effort to feel comfortable and relaxed during the treatment
session. Each patient was prepared and taught a program of pelvic floor exercises to be
performed in daily sessions in lying, sitting, and standing positions consisting of 10
seconds of contractions followed by 10 seconds of relaxation and repeating the exercises 15
times each session. The contraction and relaxation times were continuously expanded by 1
second every week as a training for the slow twitch muscle fibers. While, fast twitch muscle
fibers can be trained through asking the patient to contract as if he controls his urine by
quick contraction and relaxation of the levator ani muscles 20 times, rest for ten seconds,
and then repeat again for a total of 2 to 4 &#x0201c;sets&#x0201d; of contractions.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). A paired t-test
was used to compare intergroup mean age, weight, height, and body mass index before the
treatment protocol. It was also used to compare intra- and intergroup WBC count, PSA,
post-void residual urine, urine flow rate, and IPSS values. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to compare groups with Bonferroni&#x02019;s post hoc test. A significance level of 0.05 was
used throughout all statistical tests within the study; p values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered
significant. The smaller the obtained p value, the more significant the outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study included 67 patients with BPH and a PSA&#x0003c;4 ng/ml without clear abnormalities
on a urological examination. Of those 67 patients, seven did not meet the inclusion criteria
and were excluded from the study due to various causes: unwilling to participate (n=3),
insufficient number of evaluation values (n=2), refusal to continue the treatment protocol
(n=1), and not completing two sessions of the assigned intervention (n=1). As such, the
final sample consisted of 60 patients, 20 in each group. The demographic data for the three
groups were tested pre-intervention to confirm homogeneity, and no significant difference

count, PSA antigen, IPSS, and post-void residual urine in addition to the significantly
increased urine flow rate in Groups A and B, while Group C showed non-significant changes in
values except for IPSS, which may be due to the improved frequency, urgency, and nectoria.
Studies to date have explained that the mechanisms through which PEMF acts are complex and
reasonably include several pathways<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Further considerations are required to ascertain the principles for these impacts in BPH.
The anti-inflammatory capacity of PEMF should additionally be granted<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inflammation of the prostate gland might signify a
powerful factor in determining prostatic swelling and improving symptoms. Prostatic
inflammation may express a mechanism of hyperplastic transformations to befall<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plenty of growth agents and cytokines
contribute to the inflammatory process of the prostate. The highest PEMF potential was
displayed in its capacity to enhance the effects of inflammation by reducing inflammatory
cytokines and improving cellular metabolism<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, by diminishing the inflammatory processes, PEMF may
possess the ability to overcome developments related to BPH and its associated symptoms<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study in 2011 of 20 humans showed that
the clinical manifestations of BPH were significantly diminished following PEMF
administration, so the influence persisted for 12 months<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additional clinical studies could present further data covering
the efficiency of this approach in the same category of patients.</p><p>Electromagnetic treatments are dependent upon the time-varying EMF habitually created at
low wavelengths through an alternative current reaching through a coil<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The fundamental discrepancy with other direct fields is
that time-varying magnetic fields might produce magnetic fields with notable energy in the
body; furthermore, its amount could be determined using electrical laws such as Faraday&#x02019;s
equation. Static EMF possesses no auxiliary electric fields and cannot transport magnetic
power to the movable energized particles<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, designating the efficiency of that type of therapy and describing
the deficiency of strong medical sign in the systematic research to encourage its
application. PEMF is a broad approach employed in the treatment of various medical
dysfunctions, such as musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, neurological manifestations<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and urological
disciplines<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanism of the
beneficial performance of the PEMF upon living organisms is not completely obvious yet;
however, clinical studies have reported its convenient role in decreasing inflammation,
forming new blood vessels, and relieving pain<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plenty of clinical studies have recommended that magnetic field
stimulating properties can hasten organ healing<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Its application on the prostate gland helps reduce postoperative
problems and was observed to excite the prostate gland and promote blood flow<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, demonstrating a definite impact on
revascularization and the circulatory consequences of the prostate<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several explanations have been suggested to describe how physical exercises decrease BPH
hazards. Androgens remain engaged in the development and sustaining of BPH, and those who
joined the continued endurance disciplines possess, as a group, lower resting testosterone
values<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. They attributed their
decisions to diminished sympathetic nervous action rather than decreased prostate mass since
the exercises were greatly relevant to characteristic BPH than prostatic augmentation<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Some studies imply that physical exercises decrease the probability of BPH; however, the
exercise is simply of low to medium intensity (ascending stairs, hiking, rowing, or
gymnastics)<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. This information is
valuable since rare studies have stated that this advantage was correlated with different
health results such as cardiovascular disorders.</p><p>The limitation of the current study was its small sample size, which might affect its
results; therefore, it is advisable to increase the number of participants in future studies
to obtain much better results. Furthermore, the addition of other investigations and study
groups can support our results.</p><p>PEMF seems, by all accounts, to be a promising treatment method and appears to exert
valuable consequences in the management of BPH. Additional studies are most likely required
to clarify the correct mechanism through which EMF impacts BPH and present it as a safe and
noninvasive technique in the treatment of prostate injuries.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients of Cairo University Hospitals for their
