It is a fundamental constituent of cell membranes, the precursor of several hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Lipid disorders most often imply hypercholesterolemia. There is a large body of epidemiological evidence demonstrating a strong correlation and causal relationship between serum cholesterol level, particularly serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Other clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis also appear to be linked to plasma LDL-C levels such as cerebrovascular disease (ie, stroke) or peripheral vascular disease. In addition, clinical trials have shown that LDL-lowering therapy is able to reduce the risk of CHD.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Statins are effective for treating cardiovascular diseases in primary and secondary prevention.<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, discontinuation rates are high and almost one-third of statin users discontinue therapy within 1 year due to poor tolerability and adverse events (AEs).<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The most commonly reported AEs are: elevated hepatic enzyme levels, gastrointestinal symptoms and statin-associated myalgias, which include muscle pain and weakness. Myositis (elevated creatinine phosphokinase [CPK] level) and rhabdomyolysis are more serious, but rare complications of therapy.<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For this reason, the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in clinical practice is rarely encouraged for primary prevention.</p><p>Although statins represent an effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia, there is a medical need to use alternative products that could link a safer tolerability profile to the effectiveness. For this reason, nutraceuticals with lipid-lowering characteristics have been studied as a viable alternative to conventional therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia, with the aim to reduce the main atherosclerotic risk factors and promote cardiovascular health.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In particular, lipid-lowering effects have been claimed for nutraceuticals containing berberine, red yeast rice (RYR) and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In this context, the clinical use of a new food supplement, Body Lipid (BL; Farmaceutici Procemsa, Torino, Italy), a nutraceutical combination containing a mixture of RYR (monacolin K 10 mg), berberine (500 mg), coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (2 mg) and hydroxytyrosol (5 mg), could represent an effective approach for mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemic patients&#x02019; management.</p><p>The interest in a nutraceutical approach to metabolic disorders is growing because patients with metabolic conditions suitable for a nutraceutical approach seem to appreciate a therapeutic management that does not involve drug treatment.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Both monacolin K and berberine and have been shown to exert a positive effect on lipid control.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Monacolin K is a statin-like molecule which is derived from Chinese RYR, a dietary supplement made by fermenting the yeast, <italic>Monascus purpureus</italic>, over rice.

Since plasma levels of cholesterol depend mainly on the biosynthetic pathway and, to a lesser extent, on diet, integration of the diet with RYR has been shown to be effective in improving lipid pattern.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The approval granted by EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) in 2011 for RYR reads as follows: &#x0201c;Red yeast rice contributes to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations&#x0201d; and it refers to the administration of 10 mg daily of monacolin K from fermented RYR preparations.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Berberine is an alkaloid isoquinoline ring with cholesterol lowering properties, that is extracted from plants of the genus <italic>Berberis</italic>.

Moreover, in an explorative analysis, BL was more effective than the comparator, the marketed AM, in reducing the LDL cholesterol levels (&#x02212;26.3% vs &#x02212;18.3%, respectively).</p><p>Although the greater efficacy of BL compared to AM was likely due to a higher monacolin K concentration, the safety profile of the two products was comparable.</p><p>Notably, BL induced a reduction of LDL-C comparable with that usually obtained with low-density statin therapies, such as simvastatin 10 mg/day and pravastatin 10&#x02013;20 mg/day (LDL-C reduction of approximately 30%) and very close to the lower range of the moderate-intensity statin therapies, such as atorvastatin 10 mg/day and simvastatin 20&#x02013;40 mg/day (LDL-C reduction of approximately 30% to &#x0003c;50%).<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The particular merit of RYR is that, when consumed in doses providing 10 mg of monacolins daily, it is usually well tolerated by patients who previously have been intolerant to prescription statins (RYR rarely causes serious adverse effects), as reported in several clinical trials.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>A regimen combining RYR and berberine could work in complementary ways to upregulate the expression of LDL receptors in hepatocytes, likely achieving a reduction in LDL cholesterol comparable with that seen with moderate-dose prescription statin therapy. Studies with RYR suggest that monacolin K would be far less likely than prescription statins to induce myopathy or hepatic damage, and it might represent an effective alternative for patients who are statin intolerant. Moreover, berberine tends to decrease Tg levels and promote insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Hence, by favorably influencing both LDL cholesterol and improving glycemic control, the combination of monacolin K and berberine might be effective in reducing the cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-1585" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The above considerations suggest that combined administration of monacolin K and berberine could provide similar protection from cardiovascular diseases compared to prescription statin therapy, with potentially lower risks for adverse effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first clinical trial carried out with such a large number of hypercholesterolemic patients.</p><p>The recruited patients were screened twice, before and after the run-in period in order to obtain a homogeneous population showing LDL-C levels that clearly define patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. In addition, the new food supplement BL was compared vs placebo, and vs the market leader, AM, with the aim to test the study sensitivity.</p><p>The absolute change in LDL-C level from baseline was &#x02212;39.1&#x000b1;17.76 mg/dL corresponding to 1 mmol/L, in the BL group and 5.7&#x000b1;14.98 mg/dL corresponding to 0.15 mmol/L in the placebo group.</p><p>Despite the positive results, the study has the limitation of a short treatment period; prolonged therapy could have provided additional information about the effect of the combination and about the long-term safety and tolerability.</p><p>In conclusion, the new food supplement BL could be considered a very satisfactory treatment in terms of efficacy, safety and tolerability, for patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. This nutraceutical supplement treatment could be a valid alternative for patients who are statin intolerant or for those who prefer alternative treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The test product BL was provided as capsules of berberine, monacolin, hydroxytyrosol, and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> manufactured by Farmaceutici Procemsa.
