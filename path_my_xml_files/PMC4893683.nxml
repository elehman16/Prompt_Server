Our objective was to investigate digestive functions in rifaximin-treated IBS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, we compared the effects of rifaximin, 550&#x02009;mg t.i.d., and placebo for 14 days in nonconstipated IBS and no evidence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). All subjects completed baseline and on-treatment evaluation of colonic transit by scintigraphy, mucosal permeability by lactulose&#x02013;mannitol excretion, and fecal microbiome, bile acids, and short chain fatty acids measured on random stool sample. Overall comparison of primary response measures between treatment groups was assessed using intention-to-treat analysis of covariance (ANCOVA, with baseline value as covariate).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant effects of treatment on bowel symptoms, small bowel or colonic permeability, or colonic transit at 24&#x02009;h. Rifaximin was associated with acceleration of ascending colon emptying (14.9&#x000b1;2.6&#x02009;h placebo; 6.9&#x000b1;0.9&#x02009;h rifaximin; <italic>P</italic>=0.033) and overall colonic transit at 48&#x02009;h (geometric center 4.0&#x000b1;0.3&#x02009;h placebo; 4.7&#x000b1;0.2&#x02009;h rifaximin; <italic>P</italic>=0.046); however, rifaximin did not significantly alter total fecal bile acids per g of stool or proportion of individual bile acids or acetate, propionate, or butyrate in stool. Microbiome studies showed strong associations within subjects, modest associations with time across subjects, and a small but significant association of microbial richness with treatment arm (rifaximin vs. treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In nonconstipated IBS without documented SIBO, rifaximin treatment is associated with acceleration of colonic transit and changes in microbial richness; the mechanism for reported symptomatic benefit requires further investigation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes psychosocial factors and abnormalities of motility, sensation, and mucosal defense. Prior infection is considered an important antecedent factor, with increased odds ranging from 2 to 11, and a recent meta-analysis suggesting an average increased odds of close to 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Alterations in the mucosa and the interaction with the bacterial flora contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS.</p><p>The overall aim of the this research is to understand the changes in digestive functions in response to rifaximin in the treatment of nonconstipated IBS (non-C-IBS).</p><p>Given the antimicrobial effects of the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin, a brief summary of the prior findings on the microbiome, effects on carbohydrate fermentation (with production of organic acids), and on intraluminal bile acids are provided here.</p><p>First, earlier studies suggested there were quantitative differences in the fecal microbial population in IBS compared with controls, such as differences in <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and <italic>Veillonella.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> More recently, significant phylotype-level alterations in the intestinal microbiota of IBS patients were observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Second, under normal circumstances, &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of all complex carbohydrates in the diet are not absorbed in the small intestine and pass into the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> The composition of colonic bacteria may, therefore, modify the metabolism of complex carbohydrates such as starch and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate. A significant increase of bacterially produced SCFAs was recently recorded in the feces of Japanese IBS patients who also harbored significantly more <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> spp. compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> SCFAs can accelerate colonic transit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> similar to the long-chain fatty acid, oleic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> SCFAs may also affect colonic sensation.

The balance of secretory (DCA plus CDCA) to nonsecretory (cholic acid, lithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid) bile acids in the colon influences colonic secretion and propulsive motility and affects bowel function.</p><p>In multiple controlled clinical trials, treatment for 2 weeks with the nonsystemic antibiotic, rifaximin, provided significant relief from IBS symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, and loose or watery stools in patients with non-C-IBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Consistent with its bactericidal effects, rifaximin has also been reported to &#x0201c;normalize&#x0201d; lactulose hydrogen breath tests, suggestive of actions on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> although the accuracy and specificity of the method used for identifying SIBO have been questioned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> A recent scholarly review has suggested that rifaximin may decrease host proinflammatory responses to bacterial products in patients with IBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> However, it is unclear whether rifaximin affects other digestive functions, such as intestinal and colonic mucosal permeability or transit, SCFAs, and bile acids, in addition to effects on the microbiome.</p><p>The specific aims of this study were to compare in patients with non-C-IBS who were randomized to treatment with rifaximin, 550&#x02009;mg, t.i.d., or placebo, t.i.d., the effects on colonic permeability, small bowel and colonic transit, fecal excretion of SCFAs, bile acids, and fecal microbiome.

The capsule was ingested following an overnight fast. At the baseline transit test to determine eligibility, scans were acquired at 4 and 24&#x02009;h after capsule ingestion. A full transit study was performed at the end of the treatment phases. After the capsule had emptied from the stomach (documented by its position relative to radioisotopic markers placed on the anterior iliac crests), a radiolabeled meal was ingested. In this meal, technetium-99&#x02009;m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) sulfur-colloid was used to label two scrambled eggs, eaten with one slice of whole wheat bread and one glass of skim milk (300&#x02009;kcal total). This meal facilitated measurement of gastric and small bowel transit. Subjects ingested standardized meals for lunch and dinner at 4 and 8&#x02009;h after the radiolabeled meal, respectively. Abdominal scans were obtained every 1&#x02009;h for the first 6&#x02009;h (the first 4&#x02009;h for the assessment of gastric emptying) and at 8, 24, and 48&#x02009;h after ingestion of the <sup>111</sup>In capsule.</p><sec><title>Transit data analysis</title><p>A variable region of interest program was used to quantitate the counts in the stomach and in each of four colonic regions: ascending (AC), transverse (TC), descending (DC), and combined sigmoid and rectum (RS).

Probes were clustered into probe sets based on both correlations in intensity across all biological samples and taxonomic relatedness. Where multiple clustering solutions were available, higher correlation coefficients were favored over lower, taxonomic relatedness at the species level was favored over higher ranks, and sets composed of more probes were favored over less. All probe sets contained &#x02265;5 probes. Empirical operational taxonomic unit (eOTU) tracked by a probe set was taxonomically annotated against the May 2013 release of Greengenes from the combination of the 8-mers contained in all probes of the set. Where standard taxonomic names had not been established, hierarchical taxon identifier was used (for example, &#x0201c;94otu36152&#x0201d;). The mean fluorescence intensity for each eOTU and each sample was calculated and then rank normalized within each sample. These values are referred to as the hybridization score (HybScore) used in abundance-based analysis. The proportion of probes for an eOTU that is observed as positive in a sample is referred to as the positive fraction.

These strong associations with subject emphasize that stability of the microbial community over time is by far the most dominant signal within our data set.</p><p>Despite this strong stability in the microbial community over time, the linear models showed that a modest number of taxa did change in a consistent way between baseline and treatment periods, independent of treatment arm. Four of the five MDS axes (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and 74 out of 2,243 taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online) showed significant associations with time (i.e., visit number) at a 10&#x00025; FDR.</p><p>In contrast, only one of the first five MDS axes (axis 3; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed a significant association between study arm and time.

There were, however, no individual OTUs among the 2,243 OTUs for which we built linear models with significant associations with any term in the model involving study arm at a 10&#x00025; FDR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online), although 13 OTUs had significant associations with the interaction between study arm and time (visit) at a more relaxed 25&#x00025; FDR threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online).</p><p>The Second Genome pipeline calculates richness at the species level as the number of distinct taxa that are present above baseline in each sample.

Because of rifaximin's small effect size and the large number of OTUs for which we had to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, tests for the effect of study arm interacting with time trend toward significance at the OTU level did not reach a 10&#x00025; FDR threshold.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study in 24 patients with non-C-IBS has shown no significant effects of treatment with rifaximin, 550&#x02009;mg, t.i.d., over placebo on bowel function, small bowel or colonic permeability, small bowel transit or colonic transit at 24&#x02009;h, or fecal organic acids measured on a random stool sample. Specifically, there were no significant changes in the proportion of individual primary or secondary bile acids or in stool content of the total and individual (acetate or propionate) SCFAs. There was a borderline difference in the stool butyrate concentration in the two treatment groups. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases that results in gene regulation, immune modulation, cancer suppression, cell differentiation, intestinal barrier regulation, oxidative stress reduction, diarrhea control, and modulation of visceral sensitivity and intestinal motility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> However, the fecal butyrate level was actually higher in the placebo than the rifaximin treatment group and, therefore, any beneficial effects of rifaximin cannot be attributed to the high fecal butyrate levels. We did detect effects on the microbiome, but these were at the edge of statistical significance, with effect sizes much smaller than could be attributed to the stability of the microbiome within individual subjects over time. Given the controversy regarding the prevalence of SIBO in IBS, because of the lack of specificity of lactulose or glucose-breath hydrogen or methane studies, and the difficulty with obtaining duodenal aspirates for culture, we elected not to study small bowel bacterial populations or overgrowth in our study that explored several other potential changes in intestinal functions and stool organic acids and microbiome.</p><p>On the other hand, rifaximin treatment was associated with accelerated ascending colon emptying and borderline acceleration in overall colonic transit at 48&#x02009;h in the patients with non-C-IBS. The observations on ascending colon and overall colonic transit do not provide clear mechanisms for the beneficial effects reported in IBS-D patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> treated with rifaximin using a treatment regimen similar to that followed in this study. Interestingly, a recent trial demonstrated efficacy of rifaximin in the treatment of constipation in patients with IBS-C when combined with neomycin in comparison with neomycin alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup></p><p>A careful analysis of the evidence of efficacy on bowel function and bloating scores in the published pivotal trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> suggests that there is benefit from this treatment. Although our current studies were anchored on biological end points rather than symptoms, we are confident that the patients represented the disease manifestations typically selected for treatment with rifaximin. Thus, the patients had an average of 2.5 bowel movements per day with stool consistency averaging 5 on the BSFS.</p><p>The observed effects of rifaximin treatment on ascending colon transit and overall colonic transit at 48&#x02009;h are intriguing, given the recent observation that rifaximin may be efficacious in combination with the nonabsorbed antibiotic, neomycin, in the relief of constipation, straining, and bloating in patients with IBS-C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> On the other hand, the acceleration of transit would not be expected to provide symptom relief in non-C-IBS, the subgroup of patients included in this study. Although our study did not demonstrate any differences in stool frequency, consistency, and ease of stool passage, it is important to note that the study was not powered to assess these symptoms; in addition, we did not appraise bloating in this study.</p><p>The studies of fecal microbiome suggest that rifaximin has a modest, but detectable, effect on the bacterial flora. This contrasts with the report that rifaximin has a potent effect on specific small bowel aerobic and anaerobic flora <italic>in vitro</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> consistent with the known effects of rifaximin as a nonsystemic antibiotic with broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the human gut, as well as against enteropathogens. Our observations in humans, however, are consistent with the transient reductions in stool coliform counts that recover in contrast to the more durable reductions in duodenal bacteria with rifaximin as observed in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Our observations are also consistent with the finding from the TARGET 3 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> that the gut microbiome showed a transient, small decrease in richness with rifaximin treatment. The precise mechanism whereby this alteration in microbial species that has now been observed in multiple cohorts may result in clinical symptomatic benefit in non-C-IBS requires further investigation, but it does not appear to result from changes in colonic transit, mucosal permeability, or organic acids. Because of the modest effects of rifaximin on the microbial community, studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to characterize in taxonomic detail at the OTU level changes that happen to the microbial community with rifaximin treatment.</p><p>A puzzling feature of our study is that the taxa appear to be changing over time irrespective of treatment arm, considering similar characteristics at baseline within group. Our results in this area are modest; none of the 74 OTUs that we report as changing with time would be significant at 1&#x00025; FDR threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online), a higher stringency than the 10&#x00025; FDR threshold that we used in this paper. Nonetheless, these results stand in contrast to the TARGET 3 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> that, with a larger sample size, did not find substantial differences over a 2-week period in placebo-treated IBS subjects over a 2-week period. A major difference between the TARGET 3 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> and this study was the technology used to characterize the microbial community. The TARGET 3 study used Illumina-based deep sequencing, whereas this study used microarrays within the Second Genome platform. It is certainly a possibility that the two different platforms, with their very different bioinformatics pipelines, have different sensitivities to different taxa and this may explain the modestly different results we observed between the two cohorts.</p><p>Our study evaluated the proportion of primary and secondary bile acids; this is relevant as bacterial 7&#x003b1; hydroxylase produced by colonic bacteria is important for conversion of primary to secondary bile acids. Thus, it is conceivable that the inability to convert the primary bile acid, cholic acid, to the secondary bile acid, DCA, would reduce the concentration of the secretory DCA in the colon and potentially relieve diarrhea. Indeed, rifaximin treatment appears to act by suppressing DCA production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is equally conceivable that the primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which is secretory, would not be dehydroxylated to the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid, which is nonsecretory. The mean total DCA and CDCA proportions were virtually identical in the two treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The strengths of this study include the adequate power to address pivotal mechanisms involved in non-C-IBS and study of potential mechanisms of action of rifaximin. The quantitative traits have been used extensively and, for critically important measurement of transit, the scintigraphic measurements are validated including performance characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> and responsiveness to pharmacological treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> The wide spectrum of mechanisms evaluated also differentiates this study from any of the prior attempts to characterize the mechanisms of benefit of rifaximin in diarrhea-predominant IBS-D or non-C-IBS.</p><p>A weakness of the study is that although it appraised the stool sample in great detail, the microbiome associated with the colonic mucosa was not evaluated. Our study does not assess the mechanisms of potential benefit in patients with definite SIBO, or those with abnormal breath hydrogen or methane excretion after an oral glucose or lactulose load, as we excluded those with proven SIBO and did not perform any baseline evaluation of breath hydrogen or methane excretion in this study. In addition, with the relatively small sample size, we cannot assess whether there are subgroups that have different responses to rifaximin treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, rifaximin treatment is associated with acceleration of proximal colonic emptying, with borderline overall effect on colonic transit at 48&#x02009;h, but not at 24&#x02009;h. There were no significant effects on bowel function, mucosal permeability, fecal bile acid excretion, or SCFAs. Rifaximin was associated with a borderline change in stool microbial species richness. Although the clinical benefits of rifaximin in non-C IBS have been demonstrated following single and repeat treatment cycles in multiple large clinical trials, the mechanism(s) of these benefits requires further investigation. The design of future studies may be enhanced by focusing on patients with predominant bloating or those with proven dysbiosis at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ctg201632i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cindy Stanislav for excellent secretarial assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Information</xref> accompanies this paper on the Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology website (http://www.nature.com/ctg)</p></fn></fn-group><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article</bold>: Michael Camilleri, MD.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions</bold>: A.
