An ideal IOL is the critical component to achieve the refractive target of cataract surgery. Biocompatibility, rate of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) and visual quality have all been suggested as critical characteristics of an ideal IOL and widely investigated. Stability of IOL position was also recently proposed as a critical factor due to its close correlation with postoperative visual function. An IOL forward movement of 0.29&#x000a0;mm along the visual axis has been associated with a myopic shift of &#x02212;0.4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, Wang and colleagues recently reported that 0.5-mm decentration of an aspheric IOL could eliminate its aberration-correcting effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, poor stability could even lead to IOL exchange as well as additional surgery, which both surgeons and patients wish to avoid.</p><p>As the supporting element, haptics are crucial to maintaining the position of the IOL. Various haptic designs have been compared in terms of the position stability of IOLs. Haptic designs of single-piece versus three-piece IOLs are often compared because these are the most commonly used types. Single-piece IOLs have soft and broader haptics that are manufactured from the same material as the optic, usually hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic, whereas three-piece IOLs have rigid haptics that are composed of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA). Clinical studies comparing these haptic designs have yielded conflicting results regarding their position stability in the capsular bag, the most-recommended site for IOL fixation in an uneventful cataract surgery.</p><p>Most previous studies have measured the IOL position based on Purkinje reflections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this measurement is time-consuming, and patients are reluctant to cooperate during image acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, Purkinje measurement does not detect anterior chamber depth (ACD) and thus fails to reveal the IOL position along the axis. By contrast, clinical Scheimpflug systems based on rotating Scheimpflug imaging can acquire enough 3-dimensioinal data points within a reasonably short period, usually seconds, and are one of the best methods to estimate IOL position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>To better compare the intracapsular stability of single-piece and three-piece IOLs, we measured IOL positions using rotating Scheimpflug imaging systems and tested the visual quality of patients implanted with these IOLs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial is available as supplementary information; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 65 patients with age-related cataracts (80 eyes) were enrolled between December 2012 and December 2013 from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which is China&#x02019;s largest eye hospital and is located in Guangzhou city, South China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>The inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients with a diagnosis of bilateral age-related cataracts</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age between 60 and 85&#x000a0;years.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Diagnosis of vision-impairing diseases other than cataracts, severe refractive error (preoperative spherical equivalent of either eye&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x02212;6.00D or +5.00D);</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of ocular trauma; past refractive surgery or other ophthalmic surgery;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Capsular or zonular disorders that might affect the post-operative centration of IOLs, e.g., pseudo-exfoliation syndrome or Marfan syndrome;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Surgical complications including severe hyphema, iris injury, repeated IOL implantation during surgery, failure to achieve in-the-bag IOL implantation and corneal sutures.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Participants were assigned by simple randomization (1:1) to either Group A, receiving single-piece IOLs (ZCB00, Abbot Medical Optics, Illinois, USA) or Group B receiving three-piece IOLs (ZA9003, Abbot Medical Optics, Illinois, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

When evaluating visual function, a Snellen chart was used to assess visual acuity, and the outcome was converted to logMAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Manifest refraction was performed and further used to determine the spherical equivalent (SE) and best-corrected visual acuity. Total aberration was measured using an iTrace aberrometer (Tracey Technologies, Inc, Texas, USA) under dark lighting conditions. Pupil dilation was then induced by instilling 0.5&#x000a0;% tropicamide eyedrops. When the pupil was sufficiently dilated, IOL position was measured using Pentacam (OCULUS Optikger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Germany) as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

Central ACD was measured as the distance between the central corneal posterior endothelium and the anterior surface of IOL (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> Panel a). The subtraction in ACD between two visits indicated forward or backward axial movement of the IOL. Decentration was measured from the center of IOL anterior surface to the pupillary axis, which was perpendicular to the line between the two anterior chamber angles and through the midpoint of the line.

An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was performed to compare means of continuous variables that exhibited normal distributions (axial movement, decentration, tilt, visual acuity, refraction and total aberration) between the two groups. Continuous variables without a normal distribution were compared using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test. Categorical variables such as sex were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact probability test. Because of the nested structure of the eyes, we additionally applied a generalized estimating equation with a working covariance matrix of unstructured correlations to analyze repeated measures data.

Various factors affect position stability. Our study compared the position stability of single-piece and three-piece aspheric IOLs in a clinical scenario. The results revealed that single-piece IOLs moved less than three-piece IOLs along the visual axis and therefore had greater axial stability. The forward movement of three-piece IOLs caused a slight myopic shift, whereas the refractive status of single-piece IOLs remained stable. This result is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In a laboratory study of the biomechanical properties of IOLs with different haptic designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Lane et al. demonstrated that the optic of a single-piece IOL exhibits significantly less axial movement than that of three-piece IOLs during haptic compression. After implantation in the capsular bag, the haptics undergo compression, particularly in the case of capsular contraction, and soft haptics exert less force on the optic, resulting in less axial movement of the IOL. Axial movement beyond a certain extent will lead to &#x0201c;refractive surprises&#x0201d; and unsatisfactory visual function. In the worst scenario, a refractive surprise would require IOL exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, single-piece IOLs might be more appropriate for implantation in the capsular bag due to better position stability.</p><p>Decentration and tilt of single-piece and three-piece spherical IOLs have been investigated in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our observations of aspheric IOLs are consistent with these studies and indicate that the decentration and tilt of both types of IOLs are not clinically significant. Aspheric IOLs are unique in that they pose greater demands on centration. McKelvie et al. investigated the association of IOL decentration and tilt with aberration and suggested decentration greater than 0.5&#x000a0;mm and tilt greater than 4&#x000b0; are clinically significant for aspheric IOLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In our study, the decentration and tilt were within these limits in both groups, and the total aberration in both groups was close to zero, consistent with McKelvie&#x02019;s results.</p><p>Previous comparisons of the position stability of different IOLs have primarily used Purkinje imaging to measure IOL position in the eye. For this method, a point-light source is fixed at a certain distance in front of the eye. The patient is asked to stare at the light source, and reflections of the light source form at the front cornea, back of the cornea and anterior surface of IOL. The image of these reflections is recorded, and the distances between any two reflections are measured and used to calculate the decentration and tilt of the IOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The Purkinje method is the gold standard for measuring IOL decentration and tilt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the use of the Purkinje method among patients with age-related cataracts is hindered by low compliance by elderly subjects. Keeping the eyelids wide open and staring at a light source for a certain time can be challenging for these patients. Furthermore, the Purkinje method cannot measure the axial position of the IOL. Our study used a rotating Scheimpflug imaging system (Pentacam) to measure the position of the IOL in the eye. Rosales et al. determined that Purkinje and Scheimpflug have comparable accuracy and repeatability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An advantage of the Scheimpflug imaging system is that the image acquisition time is 3&#x000a0;s or less; thus, most patients are able to cooperate well. Few clinical studies have employed the Scheimpflug imaging system, and further studies are needed to confirm its diagnostic value.</p><p>The results and interpretation of the current study must be understood within the context of its strengths and limitations. Few clinical studies have used a rotating Scheimpflug imaging device to compare stability in the capsular bag between single-piece and three-piece IOLs. The process of image acquisition and data generation is independent of the operator; the measurement is therefore objective, and the results provide additional clinical evidence. This is the major strength of the present study. However, our study features several limitations as well. First, patients were followed up only for three months. This short follow-up period is not fully adequate to determine if single-piece IOLs or three-piece IOLs are more appropriate for implantation in the capsular bag. Second, the sample size of the present study was insufficient to detect differences in decentration and tilt. Third, fellow-eye comparison was not performed due to ethical considerations. Despite these limitations, the results of this study are useful given the lack of clinical investigations of aspheric IOLs with different haptic designs. Further studies with longer follow-up periods, larger sample sizes and more rigorous designs are needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the current study compared the position stability of single-piece and three-piece aspheric IOLs using a rotating Scheimpflug imaging system. The axial movement of single-piece IOLs was significantly less than that of three-piece IOLs. The forward movement of the three-piece IOL was associated with myopic shift. The aspheric IOLs were similar in the amount of decentration, tilt, visual acuity and total aberration. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term stability and visual function of these IOL designs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACD, anterior chamber depth; IOL, intraocular lenses; PCO, posterior capsule opacification; PMMA, poly methyl methacrylate; SD, standard deviation; SE, spherical equivalent; ZOC, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12886_2016_283_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Study protocol for this trial.
