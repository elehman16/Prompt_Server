A total of 720 patients who received a cancer diagnosis in the previous 2 months and about to start medical treatment will be enrolled. The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the HQIS versus standard care in terms of improvement of at least one of two domains (emotional and social functions) of HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 items) questionnaire, at baseline and at 3 months. This outcome was chosen because patients with cancer generally exhibit low HRQoL, particularly at certain stages of care, and because it allows to assess the strategy&#x02019;s impact as perceived by patients themselves. The HQIS comprises three phases: (1) clinician training&#x02014;to improve communication-relational skills and instruct on the project; (2) centre support&#x02014;four on-site visits by experts of the project team, aimed to boost motivation, help with context analysis and identification of solutions; (3) implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) recommendations at the centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics committee review approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of Parma.

Research points to the existence of a wide range of psychosocial needs, defined as psychological, emotional, social and spiritual aspects of health, which frequently are not detected or adequately dealt with.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although prevalence of psychological distress among patients with cancer is difficult to estimate, because of the many different tools and diagnostic criteria used, research reports that up to 75% of patients with newly diagnosed cancer develop psychological distress.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Furthermore, the burden of the disease is increased by frequent practical demands (economic problems due to absence from work, transportation to reach the hospital, and so on) and information needs concerning the disease and available support services.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> These aspects are so relevant that Bultz and Carlson suggest to consider cancer a biopsychosocial illness,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and to strongly advocate for the need to integrate the psychosocial domain into practice.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref>
</p><p>Although there are now numerous guidelines providing best evidence psychosocial and supportive care for oncology patients,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> evidence suggests that many patients with cancer who might benefit from these interventions do not receive them.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> Barriers to implementation may be related to personal characteristics of healthcare professionals (such as knowledge and beliefs about appropriate psychosocial care, and existing skills), and to environmental/organisational factors (such as time restraints and lack of formal support).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Notably, several of these barriers are modifiable.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>These findings emphasise the need for implementation strategies to effectively transfer evidence into practice.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 13 14</xref> Such a strategy should be tailored to potential barriers and obstacles,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and should be feasible (it can be implemented and maintained) and effective (able to modify both individual behaviour and the local organisation).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Choosing the strategy to improve psychosocial care</title><p>These considerations formed the basis for the HuCare (Humanisation in Cancer Care) implementation study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health and by the Lombardy Regional Health Trust, conducted in 28 cancer centres nationwide. The project, completed in 2014, evaluated the feasibility of the &#x02018;Hucare Quality Improvement Strategy&#x02014;HQIS&#x02019;, aimed at integrating into practice six psychosocial interventions recommended by international guidelines. The HQIS was developed and implemented following the model by Pronovost <italic>et al</italic> for the translation of evidence into practice.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A multidisciplinary task force first reviewed the relevant research and identified interventions with the greatest benefit and the lowest barriers to use. An improvement team (IT) then conducted four to six visits in each centre to assist clinic staff in identifying obstacles, finding solutions and strengthening motivation to carry out recommended changes. Following an implementation period, adherence to each of the six recommendations was assessed and the objective was considered to be met if the centre&#x02019;s adherence percentage was at least 75%. HuCare has demonstrated the strategy&#x02019;s feasibility in a real context,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> since over 75% of patients had received the psychosocial interventions in 27 of the 28 participating centres. Although these results are promising, it must be pointed out that participating sites were primarily leading centres of excellence, mainly located in wealthier Northern Italy. Also, the evidence of improvement was limited to process indicators and not outcome indicators of quality (eg, patient&#x02019;s psychological well-being). Randomised trials are therefore necessary to demonstrate that implementation strategies aiming to integrate psychosocial care into practice may improve knowledge and skills,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> as well as health outcomes, and that they are sustainable.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 21</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>The choice of health-related quality of life to assess the strategy&#x02019;s efficacy</title><p>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multidimensional concept referring to the effect of an illness and its therapy on a patient&#x02019;s physical, psychological and social well-being as perceived by the patient himself.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Numerous studies conducted in different countries show that HRQoL of patients affected with diverse cancer types is lower than that of the general population,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> and that the risk of a reduced QoL is greater at certain stages of the care process, such as the first few months of treatment, a period characterised by high levels of anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref>
</p><p>Today, there is general agreement on the importance of HRQoL as an outcome in clinical trials.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> As far back as 1996,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended that it be considered a primary outcome in any phase III trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration supports the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes (PRO), such as QoL, both in cancer research, and in the decision process for the approval of medicinal products in oncology.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A review of phase III studies performed by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group shows how detection of HRQoL represents an added value in research, and in some cases can modify the clinical interpretation of trial results.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p><p>HRQoL also plays a central role as a measure of the quality of care.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> The policy statement of the European Partnership Action Against Cancer Consensus Group, an initiative of the European Commission launched in 2009, considers the QoL of a patient an essential element in the decision-making process, which must be discussed with the patient.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p><p>Given the relevance of HRQoL for people with cancer, the literature is increasingly emphasising the importance of identifying ways of maintaining and improving their QoL. In this regard, a Cochrane systematic review<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> summarises findings from 30 randomised and quasiexperimental trials (5155 patients, of which 1249 were included in the meta-analysis), published between 1981 and 2009, aimed at assessing the effect in terms of HRQoL (as the primary outcome) of a psychosocial intervention comprising an interpersonal relationship between patients and specially trained healthcare professionals. The authors conclude that no statistically significant results have been obtained on HRQoL at 6 months, probably also due to methodological limitations, heterogeneity of the detection tools used, high risk of contamination bias and of a dilution of the observed effect. Based on these considerations, the review provides indications for future research, emphasising the need for randomised controlled trials (RCT) on those patients who are more likely to benefit from psychosocial interventions, and using adequate tools and sensitive measures, that is, capable of capturing changes in the psychosocial domain.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Research question and hypotheses</title><p>Building on the findings of the HuCare implementation study, and following the indications of the literature, this randomised trial was therefore designed to assess whether the introduction of the HQIS in oncology wards, compared with standard care, improves the QoL of patients at 3 months (primary endpoint), and in the long term at 6 months and 1&#x02009;year after the intervention (secondary endpoints).</p><p>The main hypotheses are the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Improving communication and relational skills of clinical staff (medical oncologists and nurses) facilitates change of behaviour.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing support for context analysis and for the solution of problems detected at a local level favours implementation of recommended psychosocial interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Carrying out such recommendations improves the QoL of patients with cancer who are at high risk of experiencing a decrease in their HRQoL.</p></list-item></list>

HQIS, HuCare Quality Improvement Strategy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016347f01"/></fig><p>The cluster randomised design was selected because the intervention is organisational and requires high involvement of all centre staff; therefore, randomising individual oncologists or patients would not be possible, as it would entail a high risk of contamination bias. Furthermore, the stepped-wedge design enables to overcome the logistic difficulty of simultaneously providing the intervention to all centres, and it is ethically acceptable since it ensures that all patients may receive an intervention considered to be beneficial. Finally, it offers the opportunity to measure the effect of the intervention in time (secondary objective), which is one of the gaps highlighted in the literature for psychosocial interventions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 21</xref>

Various tools validated in many languages exist in the literature for the measurement of HRQoL, but two of them are most commonly used: the EORTC QLQ-C30<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Luckett <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> report an interesting comparison between the two instruments, concerning content, scale, structure, psychometric properties, and other aspects, and constructed an algorithm which helps researchers in choosing the more adequate questionnaire according to the items of interest.

This project intends to address this gap, by examining the impact of a quality improvement strategy aimed at integrating evidence-based psychosocial care interventions into oncological practice, on patient&#x02019;s HRQoL.</p><p>The strategy was developed and tested within our previous study,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which demonstrated its feasibility in 28 Italian cancer centres. Preliminary context analysis (identification of obstacles and barriers and of actions to overcome them) and support provided by an IT were the peculiar elements of the strategy which made implementation possible. It must be pointed out that no preliminary study has been conducted to determine the HQIS&#x02019;s effect on QoL, but we refer to the findings of a Cochrane review of 30 RCTs,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> assessing the effects of psychosocial interventions to improve QoL in the first 12&#x02009;months after diagnosis. Considered interventions had to involve a &#x02018;trained helper&#x02019; providing therapeutic dialogue. The review combines research data from 1249 people who took part in clinical trials to test psychosocial interventions, and found no improvement in general QoL, although small improvements in &#x02018;illness related&#x02019; QoL were observed. Among the reasons stated by the authors for the lack of effect, along with the heterogeneity of examined interventions, is a potential floor effect. The strength of our study in this regard is the restriction of inclusion to patients with cancer who have received a diagnosis within the past 2&#x02009;months, a population at high risk of reduced QoL. This should help reduce the potential for measurement &#x02018;floor effects&#x02019;, in those who are not experiencing distress, to dilute the observe effects of the strategy. Furthermore, we opted to evaluate the effectiveness of the HQIS versus standard care in terms of improvement of the emotional and social domains of HRQoL, rather than considering overall QoL, because the emotional and social functions are mostly affected by psychosocial interventions.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</p><p>In this study, we use a robust methodology, with a cluster randomised stepped-wedge design, most appropriate for evaluating interventions that have been shown to be effective in more controlled research settings, or where there is lack of evidence of effectiveness but there is a strong belief that they will do more good than harm during routine implementation. In fact, this design offers a number of opportunities. In particular, it allows all centres to ultimately receive evidence-based interventions, to manage practical and logistical constraints of concurrent implementation in all clusters and to determine the modelling of the effect of time on effectiveness, a key aspect of implementation science which is often overlooked.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 67</xref> A downside of this design, however, is that some centres will wait a long time to receive the intervention, and this could result in reduced staff motivation, or make participation impossible because of changes in hospital management or ward staff. To counter these potential problems, it was decided to keep implementation time for each cluster to a minimum (4&#x02009;months). This may not give centres enough time to introduce change, and thus decrease the strategy&#x02019;s effect on patient outcomes. In fact, in our previous study, implementation times in each centre were tailored according to the difficulties encountered, ranging from 3 to 6&#x02009;months. Furthermore, this trial also suffers from financial and feasibility constraints, which only allowed to enrol 15 centres and form 3 clusters based on location.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
</p><p>Our feasibility study<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> mainly included centres of excellence situated in wealthy areas of Northern Italy. The extension of HuCare2 to centres located nationwide will enable to determine the strategy&#x02019;s generalisability to diverse settings, information which may be useful for the introduction of this approach to other contexts. On the other hand, however, the participation of centres exhibiting various cultural and organisational barriers may have a negative impact on the project&#x02019;s feasibility.</p><p>A possible weakness of this protocol is the use of a general tool to measure QoL, which may be unable to detect an effect. In fact, in the aforementioned Cochrane review,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> when the analysis was divided into general health-related and illness-specific QoL measures, a small but significant positive result was observed in the data utilising illness-specific measures. However, we ruled out the use of illness-specific QoL scales, because our protocol includes patients with any cancer type consecutively enrolled over a 2-week period, and employing different questionnaires would have greatly complicated the enrolment.</p><p>In conclusion, given the complexity of this trial, and based on our previous experience, we believe efficient project management, appropriate support to boost clinical staff motivation and an experienced project team will be key ingredients for success. In any case, regardless of the outcome, the findings of this trial will contribute to advance knowledge on implementation strategies aiming to integrate psychosocial interventions in cancer care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e158" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016347.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e159" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016347.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Francesca Diodati for her support with literature review and with the writing of the manuscript.
