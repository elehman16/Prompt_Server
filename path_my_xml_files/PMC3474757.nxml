Persons with STD symptoms in many countries, especially those with limited resources, often initially seek care in pharmacies. The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate an integrated network of physicians, midwives and pharmacy workers trained in STD syndromic management (The PREVEN Network) as part of a national urban community-randomized trial of sexually transmitted infection prevention in Peru.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>After a comprehensive census of physicians, midwives, and pharmacies in ten intervention and ten control cities, we introduced seminars and workshops for pharmacy workers, and continuing education for physicians and midwives in intervention cities and invited graduates to join the PREVEN Network. &#x0201c;Prevention Salespersons&#x0201d; visited pharmacies, boticas and clinicians regularly for educational support and collection of information on numbers of cases of STD syndromes seen at pharmacies and by clinicians in intervention cities. Simulated patients evaluated outcomes of training of pharmacy workers with respect to adequate STD syndrome management, recommendations for condom use and for treatment of partners. In intervention cities we trained, certified, and incorporated into the PREVEN Network the workers at 623 (80.6%) of 773 pharmacies and 701 (69.6%) of 1007 physicians and midwives in private practice. Extremely high clinician and pharmacy worker turnover, 13.4% and 44% respectively in the first year, dictated continued training of new pharmacy workers and clinicians. By the end of the intervention the Network included 792 pharmacies and 597 clinicians. Pharmacies reported more cases of STDs than did clinicians. Evaluations by simulated patients showed significant and substantial improvements in the management of STD syndromes at pharmacies in intervention cities but not in control cities.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Training pharmacy workers linked to a referral network of clinicians proved feasible and acceptable. High turn-over was challenging but over come.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by the Wellcome Trust-Burroughs Wellcome Fund Infectious Disease Initiative 059131/Z/99/Z, 078835/Z/05/Z, and 078835/Z/05/B; the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) STD Cooperative Research Center NIAID AI31448, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center Global Health Framework (A Global Health Demonstration Program in Peru PAR-05-050), the NIH Center for AIDS Research P30-AI27757 and the NIH Andean CIPRA U19 AI053218; and USAID-Peru.

In the US, pharmacies have become involved in expedited therapy, prior to or without clinical examination, for persons exposed to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In the UK, community pharmacists who have completed accredited training can provide antibiotics.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047750-Reeves1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> Access to antimicrobials via the internet is also increasing rapidly.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Mainous1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Thus public health strategies for STI control cannot ignore the role of pharmacies. One approach, motivated in part by concerns about over-use of antimicrobials and emerging antimicrobial resistance, involves enforcement of regulations proscribing antimicrobial dispensing by pharmacies without prescription. Efforts to enforce such regulation significantly decreased antimicrobial consumption in Chile,<xref rid="pone.0047750-Bavestrello1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but have been variably or inconsistently effective in other settings.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Chalker2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Another approach involved training of pharmacy workers to improve antimicrobial prescribing practices for STD syndrome management in Nepal,<xref rid="pone.0047750-Tuladhar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> Vietnam,<xref rid="pone.0047750-Chalker3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> Ecuador,<xref rid="pone.0047750-Cordova1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Peru.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>In Peru we have evaluated incremental enhancements of training programs for pharmacy workers linked to training of clinicians, designed to strengthen management of four STD syndromes: urethral discharge (UD), vaginal discharge (VD), genital ulcer disease (GUD), and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Initially, we assessed the impact of short didactic training on management of these four syndromes, using simulated patients to evaluate impact.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Next, we conducted a district-randomized trial of a more intensive training program in Lima: a series of seminars and workshops were followed by ongoing structural support from &#x0201c;prevention salespersons,&#x0201d; linked to simultaneous training of physicians. Pharmacy workers were trained to recognize and directly manage UD and VD; and to recognize and refer GUD and PID to trained and certified clinicians. Again simulated patients documented a large impact of training. <xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>To formally test the impact of such a program on the population-level prevalence of the STIs associated with these four syndromes, as part of a multicomponent urban community-randomized trial of STI prevention in Peru<xref rid="pone.0047750-Garca2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we created the PREVEN Network of physicians, midwives, and pharmacy workers, all trained in STD syndromic management, as one of four key intervention modalities. This paper describes the training program for the Network, rates of attrition from the Network over the three year intervention period, numbers of cases of STD syndromes reported by the Network over three years, and evaluation by simulated patients of STD syndrome management at pharmacies in ten intervention and ten control cities during the trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>Institutional Review Boards at the University of Washington (Seattle USA), Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH), and US-NMRCD (the US U.S. Naval Medical Research Center Detachment in Lima Peru) approved the protocol and instruments. All IRBs exempted pharmacy workers and clinicians from informed consent.</p><p>Twenty cities with populations between 50,000 and 300,000 located on the coast, the Andean region or the jungle of Peru were randomized in pairwise fashion into intervention and control arms. The ten intervention cities received a multicomponent intervention. One of the four intervention modalities involved training of clinicians and pharmacy workers in improved recognition and management of STD syndromes, including STI/HIV prevention counseling, resulting in formation of the PREVEN Network. The intervention began in July 2003 and continued through December 2006.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Training of Pharmacy Workers, Physicians and Midwives</title><p>Potential Network members were pharmacy workers, physicians, and midwives working in private practice and at public health settings. Leaders representing each group in intervention cities, including physicians, midwives, pharmacists, and pharmacy workers were recruited to help develop the strategy for improving STD syndromic management. These leaders helped form discussion panels involving representatives of regional governments, Network leaders, and other civil society members, to discuss management of STD syndromes and creating sustainable strategies for prevention and control of STIs including HIV infection in the city.</p><p>A comprehensive map-based, street-by-street census of pharmacies and boticas (drugstores not owned or managed by pharmacists, but allowed to sell all pharmaceuticals, henceforth also referred to as pharmacies), and of physicians and midwives <xref rid="pone.0047750-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047750-Hsieh2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> was conducted in each of the 20 intervention and control cities in early 2003. We updated the censuses throughout the study (updated for clinicians only in intervention cities). In the ten intervention cities, training interventions targeted all pharmacies and all private practice physicians and midwives who agreed to participate. Strategies previously developed, evaluated, reported <xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and based on well described strategies like academic detailing <xref rid="pone.0047750-Soumerai1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> included: (1) seminars and workshops for pharmacy workers; (2) use of &#x0201c;Prevention Salespersons&#x0201d; for ongoing structural support of the network; and (3) continuing education for physicians and midwifes.</p><p>Pharmacy seminars and workshops included four 90-minute training sessions with small groups of eight to ten pharmacy workers who met over lunch with two training specialists (a pharmacist and a midwife). Interactive workshops included case-oriented discussions, role-playing, and self-evaluation, with certification upon successful completion. Training emphasized recognition of STD syndromes, syndromic management guidelines, and referral of clients with GUD or PID to the PREVEN Network of certified clinicians. The final session provided training in client-centered counseling by pharmacy workers using motivational interviewing <xref rid="pone.0047750-Rollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> to promote treatment of sex partners, and future condom use for casual and commercial sex. Trainees learned to assess the client&#x02019;s actual and perceived risk, reduce barriers to risk-reduction, and support behavior change and promote partner treatment.

Pharmacy workers themselves suggested the &#x0201c;Prevention Salesperson&#x0201d; approach&#x02013;analogous to that of pharmaceutical salespersons&#x02013;as an innovation to provide ongoing peer-mediated diffusion of information.</p><p>Because of frequent pharmacy and botica worker turnover, the &#x0201c;Prevention Salesperson&#x0201d; provided continued on-site training for new pharmacy workers, with the participation of any initially trained and certified pharmacy workers who remained on site.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Continuing Education for Clinicians</title><p>Continuing education (CE) is not mandatory in Peru for physicians or any health professional. We decided to introduce a CE program for physicians and midwifes in private practice -about half of whom also worked in the public sector- based on a training curriculum which took into account the adult learning process, <xref rid="pone.0047750-Ferriter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> self-taught learning, and distance education. It consisted of: a) an initial four-hour induction workshop; followed by b) one month of individual learning guided by a self-instruction manual and access to a training support system through the PREVEN webpage, telephone calls, and visits from the local team; and c) a final consolidation workshop. Based on our prior training program which included 1,100 physicians in Lima,<xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> this training emphasized guidelines for STD syndromic management, patient counseling on condom use, and partner treatment. Following completion of training, clinicians were evaluated, certified, and invited to join in the PREVEN Network. A directory of trained and certified clinicians was posted on the website and distributed to all members of the network in the ten intervention cities. &#x0201c;Prevention Salespersons&#x0201d; also made monthly visits to the physicians and midwives of the Network, and distributed CE credit materials. Additionally, from August 2005 through March 2006, a substantial interactive Internet-based STD management course for physicians (reported separately) was carried out in the ten intervention cities.<xref rid="pone.0047750-Canchihuaman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Health Communication Campaign</title><p>Also, we developed a 2003&#x02013;05 health communication campaign targeting young adults to enable them to recognize STD symptoms, and to promote early health care-seeking for such symptoms, utilizing the PREVEN Network.

These numbers were extrapolated to four weeks to estimate numbers seen per month. Results are presented as STD cases reported by Network members.</p><p>We employed and trained simulated patients to present clinical vignettes (scripted scenarios), to evaluate certified pharmacy workers management of UD, VD, and GUD, and their recommendations for condom use and for partner treatment. For each evaluation, we randomly chose 30 pharmacies in each of the ten intervention and control cities, and compared management of the three syndromes through visits by different simulated patients for each syndrome. No simulated patient visited any pharmacy more than once. For UD, management was considered adequate if the patient was offered treatments for gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection that conformed to national guidelines (ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally plus azythromycin 1 g orally) or was referred to a PREVEN Network clinician. We allowed simulated patients to buy medications for up to $10 US when necessary to avoid the &#x0201c;artificiality&#x0201d; of the interaction between the simulated patient and the pharmacy worker and so as not to curtail recommendations from pharmacy workers for partner treatment or condom use. For abnormal VD, management was considered adequate if the patient was offered treatment with 2 g single oral dose of metronidazole or was referred to a PREVEN Network clinician. For symptoms of GUD, management was considered adequate only if the patient was referred to a PREVEN Network clinician. Evaluations by simulated patients were done at baseline and at three, six, and 18 months post-training, for each of the three syndromes, using previously described methodology. <xref rid="pone.0047750-Garcia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>We also performed sentinel surveillance of STD cases seen at pharmacies from control and intervention cities at three, nine, and 18 months post-initiation of the intervention. These results are reported separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data Management and Statistical Analysis</title><p>All information was collected in standardized formats, by local teams in each city. Data were reviewed for consistency and entered into a data base for analysis. For the simulated patient analysis we compared intervention and control cities with unconditional logistic regression by using cities as clusters using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to control for intracluster correlation.

The rate of turnover of pharmacy workers was exceptionally high. During the first year alone, 920 (44%) of the pharmacy workers left their jobs, and during the three years of the trial 1,677 (80&#x000b7;8%) of our initial trainees left, including 457 (76&#x000b7;2%) leaving a true pharmacy and 1,220 (82&#x000b7;8%) leaving boticas.

We emphasized referral of GUD and suspected PID to a clinician, because of the need for serologic testing for syphilis, and the complexity of the treatment including injection of benzathine penicillin in GUD management, and the need for physical examination and potentially for laboratory testing in women with symptoms of PID. In a recent paper, Khan <xref rid="pone.0047750-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> found poor performance of druggists, even after training, in the management of GUD and PID.</p><p>Efforts to implement similar programs may similarly require continuous training to deal with high worker and facility turn-over. Turnover of boticas was far more frequent than for pharmacies, both for closing and for opening of new boticas. Regulations for boticas are less rigorous, but they provide a very large percent of the market for dispensing pharmaceuticals in Peru, representing almost 70% of the baseline census of pharmacies and boticas and 80% at the end of the intervention. Workers in actual pharmacies themselves represented a heterogeneous population with only 60% having received formal pharmacy training. Attention at the policy level to academic and occupational professionalism seems important to reduce the turn-over of pharmacy and botica workers. The rate of turn-over of physicians and midwives was approximately half that of pharmacy workers. Follow up of all physicians and midwives lost to the Network, suggested most if not all actually left the intervention cities. Migration of health professionals within the country and especially emigration to other countries is well known but not well documented in Peru. The National Institute of Statistics and Informatics <xref rid="pone.0047750-OrganizacinInternacionalparalas1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> reports that the annual number of physicians who have traveled outside the country and not returned within 6 months increased from 420 in 2000 to 1,543 in 2007. Discussions regarding brain drain are active in Peru, <xref rid="pone.0047750-MaytaTristn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> but even mobility within the country presents a challenge for achieving training, for keeping trained people where they are needed, and especially for creating and sustaining a health network system. However, the online version of the course developed for clinicians <xref rid="pone.0047750-Canchihuaman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> is now used by the College of Professional Midwives in Peru to offer training on STIs and represents an innovative approach to continuing education.</p><p>Evaluations by simulated patients strongly supports the effectiveness of STD syndromic management training of pharmacy workers. Simulated patients were blinded to the intervention and we changed the teams for each evaluation. We cannot rule out an influence of the presence of posters and STD merchandising information on the evaluations in intervention cities, but our systematic post-evaluation interviews of simulated patients provided no evidence of such bias. Improvement in pharmacy workers performance over time is perhaps attributable to reinforcement by the visits of &#x0201c;Prevention Salespersons&#x0201d; and to more &#x0201c;practice&#x0201d; and confidence acquired by the workers.</p><p>Although the number of physicians and midwives certified (728) in 2003 exceeded the number of pharmacies certified (642), substantially more cases of UD and VD in particular were seen by pharmacies than by the clinicians in the Network. One limitation is that we do not have a way of validating the number of clients with UD, VD, GUD or PID reported seen at pharmacies.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the lessons learned from previous extensive studies with pharmacies and clinicians in Lima that guided design of this intervention modality for the multicomponent intervention trial. The baseline census of pharmacies and clinicians prior to the intervention enabled us to plan activities and define intervention targets.</p><p>We believe that the simultaneous training of pharmacy workers and clinicians and linking trained pharmacies workers to the trained physicians and midwives in a Network, not only encouraged cross-referrals including referral of genital ulcer disease and suspected PID from pharmacies to clinicians, but enhanced the acceptability of the Network to pharmacy, physicians&#x02019;, and midwives&#x02019; sectors. The creation of the &#x0201c;Prevention salesperson&#x0201d; support mechanism was also useful and could be used for other social and public health benefits. The impact of the multicomponent intervention at the population level is reported separately.</p><p>We conclude that opportunities exist to train and empower pharmacy workers, physicians, and midwives in the management of STD syndromes, creating a network that provides better quality in the management of STIs. Training was feasible, well accepted at the community level and appears effective in terms of process and outcome indicators.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Ministry of Health participating through the local health directorates, the National HIV/STI Program and the General Directorates of People&#x02019;s Health.</p><p>We also thank the hundreds of members of the PREVEN network, including pharmacy workers, midwives, physicians, trainers, and salespersons in charge of training clinicians and pharmacy workers.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0047750-World1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization (2003) <italic>Guidelines for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections</italic>, World Health Organization, Geneva.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0047750-Grigoryan1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
