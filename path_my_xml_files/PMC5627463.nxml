Each mother received two injections, one prior to skin incision and one after cord clamping, (one being the study drug Cefazolin, and the other, a placebo) based on the randomization code. Demographic, maternal and neonatal monitoring data until discharge from hospital, and at the 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum visit were collected. Levels of the prophylactic antibiotic were measured from the cord blood in every 8th neonate. The objective of the study was to compare the effects of the prophylactic antibiotic, intravenous Cefazolin 1&#x000a0;g, administered at Caesarean delivery (CD) at two different timings (before skin incision and after cord clamping) on both the mother and newborn. The secondary outcomes that were followed up were the number of maternal and neonatal readmissions.

When compared to women who deliver vaginally, those delivered by (CD) face a 5 to 20 fold increase in risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) by decreasing the burden of microorganisms at the surgical site during the operative procedure is the goal of antibiotic prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing SSI is well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Prophylactic antibiotics are expected to work in conjunction with the antiseptic measures taken before and during surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is suggested that antibiotic given 30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h before skin incision will cause adequate bactericidal concentration in the system before inoculation. Prophylactic antibiotics act mainly by destroying the bacteria and slowing production of bacterial proteases, thus preventing the attachment of bacteria to the mucosal surfaces. The greatest therapeutic effect occurs when antibiotics are administered just before or coincident when maximal bacterial contamination and tissue trauma occurs.</p><p id="Par18">At CD, in our Institution, the prophylactic antibiotic was being administered after cord clamping, so that it did not reach the foetal circulation. Concerns of masking signs of sepsis in babies, developing resistance to antibiotics and masking organisms in blood culture because of the transplacental transfer of the drug was the main reason for administration of the drug after cord clamping. However, recent studies suggested that, giving the drug prior to skin incision would significantly decrease the incidence of maternal infection without causing harm to the baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Administration of IV antibiotics prior to skin incision definitely showed a decrease of 9% in the rate of maternal infections with no increase in the rate of neonatal sepsis, duration of hospital stay for the infant or any complications secondary to the administration of antibiotic to the mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].The objectives of the study were:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">To compare the effects of the prophylactic antibiotic, intravenous Cefazolin1gm, administered at Caesarean delivery (CD) at two different timings(30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h) before skin incision and immediately after cord clamping) on both the mother and newborn.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">To quantify the amount of antibiotic that has crossed the placental barrier in to the cord blood.</p></list-item></list>

Babies with known major congenital anomalies were not included as well. Women undergoing CD were randomized to receive both single dose of IV Cefazolin 1&#x000a0;g and placebo. As per the randomization, every mother was given IV Cefazolin1gm either 30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h, prior to skin incision, with placebo administered within a minute after cord clamping or placebo administered 30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h prior to skin incision and Cefazolin 1&#x000a0;g IV, within a minute after cord clamping. The randomization covers with the blinded drugs were opened in the Operation Theatre (OT).The medications were administered by the Anaesthetist appropriately as per the randomisation. Cord blood was collected in every 8th neonate to estimate the amount of antibiotic levels in the neonate.

The drug level (Cefazolin) was analysed by a developed and validated High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Ultra violet protection method in the clinical pharmacological unit. Thus, the investigator, the patient and the Labour Room personnel were blinded to the drug used. After CD, all the outcomes listed below were assessed until discharge from hospital and at the first postpartum visit at 6&#x000a0;weeks and noted. In addition, basic demographic and obstetric data were noted as well. The primary maternal outcomes assessed were the presence of SSI, endometritis, UTI and length of hospital stay. The primary outcomes assessed for the neonate were incidence of early and late onset sepsis, oral thrush, increased frequency of stools, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and length of hospital stay.

The total number of UTI&#x02019;s was 16 (2.9%) in the Pre-incision group and 21 (3.9%) in the Post incision group which was not significant. Hospital stay of more than 7&#x000a0;days which indirectly revealed that delay was probably due to some infectious morbidity was 11 (2%) in the Pre-incision versus 28 (5.2%) in the Post-incision group. The post-incision group compared to the pre-incision group had significant more mothers with a length of stay &#x0003e;7 compared to having a length of stay of 4-7&#x000a0;days (RR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.55, 95% CI: 0.33 &#x02013; 0.91, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005).

There were no neonates with oral thrush or NEC in either group. Admissions of the neonates to the NICU were for various reasons, for example, low APGAR at birth, transient tachypnea of newborn, hypoglycaemia, meconium aspiration and dysmorphism. The numbers of admissions to NICU were more from the Pre-incision group, 23 (4.2%) as compared to the Post-incision group 17 (3.1%), but this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42). Most of the neonates 528 (95.7%) and 508 (93.6%) stayed in hospital 4 to 7&#x000a0;days in the Pre-incision and Post-incision groups respectively. Blood culture was found positive in 58 (10.5%) in the Pre-incision and 66 (12.2%) in the Post-incision group which was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.39).

There were no neonatal deaths due to sepsis at the postpartum visit.</p><p id="Par49">The cord blood level of Cefazolin in 19 of Group 1 (Pre-incision) babies had &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;mg/dl. Forty three babies had cord blood level of Cefazolin between 1 and 10&#x000a0;mg/dl, 60 babies had levels between 10 and 20&#x000a0;mg/dl, and 17 babies had levels between 20 and 30&#x000a0;mg/dl. The maternal blood levels however were not checked.</p><p id="Par50">The toxic level of the drug in the blood is not known. However the study showed that on an average, only 2-3% of the drug administered to the mother reached the baby.
