The protocol included pretreatment with transdermal AndroGel(r) (Besins) 25

(IVF) is still one of the most important challenges in reproductive medicine.
Several adjuvant treatments have been proposed to determine the factors interfering
with follicular output ratios and increased ovarian response to gonadotropins, but
consensus has not been reached around a strategy to treat poor responders undergoing
IVF (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Genro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).
Despite the limited data supporting the isolated use of adjuvants such as DHEA, rLH,
hCG or letrozole, transdermal testosterone has apparently improved the outcomes of
IVF cycles in poor responders (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Bosdou <italic>et
al</italic>., 2012</xref>). The association between increased live birth and
pregnancy rates and use of transdermal testosterone has been described in patients
with low ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). The authors of
these studies also found that lower FSH doses were needed to attain ovarian
stimulation (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Comadran <italic>et
al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Jeve &#x00026;
Bhandari, 2016</xref>). </p><p>The potential mechanisms through which DHEA and testosterone produce increased
pregnancy rates are still unclear. Androgens play a key role in steroidogenesis,
acting as a substrate in the conversion of androgens into estrogens through
aromatization (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Ryan <italic>et al</italic>.,
1968</xref>). Previous studies in nonhumans described greater numbers of primary
and preantral follicles and increased androgen receptor expression (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Vendola <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Hillier <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Hild-Petito <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>).
Increased ovarian levels of FSH receptors have also been associated to testosterone
administration in animal models (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Weil <italic>et
al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Studies in humans have been limited to small,
uncontrolled RCTs with preliminary data, and there is no consensus in the literature
about the clinical use of transdermal testosterone in poor responders undergoing IVF
(<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Balasch <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>;
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">F&#x000e1;bregues <italic>et al</italic>.,
2009</xref>). Different protocols, testosterone doses and pretreatment lengths
have been proposed, but there still is no consensus over the best pretreatment
scheme.</p><p>The following rationale was used in the ANDRO-IVF protocol: Testosterone is a steroid
hormone thought to increase ovarian response by positively affecting follicular
feedback to gonadotropin stimulation, leading to greater oocyte yield and,
therefore, increased conception rates (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Nagels
<italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). According to the two-cell
two-gonadotropin theory, androgens are essential for the maintenance of adequate
follicular steroidogenesis in humans. Increased levels of androgens in the
follicular intracellular environment are thought to stimulate the recruitment of
preantral and antral follicles and thus increase folliculogenesis and ovarian
response to COS.</p><p>Intrafollicular androgenization may also be performed with the co-administration of
letrozole, as described by Garcia-Velasco. This author described significantly
higher levels of testosterone and androstenedione in the follicular fluid of
letrozole-treated patients than in untreated poor responders (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Velasco <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). In 2012, the same
authors described the impact of testosterone and hCG in the positive modulation of
FSH receptor expression in human granulosa cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Velasco <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).
This study aimed to propose and assess a new protocol to improve the ovarian
response of poor responders based on three modes of intra-ovarian androgenization
(letrozole, transdermal testosterone and hCG).</p><p>The primary endpoints were number of oocytes and mature oocytes retrieved from
ANDRO-IVF cycles. The secondary endpoints were the cancellation, fertilization, and
cumulative pregnancy rates obtained with the protocol. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective crossover study included patients seen between January and October
of 2016 at the IVF Center of the P&#x000e9;rola Byington Hospital in S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, Brazil. All poor responders submitted to ovarian stimulation were recruited
and invited to join the study. </p><p>The Bologna criteria for poor ovarian response (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Ferraretti <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011</xref>) were used as inclusion
criteria. At least two of the following features had to be present:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Patients submitted to COS for IVF with &#x0003c;3 oocytes collected or whose
COS was cancelled due to lack of response from conventional COS for
IVF;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Patients with low ovarian reserve: Antral follicle count &#x0003c;5-7 and/or
antimullerian hormone &#x0003c;1.2;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Female patients aged &#x0003e;40 years.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The patients enrolled in the study had had IVF cycles with three of fewer oocytes
retrieved and antral follicle counts of six or fewer. </p><p>Patients with M&#x000fc;llerian duct anomalies and history of pelvic surgery were
excluded.</p><p>The individuals included in the study were submitted to a novel protocol called
ANDRO-IVF. Their results from the standard protocol were compared to the outcomes
produced with the ANDRO-IVF Protocol.</p><p>A) Standard Protocol was performed with gonadotropins (FSH+LH) 300 IU up to day 2 or
3; a GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg was administered after a follicle reached the size of
14 mm; and ovulation was triggered with hCG 5000 IU when at least one follicle
reached the size of 18-20 mm.</p><p>B) The ANDRO-IVF protocol included two treatment phases, as described below:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Phase 1: ovarian preparation (previous cycle).</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Phase 2: ovarian stimulation (IVF cycle).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The phase of ovarian preparation included intra-ovarian androgenization and cycle
control. Androgenization was performed with the application of transdermal
testosterone gel AndroGel(r) (Besins Healthcare, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) 25 mg
every other day, starting on the first day of the menstrual cycle. Letrozole 2.5 mg
was administered orally on a daily basis, and patients were given hCG 2500 IU
subcutaneously twice a week. Cycle control was performed with the administration of
estradiol valerate 8 mg daily from Day 3 to Day 14 of the menstrual cycle, followed
by estradiol valerate 4 mg daily up to Day 15. Micronized progesterone 400mg was
given from Day 15 to Day 24 and suspended to promote a new menstrual cycle, in which
stimulation occurred.</p><p>Ovarian stimulation was performed with recombinant or urinary follicle-stimulating
hormone 450 UI FSH/LH. A GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix acetate or ganirelix acetate
0.25 mg/day) was given up to Day 6 of stimulation or when at least one follicle
reached a diameter &#x0003e;14 mm. </p><p>Ovulation was triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin hCG 5000 IU after at least
one follicle had a diameter &#x0003e;18-20mm diameter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fourteen poor-responders were initially included in the study. One of the patients

cells and the growth of larger follicles in the ovaries of nonhuman primates (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Vendola <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). The
authors showed that androgens increased the number of primary, small and
medium-sized antral follicles in the ovaries of rhesus monkeys. They also observed
that androgens increased IGF-I expression in primordial follicle oocytes. Increased
androgen receptor expression has been observed in the granulosa cells of growing
follicles, mainly in pre antral and early antral follicles (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Hillier <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Hild-Petito <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>). The authors also
found that androgen-treated monkeys had increased growth of secondary and small
antral follicles, and increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of granulosa
cells. </p><p>Several clinical trials investigated the role of androgen administration to improve
ovarian response in poor responders undergoing IVF. Although some studies did not
support androgen supplementation to improve live birth rates (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Sunkara <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), a recent meta-analysis
showed increased clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in poor responders given
transdermal testosterone (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Bosdou <italic>et
al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). Another Cochrane meta-analysis included 17
randomized clinical trials and 1496 patients, mostly poor responders undergoing
standard IVF. The authors found that pretreatment with testosterone correlated with
higher live birth rates when compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.60, 95% CI
1.30 to 5.20). Women with an eight percent chance of achieving a live birth if
treated with placebo or not offered treatment saw their chances rise to 10-32%
(<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Nagels <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).
Clinical studies also revealed that 25% of clinics worldwide have adopted
co-treatment with androgens for this group of patients (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Fouany &#x00026; Sharara, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent experimental studies looking into the intracellular environment have assessed
the paracrine regulation of steroidogenesis in theca cells by co-culturing theca and
granulosa cells, and the results indicated increased steroidogenesis in theca cells.
These models might answer questions involving the hormone interactions affecting
ovarian stimulation protocols (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et
al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p>A prospective case-control study from a respected IVF center compared the
intrafollicular and serum concentrations of LH, estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>),
progesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione of patients showing poor response to
treatment and egg donors with normal response (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">de los
Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). They observed that LH and androgen
secretion in preovulatory follicles was similar in both groups, suggesting that the
problem was related to poor response to COS in spite of normal levels of follicular
hormones. They suggested that long-interval androgen pretreatment might potentially
increase the recruitment of small pre antral and antral follicles rather than
increasing the intrafollicular androgen levels in IVF cycles.</p><p>Our findings were similar to the reports of a prospective therapeutic self-controlled
clinical trial that included 25 patients whose first and second IVF cycles were
cancelled due to poor follicular response despite normal baseline FSH levels (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Balasch <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The
authors described a greater than fivefold increase in the number of recruited
follicles in 80% of the patients, a mean of 5.8&#x000b1;0.4 oocytes produced, a
cancellation rate of 20%, and a clinical pregnancy rate of 30% per oocyte retrieval.
They concluded that pretreatment with transdermal testosterone might be useful for
poor responders with normal baseline FSH levels.</p><p>A previous RCT enrolled 62 poor responders with cancelled cycles in the first attempt
at IFV and randomized them in two groups, one given pretreatment with transdermal
testosterone and the other treated with high-dose gonadotropins in a mini-dose GnRH
agonist protocol. The proportion of poor response cycles was significantly lower in
the testosterone group (32.2%) than in the high-dose gonadotropin group (71%, IC 95%
15.7 - 61.6; <italic>p</italic>=0.05). The findings suggested that transdermal
testosterone pretreatment might improve the ovarian sensitivity to FSH and the
follicular response to gonadotropins of poor responders (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">F&#x000e1;bregues <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009</xref>). </p><p>Another recent study described the advantages of administering transdermal
testosterone 12.5 mg for 21 days before IVF. Testosterone pretreatment was
associated to lower total doses of r-FSH and shorter length of COS. The number of
oocytes, mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes, and good-quality embryos retrieved and
clinical pregnancy rates were also significantly higher in the pretreatment group
(<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, another RCT did not find beneficial effects connected with administering
10 mg of testosterone daily before IVF (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">Massin
<italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). The divergence between the studies
may have been caused by the differences in testosterone doses, administration
regimes or inclusion criteria, and the fact that the latter enrolled not only women
meeting the Bologna criteria, but also female patients with possibly suboptimal
response to COS.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis initially including 10 papers had to cut the number of papers
down to three because of the large heterogeneity between the studies and androgen
administration protocols. The authors concluded that pretreatment with transdermal
testosterone prior to IVF might improve the clinical outcomes of poor responders,
but indicated that the results be analyzed with caution due to the lack of larger
and more robust RCTs.</p><p>Our protocol fosters intra-ovarian androgenization using different mechanisms: first,
androgen serum levels are increased with the administration of transdermal
testosterone gel every other day; then, intrafollicular androgen levels are
increased with the administration of hCG twice a week; and finally, androgen
aromatization to estrogen is prevented with the daily administration of an aromatase
inhibitor, letrozole. Letrozole increases the intra-ovarian concentration of
androgens by inhibiting aromatase activity (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Velasco <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Oral estradiol and
vaginal progesterone were administered to control the menstrual cycle. The pregnancy
rates achieved in our study were similar to the rates published in previous studies.
Considering that pregnancy rates among poor responders is close to or lower than
10%, our results suggested that this novel protocol might be a valid alternative to
treat poor responders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our protocol seemed to improve clinical outcomes in poor responders in parameters
