In older adults, 21&#x02013;33% of prescribed psychotropic medication is relatively contraindicated,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20 b21 b22">20&#x02013;22</xref> and 29% in doses that exceed those recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Moreover, 20% of older adults use more than one psychotropic drug concurrently, and 69% have more than one physician prescribing treatment, increasing the risk of undetected cumulative toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref></p><p>Computerized prescribing and decision support are expected to address preventable medication errors, as these digital technologies can guide dosing and provide alerts on drug treatment duplication, contraindications, and drug interaction errors, especially when integrated with information on all dispensed medication. However, the majority of drug alerts are over-ridden, particularly for psychotropic medication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24 b25 b26 b27">24&#x02013;27</xref> in both hospital-based and community-based studies. Even when drug alert systems are customized to present only clinically important interactions, physicians over-ride the majority of alerts, because they are deemed not clinically relevant and/or the benefit is believed to exceed the risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24 b25 b26">24&#x02013;26</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>

The provincial insurance agency (RAMQ) provides health insurance for all provincial residents, and pays all physicians and community pharmacies on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiary, medical billing and pharmacy claims data can be used to create longitudinal health histories for each patient. These data have been validated and are often used for health services and epidemiological research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31 b32 b33 b34">31&#x02013;34</xref> In 2003, MOXXI, an experimental community-based clinical information system, was the first to link to these databases and integrate this information into electronic health record systems to support clinical decision-making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Design and study population</title><p>A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that prescribing decision support that provided patient-specific risk assessment would reduce the risk of injury in older adults. The trial was conducted in a population of 81 family physicians and 5628 of their older patients from September 2008 to July 2010. This sample size was expected to detect a difference in risk of 5% assuming 80 physician clusters, 50 patients per physician, a cluster correlation of 0.01, and a Type I and II error of 5% and 20%, respectively. Injury risk reduction was assessed at the end of the follow-up period (July 2010).</p><p>Potentially eligible physicians were identified from the roster of active primary care physicians in the Quebec provincial regulatory authority and invited to participate in the MOXXI primary care research network to evaluate the use of computerized drug and chronic disease management systems in primary care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14 b15 b16">14&#x02013;16</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> To be enrolled in the network, physicians needed to practice actively in an urban community setting in Montreal or Quebec City, and use the computerized drug management system successfully to write a minimum of 10 patient prescriptions per week.</p><p>Patients were eligible if they were age 65&#x02005;years or older, had an active dispensed prescription for a psychotropic drug, or were prescribed a new psychotropic drug at a visit during the follow-up period. Psychotropic drugs included those with central nervous system side effects that increased the risk of injury: benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, and opiates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>To optimize balance in the intervention and control group, we stratified physicians by the number of patients in their practice who were prescribed psychotropic medication in the past year, with a minimum of two physicians per stratum. Within each stratum, an equivalent number of physicians were randomized by the biostatistician to intervention and control groups using a random number table. Physicians were not blinded to the intervention status, but were blinded to the specific study outcomes that were measured. Unless advised by their physicians, patients were blinded to the intervention status.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention and control group</title><p>Both the intervention and control groups used the MOXXI community-based clinical information system (CIS). A link to the provincial insurance agency (RAMQ) was used to pre-populate demographic information for the practice population based on a study physician's billings from the previous year. For patients who consented to participate in the research network, all medical services and prescription drugs provided for the past year were loaded into the MOXXI CIS, and thereafter all new records of medical services and prescriptions were refreshed on a daily basis. These data were used to update the profile of dispensed medications, dates and reasons for emergency department visits and hospitalizations, medical and surgical procedures, and health problems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> A commercial drug alert system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vigilance.ca">http://www.vigilance.ca</ext-link>) automatically reviewed each new prescription for potential contraindications, including therapy duplication, dosing error, cumulative toxicity, and drug&#x02013;disease, drug&#x02013;drug, and drug&#x02013;allergy interactions. Physicians could set the threshold for the alert system to one of three levels (1, severe alerts only; 2, moderate and severe alerts; 3, all alerts), which restricted alerts generated automatically during the prescribing process. By default, the system was set to level 2. However, all alerts generated for a patient were available for the physician to review in a drug alert summary in the patient's electronic chart. Physicians randomized to the control and intervention groups had access to these standard features of the MOXXI CIS.</p><p>Physicians randomized to the intervention group received a patient-specific risk of injury alert when a patient was prescribed a psychotropic medication that increased the risk of injury. The personalized alert used a published predictive model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> to estimate the risk of injury based on the patient's age, sex, injury history, presence of cognitive impairment, gait, and balance problems, and doses of selected psychotropic medication (selective serotonin / nor-epinephrine reuptake inhibitors antidepressants, antipsychotics, low-, intermediate- and high-potency opiates, intermediate- and long-acting benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and first-generation antihistamines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). We set a relatively low threshold for showing the alert&#x02014;an increase in risk of 1 per 1000&#x02014;to enable us to assess the likelihood of changes in drug treatment as a function of the magnitude of patient risk.</p><p>Graphics, in the form of risk thermometers, were created to show physicians the patient's risk of injury in the next 12&#x02005;months related to psychotropic medication as well as non-modifiable characteristics (eg, age, sex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1A</xref>). Physicians would see the risk thermometer, annotated with numeric values generated by the risk calculation described above, when they opened the patient drug profile or when they prescribed a psychotropic drug. Drugs that contributed to the risk calculation were highlighted in the patient's drug profile. If the physician attempted to reduce the risk of injury by stopping or decreasing the dose of a psychotropic medication, the absolute and relative reduction in risk would be shown as an adjustment in the level of the thermometer and a change in the numeric values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1B</xref>). If a new psychotropic drug was started or the dose was increased, the absolute and relative increase in the risk would be shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1C</xref>). If no change in medication was instituted (or the risk was increased by a medication change), physicians had to select a reason for the decision from a standardized pick-list (eg, prescribed by another physician). A reference section was available with publications on the risk of injury related to psychotropic drug use and methods of tapering benzodiazepines.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) Screenshot of the user interface for the &#x02018;risk of injury alert&#x02019; showing current risk and lowest possible risk.

Residential address was linked to neighborhood-level Statistics Canada census information to obtain estimates of patient household income, classified by low- (&#x0003c;$31&#x02008;753), middle- ($31&#x02008;754&#x02013;$80&#x02008;000) and high- (&#x0003e;$80&#x02008;000) income neighborhoods. Relevant comorbidity was measured using diagnostic and procedure codes in RAMQ billing claims and the electronic health record problem list for each patient.

Gait and balance problems included degenerative diseases of the extrapyramidal system (332&#x02008;333), seizure disorders (345), vertiginous syndromes (386), syncope (780), and orthostatic hypotension (458).

To assess whether the effect of the intervention was greater for patients at higher risk, each patient's risk of injury was measured twice, once at the patient's first visit after randomization (baseline risk) and again on the last day of follow-up (July 15, 2010) for the intervention and control groups (outcome risk). Overall injury risk was measured using the predictive model used in the intervention, which reflected the probability of an injury in the next year based on age, sex, comorbidity, and daily dispensed doses of benzodiazepines, opiates, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antihistamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref>). Drug doses were based on active dispensed prescriptions on the first and last day of follow-up. To permit multiple drugs within the same therapeutic category to be combined, doses were standardized, using the same approach as the predictive model, by dividing the daily dose by the WHO-recommended daily dose for adults for each drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> For example, a patient prescribed 20&#x02005;mg diazepam and 10&#x02005;mg lorazepam daily would be using three standardized doses of benzodiazepine (20&#x02005;mg diazepam/10&#x02005;mg (WHO-recommended dose) + 10&#x02005;mg lorazepam/10&#x02005;mg (WHO-recommended dose) = three doses).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Formula for estimating the risk of injury based on individual patient characteristics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> NB Baseline risk was specified at 2.06%, representing the incidence of injury among 65-year-old men without any other risk factors.

Alert response was retrieved from the MOXXI audit trail for physicians in the intervention group. The audit trail recorded each action taken in relationship to psychotropic medication and its impact on overall and modifiable risk. Actions were classified into three mutually exclusive categories: (1) over-rode alert, (2) reviewed options but made no change, and (3) modified dose or drug to reduce risk. Reasons for over-riding alerts were tabulated.</p><p>To assess change in use and dose of medication, we estimated differences between the intervention and control groups in (1) the number of active psychotropic medications prescribed or dispensed, and (2) the standardized dose of psychotropic medication by therapeutic category between the baseline and follow-up period. Data were retrieved from records of all medications dispensed from the daily updates of the drug profile by the RAMQ.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>To test the hypothesis that the patients in the intervention group would have a greater reduction in the risk of injury than patients in the control group, we used multivariate linear regression within a generalized estimating equation framework. An exchangeable correlation structure was used to account for clustering of patients within physician. Each patient's calculated risk of injury on the last day of follow-up was the continuous outcome, and experimental status (intervention vs control) was the predictor. The patient's baseline risk score was used to test the hypothesis that the benefits of the intervention would be greater for high-risk patients. The interaction term between baseline risk score and experimental status was included in the model, and the Wald &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> stxatistic was used to assess statistical significance. We used the same approach to estimate the change in the number of psychotropic medications and dose by therapeutic category between the baseline and follow-up period. For medication dose, we estimated one model per therapeutic category.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 410 physicians eligible, 81 consented to participate, representing 5628 eligible patients.

The provision of patient-specific risk information resulted in a therapy review in over 80% of patients and significant reductions in the risk of injury related to psychoactive medication, particularly for those who were at greatest risk of fall-related injuries.</p><p>This study produced a greater response to alerts than previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24 b25 b26 b27">24&#x02013;27</xref> even those that used highly selected subsets of clinically relevant alerts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> Not only did physicians review consequences of revising treatment for the vast majority of patients, they also modified drug therapy in one-quarter of instances.</p><p>Of interest, the most common reason for not changing therapy was that physicians perceived the benefit of treatment to be greater than the risk. This reason was particularly common when the patient was starting new medication, possibly because a physician who starts a patient on medication will generally have decided that the benefit exceeds the risk before prescribing, even if the precise risk and benefit are not known. In contrast, prescription renewals for prevalent users were more likely to be modified, possibly because the effects of treatment (or lack thereof) can be more precisely evaluated, and thus more precise risk information can be factored into renewal decisions. It may also be because the evidence supporting the benefits of treatment is less compelling to start with, particularly in some therapeutic categories. The most significant reductions in therapy in this study were for antipsychotics and anticonvulsants, therapeutic categories that have been reported to have both high levels of off-label use and weak to non-existent evidence of benefit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> Indeed, 22% of anticonvulsant prescriptions were for gabapentin, and all of these prescriptions were for off-label use for pain.</p><p>A ubiquitous complaint about drug alerts is that there are too many &#x02018;nuisance alerts&#x02019;, ie, alerts for problems of little clinical significance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> This study is the first to identify a data-driven approach to identifying clinically meaningful alerts and quantifying the risk associated with an alert. Typically, &#x02018;expert opinion&#x02019; is used to classify alerts as mild, moderate, and severe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> This method of classification has already been shown to lack reproducible results so that different commercial systems will generate different subsets of alerts within these categories.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> Empirically estimating the probability of adverse effects in different subpopulations provides a more meaningful clinical metric that could be used to establish alert thresholds. In this study, physicians were more likely to alter treatment when the overall risk of injury was high, and, conversely, physicians were less likely to respond when the risk was low. To study this effect, the threshold to generate an alert was set at a low level of risk: an increased risk of 1 per 1000 (0.1%). We identified the threshold at which physicians were more likely to respond to an alert at an overall risk of 32 per 1000 (3 per 100). In the future, empirical estimates of the risk of adverse outcomes could be used to establish an alert threshold. Many national agencies are establishing methods of conducting robust pharmacosurveillance. Part of the mandate of post-market surveillance could be to assess the risk associated with both new drugs and drug interactions, thereby providing the data needed to establish and calibrate a new generation of smarter drug alert systems.</p><p>An important limitation of drug alerts, including this new generation of drug alert systems, is that information is presented only on the risk of treatment and not on the potential benefits. In the future, efforts should be made to generate empirical information on both the risks and benefits of treatment, ideally deriving this information from both clinical trials and post-market surveillance systems. In addition to providing clinicians and patients with relative risk and benefit information, ideally individualized to a patient's risk profile, alternate treatment options that have lower risk with equivalent benefit for the same treatment indication could be provided. Future research should be directed to methods of generating empirical estimates of comparative risk and benefit that can be incorporated into advanced systems of drug decision support, cognitive decision-making studies that will enable the best methods of presenting this information to physicians and patients to be identified, methods of establishing the threshold for generating drug alerts, and the potential benefits of displaying alternate therapy options by treatment indication.</p><p>In summary, this study shows that individual risk estimates displayed graphically and numerically are a more effective method of eliciting response to drug alerts and reducing the risk of medication-related injury in higher risk seniors. Future research should estimate the reduction in injury rate related to this new generation of alerts and determine whether similar effects can be achieved in other therapy classes for other important outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold>
