have predominantly used word or sentence generation tasks. Here we sought to
further assess the sensitivity of fTCD to language lateralisation by using a
metalinguistic task which does not involve novel speech generation: rhyme
judgement in response to written words. Line array judgement was included as a
non-linguistic visuospatial task to examine the relative strength of left and
right hemisphere lateralisation within the same individuals when output
requirements of the tasks are matched. These externally paced tasks allowed us
to manipulate the number of stimuli presented to participants and thus assess
the influence of pace on the strength of lateralisation.</p><p id="P2">In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref>, 28 right-handed
adults participated in rhyme and line array judgement tasks and showed reliable
left and right lateralisation at the group level for each task, respectively. In
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Experiment 2</xref> we increased the pace of
the tasks, presenting more stimuli per trial. We measured laterality indices
(LIs) from 18 participants who performed both linguistic and non-linguistic
judgement tasks during the original &#x02018;slow&#x02019; presentation rate (5
judgements per trial) and a fast presentation rate (10 judgements per trial).
The increase in pace led to increased strength of lateralisation in both the
rhyme and line conditions.</p><p id="P3">Our results demonstrate for the first time that fTCD is sensitive to the
left lateralised processes involved in metalinguistic judgements. Our data also
suggest that changes in the strength of language lateralisation, as measured by
fTCD, are not driven by articulatory demands alone. The current results suggest
that at least one aspect of task difficulty, the pace of stimulus presentation,
influences the strength of lateralisation during both linguistic and
non-linguistic tasks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fTCD</kwd><kwd>Hemispheric lateralisation</kwd><kwd>Language</kwd><kwd>Rhyme judgement</kwd><kwd>Task difficulty</kwd><kwd>Visuospatial</kwd><kwd>Line judgement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) uses ultra-sound to measure
changes in the speed of blood flow through the left and right middle cerebral
arteries (MCAs) during the performance of sensory and cognitive tasks (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Aaslid et al., 1982</xref>). Studies using this
technique have reported a comparable extent of left hemisphere dominance during
language tasks as fMRI (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Deppe et al., 2000</xref>;
<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Somers et al., 2011</xref>) and the gold
standard test of language lateralisation, the Wada procedure (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Knake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Knecht et
al., 1998</xref>). Concordance between fTCD and fMRI is also reported for right
hemisphere dominance during spatial attention tasks (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2004</xref>). These studies provide good validation of the use
of fTCD to measure hemispheric dominance of cognitive function, despite differences
in the physiological markers measured by different neuroimaging modalities.</p><p id="P5">fTCD offers a relatively cheap, easy and non-invasive way to assess
hemispheric dominance during cognitive tasks. Recently, it has been used to
investigate the development of language lateralisation in young children and special
populations (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chilosi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Groen et al., 2012</xref>). To date, the primary
experimental task used has been word generation (e.g. verbal fluency as in <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Deppe et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Knecht et al. (1998)</xref>) or with children, sentence generation in
the form of picture or video description (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Lohmann et
al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et all., 2009</xref>;
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Groen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chilosi et
al., 2014</xref>). These studies converge with findings from other neuroimaging
modalities indicating a robust and pervasive leftward asymmetry in functional
responses during expressive language production. In order to maximise the
contribution of fTCD to the field, and to further our understanding of developmental
changes in language lateralisation it would be beneficial to take a multidimensional
approach to language (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bishop, 2013</xref>) by
examining language lateralisation across a range of different language skills and
not only during generation of novel material.</p><p id="P6">During free generation tasks such as verbal fluency, participants are
required to think of or articulate as many words as possible, leading to
considerable inter- and intra-individual variability in the amount of subvocally
generated or overtly articulated words. We speculate that this variability
contributes to individual differences in the degree of lateralisation that is
measured. Results from our recent study suggest this may be the case (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2015</xref>). Strength of
lateralisation was positively correlated with the number of words produced,
suggesting a relationship between the signal measured using fTCD and the premotor
requirements of the task.</p><p id="P7">Our primary question in the current study was whether language lateralisation
could be robustly measured using fTCD during a metalinguistic judgement task, which
permits a level of control of the amount of articulatory planning required. To
achieve this we used a written word rhyme judgement task, which does not require
mental generation of novel items, but, we reasoned, still sufficiently engages
articulatory planning processes. During rhyme judgement of orthographically
dissimilar word pairs, participants must sub-vocally rehearse items in order to
correctly complete the task. The choice of a rhyme judgement task was also motivated
by fMRI studies reporting peaks in activation during rhyme judgement in left
posterior mid and inferior prefrontal gyri (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Booth et
al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kareken et al., 2000</xref>;
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lurito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Paulesu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). These are regions perfused by the middle
cerebral artery (MCA), from which measurements are made using fTCD.</p><p id="P8">A second aim of the study was to examine how &#x02018;linguistic&#x02019; and
&#x02018;non-linguistic&#x02019; tasks affect the fTCD signal within participants.
Previous studies have also examined this, with the aim of testing the nature of the
relationship between hemispheric specialisation across cognitive domains. It is
interesting that these studies used the standard word generation task as the
&#x02018;linguistic&#x02019; task and either a visual memory (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Lust et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Whitehouse
and Bishop, 2009</xref>), spatial orientation (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Dorst et al., 2008</xref>) or a line bisection task (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000f6;el et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Badzakova-Trajkov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Rosch et
al., 2012</xref>) as the &#x02018;non-linguistic&#x02019; task. Whilst this
approach has made important contributions to the field, it presupposes that the
tasks being used are equally representative exemplars of a whole cognitive domain
i.e. verbal or visuo-spatial (here we use linguistic and non-linguistic for
consistency). An alternative view is that these linguistic and non-linguistic tasks
have very different processing and output demands. For example, differences in the
format of visual stimuli (e.g., videos versus single letters) may influence blood
flow to a greater extent than the domain being tested (linguistic or
non-linguistic).</p><p id="P9">Here, we examine the variability of hemispheric lateralisation for linguistic
and non-linguistic processing, using paced judgement tasks which were well matched
in terms of task demands: rhyme judgement in response to written word pairs and line
similarity judgement in response to visual line arrays. Again, the choice of
non-linguistic task was informed by the fMRI literature. <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kareken et al. (2000)</xref> asked participants to make same/different
judgements to line arrays in addition to rhyme judgements to orthographically
dissimilar rhyme pairs. They reported greater left than right hemisphere activation
for the rhyme task. In the line judgement task, they reported strongly right
lateralized activation over a large proportion of the posterior parietal lobe, and a
distinct area in the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, an area supplied by the
MCA.</p><p id="P10">One benefit of using externally paced judgement tasks is that it allows the
direct manipulation of task demands via the number of stimuli presented. The final
aim of the study was to characterise the influence of task demands on language
lateralisation. Though &#x02018;task demands&#x02019; can refer to a variety of
different factors, in the current study we address one specific element, that of
pace, by increasing the number of judgements to be made during the active period. We
predict that increasing the pace of judgements required will lead to increased
strength of lateralisation. During the rhyme judgement task, two factors are
hypothesised to drive this increase &#x00213; the greater number of words to
subvocally articulate (placing higher demands on premotor processes) and the
increased cognitive effort of completing the task at a faster pace.</p><p id="P11">Previous studies that have examined the relationship between the number of
words articulated and strength of LI have typically reported low or non-significant
correlations (e.g. <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Knecht et al., 2000</xref>).
However, in these studies the amount produced has been inferred from the overt
report period following covert generation. In contrast, we have shown that the
amount of material generated and strength of LI do correlate positively when
concurrent measures are taken during an overt word generation task (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Studies that have manipulated cognitive effort have done so via the
familiarity of the stimulus, with no control over the output. For example,
Dr&#x000e4;ger and colleagues conducted covert word retrieval tasks with fMRI (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Dr&#x000e4;ger et al., 2004</xref>) and fTCD (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Dr&#x000e4;ger and Knecht, 2002</xref>). Difficulty was
manipulated by presenting word stems of high and low frequency and instructing
participants to covertly retrieve legal words using the target stems. There were no
differences in the strength of lateralisation between high and low frequency
stimuli, either in the fMRI or fTCD data. Using a similar approach, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al. (2011)</xref> manipulated task
difficulty using letters of greater or lesser frequency in a covert word generation
task. They reported no differences in lateralisation between difficulty levels. Here
task difficulty was categorised into low, medium, and high productivity letters,
based on the average number of reported words after the active period. As suggested
above, however, this method is a somewhat indirect measure of amount produced during
the covert period, and therefore also of difficulty.</p><p id="P13">Here we predict that an increase in the rate of presentation will lead to an
increase in the strength of left lateralisation during the rhyme judgement task, due
to the combined factors of a greater number of words to subvocally rehearse and
increased task difficulty. By testing the effect of pace on a non-linguistic task,
we go some way to tease apart these factors. A finding of stronger lateralisation in
fast paced conditions for both rhyme and line tasks implies task difficulty
associated with increased pace, rather than articulatory planning demands being the
sole driver of the strength of lateralisation.</p><p id="P14">In summary, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref> we tested
whether left and right lateralisation can be established using fTCD during rhyme and
line array judgement tasks which were well matched in their demands. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Experiment 2</xref> we sought to determine the effect
of pace on lateralisation for linguistic and non-linguistic tasks, by manipulating
the number of stimuli presented during a trial.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Experiment 1</title><sec sec-type="methods" id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P15">A total of 38 right-handed participants were recruited for <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref>.

were all right handed as assessed by an abridged version of the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield,
1971</xref>). To screen for reading difficulties which are associated with
impaired metalinguistic abilities (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Wimmer et
al., 1994</xref>), reading comprehension was assessed using the Kirklees
Reading Assessment (Vernon-Warden revised; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Hedderly, 1993</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Data from several participants were excluded because of inability to
find a signal or poor signal quality (6 cases), low reading comprehension
scores (greater than 2 sd below the group average; 2 cases), and/or low
accuracy on the experimental tasks (scores lower than 2 sd below the group
mean ( &#x0003c; 83% on rhyme or &#x0003c; 81% on line; 2 cases). Therefore
data from 28 (11 male) participants were included in the study. The average
age of participants was 26.2 years (sd 6.4; range: 18.60&#x02013;49.56). The
average reading score was 34.66 (sd 3.48; range 27&#x02013;40 max=42), which
corresponds to a mean reading level categorised as &#x02018;adult&#x02019; on

on those in <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">MacSweeney et al.
(2013)</xref>). Half of the word pairs rhymed and half did not (see
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for examples). All
words were monosyllables and had a single coda. To ensure that the rhyme
decision could not be made on the basis of spelling similarity
(orthography) of the items in a pair, the orthographic similarity of
word pairs was measured using the metric of <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Davis (2010)</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/c.davis/Utilities/MatchCalc/">http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/c.davis/Utilities/MatchCalc/</ext-link>).
This metric takes into account letter position to estimate the overall
orthographic similarity between two words: a value of &#x02018;0&#x02019;
indicates no overlap and &#x02018;1&#x02019; indicates identical letter
strings. The mean overlap values were: rhyming word pairs=.34 (sd=.13),
non-rhyming word pairs=.33 (sd=.13). There was no significant difference
between word sets (<italic>t</italic>(88)=.65, <italic>p</italic>=.94,
cohen's <italic>d</italic>=.01). On average, the rhyming and
non-rhyming sets were also matched on number of letters, number of
phonemes, frequency (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Francis and Kucera,
1982</xref>), and, where data were available, from the MRC database
(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Coltheart, 1981</xref>) on number

of lines in each array was matched to the number of letters in the
rhyming words. Half of the line array pairs were identical and half were
dissimilar by one or two line orientations. Line sets were created from
text characters in the same point size as letters. Behavioural piloting
showed comparable accuracy and reaction times for word and line
stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><label>2.1.3</label><title>Procedure</title><p id="P19">Participants were seated facing a laptop computer upon which
time-locked stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox-3 (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>) for MATLAB 2012b (Mathworks Inc.,
Sherborn, MA, USA). Triggers were sent from the presentation computer via
parallel port to the Doppler-Box set-up at trial onsets and recorded on a
separate data acquisition computer with the TCD signal, allowing the
analysis of stimuli-related changes in cerebral blood flow.</p><p id="P20">Participants performed both rhyme and line judgement tasks. The
order of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Trials began
with a three second &#x02018;clear mind&#x02019; period, during which
participants were instructed to focus on the black of the screen. This was
followed by the presentation of five successive stimulus pairs (either words
or lines). Participants had to judge whether word pairs rhymed or line
arrays were the same or different. Each active phase lasted for 17.5 s.
After the active phase there was a 10 s &#x02018;relax&#x02019; period in
which participants were instructed to imagine a visual scene. We have
previously used this duration of relax period to allow normalisation of the
blood flow to baseline (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Sigut et
al., 2015</xref>). The whole test cycle for each trial was 30.5 s and
there were 18 trials for each condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The rhyme and line judgement tasks were performed in
separate blocks, each lasting 9 min, 9 s.</p><p id="P21">Button press &#x02018;yes&#x02019; (rhyme/ matching lines) and
&#x02018;no&#x02019; (non-rhyme/ non-matching lines) responses were made with
the index fingers of each hand. Participants were instructed to keep their
index fingers in a comfortable position over the keys to minimise movement.
The button indicating match or mismatch was counterbalanced across
participants but was kept consistent for the participant across tasks. The
keys &#x02018;Z&#x02019; and &#x02018;M&#x02019;, as found on a typical QWERTY
keyboard, were used to record responses. Accuracy and reaction time data
were recorded for each item. Both &#x02018;yes&#x02019; and &#x02018;no&#x02019;
trials were presented within each epoch. However, since fTCD is measuring a
haemodynamic signal, it has relatively poor temporal resolution and
therefore it is currently not possible to disambiguate blood flow responses
to rhyme versus non-rhyme, or line match versus line mismatch, trials in the
fTCD signal.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.1.4</label><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P22">Data were analysed using a custom toolbox for MATLAB, dopOSCCI
(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>). Artefact
rejection thresholds were set such that epochs containing blood flow
velocities less than 70% or greater than 130% of the average velocity for
that individual were rejected. As is the current standard for fTCD analysis,
the maximum left&#x02013;right difference allowed was set to 20% after
normalization (where the mean blood flow velocity for the total sample is
adjusted to 100) to further protect from the possibility of inaccurate
signals contributing to averages.</p><p id="P23">Blood flow velocity changes were analysed on a trial-by-trial basis
from &#x02212;6 to 23.5 s post-initial stimulus presentation. The sample
points measured from each artery were corrected to a pre-stimulus baseline
period from &#x02212;6 to 0 s, to protect against differences across trials
in the low frequency components of cerebral blood flow. A period of at least
10 s of recording was made before the start of the first trial to allow a
baseline for the first trial. Participants fixated on the screen for this
time.</p><p id="P24">Strength of differences between blood flow responses in left and
right MCAs are most often quantified using Laterality Indices (LIs). To
calculate these, periods of interest (POIs) were set from 6 to 23.5 s to
allow for a lag in the blood flow speed response poststimulus. Within this
window the maximum difference in blood flow between left and right was
identified. Laterality Indices for each individual are given by the mean
difference between left and right over a 2 s interval around this peak. This
is the current standard method for analysing fTCD data (see <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Deppe et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S10"><label>2.2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S11"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Behavioural data</title><p id="P25"><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows accuracy and

using fTCD, when performing a metalinguistic task that does not require overt or
covert word generation. Furthermore, right hemisphere lateralisation was also
established for a non-linguistic task, which was matched to the linguistic
(rhyme) condition in task requirements. This suggests that fTCD is indeed
sensitive to &#x02018;verbal&#x02019; and &#x02018;nonverbal&#x02019; processing,
above and beyond the cognitive requirements of completing a match/mismatch
decision.</p><p id="P31">We note that the group mean LI of .84 during the rhyme judgement is
lower than those LIs reported in previous studies of word generation (e.g. 2.7

In addition,
considering the data categorically, we find a lower percentage of participants
categorised as significantly left lateralised (36%) than previously reported
(e.g. 82% (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2009b</xref>); 85%
(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#x000f6;el et al., 2005</xref>)). The
proportion of participants categorised as right lateralised for the line

2009</xref>) and 72% (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Dorst et al.,
2008</xref>). It is possible that the low lateralisation in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref> is due to the slow pace of
stimulus presentation. Given our previously reported association between
strength of lateralisation and number of words generated (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2015</xref>), we reasoned that making more
rhyme judgements in the same period could boost premotor activity and result in

in the strength of left lateralisation during the rhyme judgement task. We
hypothesised this to be due to both the increased in the amount of material to
be sub-vocally rehearsed and the increase in task difficulty resulting in
greater effort. These factors can be teased apart to some extent by testing the
effect of pace on a non-linguistic task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><label>3</label><title>Experiment 2</title><sec sec-type="methods" id="S17"><label>3.1</label><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S18"><label>3.1.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P33">Eighteen of the participants who performed <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref>, also performed fast paced versions of the

questions about the role of task demands, specifically stimulus presentation rate,
on hemispheric lateralisation measured using fTCD. We demonstrated that
lateralisation can be robustly established using two novel fTCD tasks: a language
task that does not require generation of novel items, and a non-linguistic line
array judgement task, which was well matched to the linguistic task in stimulus
format and output requirements. By manipulating the number of stimuli presented
during a trial, we also demonstrated a clear effect of task demands on
lateralisation for both the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. We will now discuss
each of these findings in turn.</p><sec id="S29"><label>4.1</label><title>Linguistic and non-linguistic judgement tasks</title><p id="P47">Several previously published fTCD studies with adults have used tasks
other than free word and sentence generation to assess the sensitivity of the
fTCD technique to measure language lateralisation. For example, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al. (2011)</xref> asked participants to
passively listen to a short story accompanied by pictures, the final word of
which was replaced with a pure tone. it was expected that participants would
implicitly generate the word to complete the sentence. In a separate task,
participants were asked to listen to a definition of an object and name the
object during the active period. <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Stroobant et
al. (2009)</xref> asked participants to generate grammatically correct
sentences from jumbled words, to read a fixed number of words from a text and to
make self-paced semantic decisions between three visually presented words. In
these studies, the language tasks led to left hemisphere lateralisation at the
group level. However, in each study the average laterality indices reported were
low in contrast to those recorded during word generation from the same
participants. Furthermore, the proportions of individuals showing robust left
lateralisation were low.</p><p id="P48">In the current study we used rhyme judgement as an alternative to word
generation. Participants made button press responses to indicate whether two
written word pairs rhymed. Rhyme judgement, we reasoned, does not require mental
generation of new items, but still sufficiently engages articulatory planning
processes. This task has been reliably shown to be left lateralised in the
majority of right-handed participants as measured by the BOLD response in a
number of fMRI studies (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kareken et al.,
2000</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lurito et al., 2000</xref>;
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Pugh et al., 1996</xref>). The data from
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref> showed that fTCD can
indeed reliably measure changes in speed of blood flow speed associated with a
nongeneration task and is sufficiently sensitive to measure the left lateralised
cognitive demands of rhyme judgement, despite differences between BOLD and
CBFV/rCBF (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Mechelli et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P49">fTCD has also been used to examine lateralisation during non-linguistic
tasks such as: visual memory (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Groen et at.,
2011</xref>), mental rotation (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Serrati et
al., 2000</xref>), figure assembly, cube comparison and selecting an
identical figure from an array (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bulla-Hellwig et
al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hartje et al.,
1994</xref>). Whilst results from these studies have been mixed, and some showed
low or no lateralised responses (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hartje et al.,
1994</xref>), more recent line bisection and visual memory tasks have shown
replicable and reliable right lateralisation (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Rosch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Whitehouse and
Bishop, 2009</xref>). In the current study we used line array judgement in
an attempt to closely match the task demands of the rhyme judgement task. This
close matching of the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks allows us to address
the relationship between lateralisation for linguistic and non-linguistic skills
within participants. Previous fTCD studies that have addressed this issue have
not matched linguistic and non-linguistic conditions for task requirements (e.g.
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Dorst et al., 2008</xref>). In the current
study participants made button press responses to indicate whether two sets of
lines were oriented in exactly the same way or whether two words rhymed. We
demonstrated, as predicted, significant left hemisphere lateralisation during
rhyme judgement and right hemisphere lateralisation during line judgement. We
did not observe any significant correlations between the strength of
lateralisation during performance of the linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.
This is not surprising given that we did not recruit left handers (who are more
likely to show right lateralisation for language than right handers) and
therefore could not investigate this relationship at the population level as
other studies have done (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Badzakova-Trajkov et
al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Whitehouse and Bishop,

index</title><p id="P50">In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Experiment 1</xref>, using a slow
stimulus presentation rate, we found lower LI values than are typically reported
in studies requiring word generation, and fewer participants than expected
showing significantly lateralised blood flow. This pattern of
&#x02018;weak&#x02019; lateralisation was also observed during the line judgement
task. Previous studies that have used language tasks other than word or sentence
generation have attributed low lateralisation to increased right hemisphere
involvement (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Buchinger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Stroobant et al., 2011</xref>), arguing for the
recruitment of distributed higher cognitive processes such as theory of mind or
inference during story comprehension. <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Stroobant
et al. (2011)</xref> also suggest that less lateralised responses during
listening to stories may be due to reduced motoric demands in contrast to
generation tasks. Similary, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al.
(2011)</xref> attributed lower lateralisation in their receptive task to
inconsistent or weaker implicit production when participants are expected to
label a missing word. With regard to non-linguistic tasks, it has been argued
that strong right hemisphere lateralisation is most likely to be found during
tasks that combine visual attention and visuomotor manipulation and tasks that
do not include both factors are likely to show weak effects (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Vingerhoets and Stroobant, 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P51">In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Experiment 2</xref>, we tested the
hypothesis that previous linguistic and non-linguistic tasks that have shown
weak lateralisation may simply not have been sufficiently demanding to drive
detectable hemispheric lateralisation. Participants made (blocked) rhyme or line
judgements during fast or slow presentation rates of stimulus pairs. Faster
presentation, and therefore more judgements to be made within the same time
window, led to higher LIs than during the slow condition. This effect of pace
held for both the rhyme and line judgement tasks since there was a main effect
of pace and no interaction with task type. At the individual level, twice as
many participants were categorised as significantly left-lateralised for the
rhyme task and right lateralised for the line task during fast presentation
compared to slow presentation speeds.</p><p id="P52">It is important to emphasise that the slow and the fast paced conditions
had the same stimuli and the same task requirements. It seems plausible
therefore, that previous linguistic (but &#x02018;non-generation&#x02019;) tasks
that have been used in the literature (e.g. reading aloud or sentence
completion) were not taxing enough, or did not stimulate a sufficient degree of
articulatory rehearsal in order to drive detectable left hemisphere
lateralisation. For example, reading high frequency words (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Stroobant and Vingerhoets, 2000</xref>) requires little
phonological processing demands and articulating a single item (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Badcock et al., 2011</xref>) requires negligible
articulatory planning or rehearsal. Similarly, non-linguistic paradigms that
have not found significant lateralisation (e.g. cube comparison and figure
assembly; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bulla-Hellwig et al., 1996</xref>;
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hartje et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Serrati et al., 2000</xref>) required single
responses within trials of approximately 15 s duration. These tasks may not
require sufficient effort to drive detectable right hemisphere lateralisation.
Our results suggest that it is not necessarily the type of task that determines
the extent of lateralisation, but the effort required to complete it.</p><p id="P53">Although in the current study we found a convincing effect of increased
pace, we note that the proportion of participants categorised as left
lateralised during the fast rhyme task (66%), and the mean LI (1.6) were both
relatively low compared to previous &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; word
generation studies. There are a number of possible reasons for this. First,
using fMRi it has been established that word generation leads to activation over
a large portion of the left hemisphere in contrast to rhyme judgement, which
shows more focal inferior frontal cortex activity (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Lurito et al., 2000</xref>). Since fTCD measures only relative
differences in blood flow speed between the hemispheres, it may be that
lateralised activity in more extensive regions leads to stronger LIs than in
more focal regions. Second, whether a participant is categorised as
significantly lateralised (using a one sample <italic>t</italic>-test) depends
on the number of epochs measured and the consistency of that individual's
LIs over all the epochs. Some of our conditions had lower split-half reliability
than has been reported in studies of word generation (e.g. <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Sigut et al., 2015</xref>), which may have contributed
to fewer participants being categorised as significantly lateralised. It is
possible that consistency across trials, and hence split-half reliability, may
be improved in future studies by extending the relaxation period or increasing
the number of trials.</p><p id="P54">Despite weaker lateralisation during rhyme judgement in contrast to
previous studies of word generation, we argue that rhyme judgement could be a
valuable clinical assessment tool, since the best surgery outcomes are likely to
come from the use of a battery of language tasks (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Gaillard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ramsey et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, if we wish to better understand
which characteristics drive the fTCD signal, externally paced tasks allow a much
greater degree of experimental control, including control of number of words
produced, than word or sentence generation.</p><p id="P55">Based on the findings from the non-linguistic task, and the effect of
the pace manipulation on behavioural performance, we speculate that task
difficulty is a driving factor in the increase in lateralised blood flow, in
addition to the amount of articulatory rehearsal. If the effect of pace was
related to an increase in premotor activity alone, due to greater articulatory
planning, then we would expect the influence of pace on the strength of LI to be
evident only in rhyme condition. However, faster pace of judgements led to
increased LIs in both the linguistic and non-linguistic conditions. We therefore
suggest that task difficulty does indeed play a role in lateralisation of blood
flow, as measured by fTCD in the middle cerebral arteries, above and beyond
articulatory rehearsal.</p><p id="P56">It is interesting to note that a previous fTCD study which manipulated
task difficulty of a non-linguistic task, reported an influence of task
difficulty on behaviour but not on strength of LI (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Rosch et al., 2012</xref>). Participants were there required to
perform a line bisection task and task difficulty was manipulated in two ways:
stimulus duration and distance of stimulus from the midline. That these
manipulations of &#x02018;task difficulty&#x02019; did not influence LI but our
manipulation of pace of stimulus presentation did, is perhaps not surprising.
The increased effort required to solve more complex tasks versus that required
for faster paced tasks would likely be mediated by different processes. Future
studies with direct contrasts of such manipulations are needed to address this
issue.</p><p id="P57">Although the BOLD signal and CBFV may not relate to pace in the same way
(<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Rees et al., 1997</xref>) we can at least
speculate about the areas that might drive the greater degree of hemispheric
lateralisation during speeded rhyming from studies using other neuroimaging
modalities. <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., (1996)</xref> using
PET found a main effect of stimulus presentation rate during overt and covert
word reading tasks in visual, motor and language related areas including left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Similarly, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Shergill et al. (2002)</xref>, using fMRI, reported that increased
presentation rate, from 15 words per minute to 60 words per minute in a covert
generation task, increased strength of activation in left inferior frontal
gyrus, and anterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus. These areas lie
within the perfusion territory of the MCA and therefore in-creased involvement
of these areas is likely to affect the TCD signal.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><label>4.3</label><title>A comment on categorisation</title><p id="P58">Our data demonstrate that an increase of stimulus presentation pace
resulted in a higher proportion of participants being categorized as
significantly &#x02018;lateralised&#x02019;: left for the rhyme task and right for
the line task. A small shift in either the mean LI or standard error for an
individual resulted in a change of category &#x02013; left, right, or low
lateralisation. We suggest that these results highlight the importance of moving
away from the categorisation of participants into left, right and low groups,
reserving categorical variables for discrete groups. This is not a new idea; it
has long been suggested that the use of continuous variables results in greater
power (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Maxwell and Delaney, 199note3</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Naggara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Royston et al., 2006</xref>). Dichotomisation results in a loss of data,
and neglects within-group variability. Using a categorisation approach, some
participants may be confidently placed within a category, while data from other
participants may place them on the threshold between categories. However, the
category thresholds are arbitrarily defined or, more problematically,
data-driven. In terms of developmental studies, test&#x02013;retest reliability
estimates could be misleading if a change in category is reported from a small
shift in lateralisation index. As <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Naggara et al.
(2011)</xref> note, &#x0201c;What is necessary or sensible in clinical and
therapeutic settings in not relevant to how research data should best be
analysed&#x0201d;.</p><p id="P59">We hope therefore to move away from the categorical distinctions of
left-lateralised/low-lateralised/right-lateralised for individuals. In the
absence of categorical variables it is then easier to assess repeated measures
by accounting for non-independent residuals. Using general linear model type
analyses (e.g. ANOVA or regression), the presence of a high proportion of low
laterality indices will be accounted for. It makes little sense to exclude
participants who show &#x02018;low&#x02019; lateralisation due to an arbitrary
threshold. If a participant&#x02019;s LI is not statically different from zero
then this will be reflected in the size of the effect. A large standard
deviation of the group mean LI, along with minimum and maximum values, will
indicate whether it is likely the effect is driven by one or two highly
lateralised individuals. We suggest instead that examining group level trends
and relationships to behaviour would be a more robust and informative way to
analyse fTCD data.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><label>4.4</label><title>Summary</title><p id="P60">We have demonstrated that a metalinguistic judgement task, which does
not involve the overt or covert generation of novel words or sentences, can be
used to assess hemispheric lateralisation of language using fTCD. We also
demonstrated that a non-linguistic task, with similar task demands as rhyme
judgement-line array judgement, can also be used to assess right hemisphere
lateralisation.</p><p id="P61">Importantly, we demonstrated significantly greater hemispheric
lateralisation when rhyme and line judgements are presented at a fast compared
to a slow pace. Whilst it is tempting to attribute the stronger left hemisphere
lateralisation during faster rhyme judgements to increased premotor demands
alone, the finding that right hemisphere lateralisation for line judgements was
also stronger for fast compared to slow paced presentation rate, suggests that
general &#x02018;task difficulty&#x02019; also plays a role in influencing the
strength of laterality index. Thus we suggest that fTCD is sensitive to
increased premotor demands and also to task difficulty, which may or may not be
driven by a spatially distinct area within the territory of the MCAs. Future
studies are needed that explicitly disambiguate the influence of these factors,
for example by using fixed pace linguistic judgements of varying difficulty. In
addition, manipulating the variables of pace and task difficulty separately in a
non-linguistic task such as line judgement may shed light on the conflicting
pattern of results between the current results and previous fTCD studies of task
difficulty in spatial tasks (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Rosch et al.,
2012</xref>).</p><p id="P62">Our findings advance our understanding of the sensitivity of fTCD as a
technique to assess hemispheric lateralisation of function. This understanding
is fundamental if this technique is to be used to its full potential in
providing insights into the development of hemispheric lateralisation of
function in young children (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bishop,
2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Appendix A. Supplementary material</title><p id="P63">Supplementary dataassociatedwiththisarticlecanbefoundin the onlineversionat
