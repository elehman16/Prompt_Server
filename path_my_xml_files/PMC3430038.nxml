This conclusion proposes that midazolam may possibly act at a peripheral site to yield analgesia.</p><p>There are different suggested sites for action of IVRA. Raj et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> described that the action of local anaesthetics is on major nerve trunks, perhaps reaching to the nerve trunk through small venules inside the nerve core, while Rosenberg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> afforded strong proof related to a peripheral site.</p><p>It is currently believed that together, the nerve endings and trunks, are affected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> It was possible that analgesic effect of midazolam added to IVRA was due to its action on binding sites in periphery. This is confirmed by a significant decrease in VAS scores throughout intraoperative and twenty-four postoperative hours and by a prolonged delay between the IVRA administration and additional analgesic requirement.</p><p>Naguib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> and Nishiyama<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> et al. showed that midazolam administrations at doses of 0.05 mg/kg epidurally or 0.03 mg/kg intrathecally produce significant analgesia in both animal and human studies.</p><p>Antinociceptive effects of neuraxial midazolam arise from agonism at the BDZ binding site on a subunit of pentameric GABA-A receptors, which operates paradoxically to reduce the transmitter release, a form of presynaptic inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></p><p>Consistent with this effect and from BDZ subunit expression in dorsal root ganglion and on spinal nerves, BDZ have a propensity to suppress afferent evoked excitation in substantia gelatinosa and motor horn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> leading to an antinociceptive effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></p><p>A variety of authors have also showed the existence of these GABA-A receptors in peripheral nerves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></p><p>A comparable action of midazolam on GABA-A receptors in afferent nerve endings in the wrist and hand peripheral tissue may be responsible for its analgesic action throughout the intra- and postoperative period.</p><p>Besides GABA effects, spinal midazolam stimulates the opioid system through &#x003b4; or &#x003ba; receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
<italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that midazolam displaced [3H]-deprenorphione binding from cloned human &#x003ba; and &#x003b4; receptors, and this effect of midazolam was inhibited by selective &#x003ba; and &#x003b4; agonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></p><p>Peripheral opioid receptors present in the peripheral wrist and hand tissue and their stimulation by midazolam can be responsible for IVRA analgesia.</p><p>Additionally, coexistent local tissue inflammation may perhaps lead to up-regulation or activation of peripheral opioid receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Stimulation of these opioid receptors by midazolam possibly will be responsible for its analgesic effect. The effect of midazolam on peripheral receptors has been confirmed by its effectiveness in augmenting the duration of analgesia when used in combination with bupivacaine for brachial plexus block.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></p><p>Batra et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> study showed that intraarticular administration of midazolam decreases postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery, when compared with placebo. Their investigation also proposes that midazolam may act at a peripheral site in the joint, to produce analgesia.</p><p>Su et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> explained a case whose phantom pain of the amputated limb stump was twice induced by spinal anaesthesia during the two successive surgeries in the contralateral lower limb. It was showed that intravenous administration of 3 mg midazolam was successful in treating this rare phantom limb pain after spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Melzack and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> in clarifying the mechanism of phantom limb pain induced by spinal anaesthesia described that the occurrence of phantom pain after regional anesthesia could result from a decrease in the tonic inhibitory influence exerted by the brainstem reticular formation.</p><p>Complete loss of sensory input after subarachnoid block may possibly decrease the intensity of inhibition and may increase self-sustaining neural activity. Melzack<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> explained that intravenous administration of 10 mg diazepam could alleviate recurring phantom pain successfully in two patients following spinal anesthesia.</p><p>In SU et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> case, midazolam was effective for relief of the pain. Benzodiazepines facilitate the inhibition of gamma aminobutyric acid binding sites in the central nervous system. The above described mechanisms may possibly explain the efficacy of intravenous midazolam in relieving intra- and postoperative pain when added to IVRA. This assumption needs further investigation before final conclusion.</p><p>It is possible that IVRA might not be a perfect model to differentiate peripheral versus central mechanisms of analgesia.</p><p>It was proposed that tourniquet pain evolve from ischaemia and oxidative stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref> Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) are extremely reactive classes of molecules described by an unpaired electron in the outer electron ring. They are produced constantly in the organism following enzymatic reactions, or as metabolits of oxidation processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></p><p>Coderre and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref> advocated that antioxidant therapy such as N-acetyl-L cysteine may decrease experimental ischaemic pain owing to oxidative damage. Additionally, antioxidants for pain treatment may reduce the dose of analgesics and inhibit the negative influence of reactive oxygen species on nociception.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></p><p>There are a number of researches describing the effects of midazolam on OFRs in vitro. Ischemic model have not been employed in these investigations and the findings are contradictory.</p><p>Davidson et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref> showed that midazolam minimally affected OFRs production. Midazolam was shown to reduce superoxide anion production in doses that was higher than those used in clinical practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> It was without significant effect in a different study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></p><p>As previous studies showed, the antioxidative effect of midazolam is controversial and needs further investigation before final conclusion. However, due to isolation of intravenous midazolam in arm circulation by tourniquet for 1-1.5 hours, it is possible that local administration of midazolam might attenuate tourniquet pain by antioxidative mechanism. More studies are necessary before we could have such assumption.</p><p>IVRA midazolam was also associated with faster onset of sensory and motor block, and prolonged sensory and motor block recovery times.</p><p>Chang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref> demonstrated that midazolam produces vasodilatation by endothelium-dependent and independent mechanisms. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation produced by midazolam possibly is mediated through the release of nitrous oxide (NO) from endothelium. Endothelium independent vasodilatation appears to be related to inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</p><p>The beneficial effects of midazolam, which were showed in our study, probably will also depend on vasodilatory effect that promotes distribution of lidocaine to nerves. This would explain the rapid onset of sensory and motor block.</p><p>Reis J&#x000fa;nior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref> showed that after tourniquet release in ischemic limb, the anaesthetic releases biphasically in systemic circulation and this release lasts 20 minutes or more. It was shown that only the amount of drug that stayed in the vascular bed (25% to 50%) leaves the limb quickly. This indicates that a substantial fraction of the drug remains in the area for a prolonged time.</p><p>It has been shown that plasma levels of local anaesthetics from the anesthetized limb are always higher than in the blood from the contralateral limb, even after 40 minutes or more.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></p><p>A clinical sign that confirms the staying of the anaesthetic in the operated limb is that it is feasible to reinstitute an excellent anaesthesia (continuous IVRB), with approximately half of the initial dose, 5 to 10 minutes after release of the tourniquet (&#x0201c;respiratory period&#x0201d;).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></p><p>It is possible that due to remaining midazolam and lidocaine for a prolonged time in the operating limb after tourniquet release, the sensory and motor block recovery times were significantly longer in LM group compared with LS group. Also, it is probable that vasodilatory effect of midazolam was not lasted till removal of tourniquet or at least, it was not similar to the initial periods of tourniquet inflation. These assumptions need further investigation before final conclusion can be elicited.</p><p>The substantial prolongation of motor blockade in the LM group compared with the LS group could also be described by benzodiazepine-induced attenuation of motor tonus at the ventral horn of the spinal cord after tourniquet release.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></p><p>While a variety of adjuvants have been recommended for improving intraoperative and postoperative analgesia and maintaining better operative conditions, these adjutants can cause side effects such as sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, wound hematoma, skin rash, and hypotension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></p><p>In our investigation, owing to the high lipophilicity, rapid clearance (6&#x02013;11 mL/ kg/min), and short half-life (1.7&#x02013;2.6 h) of midazolam<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref> there was no significant difference in side effects among groups.

However, Grice et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref> used isotope scanning to show that the combination of distal extremity IV line, Esmarch exsanguination, injection over more than 90 seconds, and tourniquet pressure of 300 mm Hg had no IVRA solution leakage into the systemic circulation. Because our technique reflected his recommendations, we do not believe sub-tourniquet leakage into the systemic circulation was likely.</p><p>The degree of sedation was recorded at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after tourniquet removal. At the time of patients&#x02019; discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), all patients had sedation level of 1. Also, there were no cases of apnea, hypoxia, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension or any other side effects after tourniquet release till 24 hours after surgery. Therefore, if hospital discharge criteria were met for the outpatient surgery, it seems there were no problems concerning midazolam. But, the authors think, final decision for discharging the patients should be made with caution till further investigation carried out.</p><p>Our study was limited by the lack of a systemic midazolam control group and an active analgesic comparator (for example, IVRA opioid). Also, our study did not provide perfect substantiation of the comparative analgesic significance of central versus peripheral sites of action of midazolam.</p><p>Therefore, more studies comparing groups receiving IVRA midazolam with IV saline, IVRA saline with IV midazolam, IVRA saline with IV saline, and the addition of a standard analgesic are needed to establish the efficacy of IVRA midazolam.</p><p>In conclusion, addition of 50 &#x003bc;g/kg midazolam to lidocaine in IVRA shortens sensory and motor block onset times, prolongs sensory and motor block recovery times, and improves tourniquet pain while it prolongs first analgesic requirement time, and decreases total amount of analgesic without side effects. More studies must be carried out with experimental models and different doses to determine a relevant conclusion before midazolam routine use so its significance for the field of IVRA remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>PK has planned the study and finalized it; KM and HMH have planned the study and finalized it too; MRS and AH did the statistical analysis and prepared the first version of manuscript and revised final version for publish.
