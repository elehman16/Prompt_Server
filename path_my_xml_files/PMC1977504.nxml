Of a total of 217 patients, 107 were randomised to 3M and 110 to VAC and a mean of 5.5 courses was given per patient. The overall response rate (complete and partial) was 53% (95% Confidence Limits (CL): 43-62%) for 3M and 49% (CL; 39-58%) for VAC. The response according to sites of metastases was the same for both treatment groups. Symptomatic toxicity including alopecia, neuropathy, vomiting (P less than 0.001) and nausea (P less than 0.01) were significantly less for 3M. Myelosuppression including leucopenia (P less than 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (P less than 0.001) was significantly greater with 3M at day 21, although there was no difference in nadir counts in patients at special risk of myelosuppression and there was no evidence of an increase in infective or bleeding complications. There was no significant difference in the duration of response to 3M (10 months, CL 6-15) and VAC (11 months, CL 7-12), nor in survival (3M, 8 months, CL 6-12; VAC, 10 months, CL 8-12). These results indicate that 3M is as effective as, but has significantly less symptomatic toxicity than, an anthracycline containing regimen for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="406" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="407" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="408" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="409" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="410" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
