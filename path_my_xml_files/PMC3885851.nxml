weakness that impairs stroke patients&#x02019; gait performance, to examine the effect of the
training on stroke patients&#x02019; plantar pressure and gait ability. [Subjects and Methods] In
this study, 36 stroke patients diagnosed with stroke due to cerebral infarction or
cerebral hemorrhage performed the training. Static muscle stretching was performed four
times a week for 20 minutes at a time for 6 weeks by the training group. Ankle dorsiflexor
training was performed four times a week, two sets per time in the case of females and
three sets per time in the case of males for 6 weeks, by another group. Center of pressure
sway amplitude was measured using the F-scan system during gait. All subjects were
assessed with the same measurements at a pre-study examination and reassessed at eight
weeks. Data were analyzed statistically using the paired t-test and one-way ANOVA.
[Results] Among the between ankle dorsiflexor training group, static muscle stretching
group, and control group, the difference before and after the training were proven to be
statistically significant. [Conclusion] Compared to other training groups, the ankle
muscle strength training group showed statistically significant increases of forward
thrust at stroke patients&#x02019; toe-off which positively affected stroke patients&#x02019; ability to
perform gait.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Plantar pressure</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Muscle stretching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The gait pattern of stroke patients is characterized by a slow gait cycle and velocity, a
difference in stride lengths between the affected and unaffected sides, and short stance and
relatively long swing phases on the affected side<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, when the stiffening of the flexor on the bottom of
the ankle joint is severe, it hinders the advance of the lower limbs during gait, resulting
in problems such as asymmetric postures, balance disorders, and the loss of ability of motor
control in the performance of detailed motor functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gait function relies on the functions of both lower limbs and
needs be recovered sufficiently to enable functional activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait is the function that is first considered when
minimizing the disorders of stroke patients and having them return to an independent daily
life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the process of the functional
recovery of stroke patients, improving the gait ability becomes the prime purpose of
physical therapy, because gait is an important factor in realizing functional
independence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For functional walking,
the foot is the most important element in gait. Walking is an important transport means for
humans. The feet not only provide the propulsion and direction necessary for trunk
movements, but also play the role of absorbing physical shocks, supporting the body weight,
and simultaneously maintaining balance and the stability of the feet themselves by
responding to adaptation to the ground and the movement of the center of gravity. The ankle
joint, which is important in gait, absorbs shocks during walking, provides a stable bearing
surface in a weight bearing posture and enables the advance of the lower limbs. Achache et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the spinal excitability
in response to the flexor in the back of the ankle extending to the knee joint extensor
particularly increases when stroke patients are walking, and in the early stance phase, the
functional recovery of the flexor in the back of the ankle joint influences the improvement
in the patients&#x02019; gait ability by helping to stabilize the knee. Lin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the movements of the center of plantar
pressure on the affected side increased from side to side, but decreased forward and
backward, and most of all, improvement in the ability of the ankle joint had a major effect
on gait velocity and stride length. The movements of the center of plantar pressure also
increased forward and backward. In a study of the gait ability of stroke patients, Adler et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the contract-relax
technique, which is a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) technique, can be
applied to cause concentric contraction in limited antagonistic muscles against static
resistance, and induce relaxation within the increased range due to the concentric
contraction, as well as increasing the flexibility of muscles related to the ROM. Stretching
exercises to improve the mobility of soft tissues and the ROM are divided into passive and
active stretching exercises according to the ways in which they are performed. Regardless of
the stretching exercise method, it is important to relax shortened muscles and induce
limited connective tissues to stretch easily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As noted above, various studies have emphasized the importance of
flexion in the back of the ankle for the effective gait patterns of stroke patients.
Therefore, exercises that can increase the ROM of the ankle joint and strengthen the flexor
in the back of the ankle joint are necessary. This study focused on the fact that the
undesirable gait exhibited by stroke patients is the result of weakening of the ankle
muscles and the lack of their activation. This study implement ankle joint dorsiflexion
training for the ankle muscle strength weakness that impairs stroke patients&#x02019; gait
performance to examine the effect of the training on stroke patients&#x02019; gait and its
relationship with C.O.P away amplitude. We conduct muscle strengthening or static muscle
stretching training for patients with hemiplegia due to stroke through flexion of the back
of the ankle and analyze the C.O.P sway amplitude before and after the intervention, to
identify the effects of the respective training programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subject were 45 patients who had been diagnosed with stroke by computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), had a Brunnstrom stage higher or equal
to stage 3, met the selection criteria set by the study, and agreed to participate in the
study. The subjects were divided into 15 patients who were treated with ankle muscle
strength training in addition to conventional physical therapy, 15 patients who were treated
with static muscle stretching training in addition to conventional physical therapy, and 15
patients who were treated only with conventional physical therapy. All of them understood
the purpose of this study and gave their written informed consent before experimental
involvement. The study was performed according to the orinciples of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and ethical approval was granted by the local committee of the Institution Review
Board of university hospital. This study was conducted with patients hospitalized at K
Hospital, Buk-gu, Daegu, in 20-min sessions, four times a week over a six-week period from
December 2010 to March 2011.</p><p>The control group only received conventional physical therapy that consisted of 20 minutes
of ergometric bicycle training, 30 minutes of functional electrical stimulation (FES), and
30 minutes of exercise therapy. The exercise therapy was comprised of weight-shift training,
gait training, muscle strength training, and stretching exercises.</p><p>The static muscle stretching training group received the same conventional physical therapy
as the control group. Then each subject in this test group was instructed to direct the
heels downward and the toes upward, and perform muscle stretching for 20 minutes in a
standing position using the flexor on the bottom of the ankle joint while keeping the ankle
joint posteriorly flexed at 20&#x000b0; with an inclined board for both feet.</p><p>The ankle muscle strength training group received the same conventional physical therapy as
the control group. Then each subject lay on a bed and performed posterior flexion of the
ankle joint for seven seconds against a resistance force of 20 to 30% of the individual&#x02019;s
maximum muscular strength. Afterward, the therapist created an equal opposite pressure to
the flexion of the back of the ankle joint by using his/her hands, to induce isometric
contraction in the muscle in front of the shinbone. After the contraction, the subject was
given a 10-second break. The female subjects repeated two sets of the above exercise and the
male subjects performed three sets of the above exercise. A 10-second break was provided
between sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the training intervention progressed, the intensity of the
exercises was increased by 40 to 80%.</p><p>The sway of C.O.P in the stance phase was measured using the F-Scan system (Tekscan Inc.,
South Boston, MA, USA). The F-Scan system consists of a pressure sensorarray that can be cut
to size, and it measures plantar pressures. A transducer is attached to the legs, and a
cable connects the transducer to a computer, which is used to analyze the plantar pressures.
The subjects had to walk three times at their usual gait velocity and the average of the
three measurements was used in the analysis. The input of signals were delivered to a
computer via a 10m-long cable which was attached to an interface attached to the waist of
each subject. The data were collected and analyzed using the software F-Scan research
TAM/STAM 6.00 (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA).</p><p>The data analysis was performed after calculating the averages and standard deviations of
the measurements data using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The general characteristics of the
subjects were analyzed through descriptive statistics. In addition, the paired t-test was
employed to examine changes in the gait ability of each group before and after the training.
In addition, to verify the homogeneity of the three groups of subjects, plantar pressures
and gait indices were compared among the three groups, and compare their reciprocity, the
data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The statistical significance level was chosen as
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Forty-five subjects initially participated in this study however, six were discharged from

limits their t&#x02019; functional recovery, and results in decline muscle strength, balance
ability, and functional independence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exercises to enhance the muscle strength of the ankle joint and the ROM can be helpful for
recovery of gait ability after the onset of stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bohannon and Larkin implemented ankle joint stretching exercises
to improve gait ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported that
when hemiplegic patients, who had reduced flexion the back of the ankle due to the
shortening of the gastrocnemius, were treated with the technique of standing using a tilting
table with a wedge-shaped board installed, increase in the passive flexion at the back of
the ankle was observed.</p><p>In the study of Fan Gao et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, an
increase in the ROM was exhibited after stroke patients performed repeated stretching
exercises for the ankle joint in a sitting position using a machine,. Moreover, an increase
in the length of the Achilles tendon was detected by ultrasonography. In a previous study of
muscle strengthening exercises for the ankle joint aiming to improve gait ability, Mattacola
and Lloyd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the application
of a proprioceptive exercise program for a six-week period was effective at improving the
flexor strength of the back of the ankle. Andrews and Bohannon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> performed a study of the short-term recovery of the lower
limb muscle strength of stroke patients. They reported that the flexor strength of the back
of the ankle on the affected side increased from 75.6 N at the time of hospitalization to
102.4 N after the intervention, a statistically significant difference. Docherty et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that after a six-week ankle joint
exercise program, a statistically significant difference in the flexor strength of the back
of the ankle was observed. The present study investigated the effects of ankle joint muscle
strength training and static muscle stretching programs on C.O.P sway amplitude. The static
muscle stretching group performed static stretching while the ankle joint was flexed 20&#x000b0; at
the back of the ankle on an inclined board. The comparison of the pre- and post-training
results revealed a statistically significant increase in C.O.P sway amplitude. We consider
the statistically significant difference in the C.O.P sway amplitude between before and
after the training found in this study was the result of reduced stiffening and increased
ROM, which were also observed in the previous studies that conducted stretching exercises.
In the training group in which muscle strengthening exercises were applied to the flexor in
the back of the ankle joint, the C.O.P sway amplitude increased after the training. As with
the results of the previous studies that conducted muscle strengthening exercises, the
functional improvement in the flexor at the back of the ankle may have enabled the subjects
to accurately touch their heels on the ground in the stance phase and increase the contact
area of the foot. This would have provided the ankle joint with stability against the
bearing surface during gait and helped stroke patients to effectively walk on their own,
thereby having an overall positive influence on gait ability. The muscle strengthening
exercises used in the present study followed the technique that Chaitow mostly used in the
field of orthopedic physiotherapy. They employ a reciprocal inhibition technique using a
protocol in which the antagonistic muscle of the respective muscle is inhibited in isometric
contraction, and then immediately relaxed. Therefore, the exercises are considered as a
treatment method within the concept of therapeutic exercise, &#x02018;relaxation and facilitation&#x02019;.
The contract-relax technique, which is one of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation
techniques that are frequently used for stroke patients, may partly overlap with the method
used to increase ROM-related muscular flexibility and muscular strength using concentric
contraction against static resistance and inducing the relaxation of the antagonistic muscle
within the range increased by the concentric contraction. Given the results of the present
study, it can be seen that ankle joint dorsi flexion training implemented in addition to
conventional physical therapy increased stability during gait by increasing C.O.P sway
amplitude during gait. Compared to other training groups, the ankle muscle strength training
group showed statistically significant increases in sway amplitude, and it can be said that
this training increases forward thrust at stroke patients&#x02019; toe-off positively affecting
stroke patients&#x02019; ability to perform gait. The present study measured the C.O.P sway
amplitude as a variable of the gait of stroke patients, using the F-Scan system. This system
was developed in the USA, and it measures plantar pressures and partly measures gait
characteristics. It is capable of analyzing various gait patterns during walking and senses
pressures in various regions of the foot. In addition, it has the advantage of providing
temporal and quantitative data. The F-Scan system is known to provide more practical data
for measuring the ground reaction force than a force plate and has a high level of
reliability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has the
limitation of being unable to analyze qualitative elements and compensatory actions of gait.
The limitations of this study were that the study findings cannot be generalized all stroke
patients given the small number of subjects in each group, and the control group had a
shortage of training time, to some extent, compared to the test group.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mauritz</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name></person-group>: Gait training in hemiplegia.
