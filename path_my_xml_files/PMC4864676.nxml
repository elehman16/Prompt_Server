Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a nondegenerative, noncongenital insult to the brain from an external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or temporary impairment of cognitive, physical, and psycho social functions, with an associated diminished or altered state of consciousness.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Classification of head injury consists of primary and secondary head injury. Primary injuries occur at the time of trauma and can be manifested as focal or diffuse. Secondary injury is a result of primary and it causes significant axonal damage. It is caused by ischemia, cerebral hypoxia, cerebral edema, hypotension, raised intracranial pressure, and hyperglycemia. Secondary brain damage is potentially preventable. Minimizing secondary brain injury is the key to the optimal management of head injured patients. The release of catecholamines and hyperglycemia are results of the stress response to head injury and are among significant extracranial factors causing secondary brain damage. Early hyperglycemia is a significant indicator of the severity of injury and predictor of outcome that can easily be prevented. Anesthetic drugs and techniques may also contribute to the problem of hyperglycemia.</p><p>Since almost in every case anesthesia is needed in some or other form during surgery of head injured patients, there has been a long-standing controversy regarding the use of inhalational or intravenous (i.v.) anesthetic agents for surgery of such cases. Hence, very few studies are there which compare total i.v. with inhalational anesthesia techniques to demonstrate major outcome difference in relation to their effect on blood sugar level. In this study, we have tried to compare i.v. technique of anesthesia (using propofol) with inhalational (sevoflurane) for their effect on blood sugar level in head injured patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>This study was conducted with the aim to find out anesthetic drugs and technique having minimal or no effect on the blood sugar of patients with head injury. This was done with the following objectives:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To administer general anesthesia by two different techniques using a different combination of drugs</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess and compare the blood sugar of the patients at different time intervals</p></list-item><list-item><p>Complications, if any were observed and noted.</p></list-item></list>

Routine preoperative investigations were done in all patients including liver function test, electrocardiogram (ECG), and X-ray chest. No premedication was given except in the cases showing bradycardia.</p><p>Patients were allocated randomly by computer generated tables into two groups of 30 each:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group I received induction with sevoflurane and then had O<sub>2</sub> + air + sevoflurane for maintenance with controlled ventilation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group II received induction with i.v. propofol and then had O<sub>2</sub> + air + propofol for maintenance with controlled ventilation.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Injection Rocuronium was used to achieve muscle relaxation in both groups.</p><p>In the Group I, anesthesia was induced with inhalational agent sevoflurane by face mask with a concentration of 8% and fresh gas flow of 6 L/min in a closed circuit. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane up to 3.5%, and fresh gas flow of 2.5 L/min along with oxygen and air. Injection rocuronium was administered to achieve muscle relaxation for tracheal intubation in doses of 0.9 mg/kg in both the groups.</p><p>In the Group II anesthesia was induced i.v. with propofol in a dose of 1&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, and infusion of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;g/kg/min of propofol. Injection fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg was given before induction in both the groups. Intra-operatively fentanyl was used in increments of 50 &#x000b5;g and 100 &#x000b5;g. Muscle relaxation was maintained by injection rocuronium in 0.1 mg/kg increments as required. End tidal concentration of carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) level was maintained around 30. Residual neuromuscular block was reversed by using neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg when appropriate. Sevoflurane was discontinued approximately 5 min before the end of the surgery, and propofol infusion was discontinued 10 min before the end of surgery. Standard monitoring of vital signs was instituted, that include pulse oximetry, automated noninvasive blood pressure, ECG, respiratory rate, heart rate, and EtCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Blood glucose was measured preoperatively, after induction of anesthesia, &#x000bd; hr after induction of anesthesia and, after complete recovery from anesthesia using glucometer (Accu-Chek) that was calibrated daily. Finger prick capillary blood glucose was measured. Blood glucose unit is mentioned as mg/dl. Patient recovery was studied for 1 h after termination of anesthesia. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was used to assess patient's neurological status preoperatively, during recovery and postoperatively after 1 h. Intra-operatively, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were maintained. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003c;60 bpm, tachycardia as heart rate &#x0003e;100 bpm. Bradycardia was treated by the administration of atropine 0.6 mg. and tachycardia, or hypertension by first increasing the expired sevoflurane concentration, or increasing the rate of propofol infusion. Hypotension was first treated by decreasing the inspired sevoflurane concentration and propofol infusion and, if persistent by the administration of fluids then later by vasopressor drugs.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, Software using <italic>t</italic>-test for comparison between the two groups and Z-test for comparison of proportions.

In a similar study, Rovlias and Kotsou (2000)[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] concluded that patients with severe head injury (GCS &#x0003c;8) had significantly higher serum glucose levels than those with a moderate injury. Early hyperglycemia is a frequent component of stress response to head injury.</p><p>In our study, we did not observe a significant rise in blood sugar preoperatively, since most of the cases that we included in our study was either of moderate or mild head injury and we, therefore, expected less chances of hyperglycemia. If we assess the trend of blood sugar level, preoperatively and at the time of induction both the groups had almost equal blood sugar levels, the difference was statistically insignificant. After &#x000bd; hr of induction, at the time of the end of anesthesia and after 1 h of the end of anesthesia, Group I had significantly increased blood sugar level than total i.v. Group II. Maximum blood sugar level was found at the end of surgery in Group I patients. In Group II patients, blood sugar level was found almost similar that showed minimal effect of propofol and fentanyl on blood sugar level. The study showed that sevoflurane caused the significant rise of blood sugar level in head injury patients. If we observe <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, it depicts no significant change of GCS in both the group of patients at preoperative, at the end of anesthesia, and postoperative period. Therefore, now we can conclude that while sevoflurane caused the significant rise of blood sugar level in Group I patients, this rise was not sufficient to change in GCS of patients at preoperative, at the end of anesthesia, and 1 h after extubation period.</p><p>Saho <italic>et al</italic>. (1997)[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] investigated the effects of two different concentrations of sevoflurane, 0.4 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) and 1.0 MAC, on insulin secretion before, during, and after sevoflurane anesthesia and concluded that sevoflurane anesthesia has a rapidly reversible inhibitory effect on basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, as do other inhaled anesthetics, and might induce insulin resistance. Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] compared the dose-dependent effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia on glucose tolerance and concluded that sevoflurane anesthesia impairs glucose tolerance to the same degree as does isoflurane anesthesia. Glucose intolerance during sevoflurane or isoflurane anesthesia is independent of agent and dosage up to 1.5 MAC. We have used sevoflurane in the concentration of &#x0003c;3.5% during maintenance and found the same incidence of glucose intolerance. Kitamura <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] examined changes in blood glucose levels in rats undergoing sigmoid colostomy under sevoflurane, sevoflurane/buprenorphine, propofol, and propofol/buprenorphine anesthesia. It was found that during surgery, hyperglycemia was observed under sevoflurane, and sevoflurane/buprenorphine anesthesia, but blood glucose levels were relatively stable under propofol and propofol/buprenorphine anesthesia. These studies have similar results and support our study. Ishii <italic>et al</italic>. (2002)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in their experiment on rats found that propofol suppresses glucose metabolism in the brain and possess neuroprotective properties in cerebral ischemia. Vandersteene <italic>et al</italic>. (1998)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found no changes in lactate and glucose metabolism during propofol anesthesia in man. Fentanyl is known to cause suppression of stress response; therefore, it is supposed to be the choice for head injury patients as it may not cause the rise of blood sugar during the perioperative period. Ellis and Steward[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] retrospectively analyzed that fentanyl dosage is associated with reduced blood glucose in pediatric patients after cardiopulmonary bypass. Verma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found no significant difference in the baseline intra-operative and postoperative blood sugar values during propofol anesthesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Bent <italic>et al</italic>. (1984)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concluded that the administration of high dose fentanyl has little effect on the established metabolic response to surgery, therefore, no significant differences in blood glucose values were found. As seen in earlier studies, propofol has very little impact on blood sugar level. That is the reason of blood sugar level in Group II was found stable.</p><p>Hyperglycemia is expected as a result of stress response to head injury. In our study, we compared any rise in intra-operative blood sugar with the preoperative value, it is, therefore, assumed that at the time of taking preoperative blood sugar sample, the stress response, and consequent rise of blood sugar were already &#x0201c;set-in&#x0201d; and the sample under consideration was representing raised blood sugar level. We did not observe any abnormal rise of blood glucose. There was a time difference between the event of head injury and operation. In majority of cases, it was few hours. Liu-DeRyke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] findings from their study suggest a glucose level &#x02265;160 mg/dl within the first 24 h of admission following TBI is associated with poor outcome irrespective of severity of injury.</p><p>In order to maintain normal level of blood glucose, i.v. solutions containing glucose were avoided during perioperative period, and the normal saline infusion was given in our study.</p><p>Manorama[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that general anesthesia decreases the stress response to injury. We, therefore, presume that the observation of preoperative blood sugar itself showed a raised level of blood sugar in response to cortisol and other glucocorticoid mediated glucogenesis.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It can now be explained that no rise of blood sugar was seen after induction of general anesthesia using propofol and fentanyl in Group II patients.</p><p>Continuous hemodynamic monitoring allowed us to identify and quantify all episodes of various intra-operative and postoperative complications. Hypotension and bradycardia were more common with Group II where propofol was used while nausea and vomiting were more common with Group I where sevoflurane was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>An inhalational group where sevoflurane was used causes an increase in blood sugar in head injury patients in comparison total intravenous anesthesia group where propofol was used. However, this increase of blood sugar level was insufficient to cause a change in GCS scale of patients. Sevoflurane causes more incidence of nausea and vomiting, and propofol causes more incidence of hypotension and bradycardia.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and
