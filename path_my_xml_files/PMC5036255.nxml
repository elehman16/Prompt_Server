As part of the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of arthroscopic surgery for FAI syndrome, we developed a protocol for non-operative care and evaluated its feasibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In phase one, we developed a protocol for non-operative care for FAI in the UK National Health Service (NHS), through a process of systematic review and consensus gathering. In phase two, the protocol was tested in an internal pilot RCT for protocol adherence and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The final protocol, called Personalised Hip Therapy (PHT), consists of four core components led by physiotherapists: detailed patient assessment, education and advice, help with pain relief and an exercise-based programme that is individualised, supervised and progressed over time. PHT is delivered over 12&#x02013;26&#x02005;weeks in 6&#x02013;10 physiotherapist-patient contacts, supplemented by a home exercise programme. In the pilot RCT, 42 patients were recruited and 21 randomised to PHT. Review of treatment case report forms, completed by physiotherapists, showed that 13 patients (62%) received treatment that had closely followed the PHT protocol. 13 patients reported some muscle soreness at 6&#x02005;weeks, but there were no serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PHT provides a structure for the non-operative care of FAI and offers guidance to clinicians and researchers in an evolving area with limited evidence. PHT was deliverable within the National Health Service, is safe, and now forms the comparator to arthroscopic surgery in the UK FASHIoN trial (ISRCTN64081839).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN 09754699.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hip</kwd><kwd>Exercise rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Orthopaedics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health Technology Assessment Programme</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000664</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10/41/02</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Trainees Coordinating Centre</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000659</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR-RP-011-015</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is a motion-related clinical hip disorder with a triad of symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It represents a symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> Typically, the morphology of the hip exhibits shapes that predispose to impingement, often described with the terms cam and pincer morphology.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The epidemiology of cam and pincer morphology is not well defined but may be present in 30% of the general population.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Not all patients with cam and/or pincer morphology develop FAI syndrome,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but the treatment of those who do is controversial. Over the past 10&#x02005;years, increasing numbers of patients have been treated for FAI syndrome with shape changing surgery, most frequently through hip arthroscopy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Surgery has been shown to provide improvements in patient symptoms,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> although patient expectations are not always met.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>It has been suggested that clinicians should be cautious in the use of surgery for FAI syndrome and that non-operative approaches should be considered.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Patients with FAI syndrome have altered hip muscle strength, range of motion (ROM) and gait biomechanics, and these offer potential targets for treatment through physiotherapy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> While many authors recognise the likely value of non-operative or conservative care, there is very little published guidance and evidence on how this care should be delivered.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Given the uncertainty and lack of evidence about treatment for FAI syndrome, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing hip arthroscopy and conservative care was proposed to guide future practice.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In 2012, the UK National Institute of Health Research (UK NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (HTA) commissioned us to perform a feasibility and pilot study for an RCT to compare hip arthroscopy with &#x02018;best conservative care&#x02019; for patients with FAI syndrome (FASHIoN HTA10/41/02).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At the time, there was no established &#x02018;best conservative care&#x02019;,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and we are not aware of any that has been published since. To design this trial, we needed to develop a suitable conservative care protocol.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop an agreed conservative treatment protocol for patients with FAI syndrome that was deliverable within the UK National Health Service (NHS), was safe, and that could be used in the planned RCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Research ethical approval was granted for this study (NHSREC11/WM/0389). In phase one, a non-operative treatment protocol for FAI syndrome was developed using established consensus methodology, guided by the principles described by the Medical Research Council for development of complex interventions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In phase two, the protocol was tested in an internal pilot RCT comparing conservative care versus arthroscopic hip surgery for FAI.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

The core study group oversaw protocol development and provided the input required for consensus by nominal group technique.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The use of this consensus methodology is reasonable given the lack of an established conservative care protocol.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>To form the Delphi study group, we took a targeted approach to sampling, using networks of physiotherapists most likely to be involved in the management of FAI syndrome. National advertisements were placed in the orthopaedic, rheumatology, pain and manual therapy electronic networks of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (iCSP) and in the magazine of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, <italic>Frontline</italic>. The advertisements invited physiotherapists to help develop a consensus for a conservative care protocol for FAI syndrome. Electronic invitations were also sent to physiotherapists in the USA and Australia known to the authors through previous collaborative work on FAI syndrome. To encourage a process of &#x02018;snowball sampling&#x02019;, physiotherapists were encouraged to invite colleagues with experience and interest in managing FAI syndrome to join the consensus development process.</p><p>A systematic review was conducted to identify any previously published protocols for conservative treatment of FAI syndrome.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The first protocol was drafted using evidence gathered from this systematic review and was circulated via email to the Delphi study group. They completed a questionnaire asking whether they agreed or disagreed with the proposed protocol, and where appropriate provide comments and suggestions for improvement. Additional comments and treatment strategies were grouped into themes and tabulated. An agreement level of 50% for this Delphi consensus technique was used. If no consensus was evident, the core study group refined the protocol in the light of the feedback using a nominal group technique. The refined protocol was then recirculated to the Delphi group and the cycle repeated until a consensus of at least 50% was achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Phase 1: patient panel</title><p>As part of the FASHIoN feasibility trial, a qualitative research study among an expert patient panel was undertaken to guide many aspects of the development of the RCT.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> One task for the panel was to name the conservative treatment arm of the RCT. Previous qualitative research has highlighted the importance of naming treatments in order to improve uptake and adherence with treatment, in particular within the context of RCTs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Further details of this qualitative research can be found in Griffin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Phase 2: protocol testing and refinement</title><p>Once adequate consensus on the conservative care protocol was reached, the protocol was implemented within a multicentre internal pilot RCT comparing arthroscopic surgery versus conservative care (FASHIoN feasibility study ISRCTN09754699).

Two physiotherapists were Band 6, six Band 7, and two Band 8; NHS bands reflect seniority, ranging from a newly qualified physiotherapist at Band 5 to the most senior and experienced physiotherapist at Band 8. They had previously treated a mean of 30 (range 3&#x02013;90) patients with FAI syndrome. Of the 42 patients recruited in the pilot RCT, 21 were allocated to PHT. On average, PHT started 38 (range 12&#x02013;76) days after randomisation, reflecting physiotherapy service waiting times in the NHS. Patients attended a mean of six sessions (SD 2.3). Treatment was judged to have been delivered in line with the PHT protocol in 13 (62%) patients. Reasons for deviation from the protocol included immediate postrandomisation crossover (n=1), patient decided they no longer required treatment (n=1), no CRF received (n=2) and insufficient number of treatment sessions (n=5). Clinical outcomes are not reported from this internal pilot RCT due to the ongoing nature of the full RCT where pilot data will be included in the main analysis (FASHION ISCTRN64081839).

<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> PHT has many similarities to other non-operative treatment regimens including the EULAR and OARSI guidelines on hip and knee osteoarthritis. These also recommend a comprehensive assessment, education, lifestyle modification and exercise-based programme.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, these guidelines were unable to make specific exercise recommendations for hip OA due to a lack of evidence, although a mixed regime (quadriceps strengthening, aerobic capacity and flexibility training) was recommended in knee osteoarthritis by EULAR.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>As well as including aspects in common with other non-operative care protocols of hip disorders, PHT includes an exercise-based programme that aims to improve deficiencies in hip function (including muscle weaknesses and ROM) that have been highlighted in FAI syndrome.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Through an individualised exercise-based programme, physiotherapists using PHT are able to target these deficiencies. A recent editorial highlighted what might be included in a non-operative care protocol for FAI syndrome.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> PHT includes all of these points, including hip-specific function and lower limb strengthening, core stability and postural balance exercises.</p><p>During the pilot RCT, only 62% of PHT treatments were judged to closely follow the protocol. This raises questions about the deliverability of PHT in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019;. However, some of the reasons for deviation were teething problems to be expected in a pilot trial. These included an immediate postrandomisation crossover (n=1), no completed CRF available (n=2) and an insufficient number of treatment sessions (n=5); in some circumstances, this may reflect patient improvement, resulting in discharge prior to receiving six sessions. Compliance with home exercises can be problematic;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> but physiotherapists were able to use an exercise diary to monitor patient adherence to the exercise programme at home and did not report any concerns. Muscle soreness was reported in 62% of patients, 6&#x02005;weeks into the PHT programme. This is to be expected as part of an exercise-based regime as the muscles adapt to the increased demand. Reassuringly, this had resolved in all cases by 3&#x02005;months follow-up. This is in keeping with similar exercise-based interventions used in RCTs for other musculoskeletal conditions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref> On balance, we believe that the results from the pilot RCT show that PHT is safe and deliverable in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019; of the NHS. The overall fidelity of PHT is similar to other conservative care protocols used in RCTs,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> so it is also suitable for use in the planned pragmatic RCT.</p><p>Limitations of the PHT protocol include that it was developed based on the experiences of clinicians treating patients with FAI syndrome and not by targeting the deficiencies, observed in patients with FAI syndrome, reported in the literature.</p><p>Where conservative treatment of FAI syndrome is advocated, PHT gives clinicians a protocol for content and delivery. We do not yet know how effective PHT will be&#x02014;only that it is based on the published literature, represents a consensus among experienced physiotherapists on &#x02018;best conservative care&#x02019;, and that it has at least been tested in a pilot trial and found to be deliverable and safe. Following this successful pilot RCT, the effectiveness of PHT versus arthroscopic surgery is being tested in the full UK FASHIoN trial (ISCTRN64081839), where the outcome measures are hip-related quality of life (iHOT33), general health (SF12 and EQ5D) and health economics.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages&#x000a0;</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is increasingly recognised as a source of hip pain, especially in young adults.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A period of non-operative care is recommended, although this is poorly defined.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A protocol for a physiotherapy-led package of education, exercise and pain relieving techniques for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome called Personalised Hip Therapy is described for use in an RCT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The package of care is deliverable within the UK National Health Service, is safe, and is acceptable to patients.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>The FASHIoN feasibility trial, which was published in the <italic>Health Technology Assessment</italic> Journal (Griffin DR, Wall PD, Realpe A, <italic>et al</italic>.
