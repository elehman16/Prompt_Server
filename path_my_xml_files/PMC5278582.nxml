The present study tested the hypothesis that an intraosseous injection of OIGFs and application of LIPUS for 4 weeks can enhance OIRR repair by decreasing root resorption volume and by increasing cementum thickness, which may be interpreted as regaining resorbed root volume. In orthodontics, a complication of tooth movement is root resorption, also known as apical root resorption, which is an injury resulting from pressure applied to tooth roots during orthodontic treatment. This continuous orthodontic pressure stimulates the activity of resorbing cells, known as osteoclasts, and increases the possibility of shortening the tooth root.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Although it is important to analyze the whole tooth root when considering root resorption, focus should be placed on damage to the apical third of the root, since resorbing of dental cementum in this location leads to this root shortening.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, the present study employed bodily tooth movement with the intention of homogeneously distributing orthodontic force along the tooth root. Although this type of tooth movement is better at uniformly applying pressure in a more diffuse and less concentrated manner, there will always be some degree of tipping movement, which tends to concentrate forces on apical and cervical regions and is more associated with apical root resorption.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Therefore, it is expected in the present study that more root resorption would have resulted near the apex, but not to the extent as it would have been if tipping movement was used.</p><p>This study first measured root resorption lacunae on tooth roots in every treatment group. The sums of resorption lacunae on each root were then used in comparing root resorption volumes in each treatment group in order to determine the possible effect of treatment on reducing this volume. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the OIGF group had the greatest root resorption volume in fourth premolars but the least root resorption volume in third premolars. The OIGF + LIPUS group had the least lacunae volume in fourth premolars but the least root resorption volume in third premolars. However, each of these groups was not significantly different from one another.</p><p>Because this study did not include pretreatment measurements of cementum thickness, the Levene's test of equal variance was performed to determine differences within each population of third and fourth premolars in the control group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows that there was no difference within populations of third and fourth premolars in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). This conclusion can be used in place of baseline measurements to analyze the effect of treatment on tooth roots.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows that, although on third premolars cementum thickness was greatest in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at the middle level on both compression and tension sides, the OIGF + LIPUS group had the greatest cementum thickness compared to the other groups at the apical level on both sides of the root. However, this group was not significantly different from the other treatment groups.</p><p>During this experiment, the intention was to move third premolars mesially and fourth premolars distally. However, fourth premolars were prevented from moving distally as much as expected due to the first molars being distal and more proximal to the fourth premolars than the second premolars were to the third premolars. Because of this, fourth premolars would have decreased compression and tension sides compared to the third premolars, and it is reasonable to expect different results from treatments on fourth premolars. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that OIGF + LIPUS groups on the compression side of fourth premolar roots resulted in the thinnest cementum at each root level; however, this difference was not statistically significant at the middle level and near the apex. LIPUS treatment appeared to have greater effect on increasing cementum thickness on the tension side of fourth premolar roots; however, this difference was only significant compared to the OIGF + LIPUS group at the middle root level.</p><p>It is interesting to note that BMP-2 increased cementum thickness at each root level on both sides of the fourth premolar root in comparison to the OIGF + LIPUS group. Our results are in agreement with a previous study that showed that the application of BMP-2 to tooth root defects resulted in cementum-like tissue formation compared to control root defects.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Upon analysis of the results, it was speculated that some tooth roots treated with BMP-2 may have been cross-contaminated by treatment with LIPUS because some LIPUS-treated roots were located immediately beside BMP-2-treated roots. To investigate this speculation, root resorption volume and cementum thickness (at each root level on compression and tension sides) were compared among BMP-2-treated roots located immediate to LIPUS-treated roots and BMP-2-treated roots not beside roots receiving LIPUS treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows that there was no significant difference in resorption volume between third premolars with the possibility of cross-contamination and third premolars without cross-contamination, and between fourth premolars with the possibility of cross-contamination and fourth premolars without cross-contamination. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows that BMP-2-treated tooth roots with possible cross-contamination of LIPUS had thinner cementum at almost all root levels compared to those roots without cross-contamination, however, no statistically significant differences were calculated. Sant'Anna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> the effect of LIPUS applied in combination with BMP-2 treatment on the expression of genes associated with osteogenesis in rat stromal cells. They found that there was no additive or synergistic effect of the combination of these two treatments. Because in the present study, the exposure of LIPUS treatment on BMP-2-treated tooth roots was only through possible cross-contamination, it may be possible that this LIPUS exposure was at a lower intensity compared to direct application as in LIPUS- and OIGF + LIPUS-treated roots due to slight dissipation of LIPUS through tissue. Direct application of LIPUS to BMP-2-treated roots at a higher intensity or using more optimal levels may lead to a synergistic effect, but it may be possible that in the present study this continual and decreased exposure may have had a negative effect of BMP-2 on cementum thickness. It is suspected that, if possible cross-contamination of LIPUS on BMP-2-treated roots was absent, the overall effect of this treatment on cementum thickness may have been significantly greater than what is demonstrated in the present study.</p><p>Similarly, it was also suspected that LIPUS cross-contaminated OIGF-treated tooth roots. The possibility of cross-contamination of LIPUS on these tooth roots appears to have had a positive effect on OIGF treatment on resorption volume, but these differences are statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>]. This figure demonstrates that possibly-contaminated OIGF-treated roots had greater cementum thickness at the apical third of the root on the both sides of third and fourth premolars with a significant difference calculated on the compression side of third premolars. El-Bialy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] investigated the difference between human and dogs' gingival mesenchymal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study demonstrated that canine gingival mesenchymal cells (CGMCs) responded differently than human gingival mesenchymal cells (HGMCs) when both types of cells were grown in osteogenic medium and received LIPUS treatment for 1 day. Extensive research has been performed to show the anabolic effect of LIPUS on different types of cells, including gingival cells,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] however, research performed on CGMCs is limited. El-Bialy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that it may be possible that CGMCs require alternative parameters of LIPUS treatment, such as intensity and length of exposure, compared to parameters used currently in the treatment of HGMCs. This may explain the overall decreased effect of OIGF and OIGF + LIPUS treatment.</p><p>Future studies should not allocate different treatments to neighboring teeth in order to avoid the possibility of cross-contamination of treatments, especially those that can dissipate through tissues, such as ultrasound. This study also did not biologically track the injected OIGFs. Biologically labelling these cells would allow tracking of these cells to be determined and to know whether or not if these cells became incorporated into the target tissue and used in tissue repair. Finally, the present study used identical ultrasound application parameters that are used in studies involving human gingival cells. Future studies may also be directed to understanding the possible mechanisms, of which OIGF, LIPUS and BMP2 might be involved in repairing OITRR and possible interrelationship between these mechanisms for possible optimum combination of these treatment modalities in treating/prevention of OITRR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study showed that OIGF, LIPUS, and BMP-2 may have a possible effect on the repair of OIRR, however, more optimal parameters of ultrasound use and improved experimental design are required in order to further investigate this effect.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Qatar National Research Fund, NPRP grant number NPRP No. 09-557-3 &#x02013; 144.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cwyk</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Scat-Pierre</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Tronstad</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Endodontic implications of orthodontic tooth movement</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>1984</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>Abstract1039</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mirabella</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Artun</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and severity of apical root resorption of maxillary anterior teeth in adult orthodontic patients</article-title><source>Eur J Orthod</source><year>1995</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>93</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7781726</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Harry</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Root resorption in bicuspid intrusion.
