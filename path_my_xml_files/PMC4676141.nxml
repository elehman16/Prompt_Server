The study was initiated before this investigational treatment was licensed and conducted in real-world clinical practice to consider adherence, co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and real-world factors.

Eligible patients are recruited for the study in GPs&#x02019; offices. At visit 1, patients are offered study participation through written consent. At visit 2 (0&#x02013;30 days after visit 1), patients are randomised 1:1 to receive FF/VI or continue on usual asthma maintenance therapy (ICS or ICS/LABA). The randomisation at visit 2 is stratified by Asthma Control Test (ACT) score (&#x02265;20, 16 to 19, or &#x02264;15) and by previous asthma maintenance therapy (ICS or ICS/LABA). Patients randomised to continue their existing asthma maintenance therapy arm do not receive FF/VI. During the study, the doses of all medication may be adjusted at the GP&#x02019;s discretion in the usual way. Both study groups receive free prescriptions for study medication, which is collected by the patients from local community pharmacies, and prescription data are captured on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participating sites</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary care</title><p>To preserve the real-world nature of the study, the patient experience is as close to routine care as possible. The study&#x02019;s principal investigators are the patients&#x02019; own GPs who may make treatment adjustments according to their clinical opinion. GPs make repeat prescriptions of study medication as usual, which are collected by patients from their usual pharmacy. GPs are ideally placed to facilitate recruitment, identify and report serious adverse events (SAEs) or serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and report study endpoints. As very few participating GPs had experience of clinical trial participation, all GPs have received training and support in GCP, patient recruitment, the study protocol, coding of healthcare issues and general research procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pharmacy</title><p>Every pharmacy in Salford and others in South Manchester have agreed to participate in the study, even though very few of the pharmacists had experience of clinical trial participation. Standard operating procedures were established, and more than 500 staff at participating pharmacies have received training in GCP and safety reporting. Initially pharmacies faxed copies of all prescriptions for collected study treatments to the study coordination centre, but as the trial progressed this has been collected electronically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Hospitals</title><p>The large majority of admissions are to the local Salford Royal Hospital and the University Hospital of South Manchester where admissions are tracked electronically and in near-real time.

From primary care, all healthcare contacts, out-of-hours activity and prescriptions of antibiotics or oral steroids can be identified. These events are reviewed by the study research team and classified as asthma or non-asthma related. Furthermore, the EMR captures suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (e.g. reduced kidney function or elevated liver function tests) and, for the purposes of SLS, includes data from external sources to identify, for example, deaths or National Health Service (NHS) hospital admissions outside Salford.

However, RCTs for registration purposes do not represent real life. Multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that only a small proportion of patients with asthma (~5&#x000a0;%) are represented in DBRCTs, and patients with co-morbidities are excluded. In addition, only restricted outcomes are assessed (e.g. forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second), and studies are of short duration (&#x0003c;6&#x000a0;months). Finally, patients are closely monitored and inhaler technique repeatedly checked, so that adherence levels exceed 90&#x000a0;%, compared with less than 40&#x000a0;% in observational studies.</p><p>Although observational studies provide opportunities to assess real-world outcomes, the lack of suitable comparison between treatment groups and the small patient numbers in prospective trials can be limiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, the true impact and value of treatments for asthma may not be fully reflected by observational studies and DBRCTs.</p><p>The SLS is the first phase III pRCT study in asthma initiated while the investigational treatment was an un-licensed medicine, where supervision and monitoring of patients are reduced to a minimum. Clinical endpoints are collected and patient safety is guaranteed with remote clinical surveillance in near to real-time through the EMR. The study should provide evidence for prescribers, payers and healthcare providers to assess effectiveness, adherence levels and the true value of FF/VI treatment in the real world.</p><p>The primary endpoint, ACT, was chosen to reflect impact of treatments on patients&#x02019; overall asthma control. The rate of severe asthma exacerbations as a primary endpoint would not have been feasible due to the infrequent occurrence of such events in a general asthma population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; consequently, the number of eligible patients with asthma in the study population is insufficient to have adequate statistical power for an exacerbation study. However, although ACT may reflect a dimension of asthma that is different from exacerbations, it is not merely a proxy for exacerbations.</p><p>This pRCT has been a major challenge in study design, operational planning and study support. It has been possible because the SLS is focused on a single geographical area in the UK, with a stable population with high respiratory morbidity, and where healthcare is managed by the NHS. Salford and the surrounding area are unique in having a longstanding EMR connecting primary and secondary care together with local pharmacies. The extent to which these data will be transferable will depend on local health service provision, but SLS should provide a model for future assessments of the clinical effectiveness of new treatments.</p><p>In summary, data from the SLS will complement results from conventional registration trials, allowing a better understanding of the risk/benefit profile of the FF/VI combination in the wider community of patients with asthma.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Asthma Control Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADR</term><def><p>Adverse drug reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQLQ</term><def><p>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBRCT</term><def><p>Double-blind randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPI</term><def><p>Dry-powder inhaler</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eCRF</term><def><p>Electronic case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMR</term><def><p>Electronic medical record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>EuroQol questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FF</term><def><p>Fluticasone furoate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Long-acting inhaled corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABA</term><def><p>Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MARS-A</term><def><p>Medication Adherence Report Scale for Asthma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pRCT</term><def><p>pragmatic randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLS</term><def><p>Salford Lung Study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VI</term><def><p>Vilanterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WPAI</term><def><p>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>NDB&#x02019;s employing organisation provides IT support to GlaxoSmithKline.
