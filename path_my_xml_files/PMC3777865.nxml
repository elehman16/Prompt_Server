Treatment completion rates were higher among prospective than historical patients (82.1% vs. 65.1%), primarily due to lower abandonment rates. Rates of ADEs were lower among prospective than historical patients (56.8% vs. 66.9%). Twice-weekly evaluations increased identification of mild ADEs, prompting higher suspension rates than weekly evaluations. While twice-weekly evaluations identified ADEs earlier, they did not reduce incidence of moderate or severe ADEs. Many dermatologic ADEs were moderately severe upon presentation (35.6%), were not reduced by use of antihistamines, occurred among adult patients of all ages, and occurred throughout treatment, rather than the first few weeks alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intensive management improved completion and identified more ADEs, but did not reduce moderate or severe ADEs.

To determine the utility of pill counts and frequent monitoring to improve treatment completion and reduce ADEs, this study randomized Bolivian adults with chronic Chagas disease to either weekly or twice-weekly clinical evaluations during treatment with 60 days of benznidazole. Patient outcomes were compared to a historical cohort of patients previously treated at the same hospital with less-rigorous follow-up. This study demonstrated associations between increased follow-up and improved treatment completion, reduced ADEs, earlier documentation of ADEs, and pretreatment factors associated with benznidazole toxicity. It also validated pill-counts and demonstrated feasibility of phone-based clinical evaluations among rural Bolivians.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Fogarty International Clinical Scholars Program and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine INSPIRE Program.

Chagas disease is caused by a vector-borne parasite, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, and is responsible for an estimated 430,000 DALYs lost and a cost of $1.2 billion in lost productivity each year <xref rid="pntd.0002407-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Approximately 30% of infected adults eventually develop cardiac disease, but treatment may slow disease progression and decrease mortality <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Bern1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002407-Maguire1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Fortunately, expanded vector control since 2000 has dramatically reduced infestation rates, opening the door for antiparasitic treatment.</p><p>Current evidence supports treatment of adults without advanced cardiac disease or significant comorbidity using either benznidazole or nifurtimox <xref rid="pntd.0002407-MarinNeto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Viotti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Benznidazole is better-tolerated, but between intermittent shortages and drug rashes including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, many rural Bolivians fail to complete treatment. Frequent provider interactions and direct adherence monitoring have improved outcomes in other diseases, but have not been evaluated in Chagas disease <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. To determine the utility of pill counts and frequent monitoring to improve treatment completion and reduce adverse drug events (ADEs), we conducted a prospective cohort study of Bolivian adults treated with benznidazole for chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Johns Hopkins University, CEADES Salud y Medio Ambiente, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Asociaci&#x000f3;n Beneficia PRISMA.

The decision to initiate treatment was made by hospital physicians independent of the study, who referred patients to investigators for this monitoring protocol. After written informed consent, patients were assigned either weekly clinic visits (weekly evaluations) or weekly clinic visits plus mid-week phone calls (twice-weekly evaluations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002407-g001">Figure 1</xref>) by random number generator. Medication adherence and ADEs were assessed using structured questionnaires. Three patients randomized to twice-weekly evaluations had no phone, so mid-week evaluations were conducted as home visits. Patients reporting ADEs by phone were asked to report immediately to clinic. Treatment suspension and ADE management decisions were made by treating physicians, independent of study investigators. Adherent patients without complications underwent 11 in-clinic evaluations: 1 pre-treatment evaluation, 9 weekly evaluations, and 1 post-treatment evaluation. Random subsets of each group were assigned electronic pill bottles recording time and date of opening [Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS), Aardex Group, Zug, Switzerland]. As we were not evaluating drug efficacy, there was no placebo group.

When tests were discordant, a recombinant <italic>T. cruzi</italic> ELISA (Weiner laboratory, Rosario Argentina) served as tiebreaker. Inclusion criteria were age 18&#x02013;60 years, residence &#x0003c;30 minutes from Punata Hospital, no renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease, no household vector infestation by self-report, and no upcoming travel plans. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, residence &#x0003e;30 minutes from Punata Hospital, planned travel during treatment, and inability to attend clinic visits. As the area near Punata Hospital had recently been fumigated, excluding patients living &#x0003e;30 minutes away reduced the likelihood of vector infestation. Patients reporting active infestation were reported to the local vector control agency and became eligible for treatment after repeat fumigation. A study physician reviewed charts for pretreatment gastrointestinal disease and characterized patients by New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification according to standard definitions of cardiac disease without functional limitation in ordinary activity (Class I), mild dyspnea or angina with slight limitation of ordinary activity (Class II), marked limitation of ordinary activity such as walking 100 meters but no symptoms at rest (Class III), or symptoms at rest (Class IV).

This study showed similar MEMS&#x02013;pill count and MEMS&#x02013;self-report correlations as European and American studies associating MEMS data with improved clinical outcomes <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Winkler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002407-Namkoong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Improved MEMS&#x02013;pill count correlation with longer inter-visit intervals suggests that over-distribution pill counts can be reliably employed over standard monitoring intervals.</p><p>Prospective patients had similar completion rates to urban Spanish and Argentinian specialty clinics (82.1% vs. 83.8% and 70%, respectively), all of whom performed better than the historical cohort <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Pinazo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002407-SosaEstani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Phone-based controls were reliable, took under 1/4<sup>th</sup> the provider time of clinic visits, and saved patients travel time. Most prospective patients had phone access (85.2%), network coverage was widely available, and cellular phone-based controls cost providers an average of $0.63, though landline-based controls were significantly less expensive. Despite similar completion rates, twice-weekly patients were more likely to complete treatment on schedule than weekly patients (data not shown), suggesting a role for phone encounters in poorly adherent patients.</p><p>ADEs were common and detected more frequently among twice-weekly than weekly patients. Overall ADE rates among prospective patients were similar to published European rates (56.8% vs. 57%), but dermatologic ADEs were less frequent (36.4% vs. 42&#x02013;51%) <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Pinazo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002407-SosaEstani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Gastrointestinal ADEs were more frequent in this study than in Spain (34.0% vs. 15%), while rates of neurologic ADEs were similar (29.8% vs. 27.6%) <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Pinazo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moderate ADE rates were similar between prospective and historical cohorts, but were identified earlier among twice-weekly than weekly patients. This suggests that frequent encounters may over-sensitize providers to mild reactions, resulting in premature treatment suspension and lower completion rates.</p><p>Higher suspension rates among twice-weekly patients reflect the difficulty of differentiating localized (mild) from generalized, desquamating reactions (moderate) at the time of presentation. When drug rashes are identified, antihistamines should be initiated. Those with mild reactions will improve within days, and those that worsen despite antihistamines will require treatment suspension. Antihistamines did not prevent the progression of mild rashes to moderate severity, but were prescribed more frequently to patients whose reactions eventually progressed. This may be due to characteristics of greater concern to providers that were not captured by our categorization.</p><p>Predicting ADEs remains difficult. Traditional beliefs that older age, higher dose, and alcohol consumption are risk factors for severe drug reactions were not upheld by this study. Prospective and historical patients had similar rates of moderate ADEs, which were not associated with age in either cohort. Mild ADES were detected with greater frequency in the prospective cohort, especially among those with twice-weekly follow-up. There appeared to be more complete reporting of mild ADEs in older than in younger patients in the historical cohort. Suboptimal dosing was not associated with reduced ADEs in our data, consistent with new data showing no link between higher serum benznidazole concentration and ADEs <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Pinazo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Variables significantly associated with ADEs&#x02013;female sex, cardiac disease, proximity to clinic, and sun sensitivity&#x02013;should be accounted for in treatment and monitoring decisions. While dermatologic ADEs are classically described during the first 3 weeks, we found a continued risk throughout treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002407-SosaEstani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A similar study of patients treated with nifurtimox reported ADEs in 97.5% of patients; 7.4% had severe ADEs, and only 56.2% completed treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This study's higher completion rates and decreased frequency of ADEs confirm benznidazole as the preferred drug regimen for treatment of Chagas disease <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Bern1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>This study had several important limitations. Dedicated staff allowed clinicians to monitor ADE progression more closely than in routine practice. Completion rates may have been increased by &#x0201c;treating through&#x0201d; reactions that might otherwise have led to suspension. Exclusion of patients living &#x0003e;30 minutes from clinic may have also selected for prospective patients less likely to abandon treatment. Completion rates may have been affected by MEMS use, which measures bottle opening, rather than consumption. MEMS data and pill counts would ideally be compared to biomarkers or clinical outcomes, but no assay for serum benznidazole levels was available for routine use during this investigation, and no practical test of cure currently exists for chronic Chagas disease.</p><p>Conclusions from this study may not be generalizable to children. Children have fewer benznidazole-induced ADEs than adults, and older children have more frequent ADEs than younger children <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Altcheh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. By restricting this study to adults, we may have missed the appropriate age-based risk categories.</p><p>Clinically, this study did not employ the Kuschnir classification or Rassi risk score <xref rid="pntd.0002407-Rassi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0002407-Viotti3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. These tools require results from chest radiography and echocardiography, which are not routinely employed for Chagas disease at Punata Hospital. Patients at Punata Hospital are likely similar to other rural Latin Americans, but neglecting these standardized classifications may limit comparison of our cardiac data to other populations.</p><p>Finally, the focus on treatment completion presumes a benefit that is not yet fully understood. A large, randomized trial is currently underway to evaluate the clinical efficacy of benznidazole treatment on cardiac disease, morbidity, and mortality <xref rid="pntd.0002407-MarinNeto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Pending those results, this study cannot demonstrate improved long-term clinical outcomes, only improved management of patients undergoing current standard of care.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Summary and Recommendations</title><p>Adults with Chagas disease treated with benznidazole can safely achieve high completion rates with close patient follow-up in rural Bolivia. Programs should employ over-distribution pill counts to identify poor adherence, and phone-based encounters should be considered if resources do not allow for frequent in-person evaluation. More frequent evaluations identify more ADEs but are associated with higher suspension rates. Consideration should be paid to higher odds of dermatologic ADEs among female patients, those with ECG changes, and those with prior allergies or sun sensitivity. While severe dermatologic ADEs are rare, patients must be screened for ADEs throughout the entire treatment course, not only the first few weeks. Mild side effects can be managed with antihistamines and proton pump inhibitors, but medications should not be expected to reduce ADE severity or improve completion. The most important clinical intervention for moderate or severe ADEs is withdrawal of the offending medication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0002407-World1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organization (2010) First WHO Report on Neglected Tropical Diseases: Working to Overcome the Global Impact of Neglected Tropical Diseases.
