The fatigue management strategies most frequently used since attending FACETS were prioritisation (80%), pacing (78%), saying no to others (78%), grading tasks (75%) and challenging unhelpful thoughts (71%). Adding in those participants who were already using the respective strategies prior to FACETS, the three most used strategies at 4&#x02005;months were prioritisation (55/59), grading (54/59) and pacing (53/58). Free-text comments illustrated the complex interplay between attitudes/expectations, behaviours, emotions and the environment. Issues related to expectations featured strongly in participants&#x02019; comments. Expectations (from self and others) were both facilitators and barriers to effective fatigue management.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Individuals&#x02019; comments highlighted the complex, multifaceted nature of fatigue management. Revising expectations and a greater acceptance of fatigue were important shifts following the programme. Findings support the relevance of a cognitive behavioural approach for fatigue management.

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidance for MS suggests that health professionals could consider mindfulness therapy, CBT or fatigue management and advise that aerobic balance and stretching exercises including yoga may be helpful in treating MS-related fatigue.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Energy effectiveness approaches focus on using available energy in the most effective way possible; for example, by pacing, planning, grading, delegating, altering one's environment and so on. While such approaches can be moderately helpful<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> there are sometimes attitudinal barriers that stop individuals from applying them to aspects of their own routines and lifestyle. For example, a person might fully understand the rationale behind pacing activities or delegating them, yet not implement such strategies due to a belief that they are a failure unless they take on everything themselves and finish tasks in one go. Similarly, it might be feasible for an individual to change daily routines and schedule regular rests in their day, yet they may feel unable to give themselves &#x02018;permission&#x02019; to do so due to feelings of laziness and/or guilt.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>A cognitive behavioural approach can be helpful in addressing these kinds of complex attitudinal barriers in the self-management of chronic conditions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Cognitive behavioural approaches are concerned with how thoughts, emotions, behaviours and physical and environmental aspects interact.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> They are based on the theory that sometimes changing how we think about a situation influences what we feel and do.

As the aim of this evaluation questionnaire was to gain insights into the strategies people used following the FACETS programme rather than create an outcome measure, a full psychometric evaluation has not been conducted. The format of the FMSQ draws on an existing psychometrically validated questionnaire (The Energy Conservation Strategies Survey).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The FMSQ comprises 14 self-reported questions incorporating a combination of closed and open response formats. The initial draft of the questionnaire was developed by ST and PWT with content informed by findings from our development work.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Development of the questionnaire underwent a number of iterations with feedback from researchers, clinicians and service users. Questions 1&#x02013;11 ask participants whether they have started using 11 specific fatigue management strategies since attending the FACETS programme (namely, (1) pacing, (2) relaxation techniques, (3) changing the way activities are prioritised, (4) grading activities to save energy, (5) delegating activities, (6) planning ahead/organising activities, (7) saying no to others, (8) goal-setting, (9) starting any new exercise activities, (10) making changes to sleep routines and (11) challenging unhelpful thoughts). For strategies tried, participants are asked to rate how helpful they have found them on a 7-point scale (1=not at all helpful; 7=very helpful), and for those not tried, they are asked to indicate reasons why (&#x02018;already doing&#x02019; (this category was not used for questions (9) and (10) as these items specifically asked about whether changes had been made), &#x02018;forgot to try&#x02019;, &#x02018;didn't think would help&#x02019;, &#x02018;unsure how to do&#x02019;, &#x02018;other; please specify&#x02019;). Results from individual items will not be combined except to count the total number of strategies used by participants.</p><p>The second part of the questionnaire consists of a number of items using a free-text response format and asks participants to describe any (1) changes made to their lifestyle, attitudes or expectations since attending the FACETS programme (reflecting key aims of FACETS identified from our development work); (2) barriers to change or difficulties encountered; (3) fatigue management strategies that they had found helpful but that were not covered in the programme. We also asked respondents if they had been in contact with other group members since the FACETS programme.</p><p>It is important to note that FACETS is a complex and multicomponent intervention and the FMSQ focuses on fatigue management strategies and attitudinal changes but does not specifically ask people about awareness or normalisation of MS-fatigue, the group-based nature of the programme or the homework tasks. The questionnaire is presented in an easy to read font (pt.13.5). The instructions for the questionnaire are as follows:<disp-quote><p>During the fatigue management programme you were taught a number of strategies to help you to make the most of your available energy. We are interested to find out whether you are using any of these strategies, and if so, whether you have found them helpful.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>We are also interested in the reasons why you might have found it difficult to make changes.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The questionnaire was posted to participants 4&#x02005;months after the final session of the FACETS programme. Respondents were asked to return the completed anonymised questionnaire to the trial team using a prepaid return envelope.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analysis</title><p>We collated free-text responses. Quantitative data from the questionnaire were analysed descriptively using frequencies, percentages, medians and ranges.</p><p>An iterative, directed approach to content analysis was used.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> After careful reading and data immersion ST coded all the free-text comments and developed broad categories. These were subsequently revised following discussion with one of the coauthors (PK) and verified by the other coauthors. Respondents&#x02019; comments have been organised based on the cognitive behavioural framework as follows: (1) <italic>what we do</italic> (behaviours); (2) <italic>how we think</italic> (thoughts); (3) <italic>how we feel</italic> (feelings); (4) <italic>our body</italic> (physical); and (5) <italic>our world</italic> (environment).

Successful changes encompassed not only those relating to behaviours (such as pacing) and the environment (such as delegating, grading tasks, using energy saving devices) but also attitudes and emotions (&#x02018;I didn't have to feel guilty&#x02019;; &#x02018;learning to admit to myself that I'm not a failure if I can't do something&#x02019;). Feedback from respondents illustrated the complex interplay between attitudes/expectations, behaviours, emotions, physical aspects and the environment.</p><p>FACETS is a complex intervention involving multiple components to address a complicated symptom. The trial data indicated that the intervention is effective at helping people manage their fatigue. The current paper highlights that people used variable patterns of strategies (differing numbers and combinations) and that the degree to which they were helpful also varied. For example, participants could potentially have started multiple strategies and found only one useful; or started multiple strategies all of which were slightly helpful; or started only one strategy that was very helpful. Interpretation of our observed lack of association between changes in fatigue and use of individual strategies or total number of strategies used is therefore not straightforward and it is perhaps not surprising, given this complexity and the variable patterns of fatigue management that emerged from the data, that no clear associations were evident. Further research is needed to disentangle these complex relationships.</p><p>The theme of expectations featured strongly in respondents&#x02019; comments. Changing expectations by challenging and restructuring unhelpful thoughts is a key tenet of the cognitive behavioural approach.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Revising expectations and becoming more accepting or realistic about one's limits can enable people to give themselves &#x02018;permission&#x02019; to make important lifestyle changes (such as saying no to others, taking rests, delegating responsibilities, pacing activity, adjusting priorities). However, modifying expectations is by no means an easy process with some respondents describing a resistance and reluctance to change, despite recognising potential benefits. A lack of understanding by or unrealistic expectations (or perceived expectations) of others, including family members, were identified as factors making fatigue management challenging. The invisible nature of fatigue and its variability can make it difficult even for family members and close friends to understand<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and this has also been reported in other neurological conditions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>In a cross-sectional questionnaire study Besharat <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> found an association between negative perfectionism and fatigue symptoms in people with MS. Such perfectionism may reflect denial or an attempt to maintain a sense of self and identity in the face of an unpredictable and challenging chronic condition<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and may lead to boom-or-bust patterns of behaviour.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Some of the free-text comments provided by respondents on the FMSQ reflected similar issues. The FACETS programme supports individuals to identify and challenge these kinds of unhelpful and unrealistic expectations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>FACETS is delivered in a group format. In the context of an energy conservation course Matuska <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> noted that the group format enabled participants to share ideas and they were able to give and receive peer support. They found that many groups continued to meet informally following the completion of the course. Similarly in the context of a CB programme for rheumatoid arthritis Dures <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> reported that participants highly valued the group format. We too, have consistently found similar highly positive feedback about the group format from FACETS participants.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Additionally, around 40% of respondents reported some form of contact with other group members following FACETS. However, it must be noted that this feedback does not incorporate the views of those who declined to take part in the FACETS trial. While a group delivered format offers many benefits in terms of peer support and potential cost-effectiveness it does not suit everyone and must be considered as one of a range of interventions for people with MS-fatigue.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>A major strength of this study is that it was nested within a large multicentre pragmatic UK trial. Return rates of the FMSQ were high (82%). However, resource constraints meant that we were unable to conduct any interviews or gather further detail or clarification from respondents. The semistructured questionnaire was administered at 4&#x02005;months follow-up only so we do not have information about participants&#x02019; use of fatigue management strategies in the longer term. Additionally, we acknowledge that more participants at 4&#x02005;months follow-up may have started on disease modifying drugs or had a relapse given that these were exclusion criteria for the trial and would not be occurring at baseline. The majority of participants who completed the questionnaire were not in employment and we note that there may be important differences in relation to employment status in terms of opportunities to apply fatigue management strategies and the nature of the barriers and challenges faced. We also acknowledge the possibility of recall bias (ie, people forgetting strategies they have used) in participants&#x02019; responses to the FMSQ at 4&#x02005;months follow-up.</p><p>There are similarities between the feedback provided by our respondents and individuals who had attended a fatigue management programme for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dures <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> conducted &#x02018;exit&#x02019; focus groups with 38 participants who had attended a group-based cognitive behavioural programme for RA-fatigue. They reported that some people had moved from waiting for an external cure (a &#x02018;magic bullet&#x02019;) to a position of acceptance and understanding of the possibilities of self-help:<disp-quote><p>You might not be able to control the fatigue, you know that's going to be there, it's the feature of this condition but you can control how you manage it.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>When developing FACETS<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and in the current study we found similar shifts in perspectives:<disp-quote><p>Before I used to battle with it <italic>[fatigue],</italic> convinced that I could beat it. . .but since taking this course I've realised that perhaps I can't beat it, I can manage it.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Overall, responses to the FMSQ suggested that the content of the FACETS programme had resonated with participants, whose comments demonstrated assimilation of information, as well as adherence to some of the key principles. Participants reported finding different aspects of the programme helpful, and implemented a range of strategies in varying combinations. This illustrates the importance of a multicomponent intervention in the context of a fluctuating and multifactorial symptom such as MS-fatigue.</p><p>Four months after the end of the FACETS programme the majority of attendees reported successfully implementing fatigue management strategies. While respondents noted some ongoing barriers to fatigue management it is encouraging that they were aware of such barriers and were able to identify and describe them. We propose that booster sessions might be a helpful addition to the FACETS programme to enable a facilitated review of progress and barriers encountered. The findings from this study highlight that fatigue management does not take place in isolation. The demands of everyday life are complex and varied and effective fatigue management often requires negotiating complex social, familial and work contexts/expectations as well as overcoming sometimes deeply entrenched and long-standing attitudinal barriers. This study provides valuable insights into people's experiences of a complex intervention for MS-fatigue management and supports the relevance of a cognitive behavioural approach.
