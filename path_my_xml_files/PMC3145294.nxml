In particular, the use of a low-tidal volume (6 mL/kg predicted body weight) and plateau pressure-limited strategy has been demonstrated to reduce mortality from 40% to 31%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Further, a large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] demonstrated the equivalence of higher and lower levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. Over this time, a number of nonventilatory therapies for ALI/ARDS have been investigated. Many of these have not proven to be effective, while others appear more promising, lipids being one of them.</p><p>The lipid emulsions generally used in the parenteral nutrition of critically ill patients are rich in long-chain triglycerides (LCT), especially linoleic acid (polyunsaturated series 6 fatty acid; PUFA n-6, 18:2 n-6). These fatty acids, aside from producing adverse metabolic effects (transitory hyperlipidemias), can alter pulmonary gas exchange due to their potentially proinflammatory properties. The MCT/LCT emulsions are oxidized faster and provide fewer amounts of PUFAs than LCT emulsions. Thus, MCT/LCT emulsions have been associated with a lower risk of lipid peroxidation and fewer alterations of membrane structures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 series (PUFA n-3) are precursors of biologically active substances, e.g., the series 3 and 5 eicosanoids. These molecules use the same metabolic routes and compete for the same elongases and desaturases as linoleic and arachidonic, but ultimately they are mediators that have a much less active biological profile than linoleic acid derivatives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In 146 patients with ARDS treated with an enteral diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid, &#x003b3;-linolenic, and antioxidants, an improved PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, a reduction in pulmonary inflammatory response, frequency of new organ failures, days of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in ICU were observed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In 100 patients with acute pulmonary injury receiving a similar enteral diet, oxygenation was better, pulmonary compliance improved, and there was less need for mechanical ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The administration of lipid emulsions has been associated with changes in pulmonary function that depends on pulmonary disease, dose, duration, speed of administration, and kind of infused lipids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials comparing standard enteral nutrition with antioxidant nutrition found decreased rates of infection but again no effect on mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Many patients with ARDS require sedation/analgesia and muscle relaxation, inducing intestinal ileus and making intolerance to enteral nutrition. It has been hypothesized that adding n-3 to a MCT/LCT mixture used in enteral nutrition, should be beneficial because of the reduced amount of PUFA, would be less toxic than a lipid emulsion based on soybean oil, and that the addition of fish oil would be protective because of its anti-inflammatory properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] A study which evaluated the hemodynamic changes and variations in pulmonary gas exchange that occurred in patients with ARDS given an intravenous lipid emulsion enriched with n-3 fatty acids could not show any benefit.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In unselected critically ill medical patients, fish oil supplementation that increased the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio to 1:2 did not affect inflammation or clinical outcome, compared to parenteral lipid nutrition with an MCT/LCT emulsion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] A small study showed that while the LCT emulsion induced no deleterious effects on oxygenation in ARDS patients, the LCT/MCT emulsion improved the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and had a further beneficial effect on oxygen delivery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The present study evaluated the effects of an intravenous lipid emulsion enriched with n-3 fatty acids in ventilated patients with acute lung injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This single-center, placebo-controlled, investigator blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their next of kin.</p><p>All patients admitted to the medical ICU of this hospital between July 1 and December 31 2009 were screened for eligibility. We studied 86 consecutive patients with suspected ARDS in the first 48 hours of admission .The inclusion criteria were: Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates of sudden onset in the chest radiograph, PaO2/FiO2 less than 200, and pulmonary capillary pressure less than 18 mm Hg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Patients were excluded for age younger than 18 or older than 80 years, pregnancy, liver failure (bilirubin &#x0003e; 3), HIV positivity, leukopenia (&#x0003c;3500 mm<sup>3</sup>), thrombocytopenia (&#x0003c;100,000 mm<sup>3</sup>), acute bleeding, severe renal insufficiency (creatinine &#x0003e;2.5 mg/dl) or need for renal dialysis, signs of heart failure, transplantation, multiple blood transfusions, participation in other clinical trials simultaneously or in the last 60 days, treatment with nitrous oxide or corticoids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d or equivalent), multiple organ failure, severe dyslipidemia, propofol treatment, head injury, cerebral hemorrhage, receiving immunosuppressive regimen, radiation, allergy to any of the constituents of nutritional products.</p><p>Patients were divided into two groups:</p><p>Group 1: Standard diet (high fat, low carbohydrate kitchen feed)</p><p>Group 2: Standard diet + parenteral Omega 3 fatty acids, Omegaven<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Fresenius Kabi), an emulsion of 10% fish oil, for 14 days. This resulted in an n-3/n-6 ratio of 1:2 in the intervention group.</p><p>Patients in each stratum were assigned to the intervention or control group by the institutional intensivists, by use of a computer-generated block randomization list inaccessible to the investigators.</p><p>All participants were started on enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube within 24 hrs of ICU admission. Enteral feeding was administered continuously, and the daily enteral intake was recorded. Conventional modes of ventilation were used in all cases, including assist control ventilation (pressure mode), pressure support ventilation (Evita 4, Drager, Lubeck, Germany). The main goals of mechanical ventilation were an oxygen saturation of &#x02265;90%, peak airway pressure of &#x02264;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and tidal volume of &#x02264;6 mL/kg. Levels of PEEP and FIO<sub>2</sub> were adjusted to achieve these goals. Ventilation settings and decisions regarding readiness for extubation were left to the discretion of the investigators who were blinded to the nutritional prescription.</p><p>Following data were collected:</p><p>

All P values were two sided, significance was assigned at a threshold of 0.05. A t test was used to compare a continuous variable (e.g., PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, length of stay). A contingency table (Fishers or chi-square test) was used to compare a categorical variable (e.g., survivor vs. nonsurvivors).

Supplementation of enteral nutrition with fish oil for 14 days could not be proven to affect the examined ventilatory parameters or measures of clinical outcome in these patients. Only a significant increase in oxygenation could be shown at day 14. The hypothesis had been that inflammatory and subsequent anti-inflammatory reactions would be reduced,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] resulting in clinical benefit. This expectation had been based on results of clinical studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The majority of such studies showing a benefit from intravenous supplementation of fish oil had been performed in surgical patients.</p><p>There may be several reasons why the expected effects of fish oil supplementation could not be demonstrated in this study. First, control patients were more severely ill in terms of PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio though the APACHE scoring was comparable. Second, the choice of lipids for standard care could partially explain why fish oil supplementation was not efficacious. In most clinical studies showing a benefit for fish oil, pure LCT lipids had been used in the control groups. LCT lipids, however, have been demonstrated to exert inflammatory and immunosuppressive influence on septic patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Parenteral Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to improve glucose control and decrease inflammatory markers in COAD and after major surgery patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In the present study, standard diet containing 50% MCT and 50% LCT was used, which reduced the average daily dose of linoleic acid to less than 0.3 g/kg. Thus, the expected effects of modifying the LCT/MCT ratio may not have been detected because the standard nutrition itself had fewer immunological side effects. Third, the route of use and specific composition of n-3 PUFAs could be important for their immunomodulatory effect. Enteral application of a mixture of fish oil, canola and borage oil, which &#x02013; in contrast to fish oil alone &#x02013; contains a substantial amount of gamma-linolenic acid, has shown to improve outcome parameters in acute lung injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It may also be that this PUFA composition and its enteral application carry more benefit than the parenteral application of fish oil.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Adverse events</title><p>Considering their mechanism of action, one could logically expect two principal side effects of n-3-PUFAs: Impaired hemostasis (due to reduced synthesis of thromboxane) and reduced immune function. Bleeding events did not occur more frequently in the intervention group. The anti-inflammatory potential of fish oil may be harmful. No influence of fish oil supplementation on nutritional status, as assessed by weight and albumin (data not shown), was observed. In effect, the present study produced no evidence that fish oil supplementation is harmful for the critically ill.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of the present study merit consideration. Sample-size estimates were based on data from a previous study in a less heterogeneous population. To compensate for greater variability, much larger sample sizes could well have been necessary to detect an effect of fish oil supplementation. The dose of fish oil may have been insufficient to produce an immunomodulatory effect. However, the intervention in this study was aimed at altering the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio to 1:2. This aim was generally achieved with a daily fish oil dose of 0.1 g/kg. Favorable effect of fish oil have been demonstrated with daily doses as low as 0.1&#x02013;0.2 g/kg (17).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In
