Twelve patients were excluded because of having an ASA III or more. This resulted in 216 consenting patients, 10 of whom were excluded because of a change in their surgical procedures, which resulted in a final sample size of 206 patients (CONSORT Flow Diagram, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subsequently, the study therapist (a physician with several years of experience in cupping) obtained the randomization allocation by the research coordinator who used a computer program to generate the random allocation sequence and had no contact with study patients. Only the therapist knew the randomization result. The patients and the observer of the endpoints were not informed about the allocation.

This was followed by an infusion of 100&#x0200a;mL of Ringer lactate over 10&#x0200a;minutes, after which the induction of anesthesia started by sodium thiopental (5&#x0200a;mg/kg), sufentanil (0.2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg), and atracurium (0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg). The maintenance continued with isoflurane (end-tidal between 0.8 and 1.6) and oxygen (7&#x0200a;L/min without N<sub>2</sub>O). During the operation, patients were observed carefully while receiving crystalloids (Ringer lactate). Ten minutes before the end of surgery, all patients received morphine (0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg) or meperidine (0.5&#x0200a;mg/kg). After the surgery, 10&#x0200a;minutes before leaving the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), analgesic therapy (morphine 0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg) was repeated for all patients. Rescue therapy with ondansetron 2&#x0200a;mg was used for all patients with moderate or severe nausea episodes or if patients requested to have treatment for nausea or vomiting.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup></p><p>In both groups, after injection of premedication (midazolam 1&#x0200a;mg, 10 minutes before induction), a 30- to 40-cc cup, fitting the patient's wrist, was placed on the dominant hand P6 point. In the experimental group, after the induction of anesthesia, negative pressure (60&#x02013;100&#x0200a;mmHg) was induced. In the sham group, the cup was remained inactive without negative pressure. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate PONV in patients at 2, 6, and 24&#x0200a;hours after surgery. Anxiety levels before receiving premedication (before injection of midazolam), as well as 2, 6, and 24&#x0200a;hours after surgery were assessed by VAS and both groups were matched for anxiety.</p><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in Imam Reza hospital and is listed in the Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT2011020131ON6).</p><p>All data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated.

The most meaningful effect of dry cupping on nausea was observed in the 6&#x0200a;hours, for vomiting in the first 2&#x0200a;hours, and for need for rescue therapy in 6&#x0200a;hours, post-surgery. When we controlled for PONV known risk factors,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> patients who received dry cupping were nearly 3 times less likely to report nausea, over one and a half times less likely to report vomiting or retching, and 1.3 times less likely to need rescue therapy, post-surgery.</p><p>As one of the modalities of acupuncture, cupping is valued for its potential to strengthen body resistance, to eject pathogenic factors, and to promote blood circulation. These restore the balance between Yin (negative/passive/dark/water) and Yang (positive/active/bright/fire) and promote the flow of &#x0201c;Qi,&#x0201d; which signifies power and movement similar to energy.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several suggestions have been made regarding the possible mode of action in dry cupping. These include adjustment in skin blood flow,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> influencing biomechanical properties of tissues under treatment,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> increasing anaerobic metabolism in subcutaneous tissue,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> modulation of cellular part of the immune system,<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> and generally improving microcirculation. This prompts capillary endothelial cell repair, accelerating granulation and angiogenesis in regional tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>This is the first study testing the effectiveness of dry cupping in reducing PONV. The technique used in dry cupping is similar to acupuncture. We therefore use the acupuncture literature to inform us of possible underlying mechanisms of P6 point stimulation in controlling nausea and vomiting.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> It has been suggested that acupuncture may result in low-frequency electrical stimulation of the skin. This causes nerve activity for A-&#x003b2; and A-&#x003b4; fibers, which may have an effect in nerve transmission in the dorsal horn and upper neurons. Clement-Jones, McLoughlin et al (1980) also reported that the internal opioid system may be involved in the release of enkephalin, endorphins, beta-endorphin, and dynorphin.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> It is also possible that the effect of P6 point stimulation is because of the inhibition of gastric acid secretion and improvement in stomach motion.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup></p><p>Confirmatory benefits of sensory effect of stimulation on the wrist in reducing nausea and vomiting compared to placebo device have been reported in pregnant women,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> in outpatients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures,<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> and in children undergoing anesthesia and surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> In Zarate's study, 221 patients were randomized into: active involvement in the P6; sham group; and placebo. The authors reported that intervention significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05) the incidence of moderate to severe nausea up to 9&#x0200a;hours after surgery compared to the sham and the placebo groups. No difference was detected in the incidence of vomiting and the need for treatment (escape medication). In the study of 120 children undergoing tonsillectomy, the authors found that electrical P6 acupuncture, although patients were anesthetized, significantly reduced the incidence of PONV in the intervention group compared to the sham puncture and the control group (63% vs. 88% vs. 93%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001).<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Further studies are needed to delineate the underlying palliative mechanism of dry cupping on PONV.</p><p>Overall, our findings support previous acupuncture and acupressure findings in that pressure at the P6 point by dry cupping may have a specific therapeutic effect in preventing the incidence of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. It is also noteworthy that none of the patients in our study reported unusual side effects. In a systematic review of cupping therapy for acute and chronic pain management Cao et al reported that of 10 randomized clinical trials reported severe adverse effect related to cupping. However, 6 trails reported mild to moderate hematoma, pain, soreness or tingling at the treated site, which are considered common side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Our study had several limitations. First, it is a single-center study. A multicenter study is essential in supporting generalizability of findings. Second, because we included only females in the study, our findings suffer from converge bias in that they are limited to female population. Future studies are needed to replicate our study with males, and different populations such as patients with different body mass indices and those who were administered different anesthetic agents or underwent different anesthesia procedures. Gastric tube decompression, for example, has no apparent effect on PONV, but the use of nasogastric tubes is associated with higher incidence of nausea.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup></p><p>The third limitation involves our lack of control over response bias; high response expectancies may compromise the internal validity of the study.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> As part of the Prophetic Medicine, cupping is worshiped by many.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> It is suggested that this may involuntarily mediate a participant's response to treatment prerandomization as in obtaining informed consent. Current scientific evidence is mixed in supporting this assertion, because of the lack of standardized measures to assess response expectancies.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> However, the importance of assessing and comparing groups in terms of their expectancies appears significant.</p><p>Expectations of benefit may interfere with trial validity in studies involving sham medical devices by making it difficult to detect between-group differences.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> This further limits the validity of our findings in that we did not investigate, determine, and measure sham credibility, and relied on its applicability based on previous studies. To overcome these biases, studies with larger samples are needed. These allow for stratified randomization by strength of response expectancy across both control and sham group.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup></p><p>In addition to response expectancies, post-surgery women with real cupping may notice distinctly colored skin over the P6 region because of the negative pressure created during the process. This, of course, would not occur in the control group. Although our patients were blinded to their group assignment, this discoloration effect could introduce additional response bias. Lastly, our study was not designed to establish whether dry cupping was noninferior to acupunctures. Doing so would require studies with larger sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings are promising in that they suggest dry cupping treatments at the acupressure P6 can prevent the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and need for rescue therapy after laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. Additional clinical studies of dry cupping are needed to investigate its effect in preventing and treating PONV in men, and children undergoing similar surgery. Also, considering that dry cupping is a noninvasive procedure with fewer side effects compared to other medicinal therapy, its prophylactic antiemetic therapy should be investigated for different patients, other types of surgeries and different anesthetic agent or anesthesia procedures. More randomized, controlled multicenter studies are needed. They may provide firm evidence of the effectiveness of dry cupping, and demonstrate its underlying analgesic mechanism in preventing PONV.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences for supporting this project.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA class = American Society of Anesthesiology patient classification status, ASA I = Normal healthy patient, ASA II = patient with mild systemic disease; no functional limitation, ASA III = patient with severe systemic disease; definite functional impairment, CAM = complementary and alternative medicine, CI = confidence interval, CONSORT = Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, NNT = the number need to treat (NNT), NPT = nonpharmacologic techniques, OR = odds ratio, PACU = post-anesthesia care unit, PONV = post-operative nausea and vomiting, SD = standard deviation, VAS = visual analogue scale, WHO = World Health Organization.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was registered in the World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform with registration number = IRCT201102011310N6.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This article is the result of an anesthesiology residency project # 89172.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This work was performed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Specialty of Anesthesiology (MD), of Mohammad Kameli, in faculty of Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah Iran.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apfel</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Roewer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Korttila</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>
