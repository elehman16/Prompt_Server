Although advances in MI therapy have improved acute survival rates, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, survivors are prone to development of chronic degenerative changes as a result of irreversible cardiomyocyte loss, extracellular matrix fibrosis, and pathological gene programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Large animal model of chronic MI with long-term postoperative survival is very important for studying the molecular and cellular changes following MI and testing novel therapies for prevention of chronic negative myocardial remodeling.</p><p>At present, MI modeling in most of preclinical experiments still apply surgical opening chest and coronary artery ligation or incision of the peripheral arteries for interventional approach and balloon occlusion of coronary flow, which are also supported by endotracheal intubation and assisted respiration. Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), especially mid-LAD was used for target artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The biggest advantage is that they maintain the consistency of infarct size and target vessel status. However, some issues and potential pitfalls should be recognized such as high incidence rate of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, less induced infarct size, longer operation time (generally required 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h), and larger trauma. In this operation course, the blood flow interrupts completely and suddenly, resulting in a high incidence rate of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The temporary blockage of blood flow by balloon usually results in less induced infarct size and fast revascularization afterward, which is apt to overestimate the infarct size in the early stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In recent years, many methods of coronary artery embolization have been proposed and applied in large animals&#x02019; MI modeling. But to our knowledge, these methods still need further optimization, due to limitations in high cost (spring coil) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], difficulty in pinpointing embolism levels (micro-catheter injection of ethanol, micro-spheres embolization) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], poor operational feasibility (sponge is hard to push) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and postoperative vascular recanalization (autologous blood clots, winding stent, spring coil) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we initiated a consistent and sustained coronary embolism model with high operation success rate and short operative time by the sequential balloons-sponge embolization in a large animal so as to lay a good foundation for further heart intervention. Furthermore, multimodality clinical imaging and histology staining were applied to evaluate the efficacy of the method compared with traditional modeling by interventional technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental protocols</title><p>This study was performed at an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited large animal research facility. All animal procedures were conducted in conformity with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of 18 minipigs (female, weighing 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kg) were randomly allocated into three groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, each group) including balloon occlusion group (BO group), half-balloon embolism group (HB group), and sequential balloon-balloon-sponge embolism group (BBS group, two half-balloons with one sponge as the embolism clot). Coronary artery occlusion or embolization was kept in the mid-LAD, immediately after the ostium of the second diagonal branch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The following data were compared in three groups: the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF), total mortality, operation time of occlusion or embolization, and vascular recanalization at 3&#x000a0;months post-MI. MI in the BBS group was confirmed by electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. The combination evaluating methods of echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), and histology staining were applied to compare the infarct size in three groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Common procedures of MI induction in three groups</title><p>The three groups all went through the following six procedures including anesthesia, percutaneous femoral artery puncture, selective coronary angiography (CAG), conventional ischemic preconditioning and prevention of arrhythmia, balloon occlusion or embolization, and postoperative monitoring and treatment.</p><p>Briefly, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (20&#x000a0;mg/kg, IM) and introduced intravenous catheters in marginal ear veins. Continuous infusion of propofol (0.003&#x000a0;ml/kg/min) was administrated to maintain anesthesia. Animals were continuously monitored and inhaled oxygen (3&#x000a0;L/min). The right or left femoral artery was identified, and a 6-Fr radial arterial introducer sheath (Terumo, Japan) was advanced over the guidewire in the femoral artery by percutaneous puncture. When it was necessary, ultrasound could be used to assist the puncture. Heparin sodium was given as a 150 IU/kg bolus IV at the start of the procedure and continued at 50&#x000a0;IU/kg/h IV throughout the operation. Femoral artery angiography was performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and a 6-Fr guiding catheter (Judkins right 4.0 type) was advanced into the ostium of the coronary artery. Baseline selective coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography were performed, and the target blocking location was determined. Lidocaine (0.03&#x000a0;mg/kg/min) was intravenously infused throughout the following procedures. In case of VF, nonsynchronized direct current defibrillation was performed at 360&#x000a0;J. Along with the guidewire, the 1.5&#x02013;2.5-mm balloon catheter according to target vessel diameter was inflated and deflated three times in the mid-LAD as the ischemic preconditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Each time, the balloon was inflated 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;atm for 5&#x000a0;mins with the interval of 1&#x000a0;min. Subsequently, all animals were performed mid-LAD balloon occlusion or embolism procedure according to grouping. Finally, the arterial sheath was removed, followed by 30&#x000a0;mins oppression on the femoral artery puncture area. After the procedures, all the animals received antibiotics (penicillin 640 WU once a day, for 3&#x000a0;days).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Minipig femoral artery angiography in three groups. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Display arterial introducer sheath in the right and left femoral artery, respectively. <bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold> The angiography of right and left femoral artery and iliac artery, internal iliac artery, and abdominal aorta, respectively.

Especially, minipig is an ideal experimental animal with smaller body size and genetic stability. In the present study, we set up a new convenient and effective method for chronic LAD embolization by BBS in minipigs. In a previous study, Reffelmann et al. and Dariolli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] had proposed that the sterile sponge can be advanced directly into coronary artery by a balloon catheter to induce MI. However, the sponge is easy to shift and also be off load from the guidewire because of the fusiform structure of the balloon tip. In our study, immediate satisfactory results can be achieved when target vessel was embolized by half-balloon and subsequent thrombosis. However, we found that even though immediate results were satisfactory, LAD recanalization was high during the follow-up. This recovered forward blood flow will lead to misevaluation for the effectiveness of subsequent interventions in the animal model. According to our results, the myocardial perfusion in the BBS group is poorer than that in the HB group at 3&#x000a0;months post-MI, which may be related to the recanalization in the HB group. Meanwhile, other methods did not detect the difference between the groups.</p><p>In the BBS group with sequential embolism, the metal marker of the balloon can be used to precisely locate the embolism position to keep the consistent infarct size. Subsequent thrombus gradually formed, and the blood flow occluded totally within about 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mins, which can be considered as ischemic preconditioning to protect from acute myocardial injury. This might be the reason for the significant reduction of VF caused by sudden and complete blockage of blood flow. In addition, the second free half-balloon, sponge, and half-balloon with catheter formed a sandwich-like structure, which can be pushed easily to the target position. This sequential embolization method maximized the effectiveness and achieved the purpose of complete and permanent occlusion. Meanwhile, the BBS group did not significantly increase the operation time and incidence of VF, which made the chronic MI model more conducive to establish.</p><p>As for the evaluation for the chronic MI, heart function, and left ventricular remodeling, several imaging modalities including echocardiography, SPECT/CT, and PET/CT were applied in preclinical study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, each imaging technique holds its strength and weakness. In order to fully evaluate the whole aspect of the infarcted heart, we applied cardioangiography, echocardiography, SPECT/CT, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT. Data showed that the infarct size and embolized artery were more stable and repeatable in the BBS group than that in other groups. As a result, the chronic MI model is more consistent and conducive as compared with others. Furthermore, due to the shorter operation time than conventional balloon blocking, the minipig could better tolerate operation. Subsequently, animals were given oxygen inhalation with the nasal catheter and without the tracheal intubation during the operation, which made the experiment simpler and more convenient.</p><p>Although this methodology appears to have significant utility for animal research in chronic myocardial infarctions, it is recognized that several study limitations exist. Due to the consideration of experimental cost, the group of 60-min balloon occlusion was established as the only conventional control group, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT myocardial metabolism imaging was only used in the BBS group to verify the formation of myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared to the conventional modeling induced by balloon blocking, the method of sequential balloons-sponge embolization could induce myocardial infarction with consistent and sustained embolization and gain higher operation success rate and better repeatability in minipigs, which holds a promising method for preclinical myocardial infarction study.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13550_2016_214_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Classic methods have been fully described by previous investigators and introduced.
