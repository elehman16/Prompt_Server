Based on epidemiological data, Grimes <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that population means of blood cholesterol concentrations increase with increasing distance from the Equator and reduction in duration of sunlight received. There are also reports of seasonal variations in the population mean serum cholesterol concentrations. Grimes <italic>et al</italic>. have also shown that the mean cholesterol concentrations for each month were below the annual mean during the summer months and above the annual mean during the winter months.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Apart from other lifestyle changes, reduced sunlight exposure in populations migrated from higher sunlight to lower sunlight geographies seems to have an unfavorable effect on the lipid metabolism, leading to increased atherosclerosis. The British Heart Foundation Statistics reports that the death rate from coronary heart disease is highest in South Asian men and women than in the UK population as a whole.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has also been shown that the UK-based Indian cohort had a greater body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol concentrations, apolipoprotein B; lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and higher fasting blood glucose than their siblings in Punjab, India.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>As a result of an increased awareness in the medical community and also in the general population, there is an increasing trend of consuming Vitamin D supplements either as prescription medicines or as a nutritional supplement. Although increased sunlight exposure may be a physiological alternative to oral supplementation in sun-rich countries, it is very infrequently advised possibly due to difficulty in implementing lifestyle modifications and perceived risk of skin cancer.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, the effect of increased casual sunlight exposure on Vitamin D concentrations and lipid profile has not been previously studied.</p><p>Thus, the specific objective of this study was to assess the effect of increased sunlight exposure, in comparison with Vitamin D supplementation, on Vitamin D status and lipid profile in Indian men (aged 40&#x02013;60 years) with Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD &#x0003c;50 nmol/L) in a randomized control trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODOLOGY</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample selection</title><p>This was prospective, balanced, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel group study conducted at Pune, India.

Orally administered Vitamin D also increased 25OHD concentrations significantly; however, there was an increase in the TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C though the latter increase was not significant.</p><p>Our results in cholecalciferol supplementation group are in agreement with earlier intervention studies. Placebo-controlled randomized trials analyzing effects of Vitamin D supplementation on lipids have consistently shown an increase in LDL-C concentrations, but changes in HDL-C and TC are variable. In a study by Ponda <italic>et al</italic>., repletion of 25OHD concentrations correlated with a significant increase in LDL-C.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a similar study by Zittermann <italic>et al</italic>., Vitamin D supplementation also significantly increased LDL-C concentrations (15.4%) compared with placebo (&#x02212;2.5%), but no significant change was seen in HDL-C concentrations.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a meta-analysis of ten randomized clinical trials on the influence of Vitamin D supplementation on plasma lipid profiles, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that Vitamin D supplementation could increase LDL-C concentrations but does not appear to significantly affect TC, HDL-C, and TG. The pooled estimate of effect for Vitamin D supplementation on LDL-C was 3.23 mg/dl (95% confidence interval, 0.55&#x02013;5.90 mg/dl).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] These studies however have used different formulations (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcitriol) and doses and had variable duration of supplementation (8 weeks to 1 year) and therefore are difficult to compare.</p><p>Results in increased sunlight exposure intervention group are similar to those seen in epidemiological studies. Reduction in HDL-C can be explained on the basis that common substrate 7-DHC in skin is possibly used for synthesis of Vitamin D due to increased sunlight exposure and thus reduces cutaneous cholesterol production and consequently HDL-C concentration. Our earlier cross-sectional study has also shown inverse relationship between 25OHD and HDL-C in higher sunlight exposure group as against a positive relationship in low sunlight exposure group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Increase in HDL-C in cholecalciferol supplemented group could possibly be explained with same logic, wherein with oral supplementation, lesser 7-DHC is used for Vitamin D production.</p><p>Various other mechanisms have been suggested to explain the effect of Vitamin D and its active metabolites on lipid metabolism. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Gupta <italic>et al</italic>., it has been reported that Vitamin D and its metabolites inhibited HMG-CoA-reductase and lanosterol 14a-demethylase enzyme activity in various rat cell lines which are important enzymes in cholesterol synthesis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although lower LDL-C concentrations were seen in sunlight exposure group, cholecalciferol supplemented showed opposite results, mechanisms for this are unclear. It is not known whether sunlight exposure affects cholesterol metabolism by improving Vitamin D status or is independent of it.</p><p>Although there are a few studies which have investigated effect of Vitamin D supplementation on lipid profile, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies in medical literature of randomized control trials that have examined the effect of increased sunlight exposure and oral cholecalciferol supplementation on lipid profile.</p><p>One of the limitations of the present study was the dropout rate at the follow-up after 6 months. However, no significant difference was observed between the initial sample and the follow-up group of individuals for all study parameters; i.e., age, body measurements, Vitamin D and lipid profile across the three study groups at baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1).
