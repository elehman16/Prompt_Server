Once donors&#x02019; serums were tested negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, and Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), mineralized whole tooth allograft (WTA) and dentin allograft (DA) were prepared using the standard protocol of Tissue Bank at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Study Design:</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, 15 patients undergoing extraction of at least four teeth were selected. In each patient after atraumatic extractions, one socket was grafted with WTA, second with DA, third with FDBA, and fourth was left ungrafted (control site). All the sites were covered with chorion membrane. To estimate three-dimensional alveolar crest changes, cone beam computed tomography scans were taken immediately after grafting and 4 months postoperatively.

However, complete preservation and reconstructions of alveolar ridge to its original dimensions still seem to be a distant goal. Autogenous bone graft being osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osteoproliferative is considered a gold standard.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, most of time its quantity is inadequate due to limited availability of donor site. Thus to suffice the required quantity of bone graft material, numerous alternatives are investigated for bone regeneration over the years.</p><p>Dentin and bone have similarities in terms of structural and biochemical properties. This led an idea of using dentin as a bone graft material..[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Demineralized dentin matrix (DDM) has been shown to possess osteogenic capacity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Use of autogenous dentin graft was developed and clinically applied from 2003 onward.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It has shown promising clinical and histological results as an alternative to autogenous bone graft. However, it still has its own sets of limitations such as:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patient may not accept his/her own tooth as it is diseased and has to be extracted</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quantity is dependent on the number of teeth indicated for extraction, and quality of graft depends on the nature of extracted teeth</p></list-item><list-item><p>Chairside graft preparation is tedious as well as time consuming.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Thus, to overcome these shortcomings, we thought of preparing allografts from human extracted teeth. Allograft is a graft between genetically dissimilar members of the same species.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study is to clinically and radiographically evaluate the efficacy of mineralized human teeth allografts to preserve alveolar ridge dimensions in comparison to conventional allograft, i.e., freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA). The secondary objective is to histologically determine bone formation potential of teeth allografts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (MGVKBHDC/15-16/1634). The current trial is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry&#x02013;India with registration number-CTRI/2016/11/007441. All clinical procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Graft preparation</title><p>Allografts from human extracted teeth were prepared in collaboration with Tissue bank at Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India. Human extracted teeth were collected in the Department of Oral Surgery at MGV's KBH Dental College and Hospital, Nashik. From August 2015 to September 2015, full-mouth extraction cases were screened as potential donors for extracted teeth. Five patients met the inclusion criteria to be donors, all the donors were:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Systemically healthy</p></list-item><list-item><p>No history of, or current adverse habits such as smoking, gutka, or tobacco chewing</p></list-item><list-item><p>No caries and/or peri-apical infection.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All donors were females with a mean age of 41 &#x000b1; 0.4 years. For each donor, detailed medical and dental histories were recorded by one single dental operator in the donor screening form provided by TMH which were duly signed by the donors. The purpose of teeth donation was explained to each donor and written consent was obtained. As a standard protocol for graft preparation using human tissues, a donor has to undergo testing for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis antigens. Thus with consent of all the potential donors, 5 ml blood was collected, centrifuged, serum was separated, and it was transferred to vacutainers. These vacutainers were labeled with donors&#x02019; details and immediately refrigerated till further analysis. A total of 22 teeth were collected from five donors. All teeth were cleaned using an ultrasonic scaler.</p><p>For 11 teeth obtained from two donors, dentin was separated using carbide straight fissure bur by trimming superficial enamel and cemental portion. Rest of the 11 teeth from the remaining three donors were kept as whole teeth. Processing of all teeth was done immediately postextraction and was stored according to individual donors, in a separate sterile plastic container. Each container was labeled with donor's information and refrigerated till further processing. Once all the teeth were collected, all the containers and corresponding donors&#x02019; serums were packed and transferred in an organ donation box surrounded by frozen ice-pack gels to maintain the temperature during transportation. Box was sealed and transported to the Tissue Bank at TMH, Mumbai. Once the donors&#x02019; serums were tested non-reactive to HIV, HBV, HCV and VDRL antigens; using standard protocol of bone graft preparation by TMH, teeth were processed, sterilized, and packed as 1 cc graft of particle size 300&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;m. Two different types of allografts, namely, whole tooth allograft (WTA) and dentin allograft (DA) were prepared. The purpose of preparing two different allografts was to evaluate the effect of only dentin as opposed to whole teeth independently. The grafts were then sent back to the Department of Periodontics at MGV's KBH Dental College, Nashik, to evaluate their clinical efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized, controlled, prospective, clinical study was designed to investigate the efficacy of WTA and DA in alveolar ridge preservation as compared to conventional allograft, i.e., FDBA against ungrafted sites.

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical protocol</title><p>With written informed consent from all the study participants, flapless, atraumatic extraction of the teeth was performed using periotomes and forceps. To confirm the eligibility of surgical site, integrity of the alveolar wall postextraction was confirmed using UNC-15 periodontal probe (GDC, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India). Three extracted sockets were filled with graft materials and one extraction socket was left ungrafted as a control site. All the grafted and ungrafted sites were covered with a chorion membrane (Tissue bank, TMH, Mumbai, India). A crisscross suture was given to stabilize the membrane. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was taken immediately after grafting. Postoperative instructions were given, and amoxicillin (500 mg TDS) was prescribed for 5 days. Patients were recalled for suture removal after 7 days. Second CBCT scan was taken after 4 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Assessment</title><p>The total 4 months of study period was divided into three time intervals, i.e., day of extraction and bone grafting, 7<sup>th</sup> day postgrafting, and 4 months&#x02019; postgrafting. Clinical evaluation was done at all visits, and CBCT scans were obtained immediately after grafting and at the end of 4 months. Three-dimensional radiographic alveolar crestal bone changes in height and width after 4 months were selected as the primary outcome and histological new bone formation as the secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Cone beam computed tomography analysis</title><p>Frame/slice of each CBCT scan was adjusted in an axial view and center aligned over the area of interest. For the buccal and lingual cortical height, the measurements were done using linear measurement tool in a cross-sectional slice.

All the vertical measurements were done from the most coronal aspect of cortical bone to the fixed anatomical point apically. Buccolingual width was measured in a cross-sectional slice and mesiodistal in the tangential slice. The amount of crestal bone loss is the difference between independently measured bone height width immediately after grafting and 4 months&#x02019; postgrafting using the above-mentioned protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Histological evaluation</title><p>Individuals in whom implant placement was performed 4 months after the alveolar ridge preservation, an additional informed written consent for bone biopsy was obtained.

If the extraction socket is left to heal by its natural course, reduction of 2.6 mm to 4.6 mm in width and 0.4 mm to 3.9 mm in height of alveolar bone is observed. This ultimately results in overall shrinkage in dimensions of alveolar bone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Later, at the time of prosthetic replacements, especially in case of dental implants, additional procedure of osseous reconstruction might be required to meet optimal prosthetic, functional, and esthetic demands. Thus, procedures such as &#x0201c;ridge preservation&#x0201d; using various bone graft materials immediately after extraction can be employed.</p><p>Literature has demonstrated the availability and efficacy of different types of bone graft materials in terms of osteoinductive and/or osteoconductive properties that could preserve the alveolar ridge postextraction and accelerate the bone repair process.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Among the various options in literature, autogenous bone graft is still considered an ideal regenerative material. Alternative material such as autogenous DDM has gained a lot of momentum these days, since it has demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and favorable osteogenic remodeling properties.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Research involving dentin as bone graft material began with a case report in 1967 that demonstrated animal-derived DDM-induced bone formation in the intramuscular pockets.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Until now, several dentin studies have reported the osteoinductive potency of DDM and presence of BMP molecule in dentin matrix.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, it was noted that DDM derived from human teeth, induced bone and cartilage independently in subcutaneous tissues of nude mice at 4 weeks after implantation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Having intrinsic chemotactic property, DDM has shown to attract osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts for the promotion of new bone formation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Clinical effectiveness of the autogenous DDM inside the extracted socket was tested wherein the bone radiopacity with enhanced healing process was observed.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>However, chairside preparation of autogenous DDM is still a time-consuming process and may not be a feasible option all the time. Thus, to tackle this issue, we decided to prepare allografts from extracted human teeth. Subsequently, in this randomized, clinicoradiographic pilot study, we evaluated their efficacy in comparison to conventional allograft. This is a prospective study having 4-month follow-up period. Radiographically, change in mean width and height of alveolar bone was assessed as primary outcome variables. Histological healing pattern was considered as the secondary outcome variable.</p><p>Human teeth have three distinct calcified layers. All these layers are thought to impart different properties in terms of bone graft material. Since it is difficult to collect enamel and cementum by separating them from underlying dentin, we decided to prepare two separate grafts, i.e., dentin only and whole teeth. The process of removal of enamel and cementum from dentin was standardized and evaluated histologically before conducting a trial. In the present study, the WTA- and DA-grafted sites demonstrated statistically significant least amount of alveolar ridge width as well as height reduction in comparison with FDBA- and non-grafted sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, among WTA- and DA-grafted sites, there was no statistically significant difference when mean reduction in height and width of alveolar ridge was analyzed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). This simply implies that there is no need of putting extra efforts to separate dentin from tooth when the entire tooth can be utilized as bone graft material with similar results.</p><p>Results of the current clinical trial evaluating the use of human teeth as allograft are in accordance with various animal studies and case reports published in the 1980s. These studies have validated the osteoinductive potential of allogenic, demineralized, lyophilized dentin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] From a histological standpoint, WTA and DA particles were surrounded by vital bone with few areas of resorption. This indicates induction of new bone formation around these graft particles. This is consistent with a study done by Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Similarly, FDBA sites also showed better graft integration and new bone formation, but the amount of new bone formation was generally moderate.</p><p>Murata <italic>et al</italic>. in the first clinical case of sinus augmentation using auto-dentin as a bone graft material stated that composition of dentin and bone is comparable. They consist of body fluid (10%), collagen (18%), noncollagenous proteins (2%), and hydroxyapatite (70%) in weight volume.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to Urist in 1965, DDM and demineralized bone matrix contain mainly Type-I collagen with growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 and fibroblast growth factors. These bioactive molecules are thought to contribute to osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of human tooth as a graft material.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various <italic>in vivo</italic> and animal studies have demonstrated its biocompatibility, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive potential.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitations</title><p>This is a pilot study with small sample size.

The study validated the need of alveolar ridge preservation technique in maintaining height and width of residual alveolar ridge immediately after extraction. Human teeth allografts were prepared for the first time in India. They have shown more promising results as compared to FDBA in achieving minimum volumetric alveolar bone loss in alveolar ridge preservation procedure. Histological evidence of new bone formation by teeth allografts corroborated better clinical and radiographical results by them. Derived from an extracted human tooth, it is the most easily available and cost-effective material. Thus, rather than disposing extracted teeth as biomedical waste, they can be collected from healthy donors (tested negative for triple H along with syphilis antigens) and syphilis and pooled together. At tissue banks, they can be processed in large batches into an allograft. Being an economical, natural, biocompatible, versatile, and predictable grafting material and having demonstrated better results, it can serve as a better alternative to most of the conventional allografts. This opens up whole new avenue of deciduous as well as permanent exfoliated and extracted teeth banking. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to establish its regenerative potential in various periodontal defects.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the valuable support and timely guidance given by Dr. (Ms) Astrid Lobo Gajiwala, Tissue Bank, Tata Memorial Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, India.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>TW</given-names></name><name><surname>Muschler</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone graft materials.
