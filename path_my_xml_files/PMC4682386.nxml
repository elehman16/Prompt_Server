However, it is well established that breast milk also provides a direct immune defence against pathogens through immune cells and molecules such as immunoglobulin and lysozymes.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Additionally, observational studies have demonstrated a negative association between breastfeeding and the development of immune related diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, ulcerous colitis and coeliac disease[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This suggests that breastfeeding also has long lasting consequences through its early influence on the developing immune system. Allergy related diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC), are also considered to be a result of an altered immune system development during infancy, however the association between breastfeeding and these diseases remains controversial.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various components of breast milk have been suggested to contribute to its long term immunological effects, including growth factors, cytokines and more recently microRNAs.</p><p>MicroRNAs are a group of short, non-coding, RNA molecules (~22 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Extracellular miRNAs have been identified in several body fluids including serum, breast milk, amniotic fluid and urine.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These miRNAs are protected from RNase activity through their association with extracellular vesicles and proteins, such as Argonaute-2 (Ago2)[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and they have come under particular attention because of their potential role in intercellular communication. Compared to other body fluids, breast milk has a large quantity of total-RNA[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a high proportion of miRNAs in breast milk are considered to be &#x0201c;immune-related&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This has led to the hypothesis that breast milk miRNAs are one of the mechanisms that breastfeeding affects the early development of an infant&#x02019;s immune system. In support of the biological plausibility of this hypothesis, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that breast milk miRNAs are stable under a variety of harsh conditions, including prolonged exposure to acidic solutions simulating the stomach environment[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and animal studies have suggested that the miRNA expression in milk is correlated with that of serum samples from suckling infants.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The breast milk samples analysed in this study were collected during the Probiotics in the Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim (ProPACT) trial, which demonstrated that perinatal ingestion of probiotics by mothers reduced the cumulative incidence of AD by 40% at 2 years of age.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This is a reproducible finding with two meta-analyses demonstrating a beneficial effect of maternal and or infant probiotic supplementation in the primary prevention of AD.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These meta-analyses also indicate that postnatal supplementation is necessary to prevent AD, yet prenatal supplementation appears to strengthen the preventative effect. The biological mechanisms which mediate these effects are incompletely understood. In the current study we investigated the possibility that the prevention of AD is partially mediated by alterations in breast milk miRNAs.</p><p>The aim of this study was three-fold: first, to determine the miRNA profile of human breast milk samples in the largest collection of human milk samples to date, second, to examine if this profile is influenced by maternal probiotic supplementation and third, to assess if any changes in the miRNA profile are associated with the development of AD in offspring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Breast milk samples were collected from women who participated in the ProPACT trial, a placebo controlled, randomised trial investigating the effect of maternal probiotic supplementation on the development of allergic diseases in early childhood as described elsewhere.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Briefly, 415 pregnant women living in Trondheim, Norway, and who intended to breastfeed were randomised to receive equivalently tasting study milk containing probiotic bacteria or sterile cultured milk as a placebo from 36 weeks gestation until 3 months postnatal.

To ensure all RNA fragments were collected, the isolated RNA was eluted twice using 50&#x003bc;l RNase-free each time. The concentration of total RNA was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) and selected samples were analysed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit for total RNA and Small RNA kit for a focused review of the small RNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline</title><p>Small RNA sequencing was conducted by Ocean Ridge Biosciences (ORB, Palm Beach Gardens, FL).

Raw reads were processed with cutadapt.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Low-quality bases (&#x0003c;20) were removed from reads before adapter removal and the final reads were required to have a length of at least 17 bp. Mapping of reads to the human genome was done with STAR version 2.4.0[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], requiring a perfect match alignment. featureCounts version 1.4.0[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was then used to count every hit of miRNAs in miRBase version 20, and finally a count matrix was produced by local scripting.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analysis and functional predictions</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.03[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. miRNA read counts were standardised and assessed for differential expression using the voom[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and limma[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] packages, respectively. Due to the varying proportions of miRNA in each sample, the mature miRNA reads were normalised to the total number of reads matched to mature miRNAs to create a count per million (cpm) value for each miRNA. Within the limma package, a linear model[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was fitted to the data based on treatment allocation and development of AD. Subsequently, comparisons were made to assess the marginal effect of probiotic treatment and AD development on the expression levels for each miRNA. Comparisons were limited to miRNAs which had an expression level of &#x02265;500 cpm in &#x02265;4 samples (n = 125) in order to increase the likelihood of identifying biologically significant differences. The marginal effects of treatment allocation and AD diagnosis were also assessed in an alternate model which included maternal atopy and the presence of older siblings as covariates. A raw p-value of &#x02264;0.05 was considered of potential interest and false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled for using the Benjamini-Hochberg method[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with a FDR of &#x02264;0.05 being considered acceptable.</p><p>Potential target genes were predicted for the 20 most highly expressed miRNAs and each of the differentially expressed miRNA lists using a locally executed TargetScan version 7.0 algorithm[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with an upper threshold for the context score at -0.2.

These functional clusters were particularly related to predicted targets of down-regulated breast milk miRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we present the miRNA sequencing results from breast milk samples collected 3 months postpartum from 32 women who received probiotic milk and 22 who received placebo milk during the ProPACT trial.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Considering first the general miRNA profile of these samples, we found a relatively stable core group of highly expressed miRNAs which are predicted to have a wide range of potential biological effects. We also investigated the effect of maternal probiotic ingestion on the relative abundance of breast milk miRNAs and the association of individual miRNAs with the development of AD. On both of these accounts we observed no conclusive evidence of differentially expressed miRNAs. As such, individual breast milk miRNAs at 3 months postpartum are unlikely to play a major role in the mechanism behind the observed preventative effect of perinatal probiotics on AD.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Before further discussing the main findings, we first highlight the strengths and limitations of this study.</p><p>The major strength of this study is that it is the largest sequencing analysis of human milk small RNAs to date, allowing characterisation of the general profile of breast milk miRNAs at 3 months postpartum. In using a single collection time point we did not need to consider the temporal variation in breast milk miRNA[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We were also able to investigate the relationship between miRNA expression levels and maternal probiotic ingestion and the development of AD in offspring because of the underlying RCT design. For this purpose, we acknowledge that one of the weaknesses of this study is that the sample size only allows us to detect large differences in expression levels. Furthermore, the sample selection criteria favoured the inclusion of mother-infant pairs where the infant had developed AD and there was a maternal or familial history of allergy related disease, particularly in the placebo group. We fitted an alternate model, which included maternal atopy and siblings as covariates, to investigate if the selection procedure had affected the results. The miRNAs identified as differentially expressed in association with treatment allocation and AD development were unchanged in this alternate model. Information regarding maternal antibiotic use was not recorded, however we do not believe that the lack of this information has substantially affected our conclusions.</p><p>Other weaknesses and methodological limitations of this study include the age of the samples, extracellular vesicle isolation, and functional analysis methods. The breast milk samples had been stored for between 7 and 9 years prior to analysis and, although breast milk miRNAs are reported to be stable, it is unclear whether prolonged storage alters the general miRNA profile of human milk. Reassuringly, we found no relationship between the amount of RNA isolated and the age of the samples (data not shown). Recent methodological papers suggest that our extracellular vesicle isolation method would have maximised the quantity of RNA isolated[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but in doing so has captured protein-miRNA complexes which are both extracellular and extravesicular[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as extracellular vesicles released by lysed maternal cells upon freezing.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The current article is primarily interested in the biologically available miRNAs in human breast milk and we consider our isolation procedure to be a reasonable approach given infants ingest breast milk in its entirety, extracellular vesicles, protein-miRNA complexes and maternal cells included. In support of this thinking, Gu et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated relationships between several porcine milk miRNAs and their serum levels in suckling piglets using near identical preparation methods on previously frozen samples. Whilst Gu et al&#x02019;s findings imply that milk miRNAs are biologically available after ingestion, the investigation of the functional consequences of milk miRNAs is complicated and the available functional prediction tools have certain limitations. Specifically, gene targets are predicted rather than validated and no available tools simultaneously account for the relative abundance of the miRNAs, the number of miRNA-target interactions for any given miRNA or target, and the downstream effects of these interactions. We consider our functional annotation results to be speculative. All the same, evidence from experimental and animal studies suggests that breast milk miRNAs are stable[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and biologically active after ingestion[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which opens up the possibility that they may be involved in maternal guidance of the developing immune system and gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>The five most abundant miRNAs identified in the breast milk samples were miR-148a-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-30d-5p, let-7b-5p and miR-200a-3p. These 5 miRNAs were consistently highly expressed in all samples whilst other miRNAs showed greater variability in their relative ranking and are perhaps more influenced by individual characteristics, such as genetics, age, parity, diet or other environmental factors. Previous studies of human milk miRNA have also observed that a few highly expressed miRNAs are responsible for the majority of miRNA counts[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], yet the list over the top 10 or 20 miRNAs varies between studies (<xref rid="pone.0143496.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It would appear that the miRNA profile is particularly influenced by the miRNA quantification method, and may also depend on the milk fraction used for RNA isolation, time postpartum, ethnicity of the women and the dietary or environmental exposures of their cultures, and the bioinformatics pipeline used for filtering and alignment. Notably, the two sequencing analyses by Zhou et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Munch et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed the greatest similarity to the profile we observed despite the varying ethnic backgrounds. This would suggest that our results are generalisable beyond the predominantly Caucasian population included in the ProPACT study. Interestingly, the study by Munch et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] isolated miRNA from the lipid fraction of breast milk, yet observed a very similar miRNA profile to the extracellular vesicle enriched milk samples of the current study and Zhou et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The biological significance of this observation is uncertain, however it may suggest that even if miRNAs are preferentially selected into breast milk, their inclusion into extracellular vesicles or association with the lipid fraction may be less important for their biological actions.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0143496.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143496.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Comparison of timing, methods and results of the current study and previous studies of human breast milk miRNA.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0143496.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0143496.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Author (year)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time postpartum</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Method miRNA quantification</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Breast milk portion</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comments and most highly expressed miRNAs<xref rid="t003fn002" ref-type="table-fn">

The ultimate effect of the cooperative regulation by breast milk miRNAs is difficult to decipher from this analysis. We have considered the intestinal epithelium to be the most likely first site of action in the infant and in support of this theory epithelial tissues were identified as having a gene enrichment profile that significantly overlaps with the predicted gene targets for the top 20 breast milk miRNAs. Following the birth of a healthy term infant, the intestinal tract matures resulting in a less permeable epithelium.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The early establishment of a well-functioning intestinal barrier is thought to be integral in the normal development of the immune system and a defective intestinal barrier in early infancy has been linked to several infant gastrointestinal diseases and a predisposition to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases later in life, including atopic dermatitis.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Breast milk appears to assist this maturation process through growth factors, hormones and cytokines, and studies have shown breastfeeding to be associated with reduced intestinal permeability[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], morphological maturation[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and altered intestinal gene expression[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in the early neonatal period. Additionally, the intestinal microbiota composition and diversity is also considered to be involved in promoting intestinal maturity and breast milk is thought to promote a &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; microbiota by transferring microbes, prebiotic milk oligosaccharides and by encouraging an anti-inflammatory, environment allowing microbial tolerance.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] We propose that breast milk miRNAs may be another factor contributing to intestinal maturation and microbiome establishment. Experimental evidence in support of this theory comes from mouse studies which have demonstrated improved epithelial barrier function associated with miR-146b[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], involvement of miR-375 in epithelium-immune system crosstalk[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and promotion of innate immune tolerance in the neonatal period by miR-146a[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although miR-146a was not highly expressed in breast milk samples, the more highly expressed miR-146b also targets interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (<italic>IRAK1</italic>), a Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling molecule thought to be involved in the miR-146a mediated promotion of immune tolerance. Unfortunately, it is difficult to isolate the effects of breast milk miRNAs from other biologically active components of breast milk. In a pig experiment, Hu et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that weaning was associated with increased permeability and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in piglets, altered morphology and increased permeability. Interestingly, the analysis of gene targets of highly expressed breast milk miRNAs revealed enrichment of the MAPK signalling pathway. The results of Hu et al[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] would be consistent with a loss of a breast milk miRNA mediated down regulation of these pathways after weaning. On the other hand, gene expression analysis of intestinal epithelial cells from breastfed and formula fed human infants reveals that target genes of the top 20 miRNA are both up and down regulated in the breast fed infants[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], indicating that the biological consequences of breast milk miRNAs are either minimal or substantially more complex.</p><p>Looking to other mammalian species, there are similarities in the milk miRNA profile of pigs[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143496.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], cows[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], rats[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and tammar wallabies[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In particular, miR-148a, miR-30a, let-7a, let-7b and let-7f are reported to be expressed in moderate to high quantities across these species. The conservation of these miRNA, not only in their structural nature, but in their inclusion in breast milk over several mammalian species, implies that they are evolutionarily selected and have beneficial roles for the mother and or her offspring. With this in mind, it is perhaps not surprising that a four month dietary intervention did not convincingly affect the breast milk miRNA profile.</p><p>A number of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified on comparison between the probiotic and placebo group and between samples from mothers whose children did and did not develop AD. None of these miRNAs had an acceptable FDR after controlling for multiple comparisons. Maternal probiotic ingestion was associated with four differentially expressed miRNAs with low abundance (miR-574-3p, let-7d-3p, miR-340-5p and miR-218-5p). As such, we found no conclusive evidence to suggest that maternal probiotic ingestion significantly alters the relative abundance of individual miRNAs and is therefore not a major mechanism by which the protective effect of probiotics is conveyed to the newborn infant. On the other hand, a number of breast milk miRNAs found to be associated with the development of atopic dermatitis were the relatively highly expressed miRNAs: miR-22-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-375 and let-7f-5p. Curiously, the upregulation of let-7d-3p and miR-375 and downregulation of miR-21-3p and miR-146b-5p are opposite to what one would have expected based on a previously published review of miRNAs in allergic diseases[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is unclear what the biological significance this observation has in terms of the impact of breast milk miRNAs and the development of allergic disease.</p><p>The functional annotation results are speculative and further research will need to investigate the biological availability and function of these miRNAs. It will be particularly useful to establish models to assess the cooperative gene regulation of breast milk miRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, as a group. Such experiments and bioinformatics models may shed light on the biologically plausibility of a relationship between AD and the miRNAs differentially expressed in association with probiotic ingestion, something which is doubtful from this analysis. This study sequenced samples taken 3 months postpartum, at the end of the intervention period, however colostrum samples taken in the first 10&#x02013;14 days postpartum may reveal a different profile with greater influence on the development of AD. Another line of future enquiry is to characterise and investigate the function of other short non-coding RNAs, such as fragmented tRNAs, which have also been reported in other extracellular vesicles isolated from other body fluids.[<xref rid="pone.0143496.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, there appears to be a stable group of core breast milk miRNAs, which are at least partially conserved across a number of mammalian species. The biological functions of this, presumably evolutionarily-driven, collection of miRNAs is uncertain. Functional analysis of the potential target genes of highly expressed breast milk miRNAs revealed enrichment in a broad range of biological processes and molecular functions. Although several miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed on comparison of the probiotic and placebo groups and AD vs non-AD, none had an acceptable FDR and their biological significance on the development of AD is not immediately apparent from functional analysis. Future experimental and bioinformatics techniques should investigate the biological consequences of highly and differentially expressed miRNAs as a group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143496.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.
