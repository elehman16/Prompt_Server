Patients were randomized to receive the test drug, a prefilled pen (Metex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PEN/Metoject<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PEN), or the reference drug, a prefilled syringe (Metex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Metoject<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), at doses of 15, 17.5, or 20 mg MTX SC once a week for 3 weeks. This was followed by receipt of the reference drug (prefilled syringe) or the test drug (prefilled pen) in a crossover design, with each patient serving as his/her own control. Questionnaires regarding patient preference, the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ), and diaries regarding local tolerability were used to document outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall patient preference for the MTX prefilled pen was 75% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). In a six-item questionnaire, 73% to 76% of the patients preferred the prefilled pen in relation to use, acceptability, and satisfaction, and 67% of the patients confirmed that it did not take much effort to overcome SC self-injection with the pen. The SIAQ showed no clinical differences, in any domain scores, between both devices. Overall patient attitude towards self-injection at baseline was positive, as was patient experience with both devices during the study. As well, 92% of physicians and study nurses indicated that they would recommend the MTX prefilled pen to patients for future MTX treatment. The formulations were generally well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SC self-injection of MTX with a prefilled pen was generally preferred, by patients with RA, over a prefilled syringe with regard to use, acceptability, and satisfaction. This is supported by the strong appreciation of their attending study nurses and physicians, for its convenience.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>methotrexate</kwd><kwd>injection device</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) has become the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) of choice in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Patients then received the reference drug (prefilled syringe) or the test drug (prefilled pen) in a crossover design, with each patient serving as his/her own control. The SC injections were applied in the abdomen or the upper thigh. Patients were to use a different injection site each time, to minimize any reactions at the injection site. Before the first injection, patients were made familiar with each injection system by the study nurse or the investigator. The first injection was done by the patient himself in the investigator&#x02019;s office under the supervision of the investigator or study nurse. The following two injections were to be performed at home; however, if the patient did not feel comfortable to inject at home, he had the opportunity to perform further injections in the investigator&#x02019;s office. The total treatment duration was 6 weeks, and the MTX dose was to be kept stable during this period.</p><p>The study included patients who (1) were MTX-na&#x000ef;ve or had already been treated with oral MTX previously, and (2) had no contraindication for MTX at baseline. The patients had to have disease activity at baseline (DAS28 &#x0003e;2.6) and to require a treatment with MTX, according to their rheumatologist. For these patients, an initiation or an intensification of the MTX treatment was indicated (eg, MTX therapy was switched from oral to parenteral), and the MTX dose was to be increased when necessary. As many rheumatologists in Germany start MTX treatment at a dose of 15 mg, the dosage proposed in this study was 15 mg, 17.5 mg, or 20 mg weekly.</p><p>Prior and concomitant therapy with other DMARDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or corticosteroids was permitted, as was treatment with oral folic acid once a week. All concomitant medications were to be kept constant during the study.</p><p>The following medications were not allowed: prior or combination therapies with a biological DMARD (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-&#x003b1; blockers); drugs causing folate deficiency (eg, sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) (during the study); and live virus vaccinations.</p><p>Patients meeting all eligibility criteria were randomized centrally, by the sponsor via fax, to one of the two treatment sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary end point</title><p>The primary end point was the number of patients preferring the MTX prefilled pen over the prefilled syringe after 6 weeks of treatment, based on the question &#x0201c;Overall, if you could choose, which of both self-injection systems would you prefer for future MTX treatment?&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary end points</title><p>Secondary end points included the following: (1) number of patients preferring the MTX prefilled pen over the prefilled syringe at the end of study, based on a six-item questionnaire related to the overall ease of use, acceptability, and satisfaction; (2) comparison of the self-injection experience of the patients after each treatment period, using the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) version 2.0;<xref rid="b15-ppa-8-1061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (3) number of study nurses and investigators preferring the MTX prefilled pen at the end of study; (4) documentation of pen dysfunction, with respect to any information identifying and describing incidents in which the prefilled pen was misused, broken, incapable of being activated, or did not deliver the appropriate dose.

Hepatic enzyme increases included elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (129 U/L) in one patient and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (207 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (306 U/L) in another patient; all were reported at the time of the fourth injection. No relevant differences between the two devices were present with regard to number and type of AEs. None of the AEs was considered serious.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized, open-label, crossover study, 76% of all patients with RA expressed their overall preference with the MTX prefilled pen over the prefilled syringe, the result being highly statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>,0.0001). Subgroup stratifications for age, sex, BMI, previous MTX treatment, and baseline DAS28 score yielded similar results. For all subgroups, the preference for the MTX prefilled pen ranged from 73% to 85%, and the lower limits of the respective 95% CIs were well above 50%.</p><p>This preference for the prefilled pen was further supported by the results of the six-item questionnaire assessing use, acceptability, and satisfaction. For all but one item, patient preference for the prefilled pen ranged from 73% to 76%. About two-thirds (67%) of the patients confirmed that the use of the prefilled pen did not take much effort to overcome self-injection.</p><p>The positive patient perception of the MTX prefilled pen was also confirmed by the nurses and investigators involved in this study, who reported &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; experience for all patients at their site with the prefilled pen. All but one site would recommend the prefilled pen for the future treatment of their patients. However, due to the small number of participating investigators or nurses (n=12), these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Results from the SIAQ showed no clinically relevant differences between both devices in all domain scores of the SIAQ POST module. Generally, overall patient attitude towards self-injection at baseline was positive, as was patient experience with both devices during the study. However, testing differences in mean scores between both devices revealed two domains with significantly different scores: the score for the domain &#x0201c;self-image&#x0201d; was significantly higher for the pen and the score for the domain &#x0201c;self-confidence&#x0201d; was significantly higher for the syringe.</p><p>Whereas questionnaire outcomes concerning overall preference, use, acceptability, and satisfaction clearly favored the use of the prefilled pen, the SIAQ POST module domain and item scores showed no patient preference towards either of the two devices.</p><p>Regarding device dysfunction and misuse, as reported in patient diaries, nine patients were unable to inject the whole solution volume, seven were unable to activate the injection device, three reported a defect, and nine reported other difficulties. In relation to the total number of used MTX prefilled pens (n=347), the whole solution was not injectable in 3%, the injection device was not activated in 2%, a defect was reported in 1%, and other difficulties were reported in 5%. As clarification of data in the diary entries was not possible, some inconsistencies and redundancies could not be avoided; among these, a review of individual comments revealed that for six patients, one injection per patient was not performed with the initial pen, which had to be replaced. All other patient reports were related to observations, incorrect use of the pen, or difficulties in pen use.</p><p>These reported difficulties or inability to use the pen may be imputed to insufficient training at the physicians&#x02019; offices, to limitation in the use of the pen by the patients, or to pen-related technical problems.</p><p>Three of the six pens that required replacement were from a single investigator site and the need for replacement may have been due to insufficient device training at this site. Moreover, looking at the inability to inject the entire solution volume revealed an increased occurrence at the second injection in comparison with the third injection, for the prefilled pens. This time point corresponds to the first injection by the patient at home, without any supervision by a health care professional, suggesting the number of problems encountered by the patients may decrease with the number of injections performed. As the patients reported difficulties or inability to use the pen while they were at home, the issues were not evaluated by a health care professional and therefore cannot definitely be clarified here.</p><p>With regard to local tolerability at the injection site, significantly more patients experienced pain when using the pen compared with the syringe (<italic>P</italic>=0.0019), and significantly more patients experienced redness when using the syringe compared with the pen (<italic>P</italic>=0.0421). Both formulation devices were generally well tolerated.</p><p>Often, patients associate SC injections with pain, discomfort, blood, and cross infection. Compared with the syringe system, the prefilled pen enables a process, where &#x02013; for self-injection &#x02013; the patient simply presses a button and is therefore not directly involved with the needle, resulting in minimal anxiety and perception of pain. In addition, the needle cover minimizes the risk of needlestick injury. These advantages and the favorable patient, physician, and nurse assessments support the use of the prefilled pen for MTX administration in patients with RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SC self-injection of MTX with a prefilled pen was generally preferred over a prefilled syringe with regard to use, acceptability, and satisfaction, by patients with RA. This is supported by the strong appreciation of its convenience, by their attending study nurses and physicians.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank all patients and nursing staff involved in the study, as well as the following rheumatologists: M Bohl-B&#x000fc;hler, Potsdam; A Gause, Hamburg; B Heilig, Heidelberg; and P Wagener; Bruchhausen-Vilsen.</p><p>Martin Bornemann provided medical writing support on behalf of medac GmbH, Germany.
