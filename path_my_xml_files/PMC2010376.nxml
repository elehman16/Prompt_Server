This was started in January 1973 and concluded in April 1979. Sixty-seven patients were entered in the study and 31 were randomized for splenectomy. All patients except 2 received total nodal irradiation, excluding the splenic and hepatic areas. After 40 months' observation there was no difference between the groups in respect of survival and the number of recurrences. However, relapses occurred earlier in the splenectomized patients. Pneumococcal septicaemia was recorded in 2 splenectomized patients. It is concluded that prognosis is not improved by diagnostic splenectomy in HD patients with uncertain prognosis and treated with total nodal irradiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="284" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="285" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="286" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="287" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="288" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="289" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="290" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00455-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="291" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
