To our knowledge, this prejudice was never controlled scientifically. This is the first study to assess the capability of operating abdominal and orthopaedic surgeons to analyze a set of standardized ECG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>30 operating abdominal and orthopaedic surgeons at our university hospital were directly approached to volunteer for this study. Each participant analyzed a set of five standardized ECG with an answering scheme for eight different items, giving a maximum score of 40. The answers were matched according to specialty and experience of the doctors of less than 5 years, between 5 and 10 years or more than 10 years. The reference standard was set by two independent consultants in cardiology. All answers recollected within three months were included in the study.</p><p>Only correctly assessed items were accepted, unanswered items were regarded as incorrect. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's T-test and confidence intervals were calculated at 95%. Probability (p) levels of &#x0003c; 0.05 were accepted as significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty answers could be included, 12 from orthopaedic and 8 from abdominal surgeons. The mean overall score was 25.25 (63.13% &#x000b1; 4.78%) varying between 38 (95%) and 20(50%).</p><p>Abdominal surgeons performed a mean score of 27.625 (69.06% &#x000b1; 9.53%), and orthopaedic surgeons 23.67 points (59.17% &#x000b1; 3.69%). The difference between the performance of abdominal and orthopaedic surgeons was not significant (p = 0.09). Experienced surgeons seemed to perform slightly better than junior colleagues but no significant difference could be found among the subgroups. 20/20 surgeons identified ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and no surgeon accepted the ECG showing acute STEMI as normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Abdominal and orthopaedic surgeons provided an answering scheme are able to interprete the ECG and identify both the normal and the ECG showing life-threatening pathology. The hypothesis that surgeons were unable to interprete the ECG must be rejected.</p></sec></body></article>
