It accounts for approximately 6% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. It is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 456,000 new cases in 2012 (3.2% of the total) and the sixth most common cause of death from cancer with an estimated 400,000 deaths (4.9% of the total).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Around 80% of the cases worldwide occur in less developed regions. In 2012, the total number of cancer cases registered at Dr B. Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati were 7090, out of which esophageal cancer cases were 967 (13.6%).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis due to high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] About one-half of patients present with locally advanced stage at the time of diagnosis[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and have a 5-year survival rate of &#x0003c;30% after surgical resection or multimodality therapy. In the past decade, many single institutions and cooperative groups have investigated the use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) as a definitive treatment or as a preoperative treatment for patients with localized esophageal cancer. Definitive CCRT or preoperative CCRT with surgery results in better survival than single modality treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>A 2003 Cochrane review found that combined chemoradiotherapy led to an absolute increase in mortality difference of 7% at 2 years compared with radiation alone. Consequently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) esophageal cancer guidelines recommend preoperative CCRT or definitive CCRT for patients with Stage II or III esophageal cancer. However, in the setting of definitive CCRT, the dose of radiotherapy requires further investigation. In the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 94-05 study, which compared 50.4 Gy radiotherapy with 64.8 Gy radiotherapy in a CCRT setting, there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) and locoregional control (LRC) between the high and standard dose treatment arms.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that radiation dose &#x0003e;51 Gy improved locoregional control, disease-free survival, and survival in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. Yang-Gun Suh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also reported that high dose radiotherapy of 60 Gy or higher with concurrent chemotherapy improves locoregional control and progression-free survival and may also improve the survival of Stages II&#x02013;III esophageal cancer patients. Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, high-dose radiotherapy was a significant prognostic factor for improved LRC, PFS, and OS. Although 50.4 Gy is the standard dose as per evidence, many trials now support the use of high-dose radiotherapy &#x0003e;60 Gy which may have a better outcomes but needs to be validated in large groups with adequate support and evaluation.</p><p>In this study, we are further investigating the clinical response rates (local and distant control) in the standard-dose versus high-dose radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in esophageal cancer at our institute, i.e., Dr. B.

We demonstrated that high-dose radiotherapy has better clinical response than standard-dose radiotherapy without a significant increase in treatment-related mortalities or toxicities. However, the data is not statistically significant.</p><p>Although, NCCN esophageal cancer guidelines[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] recommend radiation dose of 50 or 50.4 Gy for definitive concurrent chemoradiation, radiation dose escalation for treating esophageal cancer should be studied further. The NCCN esophageal cancer radiation dose recommendations are based on the results of the RTOG 94-05 trial. RTOG 94-05 trial compared treatment response to concurrent chemoradiation using 64.8 Gy versus 50.4 Gy radiotherapy in patients with Stages I&#x02013;III squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This trial failed to show that high-dose radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy had any advantage over standard-dose radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths were more frequent in the high-dose group than the standard-dose group, and patients in the high-dose group tended to have a worse prognosis. However, 7 of the 11 deaths in the high-dose arm occurred in patients who received 50.4 Gy or less; therefore, high-dose radiation was not responsible for the increased mortality in this group. The potential benefits of high-dose radiotherapy for esophageal cancer should, therefore, not be ignored based only on this study. In our study, we have found higher rate of complete response in high-dose group compared to standard-dose group with almost similar toxicity in both the treatment groups without much effect (no treatment interruptions) on the treatment protocols.</p><p>A recent randomized clinical trial comparing surgery alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with T1N1 or T2-3N0-1 esophageal cancer showed that preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric junction tumor.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this study, chemoradiation followed by surgery showed excellent outcomes with median OS of 49.4 months. However, two randomized clinical trials and a recent meta-analysis, which compared chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery failed to show benefit of surgery on OS, while the addition of surgery to chemoradiation improved local control.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, this improvement in local control rate may not be entirely due to radiotherapy. However, surgery after RT improved local control rates in these patients. Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 52.1% to 76.5%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7%; 95% CI, 28.9% to 52.5%).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and 2-year-local control rate was 66.4% in patients with chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with 57% in patients with chemoradiation alone, and stents were also less required in the surgery arm (5% vs. 32%).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Although the survival rate has been slowly improving likely because of multimodality strategies and improved supportive care, the survival rate remains modest at 20% at 5 years. Considering the high local failure rates after 50 Gy[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for patients that are not going to be candidates for surgery after peroperative or radical RT, or surgery can not be possible due to comorbitities or patient's wish, we think that high-dose radiotherpy (plus concurrent chemotherapy) should be the optimal treatment in these groups of patients. Surgery might be preserved as a salvage option if there is a residual disease after high dose RT in selected patients. Therefore, many institutions now have adopted high-dose (60 Gy or higher) radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer. In our institution, we also practice high-dose (63 Gy) radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy for the patients in whom surgery is not considered as an option. Our study also strengthed the use of high-dose radiotherpay with concurrent chemotherapy in our patients with acceptable toxicity compared to the standard dose RT. However, due to lack of definite level 1 data in favor of high-dose, it is difficult to conclude that high-dose radiotherapy is really beneficial in terms of local control rate or OS without causing much toxicity. The present study was taken to answer this unresolved issue. In this study, we found that high-dose radiotherapy is more effective without producing significant toxicities. Although the result was not statistically significant, it showed trends toward improved control rate. The main limitation in our study was the small sample size and short follow-up period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The high-dose radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy is an effective treatment for Stages I&#x02013;III esophageal cancer with acceptable toxicity.
