Bupivacaine is used for PVB at higher concentrations (0.5%), which may lead to systemic toxicity after absorption. Therefore, we proposed to evaluate the efficacy of lower concentrations of bupivacaine with and without fentanyl for thoracic PVB in patients undergoing surgery for carcinoma breast.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty-eight patients scheduled for surgery for breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial and were allocated to one of four groups: 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 5 mcg/ ml, 0.25% bupivacaine + epinephrine 5 mcg/ ml with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl, 0.5% bupivacaine + epinephrine 5 mcg/ml or isotonic saline. PVB was performed and 0.3 ml/kg of the test drug was administered before induction of general anaesthesia. The primary outcome assessed was post-operative analgesic requirement for a period of 24 h. Secondary outcome measures were post-operative pain scores at rest and on movement of the arm, latency to first opioid, post-operative nausea and vomiting, quality of sleep, ability to move arm and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The patient characteristics and anaesthetic technique were comparable among the groups.

The exclusion criteria were local infection, anatomic deformities of the spine, coagulation disorders, morbid obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m <sup>2</sup>), allergy to local anaesthetics, patient refusal, severe respiratory or cardiac disorders, pre-existing neurological deficits, liver or renal insufficiency, pregnancy or breast feeding and breast reconstruction surgery.</p><p>During the pre-anaesthetic assessment, informed consent was obtained and patients were educated about reporting pain on the 11-point verbal rating scale (VRS),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] where 0=no pain and 10=worst imaginable pain. Oral diazepam 0.1 mg/kg was administered the night before and on the morning of surgery. Before induction of anaesthesia, all patients received PVB and were assigned to one of the four groups of 12 each using a computer-generated random number assignment in sealed opaque envelopes &#x02013; 0.25% bupivacaine+ epinephrine 5 &#x003bc;g/ml (Group B.25), 0.25% bupivacaine+ epinephrine 5 &#x003bc;g/ml+fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml (Group FB.25), 0.5% bupivacaine+epinephrine 5 &#x003bc;g/ml (Group B.5) and normal saline (Group NS).</p><p>On arrival to the operating room, monitoring lines were established for non-invasive blood pressure measurements, continuous electrocardiography and pulse oximetry. The patients were sedated with midazolam 1 mg i.v. They were placed in the lateral position with the side to be blocked and operated uppermost. A 26-gauge needle was inserted 2.5 cm lateral to the T3 spine and skin, subcutaneous tissue and periosteum of the transverse process were anaesthetized with 2&#x02013;5 ml of lignocaine 10 mg/ml. The PVB was performed with an 18-gauge Tuohy needle using the loss-of-resistance technique, seeking contact with the lateral process of T3 as a landmark before advancing the needle into the paravertebral space. 0.3 ml/kg of the drug/normal saline was injected into the paravertebral space according to assignment. A staff anaesthesiologist not involved in the management of the patient or study prepared the injectate according to randomization. The patients and all staff involved in patient management and data collection were unaware of the group assignment.</p><p>The patients were turned supine to induce general anaesthesia with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. and propofol 2&#x02013;3 mg/kg followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion 100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. Additional boluses of fentanyl 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. were given if heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) increased more than 20% from the pre-operative baseline. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and the trachea was extubated on return of consciousness. Intraoperative monitoring included continuous electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 5 min.</p><p>After emergence from anaesthesia, the patients were transferred to the post-op recovery room where pain was assessed by a blinded observer both at rest and on movement of the shoulder using VRS. Assessments were carried out every 5 min till 30 min and subsequently at 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h. Analgesia in the recovery room was provided by i.v. morphine 0.05 mg/kg boluses to maintain VRS&#x0003c;3. PONV was assessed on a 3-point scale (ref), where 0=no nausea, no vomiting; 1=nausea present, no vomiting; 2=vomiting present with or without nausea. Injection of ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg was administered if the PONV score was &#x02265;1. At the end of 24 h, patient satisfaction was assessed with the Numerical Rating scale (NRS) (0=dissatisfied and 10=most satisfied) and quality of overnight sleep on a 3-point scale (0=no sleep, 1=intermittently disturbed sleep, 2=good sleep).</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on a pilot study, which indicated that the mean&#x000b1;SD 24-h consumption of morphine following mastectomy under general anaesthesia was 15&#x000b1;8 mg. Administration of PVB is associated with 75% reduction in the 24-h consumption of morphine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Twelve patients were required in each group to demonstrate this difference, with type 1 error of 0.05 and type 2 error of 0.1.</p><p>The parametric data are expressed as mean (SD) and analysed using one-way analysis of variance. The non-parametric data are expressed as median (IQR) and analysed using the Kruskal Wallis test. Further comparisons between the groups were done by the Mann-Whitney U test. The Kaplan Meir survival graph was used to analyse the post-operative pain-free interval. All analyses were performed using SPSS v13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 was taken to be significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All the 48 enrolled patients completed the study protocol.

One patient experienced nausea in group NS. No complication possibly associated with PVB, such as pain or soreness at injection site, hypotension, interpleural injection, pneumothorax or dural puncture, was encountered. The quality of overnight sleep and overall patient satisfaction were significantly better in groups FB.25 and B.5 (<italic>P</italic>=0.036 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, respectively), correlating to the duration of analgesia in these two groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we have demonstrated that patients who receive PVB with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine+fentanyl or 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine in addition to general anaesthesia experience significantly better post-operative analgesia as compared with PVB with 0.25% bupivacaine+epinephrine and general anaesthesia or general anaesthesia alone. Cumulative rescue analgesic consumption in the first 24 h was significantly lower in the 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine+fentanyl and 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine groups compared with the 0.25% bupivacaine+epinephrine and control groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.003). Earlier investigators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] have also observed a similar efficacy of PVB for breast carcinoma surgery.</p><p>We have been able to highlight the utility of fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml as an adjuvant in PVB. The addition of fentanyl to a lower concentration (0.25%) of bupivacaine provided similar post-operative analgesia as 0.5% bupivacaine. Fentanyl administered through the paravertebral route may contribute to analgesia by acting on opioid receptors found in the dorsal root ganglia structures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Barlacu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] used levobupivacaine with fentanyl 4 &#x003bc;g/ml infusion for post-operative analgesia paravertebrally, and reported that patients experienced side-effects like nausea and pruritus. They had suggested that further work is required to determine the lowest effective dose of fentanyl. When plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml and clonidine were analysed following PVB during breast surgery, it was found that plasma levels of levobupivacaine were within the safe range, and plasma levels of fentanyl and clonidine were less than the effective levels after IV administration, suggesting that their analgesic effect may be partly attributed to a peripheral mechanism of action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] In view of the increased incidence of side-effects with 4 &#x003bc;g/ml, we used fentanyl in a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, and observed that the incidence of nausea and vomiting were similar to patients where fentanyl was not used.</p><p>As effective analgesia/anaesthesia with PVB using single-level injection requires a large volume, decreasing the concentration of the local anaesthetic agent would confer increased safety as the risk of systemic toxicity is reduced by decreasing the total dose used. There are reports of adverse sequelae such as convulsions when bupivacaine was used in higher concentration in larger volume.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Kairaluoma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] who used 0.5% bupivacaine in PVB, had measured plasma concentrations of bupivacaine and reported that there was great interindividual variation in the total plasma concentrations of bupivacaine. The highest mean plasma bupivacaine concentration of 750 ng/ml occurred 20 min after injection. In this series, one patient developed seizures when a total dose of 120 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected.</p><p>We had hypothesized that use of lower concentration of bupivacaine (0.25%) may result in lower plasma levels and, thus, offer better margin of safety. However, lower concentrations and thus lower doses may have a shorter duration of analgesia compared with 0.5% bupivacaine, which is confirmed by our findings in Group B.25. We had proposed to overcome this limitation by the addition of fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml to 0.25% bupivacaine. The results demonstrate that analgesic consumption, pain scores and duration of analgesia were comparable between patients who received PVB with 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.25% bupivacaine+fentanyl.</p><p>Whether a multilevel injection of PVB (at C7-T6 or C7-T7) is superior to a single-injection technique for breast resection has not been evaluated. Published results on pain and recovery are quite similar. Although the incidences of pneumothorax and intravascular injection in PVBs are small, we find it logical to perceive that the risk of complications per patient increases when multiple injections are performed. Therefore, single-level thoracic PVB was used in our study design. However, it can be argued that single-level injection may lead to variable spread of the drug and also has a higher potential for inadvertent intravascular injection and systemic toxicity.</p><p>PONV in our study population was infrequent. The anti-emetic property of propofol used for induction of anaesthesia and administration of prophylactic ondansetron in our study may have contributed to this low incidence. One of the limitations of our study is that objective documentation of failure or adequacy of block using loss of perception to thermal stimuli or pin prick was not attempted. Also, the difference in serum concentrations of bupivacaine between PVB administered using 0.25% bupivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine was not measured.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Bupivacaine 0.25%+epinephrine combined with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml provides excellent post-operative analgesia comparable to bupivacaine 0.5%+epinephrine, with the advantage of a lesser toxicity profile when used for single-level thoracic PVB for breast surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
