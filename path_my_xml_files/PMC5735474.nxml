It is typically used in an emergency setting for patients at the risk of regurgitation/aspiration or raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Laryngoscopy and intubation performed during RSI lead to choroidal blood volume increase and an eventual rise in intraocular pressure (IOP).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Physiologic mechanisms maintain normal IOP between 11 and 21 mm Hg. Pressure must be maintained within this range to ensure constant corneal curvature and a proper refracting index of the eye.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Values higher than 25 mm Hg are considered to be pathologic and in case of a perforated globe could lead to the expulsion of intraocular contents.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Both depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants have been used for RSI. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants when used for this purpose are required in very high doses leading to unnecessary prolongation of duration of action. Among depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine (SCh) is the drug of choice for RSI.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is preferred in RSI because it has the fastest onset and shortest duration of action among all muscle relaxants. The former is a major point of consideration in the context of trauma care, where endotracheal intubation may need to be accomplished early. The latter means that, if attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the patient cannot be ventilated, there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before hypoxemia occurs. The use of SCh, however, causes an undesirable rise in IOP which is further aggravated by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This may prove hazardous in patients with penetrating eye injuries and patients with preexisting high IOP.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The mechanism of rise in IOP due to SCh is thought to be caused by the contraction of extraocular muscles although dilatation of choroidal vessels is a contributory factor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Various methods have been used to attenuate the effects of SCh on IOP; they include self-taming with 1/10<sup>th</sup> dose of SCh,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] pretreatment with nondepolarizing muscle relaxant[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the use of 300 &#x003bc;g per oral clonidine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, no modality has been devoid of drawbacks and limitations. With &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists, vasoconstrictor effects have been observed in several vascular beds, including the eye.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective centrally acting &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist that has IOP lowering properties.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It exerts its effects by binding to &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors pre- and postsynaptically in the locus ceruleus (a cluster of nerves that lies near the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle of brain) and in the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the role of dexmedetomidine at a selective dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg for attenuation of the increase in IOP due to RSI using SCh.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study was carried out in the Department of Anaesthesiology of a tertiary care teaching hospital after obtaining the clearance from Institutional Ethical Committee.</p><p>This study incorporated sixty adult patients in the age group of 20&#x02013;50 years scheduled for elective surgeries under general anesthesia.

The rationale behind RSI is to prevent aspiration and its potential problems including aspiration pneumonia and to counteract the increase in systemic arterial blood pressure, HR, plasma catecholamine release, ICP, and IOP that occur with endotracheal intubation. Avoiding an increase in IOP may be desirable, especially in the patients with glaucoma or acute eye injury.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>SCh, the only depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent currently available, has been used in innumerable patients since its introduction as a neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD) in 1952.

Since its chemical structure (i.e., quaternary ammonium compound) is similar to that of acetylcholine (ACh), it binds to the ACh receptors (AChRs) on the motor end plate and depolarizes the postjunctional neuromuscular membrane, resulting in continuous stimulation of the motor end plate AChRs. The major advantages of Sch are its rapid onset with complete motor paralysis occurring within 45&#x02013;60 s and short duration of action lasting only 6&#x02013;10 min when given in the recommended 1.5-mg/kg i.v. dose. Despite its rapid onset, SCh has several side effects such as hyperkalemia, bradycardia, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, increased ICP, increased IOP, trismus, fasciculations, and malignant hyperthermia, which limit its use in RSI.</p><p>It has been reported that SCh increases the IOP by 6&#x02013;8 mm Hg. Various methods have been used to attenuate the effects of SCh on IOP. They included self-taming, where a 1/10<sup>th</sup> dose of SCh is given initially followed by the remaining amount of SCh and pretreatment with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, lidocaine, opioids, nifedipine, or nitroglycerin.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, no modality was devoid of drawbacks and limitations. Rocuronium, an intermediate-acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant used commonly, provides good intubating condition after 60&#x02013;90s, but it is not preferred in patients with anticipated difficult airway.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist that has sedative and analgesic effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists provide potentially beneficial effects in ophthalmic surgery because of their IOP-lowering properties.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Recent studies have shown its successful use for attenuation of suxamethonium and SCh-induced IOP among patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, some authors have expressed reservations on the use of dexmedetomidine owing to its hemodynamic effect.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hence, the present study was carried out with an aim to evaluate the efficacy of i.v. infusion of dexmedetomidine premedication with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg in attenuating the rise of IOP caused by SCh in patients undergoing RSI for general anesthesia and to monitor and manage the side effects of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>For this purpose, a total of sixty adult patients in the age group of 20&#x02013;50 years scheduled for elective surgeries under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study and were randomly allocated to one of the two groups &#x02013; Group I included thirty patients who were given i.v. infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) diluted in normal saline to make a solution of 50 ml as premedication, over a period of 10 min and comprised the study group whereas the remaining 30 patients were given i.v. infusion of 50 ml normal saline as premedication, over a period of 10 min and comprised the control group of the study.</p><p>At baseline, both groups had matched mean values with mean IOP right eye of Group I being 12.90 &#x000b1; 1.94 mm Hg as compared to 13.08 &#x000b1; 1.91 mm Hg in Group II (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>At all the other time intervals from T2 to T8, IOP of the right eye of Group I was found to be lower than that of Group II. The difference in IOP of right eye of both the groups was found to be statistically significant at T2 to T6 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and statistically nonsignificant at T7 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.233) and T8 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.757).</p><p>With respect to change in IOP, in study group just after the conclusion of premedication, a decrease (&#x02212;2.83 &#x000b1; 0.65 mm Hg) in mean IOP was observed. Thirty seconds after the induction of anesthesia the decline reached to &#x02212;3.58 &#x000b1; 0.93 mm of Hg. Thirty seconds after SCh injection a slight increase in IOP was observed taking the difference to &#x02212;0.52 &#x000b1; 1.63 mm of Hg. Immediately after intubation, another increase in IOP was observed which led to take the gap from baseline to be &#x02212;0.26 &#x000b1; 1.78 mm of Hg. However, at 2 min and 4 min, postintubation intervals a declining trend of IOP was observed followed by a slight incline at 6 min. At 6 min postintubation interval, mean IOP was lower than baseline value by &#x02212;4.03 &#x000b1; 1.63 mm of Hg. At all the time intervals except 30 s post SCh injection and postintubation intervals, the difference from baseline was significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>In control group, premedication a decrease (&#x02212;0.67 &#x000b1; 0.60 mm Hg) in mean IOP was observed. Thirty seconds after induction of anesthesia, the decline reached to &#x02212;2.67 &#x000b1; 0.77 mm of Hg. Thirty seconds after SCh injection a slight increase in IOP was observed taking the difference to 2.87 &#x000b1; 1.81 mm of Hg. Immediately after intubation, another increase in IOP was observed which took the gap from baseline to 4.81 &#x000b1; 1.68 mm of Hg. However, at 2 min postintubation interval onward a declining trend of IOP was observed. At 6 min postintubation interval, mean IOP was lower than baseline value by 4.06 &#x000b1; 1.64 mm of Hg. At all the time intervals, the difference from baseline was significant statistically (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>On comparing the mean IOP levels in the two groups, at all time intervals except at baseline, 4 and 6 min postintubation intervals, mean IOP was significantly higher in control group as compared to the dexmedetomidine group.</p><p>The study findings showed that at all the time intervals dexmedetomidine had a better control on mean IOP. &#x003b1;-adrenergic blockers such as dexmedetomidine and clonidine have shown a good attenuating effect on IOP following SCh and suxamethonium use.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] For IOP trends similar to the present study were also obtained by Pal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who reported the use of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine infusion and found the comparable results for control of IOP following the use of suxamethonium as the muscle relaxant and rapid sequence intubation, for both the dosages and obtained significantly lower mean values in both groups as compared to control group. Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in their study using 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine found results exactly comparable to results in the present study. In the present study, maximum postintubation increase in IOP was nearly 36% in control group as compared to &#x02212;2% decline at the same time in dexmedetomidine group, thus showing the difference between two groups to be almost 38%.</p><p>The intraocular hypotensive effect of dexmedetomidine in the present study is consistent with the previous several researches on &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists. Clonidine was effective in preventing the rise of the IOP in response to SCh and endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Similar effects were shown in elderly patients during cataract surgery.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Only two studies till date have examined the effect of dexmedetomidine on the SCh-induced ocular hypertension.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>According to explanation given by Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the effect of dexmedetomidine on the IOP may be caused by a direct vasoconstrictor effect on the afferent blood vessels of the ciliary body, which results in reduction of aqueous humor production.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Moreover, it could increase outflow of the aqueous humor caused by a reduction of the sympathetically mediated vasomotor tone of the ocular drainage system.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, its associated hemodynamic response could contribute to the IOP lowering effect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The study findings showed that at all the time intervals dexmedetomidine had a better control on HR. Dexmedetomidine is an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor, presynaptic activation of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors inhibits the release of norepinephrine, terminating the propagation of pain signals. Postsynaptic activation of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors in the central nervous system inhibits sympathetic activity and thus can decrease blood pressure and HR.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] For HR trends, similar to the present study were also obtained by Pal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who reported the use of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine infusion and found the comparable results for control of HR following the use of suxamethonium as the muscle relaxant, for both the dosages and obtained significantly lower mean values in both the groups as compared to control group. Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in their study using 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine found results exactly comparable to results in the present study. In the present study, maximum postintubation increase in HR was 10% lower in dexmedetomidine group as compared to control group. The study findings showed that at all the time intervals, dexmedetomidine had a better control on MAP. Dexmedetomidine has a known blood pressure-lowering effect. It is a fast-acting blood pressure attenuating agent and has been shown to be quite successful in attenuation of hemodynamic reflex in endotracheal intubation and laryngoscopy for different procedures[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and has been shown to have comparable or better attenuating effect on pressor response as compared to a number of anesthetic drugs, namely, lidocaine, esmolol etc., at variable dosages ranging from 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg to 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg. For MAP trends similar to the present study were also obtained by Pal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who reported the use of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine infusion and found the comparable results for control of MAP following the use of suxamethonium as the muscle relaxant and rapid sequence intubation for both the dosages and obtained significantly lower mean values in both the groups as compared to control group.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is known to have a hypotensive effect.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, in the present study, no such effect was observed. In none of the patients, any withdrawal from the study owing to hypotensive effect of dexmedetomidine was observed. Contrary to our observations, Pal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported hypotension in two patients to be the reason for their withdrawal from the study. This finding could only be incidental as even higher dosages of dexmedetomidine when used to attenuate hemodynamic reflex following endotracheal intubation did not result in any such hypotensive effect leading to withdrawal from study.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that the effect of dexmedetomidine on the IOP changes after SCh and intubation could not be isolated from its action on the hemodynamics since both effects are parallel and a causal relationship cannot be denied. However, this limitation should not decline the potential advantage of using dexmedetomidine as an alternative agent to obtund the IOP changes of SCh and intubation.</p><p>Hence, it can be concluded that the rise of IOP with SCh and rapid sequence intubation can be blunted with i.v. dexmedetomidine premedication. The hemodynamic stability is an additional advantage. Further studies are recommended to corroborate the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The findings in the present study indicate that i.v. dexmedetomidine effectively attenuates the increases in IOP with an additional advantage of control on hemodynamic responses following RSI.
