Common elements of the HBI were as follows: (1) a home visit 7 to 14 days posthospitalization conducted by a registered cardiac nurse with tertiary qualifications; (2) comprehensive automated reports derived from baseline and home profiling providing treating physicians with recommendations to address any treatment or management deficits; (3) coordination of multidisciplinary follow-up; (4) telephone follow-up by the cardiac nurse with both scheduled and patient-initiated contacts; (5) a strong focus on the 6 months postindex hospitalization to address residual risk with reapplication of home visits if a patient experienced an unplanned hospitalization; and (6) structured review and generation of a comprehensive report and recommendations for optimal long-term management once active study management was discontinued.

Subsequent adjudication of the type and nature of recurrent hospitalizations were determined by each study&#x02019;s blinded end point committee. The primary end point for this composite analysis was event-free survival expressed as the proportion of actual versus maximal unplanned days-alive (a combined total of 1&#x02009;648&#x02009;560 days) and out-of-hospital (DAOH). For example, a patient who experienced 10 days of unplanned hospitalization and died on day 700 of 730 possible days follow-up achieved 690 of 730 DAOH (94.5% of maximal). The 2 components of this end point, all-cause deaths and days of unplanned hospitalization, were also examined separately. Hospitalization data (episodes and related overnight hospital stay) were also examined on an all-cause, unplanned, and cardiovascular-specific basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Profiling and outcome data from the 3 studies were pooled and analyzed using SPSS v22.0. Discrete variables were summarized by frequencies and percentages and continuous variables by means (standard deviation) and medians (interquartile range) where appropriate. Between-group comparisons of health outcomes (including the primary end point) were assessed by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. All efficacy analyses were undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis and blinded to group allocation. Multivariate analyses used the baseline variables listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Survival data were used to generate Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves and group comparisons analyzed with the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to derive adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for independent correlates of all-cause mortality using a backward, stepwise approach. All predictors included in the Cox model were from baseline and were not time varying. We tested only for covariates of mortality, not management group, because covariates were from baseline, and random assignment to treatment group will ensure no systematic effects beyond chance. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested for the effect of treatment by using time-weighted score tests and the assumption was not rejected (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Because of incomplete data for left ventricular ejection fraction (n=839) and cognitive function (n=1004), these 2 variables were initially excluded and then added to the final iteration to determine their impact on the explanatory variables. Patient hospital activity data (unplanned, all-cause, and cardiovascular related) were converted to the rate of hospitalizations and days of hospital stay per 100 days of follow-up. An exploration of the relative impact of HBI on being in the worst quintile of DAOH and experiencing a fatal event was conducted by including a condition&#x000d7;trial interaction in logistic regression models. We also explored the possibility that there was a differential intervention effect according to the age of the patient and their burden of disease (as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>); both were treated as continuous variables and tested by including a condition&#x000d7;age and condition&#x000d7;age<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or condition&#x000d7;comorbidities and condition&#x000d7;comorbidities<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> interaction terms in the regression models. Quadratic terms were included to allow the possibility that there was a U- or J-shaped pattern of interventional effect.

Absolute differences between groups were clinically compelling. These positive differences were monitored over 2 to 5 years follow-up in contrast to the frequent reporting of short-term outcomes in those exposed to a secondary prevention program.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For all-cause mortality, the number needed to treat to avert 1 additional death via the application of HBI was 21 patients. At the same time, HBI was associated with close to 600 fewer days of hospital stay per 100 patients. Overall, these unique data provide a strong case for extending the application of this model of care more widely to those hospitalized with any form of chronic heart disease.</p><p>The benefits of home-based models of care, with their ability to improve the contextual profiling of affected patients to strengthen factors shown to improve health outcomes are now well described.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Benefits include addressing often unknown issues such as cognitive impairment and clinical instability via an individualized, case management approach and improving self-care behaviors. Accordingly, across the 3 trials, there was evidence (albeit not definitive) of greater levels of healthcare engagement, more patient-initiated contacts, greater preservation of cardiac function through better blood pressure control, and more proactive uptitration of gold-standard therapies.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The model of care applied in this instance was initially developed and successfully applied<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> in patients with a broad range of chronic disease states before being specifically adapted for those with CHF; the subsequent trial report was the first to demonstrate both prolonged survival and reduced risk of recurrent hospitalization in this patient population.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Since then, the literature has consistently demonstrated that an in-person, multidisciplinary approach is superior to other modes of management (including remote management strategies) to improve health outcomes in CHF, and this is likely to be the case for all forms of chronic heart disease.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Based on the totality of evidence, expert guidelines have recommended the application of multidisciplinary, face-to-face programs of management for those hospitalized with CHF,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> resulting in a global network of such programs. However, there has been a paucity of research and evidence to demonstrate that such an approach is beneficial more widely across the spectrum of chronic heart disease. These data, therefore, address an important gap in the literature and evidence base.</p><p>Beyond questioning the relevance of data derived from Australia (characterized by high standards of subsidized health care), it is worth considering whether a blanket approach to applying HBI is truly warranted. For example, in the recent Young@Heart Study,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> applying HBI in a wealthier cohort of cardiac patients with greater access to a specialist Cardiologist, men but not women appeared to benefit from HBI; the latter potentially attributable to suboptimal application of HBI at 1 study site.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Beyond health system factors, the relative impact of HBI will undoubtedly vary according to clinical acuity and risk of premature mortality and recurrent hospital stay. Exploratory analyses of the interaction between HBI and a patient&#x02019;s age and comorbidity clearly showed a U-shaped response with respect to DAOH and survival alone, those at either end of the spectrum demonstrating an increased propensity to have more events when exposed to HBI. The potential to identify who benefits most from HBI and therefore to apply it on a more selective basis should not, however, detract from the overall benefits observed by this composite analysis; in particular, when one considers the unique advantage of HBI in being patient centered and detecting otherwise unknown clinical instability.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The Green Amber Red Delineation of Risk and Need (GARDIAN) tool<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> was designed to achieve the former and is being used to guide the intensity of disease management according to the level of need in current trials of HBI in the setting of CHF. It is certainly possible that high levels of standard management alone, including traditional outpatient care, deliver the best health outcomes in younger patients with less complex clinical needs. Alternatively, the danger of not transitioning to a potentially more effective HBI over time is tempered by the natural history of heart disease toward more progressive, multiorgan disease and poor health outcomes in the long term.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> With an increasingly ageing cardiac patient population in whom multimorbidity and rehospitalizations are becoming more common,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> our positive findings with respect to HBI, as a reflection of the overall benefits of applying successful programs involving a home-based<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> or transitional care<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> approach to chronic heart disease management, are likely to become more clinically relevant over time.</p><p>Beyond previously identified trial limitations, including nonblinding of patients and health workers, a number of specific issues require comment. First, despite the purposeful nature of our program of research and efforts to standardize trial methodology,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> there were potentially important differences in the application of clinical management in each trial. One trial (the NIL-CHF Study)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> was conducted in a single tertiary center. The applicability of our findings (both negative and positive) from studies conducted within the Australian healthcare system requires careful consideration in terms of their generalizability. Nevertheless, our analyses of who benefits most from HBI remain ongoing and we are yet to undertake economic analyses to determine whether there is a cost threshold at which HBI might be applied. Finally, our composite findings are also yet to be tested via a single appropriately powered, prospective study.</p><p>In conclusion, across 3 contiguous clinical trials applying the same form of nurse-led, multidisciplinary, HBI adapted to the target patient population, this model of care was associated with more DAOH than standard management. These data support the wider application of HBI to optimize the immediate and longer-term postdischarge management of patients with a broad spectrum of heart disease states.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>This study (1055214), along with 1041796 (to Dr Stewart), 1112829 (to Dr Ball) and 1032934 (to Dr Carrington), was supported by National

disease management across the full spectrum of heart disease to prolong survival without provoking the competing risk of recurrent hospitalization. In combining 3 contiguous trials of the same form of management adapted to clinical profile (from younger individuals surviving an acute coronary event to older individuals hospitalized with more advanced forms of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure), we were able to tackle an important gap in the evidence base. Overall, we demonstrated that, in comparison with high levels of standard management, a nurse-led, multidisciplinary, home-based intervention was associated with both prolonged survival and reduced hospital stay over the longer term. Given that in clinical practice disease management programs are typically applied according to a single cardiac diagnosis (most notably chronic heart failure), overall, these data support the wider application of this approach to any patient discharged home from the hospital with a form of chronic heart disease; particularly in older individuals with multimorbidity. On this basis, there is scope to extend preexisting health services applying this kind of approach to the full spectrum of heart disease on a cost-effective basis. This would involve modifications in screening and referral protocols (to identify eligible patients), more health resources to accommodate an increased case load, and critical adjustments to patient profiling and needs assessments to adapt this strategy on an individual basis.</p></sec></back></article>
