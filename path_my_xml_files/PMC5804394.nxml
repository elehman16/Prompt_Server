The efficacy of bleaching depends on three aspects: bleaching agent, bleaching method, and tooth color.</p><sec><title>Objective:</title><p>This <italic>in vivo</italic> study aimed to examine whitening effects on frontal teeth of the upper and lower jaws using an over-the-counter (OTC) non-hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent in comparison to a placebo after one single use.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and methods:</title><p>Forty subjects (25 female; 15 male) participated in this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The subjects were randomly allocated to two groups (n=20). The test group received the OTC product (iWhite Instant) and the placebo group received an identically composed product except for the active agents. Each subject was treated with a prefilled tray containing iWhite Instant or the placebo for 20 minutes. The tooth shade of the front teeth (upper and lower jaws) was assessed before (E_0), immediately after (E_1) and 24 h after treatment (E_2), using a shade guide (VITA classical). Statistical testing was accomplished using the Mann-Whitney U test (p&#x0003c;0.001). The dropout rate was 0%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant differences at E_0 between placebo and test groups regarding the tooth color. Differences in tooth color changes immediately after (&#x00394;E1_0) and 24 h after treatment (&#x00394;E2_0) were calculated for both groups. The mean values (standard deviations) of tooth color changes for &#x00394;E1_0 were 2.26 (0.92) in the test group and 0.01 (0.21) in the placebo group. The color changes for &#x00394;E2_0 showed mean values of 2.15 (1.10) in the test group and 0.07 (0.35) in the placebo group. For &#x00394;E1_0 and &#x00394;E2_0 significant differences were found between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In this short-term study, the results showed that a non-hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent has significant whitening effects immediately and 24 h after a single-use treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Efficacy</kwd><kwd>Hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>Double-blind study</kwd><kwd>Tooth bleaching</kwd><kwd>Side effects</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to representative data from the United Kingdom and from a study with Chinese urban population, the prevalence of tooth discoloration in 13-65 year-olds is approximately 50%<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Consequently, tooth whitening is perhaps the most frequently applied aesthetic procedure in dentistry.</p><p>The etiology of tooth discolorations is multi-causal and can result from individual behavior, diseases, injury and other exposures along with various physiological processes<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Professional cleaning of discolored teeth is a common procedure to remove the majority of extrinsic strains. Various bleaching techniques and products are used to remove intrinsic stains: In-office or power bleaching, home bleaching, and over-the-counter bleaching products.</p><p>Most bleaching products use hydrogen peroxide as active agent. However, bleaching treatments with peroxide may cause local adverse effects such as oral mucosa irritation, pulpal sensitivity, pulpitis or alteration of the enamel surface<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. On the other hand, bleaching is a relatively safe procedure that predominantly causes severe adverse effects only at high hydrogen peroxide concentrations on hard tissue, soft tissue and restorative materials<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. The European Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP)<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> reported that the use of tooth whitening products containing &#x0003e;0.1 to 6.0% hydrogen peroxide or equivalent hydrogen peroxide-releasing substances is safe after consultation with a dentist.</p><p>On 31 October 2012, the EU Council Directive 2011/84/EU (amending EU Council Directive 76/768/EEC) specified that OTC tooth-whitening products and kits may only contain up to 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. However, this concentration is too low to have any noticeable effect on the color of teeth.</p><p>Legally, products that contain more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide can only be sold to a dentist<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. In January 2008, the SCCP recommended 6% hydrogen peroxide as a safe limit to use for home bleaching if supervised by a dentist<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. Tooth bleaching based on non-peroxide systems are available as over-the-counter products in the form of gels, rinses, gums, dentifrices, whitening strips or paint-on films<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (2005) examined the efficacy and side effects of three different bleaching treatments: Whitestrips (OTC product, 5.3% hydrogen peroxide), Opalescence PF 10% (home bleaching, 10% carbamide peroxide) and Opalescence Xtra Boost (in-office bleaching, 38% hydrogen peroxide). The side effects were reversible and the test products had no harmful effect on the tooth surfaces. Additionally, the treatments were effective in removing intrinsic stains<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>, but given the actual legislation, such products are no longer allowed to be sold as OTC products without supervision of a dentist. Various studies investigated the effectiveness, safety and possible rebound effect of at-home and OTC agents. The most common side effects after bleaching were dental hypersensitivity and gingival irritation<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Moreover, the efficacy of products containing hydrogen peroxide is generally based on cumulative and repeated treatments; no instant or one-treatment efficacy has been reported. No clinical studies were found for non-peroxide bleaching products. Only one study examined a non-peroxide at-home bleaching product based on sodium chloride <italic>in vitro</italic> and observed deteriorating effects on dental enamel<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A novel OTC bleaching agent based on nonperoxide gel was investigated in this study. It contains phthalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP) and calcium lactate gluconate as active ingredients and has a high potential of oxidation with release of active oxygen. The gel should be placed on a ready-to-use tray. The calcium-lactate-gluconate is an implemented complex to remineralize and conserve dental hard tissue. A combination of bleaching and remineralization agents was efficient in reducing dental hypersensitivity<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Thus, the purpose of this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled short-term study was to determine the efficacy and side effects of a novel OTC non-peroxide bleaching agent after a single-use application.</p><p>In this double-blind study, the primary goal was to test the hypothesis that there are significant differences in tooth color units (1-16 units) between a novel OTC non-peroxide bleaching and placebo immediately after a single-use application regarding the effectiveness of bleaching. The secondary goal was to determine the color change as well as the side effects between baseline and after 24 h plus between immediately and after 24 h bleaching.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and all procedures of the study were clearly explained in advance.

The first 40 subjects from 50 volunteers from screening examination who were interested and agreed to participate and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were asked to sign the consent form and enrolled in the study. The subjects received dental prophylaxis, then a single average shade score was calculated for each individual. This study was a double-blind randomized parallel study, and subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, balancing for gender and baseline tooth color. Randomization was done with a sealed envelope system by a person who was not involved in the trial. The randomization was stratified according to four combinations of color shade and gender (female &#x00026; average shade color darker than A3/female &#x00026; average shade color brighter than A3/male &#x00026; average shade color darker than A3/male &#x00026; average shade color brighter than A3).

No participant indicated the presence of a systemic disease in his/her medical history. An intraoral examination confirmed that each participant had an age between 18-65 years, at least 22 natural teeth with no current caries activity, gingivitis, periodontal disease, or other oral pathology. The front teeth should not be lighter than A2 and without defective enamel structure or restorations. Exclusion criteria were the presence of any systemic disease, pregnancy or breastfeeding, the use of fixed or removable orthodontic appliances, smoking, alcohol abuse, allergic reaction to any component of the agents, the use of any bleaching agents within the last year and dental hypersensitivity. Subjects were instructed to use the same non-whitening toothpaste (Sensodyne Fluoride, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany) and a soft toothbrush (Sensodyne Precision; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG; Hamburg, Germany) throughout the experiment. Whitening products and the consumption of curry, coffee, black tea or red wine were strictly forbidden during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Calibration of the examiner</title><p>All examination procedures and subject instructions were performed by the same experienced clinician (JD) to avoid interexaminer differences. Before the study, the clinician was calibrated on 20 subjects to ensure the validity of the tooth color measurements using the VITA shade guide (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad S&#x000e4;ckingen, Germany). The second tooth color measurements were performed after a two-week break. The strength of agreement was assessed by calculating Kappa values. The intraexaminer correlation coefficient was 0.83; hence, the strength of agreement can be rated as almost perfect.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination</title><p>Efficacy (tooth color) and safety (side effects such as tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation) were assessed at baseline (E_0), immediately after treatment (E_1) and 24 h after treatment (E_2). Tooth color was measured using the VITA Lumin shade guide (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad S&#x000e4;ckingen, Germany), which consists of the 16 most common tooth colors (1-16). The examiner assessed patients&#x02019; conditions by deploying a blast of air to teeth isolated with cotton rolls, from a distance of 1 cm, for 1 s. The scale was used as follow: 0 = absence of pain and 1 = presence of pain (slight, moderate and severe sensitivity). Gingival irritation, i.e. any abnormal findings such as redness, edema or epithelial irritation of soft tissues was recorded by the examiner. The next parameters were self-reports for tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation at the final examination. Tooth sensitivity included pain after the consumption of cold and hot beverage and/or food respectively and gingival irritation involved any discomfort or gingival irritation. The scale recorded as 0 = absence of pain and 1 = presence of pain.</p><p>Treatments were performed according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. The test and placebo gels were placed on a ready-to-use tray for six upper and six lower anterior teeth. The examiner supervised the subjects to ensure correct application. They were not allowed to remove the trays during the treatment session but they were allowed to talk. After 20 min, the trays were removed and discarded. Teeth were cleaned from remnants of the gel. Thereafter, the tooth color, tooth hypersensitivity and the condition of the soft tissue were recorded. The fluoride gel (Elmex Gel&#x000e9;e, CP GABA, Hamburg, Germany) was applied subsequently for five minutes. The final examination was performed after 24 h.</p><p>The individual color determinations were evaluated by one examiner under identical conditions using the VITA Lumin shade guide (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad S&#x000e4;ckingen, Germany). The VITA shade guide served as reference to the clinical situation and consists of the 16 most common tooth colors sorted according to shade<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

The test bleaching products may potentially cause irreversible damage if used on a long-term basis; so we decided to perform a single-use application under the supervision of a dentist.</p><p>The tooth color alterations were assessed using a shade guide and the visual evaluation from one examiner, which is in accordance with other clinical studies<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Interference by surrounding light is a disadvantage for the color determination by means of a shade guide. The color impression of a tooth depends on the translucency, the reflection and the adsorption of the light on the tooth surface. The tooth color was examined under standardized light and surrounding influences to eliminate artefacts.</p><p>The investigated novel bleaching agent (iWhite Instant) consists of phthalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP), an organic peracid containing a high potential of oxidation. Oxidation is necessary for the bleaching procedure as it neutralizes organic double bonds that cause dental discolorations. But the activity of PAP is not based on the release of hydrogen peroxide<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Risks involved in at-home and in-office bleaching procedures are tooth hypersensitivity and gingival irritations. These side effects depend on the concentration of the bleaching agent and the contact between the tray and the gingiva<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, a mucosal irritation or dental hypersensitivity may also occur after the use of non-peroxide bleaching agents. No dental hypersensitivities and mucosal irritations were observed by the examiner immediately and 24 h after the single use of the new bleaching agent. Fluoride was applied after the treatment which may also have a remineralizing effect on the enamel<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
