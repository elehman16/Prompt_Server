The study consisted of a screening period, two treatment periods, and follow-up contact by telephone. Participants were stratified according to age (55&#x02013;64, 65&#x02013;74, and &#x02265; 75 years) and gender, then randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences (LDX 50 mg followed by placebo or placebo followed by LDX 50 mg). Treatment periods within each sequence were separated by a 7&#x02013;14-day washout period. After the cohorts aged 55&#x02013;64 and 65&#x02013;74 years completed the study, a blinded safety data review was conducted by the investigators before proceeding with enrolment of the cohort aged &#x02265; 75 years. Baseline creatinine clearance was determined based on a 24-hour urine collection, starting at predose day &#x02013;1 of treatment period 1, with final urine collection obtained at predose day 1 of treatment period 1.

Beginning on day 1 of each treatment period, samples were obtained predose at &#x02013;0.5 hours and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postdosing. Blood samples were kept on ice, and within 30 minutes of sampling were centrifuged at approximately 1500&#x000d7; g for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The separated plasma was divided equally into primary and backup samples, and stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until bioanalysis at the end of each treatment period. For participants dosed with LDX, plasma was analyzed for LDX and d-amphetamine using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method validated over the range of 1&#x02013;100 ng/mL for LDX and 2&#x02013;200 ng/mL for d-amphetamine based on 200 &#x003bc;L of human plasma. Human plasma samples containing LDX and d-amphetamine, and internal standards, ie, D8-LDX and D5-amphetamine, were extracted with ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1) in the presence of saturated sodium chloride/sodium hydroxide. Following centrifugation, the organic layer was transferred and evaporated. After addition of formic acid and reconstitution in mobile phase, an aliquot was injected into a SCIEX API 4000 (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a high-performance liquid chromatography column.

Peak area integrations were performed using Analyst version 1.4.2 software from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA). Concentrations were calculated using eight-point curves in the range of 1&#x02013;100 ng/mL for LDX and 2&#x02013;200 ng/mL for d-amphetamine, with separate weighted linear regression. Based on a sample volume of 200 &#x003bc;L, the method had a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL for LDX and 2 ng/mL for d-amphetamine.

Renal function, as assessed by baseline creatinine clearance, was lower in participants aged &#x02265; 75 years, compared with participants aged 55&#x02013;64 years and 65&#x02013;74 years, but the mean creatinine clearance was in the normal range for all groups and the slightly lower d-amphetamine creatinine clearance in the group aged &#x02265; 75 years was unrelated to renal function based on creatinine clearance at baseline.</p><p>The present findings in older adults are in line with results from previous pharmacokinetic investigations of LDX in younger adults aged &#x02264; 55 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-9-219">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> In a study reported by Ermer et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> administration of single oral LDX doses of 50&#x02013;150 mg in 20 adults (mean age 33.3 years, mean body weight 75.0 kg) displayed linear d-amphetamine pharmacokinetic parameters and was associated with a CL/F of 0.9 L/hour/kg, with a mean C<sub>max</sub> in the range of 44.6&#x02013;126.6 ng/mL and a mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> in the range of 818.1&#x02013;2503.4 ng &#x02022; hour/mL for LDX 50&#x02013;150 mg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> In a report by Krishnan et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-9-219">5</xref> a 70-mg capsule of LDX given to fasted adult volunteers led to d-amphetamine C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> values of 69.3 ng/mL and 1110 ng &#x02022; hour/mL, respectively. Moreover, from the studies reported by Ermer et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> and Krishnan et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-9-219">5</xref> mean C<sub>max</sub> values for LDX were 25.6 and 48.0 ng/mL, respectively, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> values were 62.1 and 66.8 ng &#x02022; hour/mL, respectively. The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> values for d-amphetamine observed among each of the age groups examined in the current investigation (44.2&#x02013;51.0 ng/mL and 915.0&#x02013;1347.8 ng &#x02022; hour/mL, respectively) are generally similar to these previous data, as were C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> values for LDX (24.7&#x02013;43.0 ng/mL and 35.3&#x02013;51.9 ng &#x02022; hour/mL, respectively). The d-amphetamine parameters appeared comparable between women and men in each of the age groups. The current findings indicate that gender does not have a large effect on the disposition of d-amphetamine or LDX, and CL/F decreased with advancing age.</p><p>Normal age-related decreases in renal function might have been expected to affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics of d-amphetamine in the current study. This is because a portion of administered d-amphetamine is excreted unchanged in the urine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-9-219">17</xref> Although creatinine clearance and d-amphetamine clearance both tended to decrease with age among our older participants, no clear relationship was detected between these two factors in the current investigation. This is somewhat different from the findings of a prior investigation of the pharmacokinetics of amphetamine when given following stroke in older patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-219">12</xref> In that study, patients aged 66&#x02013;70 years received 2.5 mg to 10 mg of immediate-release d-amphetamine twice daily for 5 days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-219">12</xref> In contrast with the current findings, the pharmacokinetic analysis by Martinsson et al showed that creatinine clearance, but not patient age, was strongly correlated with d-amphetamine exposure, based on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>. It seems possible that such divergent findings may be due, in part, to sampling differences. The current trial enrolled a largely healthy sample of older volunteers; however, the patients in the report from Martinsson et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-219">12</xref> were hospitalized following a stroke, likely had medical comorbidities, and were receiving a number of other medications that potentially may have altered renal function and/or disposition of d-amphetamine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-9-219">12</xref> It may be of interest to examine more directly the effect of renal impairment on LDX and d-amphetamine pharmacokinetics in future investigations.</p><p>In the present trial, a single 50-mg dose of LDX did not result in any new or unexpected safety concerns. Overall, increases in blood pressure and pulse as well as in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events across all the age groups were consistent with those observed previously in healthy younger adults aged &#x02264; 55 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-9-219">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> A similar profile of small mean increases in blood pressure and pulse has also been reported in adults with ADHD. In a 4-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of LDX in adults aged &#x02264; 55 years with ADHD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ndt-9-219">9</xref> small least squares mean changes from baseline to endpoint for placebo, and 30, 50, and 70 mg/day of LDX, respectively, in systolic blood pressure were &#x02013;0.5, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.3 mmHg; in diastolic blood pressure were 1.1, 0.8, 1.1, and 1.6 mmHg; and in pulse were 0.0, 2.8, 4.2, and 5.2 beats per minute. The changes in pulse (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0018 versus placebo) but not blood pressure with LDX were statistically significant. In a post hoc analysis of that 4-week trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ndt-9-219">18</xref> the proportion of participants who were pulse outliers (&#x02265; 100 beats per minute, any one event) ranged from 3.3% to 8.5% in the LDX groups. Additionally, for the current study, it is important to note that although the absolute value of transient increases in pulse rate and blood pressure (in all age groups) may appear quite high relative to placebo, it is expected that, because of the rigorous monitoring procedures employed throughout the day, these results may overestimate the magnitude of pulse rate and blood pressure effects that would be noted using traditional vital sign monitoring procedures during typical outpatient use.</p><p>Although the number of participants was small, fewer older participants (aged &#x02265; 65 years) reported a treatment-emergent adverse event than those who were younger (aged 55&#x02013;64 years). It is of interest that the safety profile of LDX among participants aged &#x02265; 75 years was not apparently compromised in this study, despite the slightly greater exposure to d-amphetamine seen in these participants. This is in line with normal age-related decreases in adrenergic sensitivity to sympathomimetic stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-9-219">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-9-219">20</xref> A larger proportion of female participants reported treatment-emergent adverse events compared with male participants. Safety analyses by gender in adults with ADHD have not been presented in previous reports; further, the number of participants in the current study is relatively small, so broad conclusions are not warranted. As with all psychostimulant medications, careful patient selection is key to maintaining adequate safety with LDX; regardless of age, patients with a history or evidence of cardiovascular disease or drug abuse should not be treated with LDX.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-9-219">1</xref></p><p>The findings of this study should be interpreted while considering certain limitations. Participants received a single dose of LDX; this is not representative of clinical use of LDX. The current study enrolled older adults who were otherwise healthy, without significant hepatic or renal dysfunction. Pharmacokinetics and safety of LDX in medically or psychiatrically ill older patients is unknown. Thus, the current findings may not be applicable to a population of older adults with multiple health issues or compromised hepatic or renal function.</p><p>Only a single 50-mg dose of LDX was examined, so dose proportionality of the pharmacokinetic parameters cannot be determined from this study. However, dose proportionality has been established in both children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-9-219">1</xref> and younger adults aged &#x02264; 55 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> Despite these limitations, the present study provides useful information to help consider appropriate procedures for LDX dosing in a diverse adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In older adults, pharmacokinetic parameters for LDX-derived intact LDX and d-amphetamine, including C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, were generally similar to those seen previously in younger adults aged 18&#x02013;55 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-9-219">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-9-219">6</xref> d-Amphetamine exposure was modestly higher in participants aged &#x02265; 75 years than in those aged 55&#x02013;64 years and 65&#x02013;74 years. The increased d-amphetamine exposure did not appear related to decreased baseline creatinine clearance, which is an indication of kidney function. Safety of LDX among participants aged &#x02265; 75 years was not apparently compromised, despite their slightly greater exposure to d-amphetamine in this study. This may be accounted for by normal age-related decreases in adrenergic sensitivity to sympathomimetic stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-9-219">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-9-219">20</xref> No clear trends in blood pressure or pulse changes by age were seen with LDX.
