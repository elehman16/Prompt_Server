After approval from the Ethical Committee of our institution, written informed consent was obtained from forty patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Class I or II patients and scheduled for lower abdominal surgeries such as appendectomy, repair of incisional hernia, and abdominal hysterectomy. Exclusion criteria were patient's refusal, patients with a history of cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, local infection at the site of block, psychological disorders, allergy to study medications, coagulation disorders, and any other contraindication for general anesthesia.</p><p>During the preoperative anesthetic assessment of patients, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment from 0 to 10 cm with 0 refers no pain and 10 refers the worst pain imaginable was explained to patients. The patients were monitored by noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, temperature, and electrocardiography. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was standardized for all patients in the both groups. All surgical interventions were performed by the same surgical team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. In Group R (<italic>n</italic> = 20), patients received TAP block on each side using 22 ml of study medication which consisted of 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% and 2 ml of normal saline. However, Group RD (<italic>n</italic> = 20) patients received TAP block on each side with 22 ml, in which dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg was dissolved in 2 ml of normal saline and added to 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.2%.</p><p>Following skin preparation, TAP blocks were performed by one of the investigators under dynamic ultrasound guidance (MTurbo, Sonosite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). Broadband linear array ultrasound probe was placed in the axial plane across the midaxillary line midway between costal margin and iliac crest. Following identification of the three different layers of the abdominal wall, 22-gauge insulated nerve block needle was inserted in plane until its tip was located in between the internal oblique and transverse abdominal muscles. After careful aspiration injection of the study, medication was performed and hypoechoic layer was detected on ultrasound.</p><p>After completion of the surgical procedure and reversal from anesthesia, patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). An observer who was unaware of the study protocol recorded the pain score on VAS. Intravenous tramadol was given as rescue analgesia for postoperative pain relief if pain score &#x0003e;4 or when it was requested by the patients; the time to first dose of rescue analgesic given was recorded and worst pain score was also noted. In PACU and the first 24 h postoperatively, VAS will be recorded at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h postoperatively.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 16.0 (IBM).

The mean age of the patients in Group 1 was 43.80 &#x000b1; 12.10 years while in Group 2 was 42.60 &#x000b1; 10.67 years. This was not significant having <italic>P</italic> = 0.741.

The uncontrolled postoperative pain is the major limiting factor for early ambulation and thereby puts patient to the increased risk of various complications as well. The desirable properties of an analgesic agent are that it provides safe and effective analgesia, with minimal side effects. The multimodal pain management is the answer of this. The TAP block is used for postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgeries. It provides blockade of the nociceptive inputs from the abdominal wall but not from the abdominal organs. Therefore, the block is used as a part of multimodal approach.</p><p>Ranjit <italic>et al</italic>. in the study of comparison of ultrasound-guided TAP block versus local wound infiltration for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing gynecological surgery under general anesthesia found that bilateral TAP block was effective in reducing postoperative pain scores for 8&#x02013;12 h postoperatively. This block was also successful in reducing postoperative opioid requirement.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Yu <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study titled, &#x0201c;TAP block versus LA wound infiltration in lower abdominal surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.&#x0201d; They found that TAP block and LA infiltration provide comparable short-term postoperative analgesia, but TAP block has better long-lasting effect, especially up to 24 h after surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Another study by Mishra <italic>et al</italic>. comparing TAP block versus wound infiltration of local anesthesia for postoperative analgesia concluded that TAP block and wound infiltration of local anesthesia both provide significant postoperative analgesia initially but the effects are more long-lasting in TAP block.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, we can presume that the potent prolonged analgesic effects of TAP block remain the issue beyond doubt. Now, the next issue of concern can be that how we can prolong the analgesic effects of TAP block even further. The current studies were performed on patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia and were offered ultrasound-guided TAP block for postoperative analgesia. One study group received only ropivacaine for TAP block while other group received ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine for TAP block. The results of this study showed that the group receiving combination of ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine has significantly lower pain scores postoperatively that the group receiving only ropivacaine.</p><p>In the study by Rai <italic>et al</italic>., it was found that the addition of dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in TAP block led to further prolongation of analgesia, less requirement of rescue analgesia, and lower VAS pain scores.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study done by Marhofer <italic>et al</italic>. found that there was prolongation of ulnar nerve block duration after addition of dexmedetomidine in ropivacaine used for the block by approximately 60%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Almarakbi andKaki reported that the addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine in TAP block in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy provides better pain control postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The major limitation of this study is the small sample size which may or may not be the representative population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The addition of dexmedetomidine to local anesthesia during TAP block tends to increase the analgesic effect as well as prolongs the duration of analgesia achieved.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
