It is not uncommon that the reason for presentation is based on observations of memory loss by family carers or carer distress or breakdown. What carers recollect at an initial assessment may be quite variable and they, along with their loved ones, may find it difficult to retain and recall all the problems in the initial assessments or follow-up appointments. Some carers attend clinic with written unstructured account of problems they face in caring to help provide information at the initial assessment. From the literature reviewed, there were very few studies on the use of carers' diaries in the assessment and management of dementia.</p><p>It has been reported that diaries can be used as a primary method of data collection with family caregivers, and they found completing a diary both therapeutic and pleasurable <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Four types of diaries were described:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Meager diaries&#x02014;brief with only few lines recorded.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p>Reporting diaries&#x02014;written like reports of daily timetables</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p>Descriptive diaries&#x02014;the type where family caregivers describe their daily tasks.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0025"><label>4.</label><p>Reflective diaries&#x02014;contained information about family caregivers' daily lives and emotions.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In a study examining the unstructured diaries of carers over the first 6 months after diagnosis of dementia, the two core themes found in the diaries were that the meaning of the onset of Alzheimer's disease has on the lives of carers and the restructuring of their lives <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In another diary study to examine relationship between caregiver-burden, leisure satisfaction, and affect in dementia caregivers, a positive correlation between leisure satisfaction and positive effect among care givers was reported. Diary records capture rich source of data, but it has been suggested that solicited diary recording should be limited to 1 to 2 weeks in older adults as there will not be sufficient data if it is less than a week and for periods more than 2 weeks, the participants will get bored or tired of making entries which would make the data inadequate or unreliable <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>There are drawbacks and limitations when people with dementia record their thoughts in written diaries. People with dementia became aware of their diminishing skills, frustrated, and not sure what to record in their diaries <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Diary recording relies on participants to be self-motivated and inspired to notice and records their thoughts. Therefore, it has been suggested that this method should be in conjunction with other methods like interviews and also to include photo and audio diaries to help the researcher to understand the many facets of a person's life <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In a study using a diary method in conjunction with an interview to collect data from 14 family carers, the process of normalization was described, in which the family carers continuously defined and redefined their relationship with the persons with dementia as was normal for them <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The strategies taken up by family carers with the support of professional carers were said to be able to facilitate this process of normalization. The research also showed the diary method to be valuable as it provided a detailed account of factual, emotive, personal, and sensitive events and emphasized the importance of it, when used in conjunction with interview data.</p><p>This present study aimed to examine a novel hypothesis that asking carers to record dementia patients' problems and symptoms as they occur in everyday life, may aside from recording more problems, have therapeutic effects on caregivers' mood and well-being by giving them better insight into the problems and how to cope or prevent them.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This was a mixed qualitative and quantitative, randomized controlled study in which experimental (diary group) and control participants completed various questionnaires assessing behavior and psychological problems in people with dementia living with family carers, as well as the carers' health-related quality of life and mood. In addition, participants randomly allocated to the diary group were given a diary to complete of patient problems for 1 week (between day 1 and day 8), and the control group was not asked to keep a diary. The carers were randomly allocated to two groups, control and diary groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Study participants</title><p>The study participants were recruited from the local memory clinic. It involved carers of patients newly diagnosed and follow-up patients with Alzheimer's disease referred to the clinic. Both patients and carers were provided with information sheet about the study and invited to participate. Patients were informed that their medical records would be reviewed for information pertaining to the study, which would be kept anonymous, and that they would not be interviewed. If both patients and carers expressed an interest, follow-up visits at home were arranged for day 1and day 8. Informed consent was obtained on day 1 with both patients and carers being reminded they could opt to withdraw from the study at any time and that would not impact on their treatment in the memory clinic.</p><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0030"><label>1.</label><p>Carers aged &#x02265;20&#x000a0;years who cared for a person diagnosed with dementia and resided with them at home.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>2.</label><p>Participation of only those persons where consent was obtained from both carer and the person with dementia being cared for.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.2"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0040"><label>1.</label><p>Any carer who did not give an informed consent.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0045"><label>2.</label><p>Any carer who was unable to speak, read, or write in English to fully participate in the study.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Assessment tools</title><p>The following assessment tools were used<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0050"><label>1.</label><p>The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale includes six domains consisting of memory; orientation; judgment and problem solving; community affairs; home and hobbies; and personal care <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Each domain is rated on a 5 point scale with the following scale points: 0&#x02014;healthy; 0.5&#x02014;questionable; 1&#x02014;mild; 2&#x02014;moderate; and 3&#x02014;severe.

It is scored from 1 to 144, which is the sum of the multiplication of severity (S) and frequency (F) scores of the 12 NPI symptoms independently assessed by a clinician, based on information provided by carers. Both the severity and frequency of each symptom are rated on a three (1&#x02013;3) and four point (1&#x02013;4) Likert scale, respectively.

The participants on recruitment were randomly allocated into the diary and control groups. Forty one participants in the control group and 39 participants in the diary group completed the eighth day assessments and/or diaries. The background variables of patients in the diary and control groups, in terms of age, gender, severity, and duration were not significantly different at day 1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Likewise, among the carers, there were also no significant differences in the background variables (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Outcomes in diary and control groups</title><p>The problems identified in the narratives and diaries were coded and counted by two raters who came to a mutual agreement where there were any discrepancies.

The mean number of diary entries (pages) was 4.3 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.97) pages; 8 (20.5%) carers made no entries claiming there were no problems to record. The maximum number of diary entries (pages) by a carer was 17, and the mean number of problems identified per diary page was 1.8. The mean number of diary pages completed by female carers was 5.2 pages (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.1) of diary entries and by the male carers 2.3 pages (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.9) which was significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05) using the analysis of variance. The number of problems identified in the diary entries was significantly greater for all five groups compared to the narratives in the carer group (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). However, there were no significant differences between the total number of problems in the diary and control groups in the carers' verbal narrative accounts at both days 1and 8. There were no significant differences between diary and control groups' mean scores in the Neuro Psychiatry Inventory, EuroQol, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at days 8 and 28 (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This is an original study that involves the use of carers' diaries in dementia with a mixed qualitative and quantitative design. It is a randomized control study comparing real-time recording of problems using carers' diaries with the retrospective information gathered in the usual clinical assessments in clinics or domiciliary visits of persons with dementia living at home. The findings revealed that the carers' diaries identified a greater number of problems compared to retrospective information gathered from carers with forgetfulness and behavior problems being the two most common problems. Carers' diaries identified more problems in the areas of behavior, cognition, emotional and psychiatric, as well as, problems grouped under others such as insomnia and incontinence. Despite identifying more problems, the use of the carers' diaries in dementia did not appear to make a difference in carers in terms of carer distress, carers' health-related quality of life or their mood.</p><p>In contrast, earlier studies involving carers' diaries in dementia were mainly qualitative and involved the use of unstructured diaries in comparison to this study <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. They found that there were beneficial effects on carers affects and experience of caring. These earlier studies mainly focused on carers' problems and impact of caring, whereas this present study investigated both carers and the person being cared for with dementia.</p><p>An incidental finding noted was that the male carers in this study tended to under report problems in their narratives and diary entries which became apparent when reports were compared with the Neuropsychiatry Inventory scores. This under reporting may have an impact on the usefulness of diaries and narrative accounts in male carers or the need to put this into consideration, when taking accounts from male carers. It may be that male carers tend to normalize things much more than female carers or a reflection though not confirmed in this study or the literature, that female patients with dementia may be less demanding on family carers.</p><p>Our findings suggest that there may be a potential use of carers' diaries in the assessment of dementia, in that they may identify more problems compared to relying solely on the retrospective account of patients and carers in clinic. More research using carers' diaries in dementia covering longer period than a week may be required to ascertain other benefits.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0085"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: A standard literature search was carried out using PsychInfo, PubMed, CINALH plus, Cochrane library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using various search terms, such as carers diaries and dementia. We did not find any articles which was relevant to the proposed study of using carers' diaries in assessment of dementia. Several studies used patients' diaries in dementia and a few used unstructured carers' diaries for other purposes.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0090"><label>2.</label><p>Interpretation: The study found that carers' diaries did identify more problems in dementia than the verbal retrospective account of carers.
