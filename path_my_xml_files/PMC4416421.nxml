The Child Illness and Resilience Program (CHiRP) will develop and evaluate a parent-focussed family intervention designed to increase the resilience and wellbeing of families living with childhood chronic illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study will be conducted in an Australian regional paediatric hospital and will use a stepped care intervention that increases in intensity according to parental distress. All parents of children discharged from the hospital will receive a family resilience and wellbeing factsheet (Step 1). Parents of children attending selected outpatient clinics will receive a family resilience and wellbeing activity booklet (Step 2). Parents who receive the booklet and report psychological distress at three-month follow-up will be randomised to participate in a family resilience information support group or waitlist control (Step 3). The Step 3 control group will provide data to compare the relative effectiveness of the booklet intervention alone versus the booklet combined with the group intervention for distressed parents. These participants will then receive the information support group intervention. All parents in Step 2 and 3 will complete baseline, post-intervention and six month follow up assessments. The primary outcomes of the study will be changes in scores between baseline and follow-up assessments on measures of constructs of family resilience, including parental wellbeing, family functioning, family beliefs and perceived social support. Qualitative feedback regarding the utility and acceptability of the different intervention components will also be collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is hypothesised that participation in the CHiRP intervention will be associated with positive changes in the key outcome measures.

A chronic illness is one that is prolonged in duration, does not often resolve spontaneously and is rarely cured completely (Dowrick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>). It includes illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, musculoskeletal and inflammatory disorders and gastroenterological disorders. Better survival rates mean the number of children living with chronic illnesses are increasing and consequently, there is a growing need to better understand the family impacts of caring for a child with a chronic illness (O'Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>; Scholten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>).</p><p>Children and young people who live with a chronic illness experience a range of persistent stressors that can increase their risk of developing mental health problems (Barlow &#x00026; Ellard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; Cadman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1987</xref>; Combs-Orme et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>; Lavigne &#x00026; Faier-Routman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1992</xref>; Mikkelsson &#x00026; Sourander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1997</xref>; Sein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2001</xref>). For example, these children may need to manage symptoms that introduce physical and lifestyle limitations, including restricted participation in school and sport, as well as treatment effects and the impact of incorporating ongoing treatment into daily activities. These factors may limit spontaneity, create challenges for social relationships, and generate concerns about the future (Scholten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>; Gannoni &#x00026; Shute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2008</xref>).</p><p>The social and emotional impacts of living with childhood chronic illness are not confined to the child or young person themselves; they are shared with other family members (Barlow &#x00026; Ellard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; Bauman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1997</xref>; Raina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>). Parents of children and young people living with a chronic illness experience increased levels of stress due to intensified demands of their care and support role, financial pressures, and strains on their relationships with immediate and extended family members (Gannoni &#x00026; Shute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Raina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Barlow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Melnyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>; Tong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2008</xref>). Siblings are at increased risk of anxiety and intense emotions, experience confusion and difficulty communicating about the illness, may feel overlooked, and can experience negative changes to family and social functioning as a result of their sibling&#x02019;s illness (O'Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>; Gannoni &#x00026; Shute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Bellin &#x00026; Kovacs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Besier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Strohm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2008</xref>).</p><p>While the experience of living with childhood chronic illness can increase vulnerability to mental ill-health, there is a growing body of research that suggests despite increased risk, some families are able to positively manage the impacts of the illness on their lives (Bellin &#x00026; Kovacs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>). Such families utilise their experience of managing the illness to develop stronger relationships, coping skills, refocus priorities, recognise opportunities and adapt to the situation so they achieve a sense of functioning just as well as &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; families (Gannoni &#x00026; Shute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Huygen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>). The ability to maintain healthy family functioning, adapt to stressful life events and develop strengths and skills as a result, reflects a family&#x02019;s resilience (Rolland &#x00026; Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>).</p><p>A family resilience framework can guide mental health promotion interventions. Strategies for promoting wellbeing can target the processes and factors involved in coping, adjustment and resilience (Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>). Theoretical models of family resilience describe a dynamic process through which families are able to adjust in healthy ways to change, cope with stressors, build on strengths, draw on protective factors and modify family functioning to support optimal adaptation in the face of adverse experiences (Rolland &#x00026; Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>; Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>; Benzies &#x00026; Mychasiuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; McCubbin &#x00026; McCubbin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1996</xref>). Resilience-based mental health promotion interventions can assist families to identify their strengths, recognise the protective factors and resources they can utilise and build on within their family and the environment, and provide opportunities to practice specific strategies to improve coping and family functioning (Padesky &#x00026; Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>).</p><p>Interventions aimed at improving the mental health and wellbeing of families living with childhood illness provide evidence that helping families to identify positive coping skills (Barrera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>; Sahler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>; Sansom-Daly et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>; Scholten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>), enhance family functioning (Hocking &#x00026; Lochman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Jerram et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>; Lobato &#x00026; Kao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2002</xref>; Loding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>) and access resources including social support (Chernoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>; Merkel &#x00026; Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>; Monaghan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>; Stewart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2011</xref>) result in positive patient and family outcomes. There is evidence that interventions targeting parents have positive outcomes for the child and family, given that parental wellbeing and family functioning has a significant impact on the child&#x02019;s health outcomes and coping with the illness (Sein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2001</xref>; Raina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Tong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2008</xref>; Scholten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>; Hocking &#x00026; Lochman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Eccleston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Patterson &#x00026; Geber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1991</xref>; Peek &#x00026; Melnyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>) and sibling adjustment (Sahler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>; Drotar &#x00026; Crawford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1985</xref>). The literature also suggests that the efficacy and acceptability of parent based interventions is enhanced when conducted in a group setting, as the group provides the additional benefit of opportunities for exchange of information, shared experience and mutual support for parents experiencing child-illness related stress (Chernoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>; Merkel &#x00026; Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>; McCarthy &#x00026; Sebaugh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2001</xref>).</p><p>Although existing research supports the efficacy of interventions to improve the mental health and wellbeing of families living with chronic illness, there are a number of limitations to the existing evidence. Published reviews report a focus on improving disease management (e.g. enhancing treatment adherence, reducing or managing symptoms) with fewer studies addressing psycho-social outcomes or using a health promotion approach (Peek &#x00026; Melnyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>; Barlow &#x00026; Ellard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>; Glasscoe &#x00026; Quittner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have used insufficiently validated outcome measures, short follow up periods, small sample sizes, non-standardized intervention delivery or provided inadequate detail of intervention content (Eccleston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Barlow &#x00026; Ellard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>; Glasscoe &#x00026; Quittner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>; Pai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2006</xref>). Previous interventions have also been limited by the absence of a theoretical framework for a project&#x02019;s design and reliance on delivery by mental health professionals within clinical settings (Peek &#x00026; Melnyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>; Marsac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). Thus, there is a need for studies that develop and evaluate interventions designed to improve the mental health of families living with childhood chronic illness that address these limitations.</p><p>This paper describes the methodology for the Child Illness and Resilience program (CHiRP). The CHiRP program is a stepped-care mental health promotion intervention guided by family resilience theory designed to support families who care for a child or young person with chronic illness. The intervention resources will assist families to identify existing strengths and provide strategies that target key protective factors and processes that enhance family resilience, such as family functioning, coping skills and utilising resources including social support.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim and hypotheses</title><p>This study aims to improve the resilience and wellbeing of families caring for a child living with chronic illness. Specifically, the objectives of the study are to: 1) improve the capacity of health services to provide family resilience information and strategies to families; 2) determine if the CHiRP resources are acceptable to parents; 3) increase parents knowledge and confidence to implement strategies to improve their family resilience; 4) promote parental help seeking behaviours and 5) improve the resilience and psychological wellbeing of families by providing a stepped care intervention to parents that increases in intensity according to the family&#x02019;s situation. It is hypothesised that a significant positive improvement in outcome measures of constructs indicating family resilience (parental wellbeing, family functioning, family beliefs, and perceived social support) will be observed between baseline and follow up assessments as a result of receiving a family resilience self-directed booklet. Furthermore, for parents who are experiencing psychological distress, it is hypothesised that participation in a parent information support group (in addition to receiving the booklet) will result in greater improvement on the same outcome measures. It is further anticipated that participants will report that the intervention content and delivery style is acceptable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The setting is a paediatric hospital in regional New South Wales that provides healthcare services to approximately 16,675 children per year who reside in the Newcastle, Hunter and New England regions (Australia). The intervention uses a stepped care design, such that increasing levels of intervention support are provided to families living with childhood chronic illness based on the level of parental distress. Step one involves the routine dissemination of a Family Resilience and Wellbeing Fact Sheet using single group assignment. Step two involves the targeted dissemination of a parent-focussed Family Resilience and Wellbeing information and activity booklet and will employ a repeated measures pre-post design. Step three involves the active participation of parents in a Family Resilience and Wellbeing Information Support Group and will employ a randomised waitlist control design. The dissemination strategy and research design for each step of the intervention is outlined in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

This will be automatically printed with paediatric discharge summaries and routinely disseminated alongside normal clinical practice. This component of the intervention will ensure all families who have a child discharged from the wards of the paediatric hospital, regardless of the reason for admission, will receive standardised brief family resilience and wellbeing support information. There will be no direct data collection from this group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 2 targeted dissemination: booklet intervention</title><p>All parents who have a child who attends one of four selected outpatient clinics at the paediatric hospital will be considered eligible to participate in this stage of the intervention. The outpatient clinics at the paediatric hospital were selected for inclusion based on patient occupancy, illness presentations and clinic attendance rates. The clinics include Cystic Fibrosis, Diabetes, Gastroenterology and Rheumatology. These clinics provide a service predominantly to children living with a diagnosed chronic illness. Clinics operate once a week on a rotating basis and provide appointments to approximately 350 children per month in total.</p><p>Parents with children attending these selected outpatient clinics will be invited to participate in the program via a mailed invitation that includes the participant information statement, consent form and questionnaire. This will be delivered a minimum of two weeks prior to their child&#x02019;s clinic appointment. The booklet will be provided to participants once the research team receives the completed questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Step 3 active dissemination: parent information support group intervention</title><p>Participants who report psychological distress at the 3-month follow up of Step 2 will be considered eligible to participate in Step 3 of the intervention. Psychological distress will be defined according to cut off scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) (Kessler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>). There is some evidence that support groups are of optimal benefit for this portion of the target population (Turner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2001</xref>). All parents reporting a K10 score above 15 (Slade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>) will be eligible for the group. Eligible parents will be contacted by phone by a member of the CHiRP research team and invited to attend an Information Support Group. Participants who agree to attend the Information Support Group will be randomly allocated to the group or waitlist condition using standard statistical computer software. Researchers will not be blinded to group assignment.

Participants will complete the questionnaire at home or while waiting for the clinic appointment, and it will be available to complete in hard copy or online. Baseline data collection for Step 2 will occur from September 2013 to March 2014.</p><p>Follow up data will be collected from all participants in Step 2 at three and six months after completing the baseline assessment and receiving the Booklet intervention. On both follow up occasions, to minimise attrition, participants will receive a prompt letter advising that follow up will occur. Participants will be contacted by phone approximately two weeks after receiving the prompt letter and be given the option to complete the questionnaire over the phone with a member of the CHiRP team, be sent the questionnaire to complete in hard copy (and return it with a reply paid envelope), or complete the questionnaire online.

Medical records for the child of parents in Step 3 will be reviewed to record any hospital-based nursing or allied health staff involvement with the family.</p><p>On completion of the Information Support group, participants will be provided with the follow up questionnaire as part of the last group session. Follow up assessment of the group intervention will occur between April &#x02013; September 2014. Participants in the waitlist control group will be completing the 6-month follow up assessment from baseline in Step 2 of the study at this time. This will provide the control comparison data to assess the additional impact of the group intervention, compared to receiving the booklet alone. The waitlist control group will then proceed to participate in the group intervention. All participants in Step 3 will be scheduled to complete a final follow up (single-group) assessment six months after they attended the group. This will provide repeated measures pre-post data regarding the longer-term efficacy of the group intervention. Participants will receive a prompt letter regarding six month follow up and approximately two weeks later a phone call, giving them the option to complete the questionnaire over the phone, online or receive a hard copy in the mail.

The K10 uses a five-point rating scale asking how often in the last four weeks participants have experienced symptoms pertaining to nervousness, agitation, psychological fatigue and depression. Higher scores indicate higher levels of distress. The K10 has established validity and acceptable reliability (Andrews &#x00026; Slade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; Centre for Population Studies in Epidemiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Family functioning</title><p>The McMasters Family Assessment Device (FAD) will be used to measure family functioning (Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>). The FAD identifies strengths as well as limitations in family functioning across seven dimensions including problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behaviour control and general functioning (Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>). Statements describe various aspects of family functioning and respondents indicate agreement on a four-point scale, with lower scores indicating better family functioning. The FAD has adequate internal and test retest reliability (Epstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1983</xref>; Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1985</xref>) and appropriate construct and criterion validity (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1985</xref>; Kabacoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Social connectedness</title><p>The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOSSSS) assesses perceived availability of functional support (Sherbourne &#x00026; Stewart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1991</xref>).

The group program content will be based on the &#x0201c;Strong Parents, Resilient Families&#x0201d; booklet and will provide the additional benefit of an opportunity for discussion and practice of the strategies within a facilitated, interactive peer-supported environment.</p><p>Parents managing childhood chronic illness have significant demands on their time and participation in face-to-face groups can be low and attrition rates high (Stewart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>). In light of this, the information support group will combine face-to-face delivery with interactive online delivery strategies. The intervention will be conducted over six weeks. In week one, participants will attend a full day session (4&#x000a0;hours&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x000a0;hour lunch) during which they will have the opportunity to connect with other parents, share their experience and interact with the facilitators to engage with the material in the &#x0201c;Strong Parents, Resilient Families&#x0201d; booklet. This session will include up to 15 participants and will be run by two trained facilitators with a background in psychology or allied health. Over weeks two to five, material pertaining to family resilience strategies will be posted once a week onto an online forum by a research team member who will act as moderator of the site. Participants will be encouraged to read the material, engage in the activity with their family, and post their comments for group online discussion. In week six, a final session will provide an opportunity for parents to meet face-to-face to discuss their experiences, review their participation in the program and complete the evaluation. A facilitator manual detailing the content, structure and format of each session and online material will maximise standardised delivery of the intervention content. Collaboration with outpatient clinic staff (e.g. Clinical Nurse Consultants or Social Workers) and carer support services will allow for delivery of the program to occur with the support of existing service providers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>CHiRP has been approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref No.13/03/20/4.06) and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref No. H-2013-0157).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sample size</title><p>In Step 1, it is expected that the Fact Sheet will be provided to 1050 parents of children discharged from paediatric hospital services based on an estimate of inpatient numbers over a 12-month period in 2011. There will be no direct data collection from this group.</p><p>A sample size calculation was conducted to guide recruitment for Step 2, the booklet intervention. Using mean estimates based on normative scores (Andrews &#x00026; Slade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; Kabacoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1990</xref>; Sherbourne &#x00026; Stewart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1991</xref>; Sixbey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>) and a hypothesised effect size of 0.2 as a result of receiving the family resilience and wellbeing booklet, a minimum sample of 98 participants at the three-month follow up assessment will have sufficient power (0.8) to detect a significant difference between mean scores (using alpha 0.05) in a one-sample comparison of baseline and three month follow-up data. A larger sample size will be recruited, however, to allow for attrition and sufficient numbers of participants eligible for Step 3.</p><p>In Step 3, the Parent Information Support Group intervention, using a randomised waitlist control design, the sample size will be divided randomly and equally between the group condition and the waitlist control condition. A sample size calculation used mean estimates based on a sample of Australian patients diagnosed with a mental disorder (Kohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>) using the K10 and normative scores for the other outcome measures of interest. Effect sizes of 0.5 and 0.3 were hypothesised as a result of receiving the booklet intervention and participating in the information support group intervention or being in the control group, respectively. A sample size of approximately 120 (60 per group) participants at the three month follow up assessment will allow detection of a significant difference between mean scores using an alpha level of 0.05 in a two-sample comparison of the group condition and control condition on the outcome measures, with a power of at least 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Step 1 routine dissemination: fact sheet intervention</title><p>Descriptive statistics only will be used to describe the reach of the factsheet; and whether participants in Step 2 and Step 3 recall receiving the factsheet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Step 2 targeted dissemination: booklet intervention</title><p>Using oneway analyses of variance (ANOVA), the relationship between demographic data (e.g. gender, age categories, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, help-seeking behaviour categories) and baseline outcome measures will be explored.</p><p>The impact of the booklet intervention will be examined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare changes in mean scores from baseline to three-month follow-up on the outcome measures for all participants in Step 2 (n&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;353). To test for sustained change, a second analysis of the Step 2 participants will use a repeated measures mixed model to compare mean scores on outcome measures at baseline, three and six month follow-up for the participants who did <italic>not</italic> move into Step 3 (the Information Support Group Intervention phase).

Differences in responses according to demographic variables on the construct measures of interest (K10, FAD, family belief systems and MOSSSS) will also be analysed using oneway ANOVAs.</p><p>To examine the additional impact of the information support group intervention, relative to the wait-list control group (who will have only received the booklet intervention), an analysis of covariance will examine changes in mean scores on the outcome measures from baseline to post-intervention follow-up according to Group (n&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;60) versus Waitlist (n&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;60) allocation. To account for participant deviations from the protocol (such as dropout or failure to sufficiently participate in the group intervention), two analyses will be conducted. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle, which will assume all participants randomised to the intervention or waitlist group completed the study as per the research design and a per-protocol analysis will include only those participants who participate in a minimum of two-thirds of the intervention (Porta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). Following post-intervention follow-up data collection, the waitlist group will complete the information support group intervention, and complete the post-intervention follow up. All group-based intervention participants will complete a six-month follow-up assessment. Thus, to test for sustained change, a second analysis will compare mean scores at baseline, post-intervention and six-month follow up on the same outcome measures for all participants in Step 3 of the intervention (n&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;120). There will be no treatment allocation variable in this second analysis. Further analyses will adjust for baseline characteristics to control for any confounding effects.</p><p>Additional analyses will identify risk and protective factors on each construct measure (for example, scoring above 15 on the K10) (Slade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>) at baseline for Group and Waitlist participants, and include comparisons for participants who agree to participate in Step 3 of the intervention and attend the Information Support group, compared to those who decline to participate in this step of the project, despite meeting eligibility criteria.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CHiRP (Steps 1-3) aims to promote the psychological wellbeing and resilience of families of children and young people living with a chronic illness. This paper has provided an overview of the methodology to be employed to implement and evaluate a stepped care family resilience and wellbeing intervention.</p><p>The CHiRP intervention is guided by family resilience theory and identifies parents&#x02019; capacity to implement change to support optimal outcomes for the whole family. Utilising a behaviour change model (Padesky &#x00026; Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>) parents will be encouraged to recognise family strengths, coping skills and resources and be provided with the opportunity to develop skills and knowledge that promote resilience.</p><p>The effectiveness of CHiRP will be measured using standardised, psychometrically validated instruments of relevant constructs, i.e. parental wellbeing, family functioning, family beliefs and social support, which collectively provide a measure of family resilience. Positive changes in outcome measures will indicate improved family wellbeing and resilience. Renzaho et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>) have demonstrated a relationship between family functioning and parental psychological distress. It is expected that improvements in family functioning, including the dimensions of problem solving, communication, roles and behaviour will reflect adaptation and coping with chronic illness (Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>; McCubbin &#x00026; McCubbin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1996</xref>) and will be associated with improved parental wellbeing. Changes on the family beliefs scales will reflect the process in resilience where families make meaning of adversity and maintain a positive outlook. Positive change on the social support measure will indicate improved perception of the availability of social support, a protective factor contributing to family resilience (Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>; Benzies &#x00026; Mychasiuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; McCubbin &#x00026; McCubbin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1996</xref>). Analysis will also be able to contribute to the development of a psychometrically valid and reliable method for measuring family resilience.</p><p>CHiRP will employ a stepped care design to meet the demands of scientific rigour as well as conform to the pragmatic considerations involved in implementing research in a busy paediatric hospital setting. The dissemination of the Fact Sheet in Step 1, as part of routine paediatric discharge procedures, maximises the opportunity for families of hospitalised children (regardless of reason for admission) to receive brief, standardised information regarding ways to promote family resilience. The use of a single group pre-post design in Step 2, while potentially limiting the generalizability of outcomes for the booklet intervention, corresponds to the practicalities involved in implementing mental health promotion practices in the busy outpatient clinic environment (Merkel &#x00026; Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). The use of a randomised waitlist control group in Step 3 ensures that the impact of the Information Support group can be rigorously evaluated, while allowing all consenting parents who are experiencing psychological distress to receive the highest level of intensity of the CHiRP intervention.</p><p>CHiRP meets an identified need for mental health promotion and prevention interventions that enhance family resilience and wellbeing in families of children with chronic illness who are more vulnerable to mental health issues. Through provision of the Family Resilience Fact Sheet and the Strong Parents, Resilient Families workbook, this study will provide information and strategies in a format that families can access and work through independently, without relying on intensive mental health or medical professional delivery. These family interventions are designed to empower parents to help the whole family cope better by learning new strategies and interacting with each other (Marsac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). Further, through provision of the Information Support Group this study will provide additional support to parents reporting the highest levels of distress. If effective, CHiRP will increase the capacity of health services to provide standardised family resilience information and strategies to families living with a child with chronic illness.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>First author KH led the development of this manuscript.
