The AGHE advises that a varied diet, which includes foods from these five food groups, should be consumed in order to meet nutrient requirements.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> &#x02018;Discretionary&#x02019; foods are defined by the AGHE as foods and beverages, which are often energy-dense and/or high in saturated fats, sugar or salt. AGHE recommends that the consumption of discretionary foods should be limited in order to reduce the risk of chronic disease such as CVD and high BP.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>It has been estimated that in the diets of individuals from developed countries, approximately 75% of dietary sodium is derived from salt added during the manufacture of foods<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and many of these types of foods are core foods such as breads, cereals and cheese.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, the AGHE dichotomisation of foods into core and discretionary foods does not explicitly refer to the level of food processing. Classifying foods based on the level of processing is important, as most purchased foods undergo different levels of processing such as peeling, chopping, extraction or refinement. Using a processed food classification system to group foods based on the type and level of manufacturing method allows for the distinction between foods that may differ by sodium content.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It is therefore relevant to assess both the relative contribution of core and discretionary foods to total sodium intake, and the contribution of the level of processing to daily sodium intake, particularly in children.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess dietary sodium intake and the food sources of sodium in a sample of Australian preschool children, and to assess the contribution from core and discretionary foods and levels of food processing to daily sodium intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study population comprised children participating in the Melbourne Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial (InFANT) Program. The study design for InFANT has been reported previously.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Briefly, InFANT was a cluster-randomised controlled trial involving first-time parents attending parents&#x02019; groups when their children were 3&#x02013;20&#x02005;months of age. InFANT was conducted in 2008&#x02013;2010 in 14 local government areas (LGAs) situated within the major metropolitan city of Melbourne, Australia.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Individual parents were eligible to participate if they gave informed written consent, were first-time parents, and were able to communicate in English. Each parent&#x02013;child dyad represented one parent and their first born.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Parent groups were eligible if &#x02265;8 parents enrolled or &#x02265;6 parents enrolled in areas of low socioeconomic position (SEP). Fifty per cent of eligible first-time parents&#x02019; groups within each LGA were randomly selected (62/103 groups) and approached by research staff for recruitment. When first-time parents&#x02019; groups declined to participate, another randomly selected group was approached.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The final recruitment of 62 parent group clusters resulted in a sample of 542 children,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and groups were randomised after recruitment in order to minimise selection bias. Parents were not blinded to allocation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The intervention group received anticipatory guidance on the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity, whereas the control group received information only on child health and development. The original InFANT cohort was followed-up when children were approximately 3.5&#x02005;years of age.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The present study uses data from this subset of children who completed the follow-up data collection. At follow-up, there were no differences in sodium intake between the intervention and control groups, and thus, the analysis included all participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The 24&#x02005;h dietary recall and food sources</title><p>Dietary intake was assessed by trained nutritionists by telephone-administered, multipass, 24&#x02005;h recall, with the child's parent, where all food and beverages consumed midnight to midnight on the day before the interview were recalled.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To limit bias, data were collected over 3&#x02005;days including one weekend day, and where possible, call days were unscheduled (96% of calls).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Recalls were non-consecutive,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the mean number of days between the first and last recall was 15.5&#x02005;days (SD 18.3&#x02005;days). Study-specific food measurement booklets aided parent's estimation of children's food consumption.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Sodium intake was calculated using the Australian nutrient composition database AUSNUT 2007.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> All recorded foodstuffs and drinks were matched to an eight-digit food code, which was linked to a set of nutrient data. All eight-digit food codes are comprised of a five-digit food code that represented &#x02018;minor&#x02019; food categories. Each minor food category fell under a three-digit submajor food category, which then fell within a two-digit major food category. For example, the eight-digit code for &#x02018;bread roll from white flour&#x02019; fell within the five-digit code for &#x02018;white breads and bread rolls&#x02019;, which was within the three-digit code for &#x02018;regular breads and bread rolls&#x02019;, which fell within the two-digit code for &#x02018;cereal and cereal products&#x02019;.

The AGHE describes five food groups: (1) grain (cereal) foods; (2) vegetables and legumes/beans; (3) fruit; (4) milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives and (5) lean meats and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds and legumes/beans.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this study, these foods have been described as core foods. Foods and beverages, which are energy-dense and/or high in saturated fats, sugars or salt, are defined by the AGHE as discretionary foods. Using a previously described classification system,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> all the food and beverage items consumed by children across the 3&#x000d7;24&#x02005;h recall periods were classified as core or discretionary foods.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Definition of processed foods</title><p>The NOVA processed foods classification system which groups foodstuffs into four categories (minimally processed, processed, processed culinary ingredient, ultraprocessed) according to the type and intensity of technological intervention was used to classify foods according to their level of processing. The criteria for classifying foods and ingredients into the four groups is described elsewhere.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In brief, the minimally processed food category often involves food preservation techniques which improves storage suitability and manufacturing methods which enhance palatability and food quality. Processed foods are derived from the addition of ingredients such as oil, sugar and salt to whole foods to make them more palatable. The processed culinary ingredient category includes ingredients used in the preparation of foods and may include versions of the original foods, whereas ultraprocessed foods typically contain little or no whole foods, and often contain ingredients such as preservatives and sweeteners which make foods highly palatable and convenient.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In this study, each five-digit food code representing minor food categories (n=286) from the InFANT data set were classified as a minimally processed, processed, processed culinary ingredient or ultraprocessed food. In some instances when it was difficult to classify some minor food categories, (n=9) the eight-digit food code was consulted to examine the individual food products within that category and to identify the ingredients and level of processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data analysis and statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe food group contributions to total sodium and energy intakes. Mean contributions and SD for the sample, and the percentage of the sample consuming each food group were calculated. The mean ratio method at the individual level was used to calculate the daily contribution of each food group to the participants&#x02019; sodium intake.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This method was also used to calculate the daily contribution of each food group to the participants&#x02019; average daily energy intake as well as the contribution of core and discretionary foods, and the four nominated types of processed foods to the participants&#x02019; sodium intake over 3&#x02005;days. Differences in the mean sodium intake between core and discretionary foods were assessed using independent t tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the differences in the mean sodium intake between the four types of processed foods. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducted using StataSE V.12 software (Release; StataCorpLP, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>InFANT follow-up participants</title><p>The derivation of participants in this study of sodium intakes at 3.5&#x02005;years in relation to the design of InFANT cohort are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008698F1">figure 1</xref>.

Within the meat, poultry and game products and dishes group, processed meat made the greatest contribution to sodium intake accounting for 8% of total sodium intake and 1.4% of energy intake, and this food group was consumed by 56% of children. Cheese (9%) and dairy milk (7%) contributed the most sodium within the milk products and dishes group, and collectively provided 18% of total energy.

In a previous analysis of children from the original InFANT Program at 18&#x02005;months, Campbell <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reported that 54% of children exceeded the UL recommendation for sodium. This increase in the proportion of InFANT participants exceeding the recommended upper levels for sodium intake at the age of 3.5&#x02005;years is the cause for concern, and likely reflects the continued transition for all children from lower sodium infant foods to sodium-rich foods such as bread, cheese and breakfast cereals. Our findings are similar to the most recent Australian national survey, which reported an average daily intake of 1484&#x02005;mg/day (salt equivalent approximately 4.0&#x02005;g/day) in children aged 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;years across 1&#x02005;day of intake,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and confirms that Australian preschool children's dietary sodium intake is excessive.</p><p>The major sources of dietary sodium were cereal and cereal products (eg, bread and bread rolls), meat and poultry products (eg, ham and bacon) and milk product dishes (eg, cheese) which are similar to the key sources of sodium for primary school children aged 4&#x02013;13&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Earlier analyses of the InFANT cohort at ages 9 and 18&#x02005;months, also found that bread, cheese and breakfast cereal were major sources of sodium.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These findings are consistent with the 2011&#x02013;2013 AHS which indicated that in children aged 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;years, the main sources of sodium were cereal-based products (eg, bread), cereal products (eg, mixed pasta/rice dishes), meat (eg, processed meat) and milk products (eg, cheese).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In this group, discretionary foods contributed 35% of total sodium for children across the 3&#x02005;days of intake, and more than half the children within our sample consumed discretionary foods such as processed meat. It is a matter of concern that a high proportion of young children are consuming these high-sodium discretionary foods. Importantly, we found that core foods contributed 65% of total sodium for children across 3&#x02005;days of intake. Although it was expected that core foods such as breads and cereals, which are known to be important contributors of sodium, would make a contribution to daily sodium intake,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> it is concerning that core foods contributed almost twice as much sodium as discretionary foods. It is therefore doubtful that children can reduce their sodium intake below the UL recommendations without the reformulation of core foods to lower levels of sodium.</p><p>In Australia, some progress has been made by the Food and Health Dialogue (FHD), a voluntary sodium reduction programme involving food industry stakeholders, to reduce the content of sodium in core and discretionary foods. The FHD has set voluntary sodium reduction targets for nine food categories, and of these, breads, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and processed meats were scheduled to achieve sodium reduction targets by December 2013.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Some of the maximum levels of sodium recommended by the FHD include: bread (400&#x02005;mg/100&#x02005;g) and processed meats products (1090&#x02005;mg/100&#x02005;g ham and bacon, and 830&#x02005;mg/100&#x02005;g luncheon meats), and a 15% sodium reduction target was applied to those ready-to-eat breakfast cereals where sodium levels exceeded 400&#x02005;mg/100&#x02005;g.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Despite the progress of the FHD programme, a recent evaluation found that by December 2013, just 67% of all breads met the targeted reduction; approximately half the ready-to-eat breakfast cereals had their sodium content reduced by at least 15%, and less than half the processed meats products had reached their targets.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, the range of sodium levels across Australian ready-to-eat breakfast cereals varies between 4 and 1063&#x02005;mg/100&#x02005;g, and applying only a 15% reduction to those cereals at the uppermost range in sodium levels would still result in the production of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals with excessively high sodium levels.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>In the development of widespread sodium reduction targets across the globe, Australia is falling behind the UK, the USA and Canada.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The UK has led the way with respect to the product reformulation of lower sodium foods. The UK voluntary salt reduction programme is a multicomponent strategy between the UK government, industry and public health groups, which has been coupled with consumer campaigns and the threat of regulation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This comprehensive programme included a set of progressively lower salt targets set by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) for &#x0003e;80 food categories, and between 2001 and 2012, has resulted in a reduction in the salt content of up to 50% in breakfast cereals, 45% in biscuits and 20% in breads.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Consequently, the average adult sodium intake in the UK has decreased from 9.5 to 8.1&#x02005;g/day,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which is the lowest known mean dietary sodium intake for adults of any developed country.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, the UK has become a proximate model for other countries aiming to reduce the population's salt intake.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Furthermore, a recent analysis has shown that applying the UK FSA targets to 85 minor Australian food categories, and a 25% reduction on a further 81 minor food categories could reduce the average sodium intake of Australian children aged 2&#x02013;16&#x02005;years by 20%.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although this 20% reduction is small, modest reductions in the population's salt intake can lead to substantial health and cost effects; in the UK, it has been estimated that the 0.9&#x02005;g/day reduction in salt intake has led to approximately 6000 fewer CVD deaths, saving the UK economy approximately &#x000a3;1.5 billion per annum.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> It is therefore imperative that there is a strong and coordinated commitment between the food industry and the FHD, to the reformulation of lower sodium food products, for without this, sodium intake will continue to exceed ULs recommended for health, even in our youngest populations.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating the contribution of sodium from core and discretionary foods, we also found that ultraprocessed foods contributed the greatest (48%) to total sodium, with processed (34%) and minimally processed foods (19%) contributing less, and culinary processed ingredients contributing the least (1%). Although there are no national recommendations, generally, foods are arbitrarily dichotimised into either processed or unprocessed foods, and the levels and types of food processing are often overlooked, particularly in national guidelines such as the AGHE. Thus, a reduction in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods would be a valuable educational approach in developing an effective strategy to reduce sodium intake in young children's diets.</p><p>The major strength of this study was the use of 3&#x02005;days of 24&#x02005;h dietary recall data. Importantly, the collection of detailed dietary intake data in this study allowed food sources of sodium to be described, specifically enabling identification of core and discretionary foods and four types of processed foods. The limitations of the study should also be noted; the 24&#x02005;&#x02005;h recall method fails to capture the amount of salt added at the table and, therefore, is likely to underestimate the true value of salt intake.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> While this is a limitation of our methodology, our understanding that the addition of salt at the table&#x000a0;is commonplace would suggest that total sodium intakes are likely to be even higher than reported here. Occasionally, some food product brands may have been unavailable within the food composition data base, and in these instances, dietary sodium assessment may not have been entirely accurate. The NOVA classification is a new processed-food grouping system and although it is not yet a well-established method of assessing diet quality, it has been included in the most recent Brazilian Dietary Guidelines.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In addition, our sample was subject to selection bias, as those included in the survey were more likely to have a university qualification, more likely to be born in Australia and to speak English at home; and the children had a lower BMI z-score when compared to those who did not participate, which reduces generalisability to the Australian population. However, given the known socioeconomic patterning of diet, whereby lower SES children eat nutritionally poorer diets, these data present the best-case scenario, and it is likely that children in lower SES families will indeed have greater sodium intakes than their higher SES peers.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>In summary, the findings of excessive sodium intake in Australian preschool children, and the identification of sources of key foods provides important evidence affirming the need to reduce sodium in the Australian food supply. Reducing preschool children's sodium consumption could result in a lifelong reduction in dietary sodium intake which is likely to reduce the age-related rise in BP, and represents a significant area for public health action.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants and the staff involved in InFANT.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SAO performed the statistical analysis and wrote the manuscript.
