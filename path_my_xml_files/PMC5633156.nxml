The article provides human performance data for 36 individuals collected using a virtual environment. Each participant was assigned to one of two groups for training: 1) G1: high level training and 2) G2: low level training. Participants&#x02019; performance was tested in 4 different virtual scenarios with different levels of visibility and complexity. Several performance metrics of the participants were recorded during each scenario. The metrics include: time to muster, time spent running, interaction with fire doors and watertight doors, interaction with hazards, and reporting at different muster locations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><bold>Specifications Table</bold><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><alt-text id="at0005">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td><italic>Engineering, Human factors</italic></td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td><italic>Safety &#x00026; Risk, Human Reliability Analysis</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td><italic>Text files</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">How data was acquired</td><td>Data were collected by conducting an experiment in a virtual environment.

The participants were na&#x000ef;ve concerning any detail of the experimental design, they were not employed in the offshore oil and gas industry, and therefore they were not familiar with the offshore platform. Each participant was assigned to one of two groups for training: 1) G1: high level training and 2) G2: low level training. Participants in both groups received basic offshore emergency preparedness training. Participants in G1 received additional training tutorials and practice scenarios on alarms and hazards.</p><p>Once a participant was assigned to a group, his/her training level remained static (either low or high) for the rest of the study. The PSFs visibility and complexity, on the other hand, were set to different levels to investigate how these PSFs influence each participant.
