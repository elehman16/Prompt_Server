on the dynamic balance ability of healthy young adults. [Subjects] Thirty-three healthy
adults participated in this study. [Methods] Subjects were randomly assigned to either an
open kinetic chain exercise group (n=17) or a closed kinetic chain exercise group (n=16).
Both the open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain exercise groups performed 3 sets of
exercises 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Dynamic balance was measured at the beginning and
end of the 6-week training period, including anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and total
displacement of the center of pressure. [Results] Both exercise groups showed improvement
in balance parameters but the improvement was only statistically significant in the closed
kinetic chain group. [Conclusion] Closed kinetic chain exercise appears to be more
effective at improving of dynamic balance ability than open kinetic chain exercise within
a 6-week training period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Open kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Closed kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Dynamic balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ability to maintain balance, one of the important factors in performing everyday
activities, is derived from complex interactions among the nervous system, musculature, and
skeletal system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintenance of balance
requires visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular feedback in order to respond to the changing
environment with appropriate balance strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Biomechanically, balance control is the ability to control the
center of gravity of the body in both static and dynamic environments. Balance control
secures postural stability by controlling the musculoskeletal system against gravity both at
rest and when the body center of gravity is being moved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, balance control is an important component in the
rehabilitation of many neuromuscular disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rehabilitation of balance can target static or dynamic balance. Dynamic balance is the
ability to maintain balance while the body is moving by keeping its center of gravity over
the base of support<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a moving body
stops and begins to move again, maintaining this equilibrium requires selective contraction
and relaxation of various muscles to control the position of the center of gravity over the
moving base of support<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Important parameters of balance performance include range of motion, muscle strength,
somatosensory function, and the size and quality of the base of support<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscles can be strengthened through resistance training,
which can be divided into open kinetic chain (OKC) and closed kinetic chain (CKC)
exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Open kinetic chain exercise
occurs when the movement allows the distal part of the limb to move freely while the
proximal part is fixed. OKC exercise plays an important role in isolating individual muscle
groups. It tends to generate more distraction and rotational forces and is often used with
concentric muscle contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Closed
kinetic chain exercise is a movement wherein the distal part is fixed, as when the sole of
the foot makes contact with the ground or the exercise equipment. With the distal part
fixed, movement at any one joint in the kinetic chain requires motion as well at the other
joints in the kinetic chain. Thus both proximal and distal parts receive resistance training
at the same time. In the case of the lower limb, CKC exercises are more functional, as
weight bearing is, by definition, a closed kinetic chain activity of the lower limb. CKC
exercise has been cited as producing superior eccentric contraction and co-contraction of
muscles, as well as reducing shear forces while adding compressive forces to the joints,
thereby enhancing joint stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Several studies have investigated the effects of muscle strengthening using OKC and CKC
exercise programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, but few studies have examined which exercise program would be
helpful for improving dynamic balance performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to investigate the effect of OKC and CKC exercises on the dynamic balance performance of
normal healthy adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Baseline characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GroupVariable</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OKC group (n=17)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CKC group (n=16)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.1&#x000b1;0.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.0&#x000b1;0.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.1&#x000b1;33.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">164.8&#x000b1;7.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.1&#x000b1;11.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.2&#x000b1;7.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">APD (mm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">688.6&#x000b1;146.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">748.2&#x000b1;188.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLD (mm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">578.2&#x000b1;165.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">635.1&#x000b1;196.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TD (mm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1005.8&#x000b1;220.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1093.3&#x000b1;299.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD, * p&#x0003c;0.05</p><p>OKC: Open kinetic chain; CKC: Closed kinetic chain; APD: Anterior-posterior

orthopedic diseases, or problems with balance due to vestibular or visual impairment. They
were healthy functional adults who did not regularly exercise. Subjects were randomly
allocated to either an OKC or CKC exercise group, and each group performed the prescribed
exercises three times a week for six weeks. A description of the purpose and methods of the
study was provided to all the participants, and the experiments were conducted after the
participants had read and signed an informed consent form. Subject characteristics are
summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The independent t-test
was used to compare demographic variables (age, height and weight) and pre-balance measures
of center of gravity displacement. There were no significant differences between demographic
variables or pre-exercise balance abilities of the two groups.</p><p>Subjects were asked to perform repetitive exercise using open and closed kinetic chain
exercise equipment. For OKC exercise, subjects sat on a knee extensor machine (HUR, Finland)
and extended their knees starting from 90 degrees of knee flexion. For CKC exercise,
subjects used the Shuttle 2000-1 (Contemporary Design Company, USA), extending their knee by
pushing on the foot stand of the device from 90 degrees knee flexion. A resistance level of
80% of 1RM was used by both groups, as described by Holten<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three sets of ten repetitions were performed in each exercise
session and the sessions were conducted three times a week for six weeks. The exercise was
halted if the therapist observed subject fatigue, pain, or decrease in coordination ability.
To minimize muscle fatigue, there were two-minute breaks between sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The HUR knee extensor uses pneumatic air resistance while
the Shuttle 2000-1 uses variable elastic resistance as well as body weight; thus,
quantifying and comparing the resistance levels between of the devices was not feasible. By
using a resistance level of 80% RM for each device, comparable levels of resistance could be
maintained for both exercise groups.</p><p>This study used the Good Balance System (GBS) Ver.3.06 (METITUR, USA) to assess subjects&#x02019;
ability to control dynamic balance following open or closed kinetic chain exercise. The GBS
uses a diagonal force platform to convert shifts in weight to digital data to obtain a
quantitative assessment of maintenance of balance. The GBS measures anterior-posterior (AP),
medial-lateral (ML) and total displacement (TD) of the center of gravity over time. Subjects
were asked to step forward diagonally to the right and back and then to step forward to the
left and back to a marker on the force platform and the amount of sway from the target was
recorded. Balance was measured before and after the six-week exercise period. Data analysis
was performed using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The paired t-test was used to measure the change
in balance within each group between pre-and post-training sessions, with a level of
significance of 0.05. Estimated reliability coefficients for the GBS variables have been
reported by Ceria-Ulep et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> as
ranging from 0.22 to 0.73, but these measures were recorded during 15 to 30 seconds of
static balance. There are no reports of the reliability of the GBS for dynamic balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Mean COP displacement in the open- and closed-kinetic chain exercise

anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and total displacement of COP of both exercise groups at
pre- and post-training. All mean displacement values decreased in both groups, demonstrating
improvement in dynamic balance ability, but in the OKC group the change was not
statistically significant for any measure, while in the CKC group the change in displacement
was statistically significant for all three measures. As seen in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the pre-exercise balance scores of the CKC group were all
poorer than those of the OKE group. Although the mean scores were not statistically
different at baseline, this raises that question as to whether the CKC group had more room
for improvement, as they had somewhat poorer balance to start with. This possibility could
be addressed with a larger sample size. However, the present data shows that not only was
the change in balance greater in the CKC group, but also the final balance scores were all
lower in the CKC group. This means that the CKC group, on average, started off with poorer
balance than the OKC group, but finished with better balance than the OKC group, which is
suggestive of a true treatment effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Muscle strength decreases if there are lesions in the muscular tissues or their nerves,
lesions in the joints controlled by the muscles, or as a person ages. In addition, if muscle
activity is not performed for a long time, muscle strength decreases through muscular
atrophy. When muscle activities are consistently increased through resistance exercise,
muscle strength gradually increases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the present study population did
not have any disorders that would have affected muscle strength, they were not regular
exercisers and therefore had the potential for strength gains within a relatively short time
period.</p><p>To maintain balance of the human body, several systems interact with each other. To
maintain the center of gravity over the base of support, the body combines input acquired
through vision, somesthesia, and vestibular senses and controls movement through
synchronized muscle contraction based on that information. The body reacts to new positions
based on changes in the base of support to maintain balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various exercises such as aerobic exercise, open and closed kinetic
chain exercise, and Tai Chi exercise have been used to improve balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study investigated whether open and closed kinetic chain exercises improve dynamic
balance ability in healthy adults who had no exercise habit. The anterior-posterior,
medial-lateral, and total displacements of center of pressure, representive of dynamic
balance ability, were significantly reduced in the CKC group at post-test, whereas no
significant differences were found in the OKC group. The OKC exercise was isolated to the
knee extensors, while the CKC exercise involved hip, knee and ankle muscles. CKC exercise,
by virtue of being weight bearing, also involves more joint compression. Thus, both the
neuromuscular activation of multiple muscle groups and the proprioceptive feedback from the
sole of the foot and the lower extremity joints during CKC exercise is closer to that
required in weight bearing balance.</p><p>Improvement in balance can be achieved by either strength gains or improved motor control
(or both). Strength was not measured before or after training, so it is not known how much
of the improvement in balance was derived from strength gains. However, the CKC exercises
performed in this study were done while on a seated apparatus, as opposed to performing CKC
exercises while weight bearing, as in squats. Therefore any motor control training that did
occur was not the result of targeting balance mechanisms, as the vestibular and visual
systems were not challenged during seated CKC training. However, the CKC training did
involve more coordination and co-contraction of antigravity muscles. Therefore the benefits
of CKC exercises may have accrued from a combination of more muscles being strengthened and
those muscles being trained to co-contract together.</p><p>Because both exercise devices strengthened muscles that act primarily in the sagittal plane
(knee and hip extensors) the balance parameter that would be expected to show the greatest
improvement from strength gains is the anterior-posterior displacement. However,
medial-lateral balance (and total balance) measures improved even more than the
anterior-posterior measure, suggesting a training effect that goes beyond simply muscle
strengthening.</p><p>Only one other study has examined the effect of CKC exercises on balance. Dannelly et
al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> examined balance performance in the
Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) before and after performance of CKC and OKC exercises.
They found that following 13 weeks of resistance training, both strength training methods
resulted in a significant improvement in left leg balance in the posteromedial direction and
marginally significant improvements in right leg balance in the posteromedial direction;
however, there were no significant changes in balance in the anterior direction in either
leg. The SEBT used in their study focuses on the ability to reach while standing on one leg,
while the present study measured displacement of center of pressure without reaching.
Danelly et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> also used different
exercise equipment and a different training period and examined only women. The difference
in exercise equipment is of particular importance. The device used by Dannelly et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup> for CKC exercise was a type of sling
suspension that provides resistance to push-ups and pull-ups while being suspended above the
ground. This would recruit muscles in a completely different fashion from CKC exercises that
give resistance through the sole of the foot, which should better mimic weight bearing
muscle recruitment during balance.</p><p>In previous studies, lower body CKC training has been shown to be more effective than OKC
training for improving vertical jump performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and CKC training has generated
muscular co-contraction, resulting in greater joint stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These findings agree
with the results of present study, because CKC exercise would develop better joint coupling
at the hip and knee than OKC exercise focusing on knee extension alone.</p><p>In conclusion, CKC exercise for 6 weeks significantly improved dynamic balance of healthy
adults, while OKC exercise produced a positive, but not significant improvement. Limitations
of this study include a small sample size, and the lack of strength measurement of subjects&#x02019;
ankles, knees, and hips. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, and compare the
effect of open and closed kinetic chain strengthening exercises on dynamic balance of
patients with ankle instability or knee or hip osteoarthritis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Horak</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Postural orientation and equilibrium: what do we need to
