training using Nintendo Wii on balance and walking for stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Forty stroke patients with stroke were randomly divided into two exercise program
groups: virtual reality training (n=20) and treadmill (n=20). The subjects underwent their
40-minute exercise program three times a week for eight weeks. Their balance and walking
were measured before and after the complete program. We measured the left/right
weight-bearing and the anterior/posterior weight-bearing for balance, as well as stance
phase, swing phase, and cadence for walking. [Results] For balance, both groups showed
significant differences in the left/right and anterior/posterior weight-bearing, with
significant post-program differences between the groups. For walking, there were
significant differences in the stance phase, swing phase, and cadence of the virtual
reality training group. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that virtual
reality training providing visual feedback may enable stroke patients to directly adjust
their incorrect weight center and shift visually. Virtual reality training may be
appropriate for patients who need improved balance and walking ability by inducing their
interest for them to perform planned exercises on a consistent basis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality training</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many stroke patients with stroke have a balance problems while standing because they tend
to put their weight on their non-paralyzed lower limb to increase swing of their upper
body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falling accidents due to such
decline in balance ability is on the increase annually. Falling is caused by sudden
paralysis, seizure or external pressure. Even when there is no injury from falling, frequent
falling can sufficiently disrupt physical and social activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because deterioration of muscular strength and balance
ability increases the risk of falling, it is significantly important to perform exercises to
promote upper limb muscular strength and training for balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regular exercise of walking and for muscular strength and balance
may increase muscular strength and balance to prevent falling of patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking, in particular, is known to be a
safe type of aerobic exercise for patients, having the merit that it can be performed
gradually by considering appropriate intensity, frequency, period, and phases of exercise
for abilities of each patient<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently
efficiency of walking training using a treadmill has attracted more attention as when such
training has been reported to have better effects than walking on even ground. Some
researchers reported that walking on a treadmill is effective in improving balance and
walking ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With recent developments of relevant computer programs, new methods of rehabilitation
exercise are being introduced. Such exercises can increase interest and participation of
patients in treatment and improve their significant functions by enabling them to perform
various forms of tasks appropriate for goals of individual patients in virtual reality.
Virtual reality indicates a type of interactive simulation using computer hardware and
software, in which users can have close-to-reality experiences<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality training using visual feedback enables the
participants to undergo the training while seeing their movements with their own eyes, a
feature that helps them adjust their inaccurate body center caused by body image damage
suffered by most stroke patients. In addition, training serves as a catalyst in active
participation and performance of tasks by inducing interest and pleasure, providing
immediately visual feedback on the result to enhance motor education ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many recent researches of virtual reality
games with higher accessibility reported that such games showed significant effects on
voluntary control and coordination of children with cerebral palsy and increases in the
motor ability of patients with Parkinson disease<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those types of games were also effective on recovery of upper limb
functions and induced significant improvement in balance and walking of stroke patients,
showing that the games can be used as an effective method of intervention<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a means of overcoming limitations of the existing intervention methods, virtual reality
shows an availability it has to being applied in the rehabilitation of stroke patients.
However, devices of virtual reality in previous studies are so large that they are difficult
to be used in general social institutes or homes in terms of scale and cost. Furthermore,
they are targeted to a small number of patients. In this context, the purpose of this study
was to perform treadmill exercise and virtual reality training exercise using Nintendo Wii,
a device that can be easily used without regard to place or facility, in order to
investigate the effects on balance and walking of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty stroke patients participated in this study. All of the subjects were sufficiently
explained of this study and voluntarily consented to their participation in the experiment.
This study was approved by the research agency, and all participants provided written
informed consent. Those who could perform communication, comply with instructions in this
study, perform balancing and walking independently, had no pain limiting execution of
exercise, and had no disability in sight, hearing, and the vestibular organs were selected
to be the subjects of this study. The forty stroke patients were randomly divided into two
exercise program groups with one group using virtual reality training (n=20) and another
group using a walking exercise program using a treadmill (n=20). Age for the virtual reality
group, the age was 62.2 &#x000b1; 7.2&#x02005;years old, the height was 162.8 &#x000b1; 6.7&#x02005;cm, the weight was 58.1
&#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;kg, and the onset period was 30.4 &#x000b1; 5.4 months. Age for the treadmill group, the age
was 63.2 &#x000b1; 5.4&#x02005;years old, the height was 164.7 &#x000b1; 7.5&#x02005;cm, the weight was 60.2 &#x000b1; 4.5&#x02005;kg, and
the onset period was 31.6 &#x000b1; 7.4 months.</p><p>All subjects exercised for 40 minutes three times per week for eight weeks. The virtual
reality group underwent training using the Wii-fit software by Nintendo, Japan. When playing
the Nintento Wii, the participants used wireless controllers to interact with the avatars on
the screen via the virtual reality motion detection system. The controllers were attached by
acceleration detecting sensors responding to changes in direction and speed. Due to the
detector being installed on the television, the screen showed the movements of the
controller just as the player performed the movements<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The virtual reality system used in this study was the Wii board
balance system, in which users played games while the balancing board sensed weight shift
and distribution. The subjects of the virtual reality group performed yoga, muscular
strength exercise, aerobic exercise, and balancing exercise, all for 10 minutes each for a
total of 40 minutes. The treadmill group used low-speed treadmills for patients to directly
control their speed based on their walking ability while walking for 40 minutes. The
treadmills were equipped with handles on the front and on both sides, which the users could
grip when they lost balance walking. The dashboards on the front showed walking time,
distance and calorie consumption.</p><p>We used a Pedoscan (RSscan 1m, Germany) to measure balance of the subjects. The device
consisted of 4,096 sensors for measuring pressures on both feet in static standing,
computerizing left/right weight-bearing and anterior/posterior weight-bearing by separating
each area. The patients were asked to stand up straight on the device without any movement
for 30 seconds. We used a Smart step (Andante, USA) to measure walking. The device was
attached to the dominant foot of a subject, measuring the anterior and posterior pressures
of the foot by the pressure detecting sensors on its insole. The insole between the foot and
the board sensed the vertical reaction force to measure the stance phase, swing phase,
cadence of the dominant foot. The measured signals were temporarily saved by the portable
compact controller attached to the ankle by receiving the walking data of the subject and
then were computerized and calculated. Before the walking exercise, the Smart step insoles
were inserted in the shoes and were injected with air to maintain appropriate pressure.
After putting on the shoes and being attached to the controller on their ankles, the
subjects walked along a straight footpath for 10 meters, looking straight ahead.</p><p>Window SPSS 18.0 was used for statistical analysis. A paired t-test was used for before and
after comparisons, and an independent t-test was used for a between group comparison with a
significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>For balance, there were significant differences in both the virtual reality group and the

falling. Planned and consistent exercise is needed to prevent falling and strengthen
muscles, and exercises promoting weight bearing, resistance, and aerobic process are known
to be effective for such purposes<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Exercises enhancing lower limb muscular strength are sufficiently effective. Exercises for
lower limb muscular strength and balancing exercises are effective for the prevention of
falling and improvement of stamina of patients, but such exercises have some demerits
because the content is simple and thus boring. To supplement the demerits, new methods of
exercise owing to development of scientific techniques have been recently introduced where
patients can perform various tasks in virtual reality<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therapeutic
intervention via virtual reality is more advantageous than other intervention methods in
that it can provide relatively easy environmental control, availability in selecting
environments, training based on patients&#x02019; abilities via phase-in task difficulty, rapid and
precise feedback on performing tasks, and self-learning in safe environment<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We applied an eight-week exercise program to stroke patients who were divided into a
virtual reality exercise group and a treadmill walking group, in order to investigate
effects of each exercise on balance and walking.</p><p>The results of measuring balance and walking effects as the purpose of the virtual reality
exercise program showed that significant differences were shown in all the domains of the
left/right and anterior/posterior weight-bearing in balancing and the stance phase, the
swing phase, and the cadence in walking. For the treadmill group, significant differences
were displayed in the left/right and anterior/posterior weight-bearing in balancing.
Although the walking exercise program using a treadmill showed significant differences in
balancing ability, the exercise program using virtual reality training displayed significant
differences in balancing and walking because the patients could directly adjust their weight
center and shift due to visual feedback. In addition, various similar programs such as
jogging may further influence their balancing and walking. The results of this study suggest
that virtual reality training may be appropriate to provide planned and consistent exercises
for stroke patients who need improved balance and walking ability by giving visual feedback
to induce their interest.</p><p>Meanwhile, the results of this study are consistent with those reporting increases in
left/right, anterior/posterior stability of stroke patients who performed of virtual reality
training, or reporting significant improvement in the Berg Balance Test for the elderly who
underwent a training using virtual reality games<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, there were researches in which significant
differences were observed in balancing ability of the elderly with their eyes open after
they underwent a virtual reality exercise program, or in which significant differences were
found in balancing ability of the elderly after an eight-week virtual reality exercise
program. Meanwhile, the increase in walking ability shown in this study was consistent with
the results of studies in which electrotherapy based on virtual reality significantly
increased walking speed of stroke patients, or in which exercise using visual feedback was
effective on the walking ability of stroke patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study also, virtual reality training was effective in
producing positive improvements in balance and walking of stroke patients.</p><p>However, there remains insufficient research related to virtual reality because the
technology has not been fully commercialized yet. Further studies are needed to deal with
virtual reality for many patients to use it in performing various indoor exercise programs
and developing their abilities.</p><p>The results of this study may indicate that virtual reality training providing visual
feedback enables stroke patients to directly adjust their wrong weight center and shift
visually, and that it is appropriate for the patients who need improved balance and walking
ability by inducing their interest for them to perform planned exercise on a consistent
basis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was conducted by research funds from Gwangju University in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Laufer</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of walking aids on balance and weight-bearing
