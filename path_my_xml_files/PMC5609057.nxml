Such evidence led to the conduction of a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial aiming to test the effectiveness of an extract of three Cretan herbs, namely thyme (<italic>Coridothymus capitatus</italic> (L.)

Cav.), dictamnus (<italic>Origanum dictamnus</italic> L.) and sage (<italic>Salvia fruticosa</italic> Mill., <italic>Salvia pomifera</italic> L.), on the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. The results indicated amelioration in the severity of symptoms, with 90% of treated patients being symptom-free at the last day of observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The extract was released in the market in 2015, in the form of nutritional supplement (extracts at a dilution of 15&#x000a0;ml/L in extra virgin olive oil, formulated as 0.5&#x000a0;ml soft-gel capsules, for a daily dose of two capsules).</p><p id="Par8">The aim of this observational study was to explore the extract&#x02019;s effectiveness on the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, after its market release, through a questionnaire-based inquiry of participants.

In order also to increase the possibility that the infection was viral, and not of any other type, the presence of fever was considered as a perquisite for inclusion in the study.

Multiple linear regression models were performed with dependent variables: the AuC, the day patients reported feeling better and the day patients reported their symptoms ceased completely.

Linear mixed models with dependent variables the total score of symptoms and presence of fever and independent variables the day of observation (1, 4, 7), supplementary medication intake (by day of observation), socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were used to assess symptoms&#x02019; alleviation over time.

Indeed, our data indicated significant decrease in symptoms&#x02019; scores in days 4 and 7 of observation, compared to baseline. We documented a reduction of 90.3% in the percentage of people reporting fever between days 1 and 4 and 97.6% between days 1 and 7, a result that has not been reported previously.

Additionally, information about the daily course of patients&#x02019; treatment could not be reported, since data was gathered at distinct time points. The presence of fever was, also, not recorded as exact temperature but rather as a dichotomous variable (yes/no). Almost two out of three patients received supplementary medication for their treatment. In all regression models, supplementary medication intake was modelled as dichotomous on each observation, since types and duration of intake differed for each patient. Thus, the effect of competitive active ingredients and types of medication could not be documented. Moreover, it was not possible to determine the extracts&#x02019; effectiveness on specific viral infections, since there was no identification of patients&#x02019; viral strains and viral loads.
