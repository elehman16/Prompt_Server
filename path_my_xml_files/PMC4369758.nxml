The aim of this work was to extend the semimechanistic integrated glucose-insulin model to include the effects of a GLP-1 analog on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients. Data from two trials comparing the effect of steady-state liraglutide vs. placebo on the responses of postprandial glucose and insulin in T2DM patients were used for model development. The effect of liraglutide was incorporated in the model by including a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. Furthermore, for one of the trials an inhibitory effect on glucose absorption was included to account for a delay in gastric emptying. As other GLP-1 receptor agonists have similar modes of action, it is believed that the model can also be used to describe the effect of other receptor agonists on glucose homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is secreted from the small intestine following food intake, is a potent glucose-lowering agent. The glucoregulatory effects of GLP-1 are facilitated through enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, slowed gastric emptying, glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion, and improved &#x003b2;-cell function.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 is preserved in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it has created considerable interest as an agent for the treatment of T2DM. However, since endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), resulting in a short half-life in humans (&#x0223c;2 minutes) after intravenous (IV) administration,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the therapeutic use of endogenous GLP-1 is limited. Instead, several derivatives with a longer duration of action have been developed.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analog that shares 97% amino acid sequence identity with native GLP-1.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The analog is obtained by creating two modifications to native GLP-1: the replacement of lysine with arginine at position 34 and the attachment of a C16 fatty acid chain via a &#x003b3;-glutamic acid spacer to lysine at position 26.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The fatty acid chain contributes to delaying absorption and extending the plasma half-life by increased binding to plasma albumin, while the lysine replacement makes DPP-4 unable to exert its action. Clinical trials have shown that liraglutide significantly reduces fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c and does so with a low risk of hypoglycemia in T2DM.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of a GLP-1 analog on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients by use of the previously developed integrated glucose-insulin (IGI) model<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> following appropriate modification.

The PD measurements, i.e., plasma glucose and serum insulin, measuring glucose homeostasis effects, as well as paracetamol, measuring gastric emptying effects, were sampled for 5 hours in trial 1 and 8 hours in trial 2 after MTTs in the presence of placebo or study drug. Treatment duration was 3 weeks in both trials. The liraglutide/placebo dose was escalated weekly in 0.6 mg increments from 0.6 mg until a daily dose of 1.8 mg was reached. In trial 1 MTTs were performed at each dose level, whereas in trial 2 MTTs were only performed at the highest dose level. In both trials standardized meals were served. In trial 2, a high-fat meal with a caloric density of 4 MJ was served, and in trial 1 the caloric density of the meal was 2 MJ.</p><p>The final model is illustrated in <bold>Figure</bold>

A significant model improvement was obtained by allowing k<sub>a</sub> to be reduced in trial 1 for the MTTs with liraglutide, such that two values for ka were estimated: one for the placebo data (k<sub>a,trial1,placebo</sub>) and one for the liraglutide data (k<sub>a,trial1,liraglutide</sub>). It was not possible to detect any liraglutide concentration-dependent reduction in k<sub>a</sub>. No model improvement was achieved by including different values for k<sub>a</sub> for the placebo and the liraglutide arm in trial 2.</p><p>In trial 2 the glucagon response was significantly reduced with liraglutide vs. placebo<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (no glucagon measurements were obtained in trial 1). Glucagon is not explicitly expressed in the IGI model; however, the IGI model for healthy subjects contains a delayed, glucose-dependent inhibition of endogenous glucose production (EGP),<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which accounts for the effect of glucagon. As T2DM patients have been shown to have a malfunction in the suppression of EGP, the IGI model for T2DM patients does not contain this feedback mechanism. However, in another trial<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the rate of EGP in the fasting state was significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated T2DM patients. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that liraglutide has an effect on EGP. This was tested by including an inhibitory effect of C<sub>lira</sub> on EGP. Different inhibitory functions were tested (linear and Emax), but they did not improve the fit nor were they statistically significant. For each inhibitory function it was checked that, with the estimated parameters, EGP remained positive at all relevant liraglutide concentrations. No effect of liraglutide on EGP was included in the final model.</p><p>The IGI model was able to describe the glucose and insulin data well, as seen in <bold>Figures</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>, in which time courses for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations for the two trials are shown together with the model fits. The MTTs with liraglutide were performed when liraglutide was at steady state. Thus, the glucose concentration at the start of the MTTs with liraglutide was less than the estimated glucose concentration at steady state G<sub>SS</sub>, which reflects the placebo steady-state concentration. In the model, all previous liraglutide doses are included to ensure that at the start of the MTTs with liraglutide the glucose concentration is less than G<sub>SS</sub>. For example, for trial 1 the estimate of G<sub>SS</sub> was 9.7 mM. At the start of the MTT with 0.6 mg liraglutide, the mean of the observed glucose concentrations was 8.1 mM, which is in accordance with the mean of the individual model predictions of 8.5 mM. At the start of the MTT with 1.2 mg liraglutide the mean observed glucose concentration was 7.6 mM and the mean of the individual model predictions was 7.7 mM. At the start of the MTT with 1.8 mg liraglutide the mean observed glucose concentration was 7.3 mM and the mean of the individual model predictions was 7.1 mM. There seems to be a trend in the insulin concentrations that the model does not quite capture (underprediction at the low liraglutide doses and overprediction at the higher liraglutide doses).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Time courses for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations for trial 1.

These therapies can be divided into two groups: (i) dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors, such as vildagliptin and sitagliptin, which increase the concentration of native GLP-1, and (ii) GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as liraglutide and exenatide.</p><p>Different models have been used to describe the effect of GLP-1-based therapies on glucose homeostasis. A mechanism-based population model of the effects of vildagliptin on GLP-1, glucose, and insulin in T2DM patients was developed by Landersdorfer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The effect of exenatide on insulin secretion during a hyperglycemic clamp<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> as well as the effect of liraglutide on glucose and insulin homeostasis in healthy volunteers<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> have been explored using an adapted minimal model. The effects of liraglutide in the adapted minimal model were implemented as a stimulatory effect on the magnitude of the first-phase insulin secretion and an increased second-phase insulin secretion. Also, exenatide was found to increase second-phase insulin secretion.</p><p>In this study the integrated glucose-insulin model was extended to describe the glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients treated with liraglutide. For this purpose data from two trials investigating the effect of steady-state liraglutide on glucose homeostasis were used.</p><p>The main effect of liraglutide on glucose homeostasis was incorporated in the IGI model as a concentration-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion. This is in accordance with prior modeling of the effects of GLP-1 analogs.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> No significant model improvement was achieved by including an inhibitory effect of liraglutide on the endogenous glucose production, which would mimic an effect on glucagon. Furthermore, in one of the two trials (trial 1) a significant model improvement was achieved by including an inhibitory effect of liraglutide on gastric emptying. As it was assumed that glucose is absorbed in the intestine and not in the stomach, this was modeled as a decreased glucose absorption rate for the MTTs with liraglutide.</p><p>The estimated glucose absorption rate in trial 1 was nearly twice as high as in trial 2. The caloric content of a meal is known to affect the gastric emptying rate, with decreased gastric emptying rate for increased caloric density.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In trial 2 the caloric content of the meals was twice as large as in trial 1. Thus, it was reasonable to assume that the gastric emptying rate in trial 2 was smaller than in trial 1, which agrees with the estimated values for glucose absorption rate.</p><p>The glucose equivalents of the meals were estimated instead of fixing the glucose doses based on the carbohydrate content of the meals. For trial 2, a glucose equivalent of the meal could be calculated based on the glycemic indices of the ingested food,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which suggested that the glucose equivalent of the meal was 25 g. If instead it is assumed that 1 kcal of carbohydrate is equivalent to 0.25 g of glucose, which has also been done in previous publications of the IGI model,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> then the glucose equivalent is 46 g. Both values are lower than the estimated glucose equivalent. Assuming that 1 kcal of carbohydrate is equivalent to 0.25 g of glucose, the glucose equivalent in trial 1 is 60 g, which is in line with the estimate of 51 g.</p><p>In another study investigating the effect of protein on glucose homeostasis, it was observed that the addition of protein to a glucose dose increased the insulin concentrations at least twofold compared to the ingestion of glucose alone, while little or no effect was observed for the postprandial glucose concentrations.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The addition of fat to a carbohydrate load also affects the glycemic response, as it slows down gastric emptying<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and markedly alters the appearance of ingested glucose.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Thus, the glucose and insulin concentrations following meal ingestion are highly dependent on meal composition. The IGI model in its current form is unable to handle the effect of protein and fat on glucose homeostasis, which may result in an overestimation of the ingested glucose for mixed meals. For simulation purposes, a more mechanistic model describing the effect of the different macronutrients on glucose homeostasis would be preferable, such that other meal types can be simulated. The development of such a model, however, would require data with different meal compositions.</p><p>In conclusion, we modified the IGI model for evaluating effects of GLP-1 analogs on glucose homeostasis in patients with T2DM. Our results confirm that the primary mode of action of liraglutide is via stimulated insulin secretion following a glucose challenge and that a minor effect on gastric emptying may also be present, depending on the composition of the ingested meal. No effect on endogenous glucose production could be detected using the model.</p><p>In this article, data from trials with liraglutide were used for model development. However, as other GLP-1 receptor agonists have similar modes of action as liraglutide, it is believed that the model with minor alterations can also be used to describe glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients treated with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Others are also working on implementing the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glucose homeostasis in the IGI model, and have presented similar results.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Thus, we conclude that the IGI model is a useful tool for investigating GLP-1 receptor agonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Data</title><p>For model development data from the following two trials were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial 1</title><p>Trial 1 was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period, crossover trial, comparing the effect of steady-state liraglutide at three dose levels (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg/day) vs. placebo on the responses of fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose, insulin, and gastric emptying in T2DM patients. Eighteen patients were recruited for the trial and they were randomly assigned to either treatment group A (3 weeks of once-daily liraglutide, 3&#x02013;4 weeks of washout, and 3 weeks of once-daily placebo) or B (3 weeks of once-daily placebo, 3&#x02013;4 weeks of washout, and 3 weeks of once-daily liraglutide). During each 3-week treatment period, the liraglutide/placebo dose was escalated weekly in 0.6-mg increments from 0.6 mg until a daily dose of 1.8 mg was reached. After 1 week of treatment at each dose level, an energy fixed MTT was performed. The patients were instructed to administer liraglutide/placebo in the evening and the MTT was performed in the morning. Along with the meal, patients also received 1.5 g paracetamol. During the MTT, plasma glucose, serum insulin, and paracetamol concentrations were measured.
