While they can affect people of all ages, the condition appears to develop mostly in childhood.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Fear of pain from the needle during local anesthesia, the mainstay of pain control during intraoral operative procedures, has been frequently indicated to be the most fear-evoking stimulus for dentally anxious children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Needle insertion and the deposition of solution are two aspects of local anesthetic injection that can cause pain. Topical anesthesia has been widely advocated as a method for reducing the discomfort associated with needle insertion and is an important component of atraumatic administration of intraoral local anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The additional time required to apply topical anesthesia may increase the child's apprehension concerning the approaching procedure,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the usefulness of topical anesthesia has been debated in several studies. It also seems that the benefits of topical anesthetics are not only pharmacological but also psychological.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Pain is a complex behavioral phenomenon that is not fully understood. Behavioral pain reaction ratings by direct observation, reports from the child or accompanying parent, and physiological measures are three main techniques for the assessment of dental fear and behavior management problems during the administration of local anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the present study, observational technique has been chosen for behavioral pain reaction assessment for two reasons. The first is that children are not aware that they want to receive an injection. The second is that the capacity of younger children for self-report of subjective experiences is doubtful.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Distraction during an injection has always been a technique to avert discomfort and negative feelings about that procedure as well as the entire dental appointment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hence, the aim of this study was to use direct observation to compare children's behavioral pain reactions when receiving anesthesia by cotton-roll vibration method versus routine topical anesthesia procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 48 children with a mean age of 5.94 &#x000b1; 1.88 (3.25-9.6) years, referred to a private specialty pediatric dental clinic, were entered into the study to assess their reactions to each of two methods of local anesthesia administration including cotton-roll vibration method versus control method. Based on a pilot study conducted on 20 children, and by considering a power level of 0.80, an alpha level of 0.05, and &#x00394; = 0.5 as the underlying treatment benefit for cotton-roll vibration method versus control method in children's behavioral pain reactions, the final sample size was determined as 48 children. To be included in the study, children had to be healthy with no history of systemic or psychological diseases, have no previous dental history, and were required to have two separate inferior alveolar nerve block or primary maxillary molar infiltration injections on contralateral sides of the jaws in the treatment process, with written parental permission. Children would be excluded from the study if they had a previous history of local anesthesia injection in another clinic and/or had a severe gag reflex. The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Children were introduced to dentistry in one or two sessions via prophylaxis with a rubber cup in a slow-speed handpiece and fluoride therapy. Before the first session of treatment with local anesthesia injection, the method of injection (cotton roll or control) was randomly assigned by the toss of a coin. Each child received the other method on the other side of the mouth at the next session.</p><p>In both methods, a standardized script of verbal distraction was used. A cylindrical cotton roll with a cherry-flavored red Master-Dent 20% benzocaine topical anesthesia gel (Dentonics, Inc., Monroe, NC, USA) applied to its head, without waiting for topical anesthesia gel to affect, was used for physical distraction in the cotton-roll method. Initially, the other head of the cotton roll was used to dry the needle insertion area for 2-3 s after which the cotton roll was rotated, and the gel was in contact with the needle insertion area kept in position by the dentist's left hand. Then, the dentist used his right hand and peripheral vision to smoothly and slowly bring the syringe to the child's mouth, and the cotton roll with gel remained in place with a mild vibratory stimulus applied by the left hand during the around 1 min injection of a carpule with 2% lidocaine and 1/80,000 epinephrine (Darou Pakhsh, Tehran, Iran) by means of a 27-gauge needle (Technophar s.p.a., Delebio, Italy). After injection, the syringe was removed, and mild vibratory stimuli with the cotton roll continued for a few seconds while the dentist pretended that this was the fault of the microbes of the tooth that did not want to sleep.</p><p>In the control method, the same amount of the same topical anesthesia gel applied using a cotton-tipped applicator for 1 min to the needle insertion area, which had been adequately dried with a 1 inch &#x000d7;1 inch cotton gauze pad for a few seconds (routine topical anesthesia procedure according to the textbook).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] After that, the applicator was removed, and the syringe was brought to the child's mouth smoothly and slowly with the dentist using peripheral vision, and with the same local anesthetic and the same needle gauge an injection was administered for 1 min. All these procedures have been done by the first author of the study. The local anesthesia duration was recorded in seconds from the start of drying until removing of the syringe and cotton roll in the control and cotton roll methods, respectively.</p><p>The children's behavioral pain reactions were measured according to the author-developed face, head, foot, hand, trunk, and cry (FHFHTC) scale, which was inspired by the face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability scale[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for scoring postoperative pain in young children. The content validity of this scale has been evaluated by seven pediatric dentists. In this scale, each item is scored from zero to three [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], which results in a total score of 0-18. To be more precise, these reactions were recorded by two extra nurses present in the treatment room who were unaware of the philosophy of the research. One nurse recorded the face, head, and cry reactions, and the other recorded the hand, foot, and trunk reactions.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Face, head, foot, hand, trunk, and cry scale for assessment of behavioral pain reactions in children during local anesthesia injection</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-13-272-g001"/></table-wrap><p>In this clinical trial, the patient and statistical analyzer were blind.

Dental anxiety and fear-related behaviors associated with dental injections are undoubtedly among the most challenging aspects of pediatric dentistry, and proper intraoral local anesthesia is the mainstay of pain control during dentistry procedures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Despite improvements in pain control, dental fear has remained relatively constant during the last 50 years, and the use of topical anesthesia is the most commonly advocated technique to reduce pain associated with oral injections.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The results of this study indicated that the total scores for pain behavioral reaction in the cotton-roll group (that we did not wait for topical anesthesia gel to affect) were significantly lower than those in the routine topical anesthetic method (1 min gel application to the needle insertion area) that may confirm the hypothesis that topical anesthesia has more psychological effects than pharmacological effects. This hypothesis was stated in Meechan's review of intraoral topical anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>As a general rule, topical anesthetics by affecting superficial tissues pharmacologically (2-3 mm), prevent deep tissues becoming anesthetized.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Results of this study indicated that regardless of the local anesthesia area (inferior alveolar nerve block with approximately 20 mm of needle penetration and primary maxillary molar infiltration with a few millimeters of needle penetration), the cotton-roll method caused fewer behavioral reactions to pain. This finding may also demonstrate that the psychological aspect of topical anesthesia is more effective than the pharmacological one.</p><p>In the cotton-roll vibration method, which was described here and has been used for several years by the author, the main component is to pretend that the use of colored topical anesthesia gel makes the teeth's microbes &#x0201c;sleepy.&#x0201d; Distracting the child's attention from the syringe by application of vibratory stimuli of the needle insertion area by the cotton roll during injection also plays an important role in this method. The results of this study indicate that utilizing this method has certain advantages for dentists. It requires shorter duration of intraoral local anesthesia than the method using routine topical anesthesia procedure, thereby resulting in shorter treatment duration, which is especially useful in pediatrics. It also has shown significantly reduced pain behavioral reactions than the method using routine topical anesthesia. Recently, vibratory devices that attach to dental syringes have been introduced[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to facilitate counter-irritation in the injection area to modify noxious input, but in this cotton-roll vibration method, the cotton roll, which is available in all dental clinics, plays this role.</p><p>In the routine topical anesthesia, the cotton-tipped applicator with the topical anesthesia gel should be placed at the site of needle penetration for at least 1 min.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Compared with the cotton-roll vibration method, this has two disadvantages: The additional time required to apply the gel may make the child apprehensive concerning the impending procedure,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and also, because the child's mouth remains open for longer time in this technique, saliva will accumulate in the mouth, leading to discomfort for the child.</p><p>In the present study, the author-made FHFHTC scale, a behavioral rating scale relying on direct observation, was used to assess behavioral pain reactions, for several reasons. First, observational scales are preferred when the capacity for self-report of subjective experiences is not available or when the veracity of self-report is doubtful.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (The age range of the children in this study was 3.25-9.6 years). Second, although the self-report scales are gold standard,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] they should be explained to the patients, but in this study we wanted to distract the child and pretend that nothing special happened. Thus, children should not be asked to explain what happened during the procedure. Third, this scale for behavioral pain reaction measurement is easy to use, and trained personnel can easily document it without being noticed by the child.</p><p>This FHFHTC scale for behavioral pain assessment also has two disadvantages: The first is a disadvantage of all observational scales. Behavioral pain reactions are what we observe while pain is what the patient feels, and the two do not always correlate,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and the second disadvantage is that sometimes the same scores for different items on this scale do not have the same value in pain reactions, for example, to cry with voice during injection (cry item) and bringing up the foot (foot item) both received a score of two, but they do not have the same value in pain presentation.</p><p>In this study, the FHFHTC items receiving the most and least reaction were face and trunk, respectively [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The face is always the first part of the body to show emotion, including pain and facial expression, has been considered to be a more valid component for the assessment of pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The least reaction (trunk) can be explained by the fact that because the children were in a supine position during intraoral local anesthesia injections, it was more difficult for trunk reactions to occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
