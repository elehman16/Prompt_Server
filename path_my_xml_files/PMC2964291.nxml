<article-title>Geographical Variation in the Response of Visceral Leishmaniasis to Paromomycin in East Africa: A Multicentre, Open-Label, Randomized Trial</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>A recent study has shown that treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with the standard dose of 15 mg/kg/day of paromomycin sulphate (PM) for 21 days was not efficacious in patients in Sudan. We therefore decided to test the efficacy of paramomycin for a longer treatment duration (15 mg/kg/day for 28 days) and at the higher dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, open-label, dose-finding, phase II study assessed the two above high-dose PM treatment regimens. Patients with clinical features and positive bone-marrow aspirates for VL were enrolled. All patients received their assigned courses of PM intramuscularly and adverse events were monitored. Parasite clearance in bone-marrow aspirates was tested by microscopy at end of treatment (EOT, primary efficacy endpoint), 3 months (in patients who were not clinically well) and 6 months after EOT (secondary efficacy endpoint). Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from a subset of patients weighing over 30 kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>42 patients (21 per group) aged between 4 and 60 years were enrolled. At EOT, 85&#x00025; of patients (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]: 63.7&#x00025; to 97.0&#x00025;) in the 20 mg/kg/day group and 90&#x00025; of patients (95&#x00025; CI: 69.6&#x00025; to 98.8&#x00025;) in the 15 mg/kg/day group had parasite clearance. Six months after treatment, efficacy was 80.0&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 56.3&#x00025; to 94.3&#x00025;) and 81.0&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 58.1&#x00025; to 94.6&#x00025;) in the 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. There were no serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic profiles suggested a difference between the two doses, although numbers of patients recruited were too few to make it significant (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3 and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6 in the 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Data suggest that both high dose regimens were more efficacious than the standard 15 mg/kg/day PM for 21 days and could be further evaluated in phase III studies in East Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00255567">NCT00255567</ext-link>
</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of sandflies. The WHO estimates 500,000 new cases of VL each year, with more than 90&#x00025; of cases occurring in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and South America. If left untreated, VL can be fatal. We had previously conducted a large multi-center study in Sudan, East Africa, to assess the efficacy of paromomycin (PM) alone or in combination with sodium stibogluconate. Clinical studies in India have shown that 15 mg/kg/day PM for 21 days was an effective cure. However, the same treatment regimen was not efficacious in two study sites in Sudan. Here, our aim was to assess two high-dose regimens of PM in Sudan: 15 mg/kg/day for 28 days and 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days. The results suggest that, at these total doses, PM is more efficacious than when given daily at 15 mg/kg for 21 days, and that high doses are required to treat VL in Sudan. Efficacy of 20 mg/kg/day PM for 21 days is currently being evaluated in a prospective, comparative phase III trial in East Africa.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the WHO estimates, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease that affects more than 500,000 people globally each year <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Desjeux1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and has a fatality rate of up to 100&#x00025; if left untreated <xref rid="pntd.0000855-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. 90&#x00025; of cases occur in five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Desjeux1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, with the affected communities mostly located in remote regions of these endemic areas without ready access to treatment.</p><p>Although drugs (mainly antimonials such as sodium stibogluconate [SSG]) currently exist to treat this parasitic infection, their use has been limited because of high cost, toxicity, or development of parasite resistance <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Croft1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0000855-Thakur1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A multi-center phase III study in India showed that PM is a very efficacious, affordable, and safe treatment <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and is now registered for VL treatment in India.</p><p>In an effort to identify an effective treatment for VL in East Africa, we had previously initiated a multi-center phase III study in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya comparing the efficacy of PM alone at the dose shown to be efficacious in India (15 mg/kg/day for 21 days) against SSG alone (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days) and against a combination treatment of SSG and PM (same dose of individual treatments but for 17 days). PM monotherapy did not show adequate efficacy, particularly in Sudan where parasite clearance was below 50&#x00025; in patients at 6 months after end of treatment (EOT), and the study had to be prematurely stopped <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In the current study, we sought to find an efficacious dose of PM for the treatment of VL in Sudan and to explore possible reasons for the failure of the drug at the previous dose studied of 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days. In our previous study using this dose, conducted in 5 sites in Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan, we found an overall end of treatment cure of 67.4&#x00025; and 6-month post-treatment cure of 63.8&#x00025; <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cure at both sites in Sudan was below 50&#x00025; <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The cure rate in this study of SSG was 92.2&#x00025; at 6 months post-treatment <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore a total dose increase of 33&#x00025; was attempted through two possible regimens- an increased dose of 20 mg/kg for 21 days or a prolonged course of 15 mg/kg for 28 days. The former regimen has been evaluated in some clinical trials in India <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Jha1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Thakur2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. There was no previous clinical experience with the 15 mg/kg dosage given for 28 days. The rationale was that the longer course of treatment would provide additional time for the patient's general condition to improve, and for their immunological response to develop, and that this might translate into a better clinical response without increasing the daily dosage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The main objective was to assess the efficacy of two dosing regimens of PM monotherapy for the treatment of VL: 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days and 15 mg/kg/day for 28 days.

This site participated in the previous study conducted on PM <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg/kg/day PM for 21 days (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21) or 15 mg/kg/day PM for 28 days (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21), and started a treatment regimen upon allocation to their treatment. Restricted-block randomization was done for the two groups. Randomization was done using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were prepared according to a centrally generated randomization list. Treatment was administered via daily intramuscular injection, and patients remained in the hospital for the duration of treatment. Patients were followed up at 3 and 6 months after treatment as outpatients. Parasitological assessments (bone-marrow aspirates only) were done at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), 3 months (only on patients who were not clinically well) and 6 months after treatment. Safety and clinical laboratory assessments were done at baseline, day 7 and day 14 of drug administration, EOT, and at 3 and 6 months follow-ups. These included a clinical assessment, (clinical symptoms, vital signs, weight, spleen and liver size), ECG, HIV testing (at baseline only), hemoglobin, white cell count, platelets, urea, creatinine, liver function tests (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase), urinalysis and audiometry. Audiometry was performed using a standardized procedure by site investigators who were trained by a qualified audiometrist and recorded as hearing levels in dB at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz frequencies <xref rid="pntd.0000855-World2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. All reported abnormal audiometric readings were reviewed by the audiometrist. An audiometric shift was defined in patients for whom there was one of the following: an increase in hearing level between baseline and EOT of &#x02265;25 dB at &#x02265;1 threshold frequency; an increase in hearing level between baseline and EOT of &#x02265;20 dB at &#x02265;2 adjacent threshold frequencies. Disabling hearing impairment was determined as an average of at least 41 dB across 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz frequencies in adults (ages 15 years and above) and at least 31 db across 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz frequencies in children (less than 15 years of age) <xref rid="pntd.0000855-World2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Parasitology slides were prepared from bone-marrow aspirates, read, and reported according to a standardized, approved WHO method <xref rid="pntd.0000855-World3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Chulay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Standardised parasitology readings were done from freshly prepared bone-marrow aspirates taken directly from the patients to the laboratory.

All parasitology was performed by a trained laboratory technician.</p><p>For the PK analysis, the first six consenting patients weighing 30 kg or more were selected from each treatment group and had additional venous blood and urine samples on day 1 and day 14 in the 20 mg/kg/day group, and on day 1 and day 26 in the 15 mg/kg/day group. The timing for blood sampling was 0 (before treatment) and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration of the drug, and at 0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;6, 6&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;12, and 12&#x02013;24 hours after administration of the drug for urine sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The trial was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2002 version) for the conduct of research on human subjects and followed the International Committee for Harmonization guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials.

Rescue medication before an endpoint indicates treatment failure at that endpoint. Clinical and biological parameters, such as temperature, weight, spleen size and hemoglobin, were used by clinicians to decide each patient's response to treatment and whether rescue medication was indicated. Relapse at 3-month follow-up was defined as patients with no parasites detected at EOT but in whom parasites were seen at 3-month follow-up. Slow response to treatment was defined as the presence of parasites at EOT but not at 6 months in the absence of rescue medication.

Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. In case of missing data, efficacy analyses were by complete-case analysis, excluding patients with missing data, and by worst-case analysis, where missing efficacy data are assumed to be treatment failures. To account for different treatment durations and avoid overestimating harm in the longer treatment duration group, the treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rate was calculated, per group, as the total number of adverse events divided by the total person-time at risk <xref rid="pntd.0000855-World4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

This study is part of the first large-scale multi-centre clinical trial to assess the efficacy of PM for the treatment of VL for the East African region. The initial study <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> showed poor efficacy results when 15 mg/kg/day PM was administered for 21 days to VL patients. This finding is in contrast to an earlier phase III study in India <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The results of this study show that increasing the total dose of PM from 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days to 15 mg/kg/day for 28 days or 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days improves efficacy in VL patients in Sudan. However, it should be cautioned that the results found in this study apply to one site only and might not apply to the whole East African region.</p><p>Although efficacy is normally assessed as parasite clearance at 6 months in trials for VL, in this study we chose to use parasite clearance at EOT as the primary endpoint because a chance of loss to follow-up of just a few patients would significantly affect the result. In addition to the small sample size, another potential limitation is the use of bone-marrow aspiration for diagnosis and test of cure. However, spleen aspiration remains contraindicated in rural hospitals in Sudan, making bone marrow the best viable alternative.</p><p>At 6 months after treatment, efficacy was 80.0&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 56.3&#x00025; to 94.3&#x00025;) and 81.0&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 58.1&#x00025; to 94.6&#x00025;) in the 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively, compared with less than 50&#x00025; (in Sudan) at 6 months observed in the previous study <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This result shows that efficacy improved to levels closer to those obtained in trials in India (&#x0223c;95&#x00025;) <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Serious safety issues that would limit the evaluation of PM at high doses were not identified in this study. Otoxicity, which has been seen as a transient side-effect of PM in other studies <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, was also identified as a potential issue in this study because one patient had audiometric shift at 6 months. This shift occurred at high frequencies, as expected with aminoglycosides <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We suggest that this adverse event needs to be monitored closely in subsequent studies.</p><p>PK analyses showed that peak plasma PM concentration occurred 1&#x02013;2 hours after administration and suggest that, at the high daily dose of 20 mg/kg, elevated plasma PM concentrations may be maintained for a longer period of time (up to 8 hours). Unpublished data (Mahmoud Mudawi, personal communication) of PM administration (15 mg/kg) to healthy Sudanese volunteers showed peak PM plasma concentrations similar to those in American volunteers who received a similar dose <xref rid="pntd.0000855-Kanyok1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Sudanese VL patients had a much lower plasma concentration (30&#x02013;40&#x00025;) than that of healthy Sudanese (19.5&#x000b1;7.6&#x000b5;g/mL; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) and American volunteers. Therefore, Sudanese VL patients may have different PK characteristics from both Sudanese and American healthy volunteers, and Indian VL patients. However, PK data were very limited and derived from only a small subset of patients. A PK study with more patients is currently underway as part of the larger phase III study.</p><p>Even though interpretation of our results is limited because of the small sample size, we identified what seems to be a more efficacious dose of PM than the one previously used in Sudan <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A meeting of the principal investigators was held to discuss the PM efficacy and PK dose-finding results. The group chose to use in the large multi-center phase III study, a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days for a comparison with the previously used doses of SSG and SSG and PM in combination. Our initial study <xref rid="pntd.0000855-The1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> showed that efficacy of PM can vary greatly between geographical regions, and in addition to this study, suggests that different doses may be required to obtain similar levels of efficacy. If confirmed, these results emphasize the importance of considering regional differences in the treatment of VL and show that drugs of proven efficacy in Asian patients might not have the same efficacy in African patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000855.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000855.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000855.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Dose-ranging CSR.</p><p>(0.56 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000855.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000855.s003"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Clinical trial protocol.</p><p>(0.23 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000855.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000855.s004"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><p>Protocol amendment.</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000855.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all members of the trial site team (Kassab Hospital), the DNDi trial coordination team in Nairobi and Geneva (Switzerland), the data management team based at DNDi Africa in KEMRI in Nairobi, Prof Peter Smith, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the audiometrist Serah Ndegwa, and the Ministry of Health of Gedaref State, Sudan.
