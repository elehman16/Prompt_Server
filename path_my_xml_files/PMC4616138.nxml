muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises accompanied by functional electrical
stimulation on stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability. [Methods] For six weeks beginning in
April 2015, 22 stroke patients receiving physical therapy at K Hospital located in
Gyeonggi-do were divided into a functional electrical stimulation (FES), ankle
proprioceptive exercise and ankle joint muscle strengthening exercise group (FPS group) of
11 patients and an FES and stretching exercise group (FS group) of 11 patients. The
stimulation and exercises were conducted for 30&#x02005;min per day, five days per week for six
weeks. Balance ability was measured using a BioRescue and the Berg balance scale,
functional reach test, and the timed up-and-go test were also used as clinical evaluation
indices. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to examine differences between before the
exercises and at three and six weeks after beginning the exercises within each group, and
the amounts of change between the two groups were compared. [Results] In the comparison
within each group, both groups showed significant differences between before and after the
experiment in all the tests and comparison between the groups showed that greater
improvement was seen in all values in the FPS group. [Conclusion] In the present study,
implementing FES and stretching exercises plus ankle joint muscle strengthening and
proprioceptive exercises was more effective at improving stroke patients balance ability
than implementing only FES and stretching exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Proprioceptive</kwd><kwd>Strengthening</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Due to the loss of the central nervous system&#x02019;s ability to control the paretic side, stroke
patients show excessive muscle tone, such as spasticity and loss of proprioceptive and
equilibrium senses<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, Carr
and Shepherd<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that stroke
patients have disorders in standing and gait due to asymmetric postures, abnormal body
balance, and the loss of certain motor abilities.</p><p>In the human body, the hip joints and ankle joints play important roles in maintaining
stability. In particular, the hip joints mainly act when the range of body sway is large,
and the ankle joints mainly act when the range of body sway is small<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most important roles of the ankle joints and the feet
are in controlling body sway and forward movements of the lower extremities, and these roles
require a sufficient range of motion, muscle strength, and proprioceptive sense in the ankle
joints<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the effects of functional electrical stimulation treatment, Achache et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when functional electrical
stimulation was applied to the dorsal flexor muscle of the ankle joints, increased muscle
activity improved muscle strength. This led to the enhancement of the stability of the knee
joints, which had positive effects on balance. In addition, Sabut et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when functional electrical
stimulation was applied for 12 weeks, the activity of the anterior tibial muscle increased
and energy consumption decreased by 34.6%.</p><p>Regarding the reason that ankle muscle strength is necessary to maintain balance, Macrae et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that according to the
results of tests of seven lower extremity muscles, the ankle dorsal flexor muscle was the
best predictive factor for the prediction of falls. In addition, Lord et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that one of differences between
no-fall groups and those who experienced falls was the muscle strength of the ankle dorsal
flexor muscle.</p><p>The retraining of the movements of the ankle joints that control body balance plays as
important role in solutions to problems in balance control, and it mitigates problems such
as abnormal forms of muscle control of the ankle joint, joint contracture over a long
period, and proprioceptive sense disorders<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability that has deteriorated
due to ankle instability and proprioceptive sense declines, the stability of the ankles
needs to be restored through ankle muscle strengthening<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies that have simultaneously applied functional
electrical stimulation treatment, proprioceptive sense treatment, and ankle muscle
strengthening exercises in an ankle training program for stroke patients are rare.</p><p>As noted above, to improve stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability, the ankle muscles need to be
strengthened and the proprioceptive sense needs to be recovered. Therefore, the purpose of
the present study was to examine the effects of approaches to ankle joint treatment on
balance ability. The study focused on that the factors affecting stroke patients&#x02019; balance,
the loss of the ankles&#x02019; proprioceptive sense, and ankle muscle weakening, in order to
determine diverse protocols for stroke patients&#x02019; balance improvement and functional
enhancement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 22 stroke patients in the rehabilitation center of a general hospital
located in Korea. The selection criteria were: first-time stroke, at least 6 weeks
post-stroke, a Mini-Mental State Examination score &#x02265;24, and no serious visual disorder,
visual field defect, or hearing impairment based on the opinion of the doctor in charge, All
subjects understood the content of the study and voluntarily participated in the study. The
exclusion criteria were: severe hemineglect, pregnancy, or prior adverse reaction to
Functional electrical stimulation (FES). This study was approved by the Institutional Human
Research Review Board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>To minimize the selection bias of group division, the subjects were randomly assigned to
two groups. The subjects drew O&#x000b7;X lots and those who drew O were assigned to the group
receiving the application of FES, ankle muscle strengthening exercises, and ankle
proprioceptive exercises, the FPS group, while those who drew X were assigned to the FP
group. A preliminary evaluation was conducted before the experiment and an ex post facto
evaluation was conducted at three weeks and six weeks after the start of the experiment.</p><p>FPS group received FES for 30&#x02005;min, and performed ankle proprioceptive exercises for 15&#x02005;min,
and an ankle muscle strengthening exercise program for 15&#x02005;min in 60-minute sessions, five
times per week for six weeks.</p><p>FES was applied as a square waveform with a pulse width of 400 &#x003bc;s and a stimulation
frequency of 40&#x02005;Hz. To induce accurate movements of the muscles, the stimulation intensity
was adjusted to 30&#x02013;70 mA at the common peroneal nerve through observations by the therapist.
The subjects performed ankle dorsiflexion movement during functional electrical stimulation
producing muscle contraction delivered via surface electrodes. The stimulation increase and
decrease times were set to 0.3&#x02005;s, and to minimize muscle contraction and fatigue due to the
subjects&#x02019; excessive efforts, the electrical stimulation given to patients was restricted to
below the threshold value<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle
proprioception exercise program was designed by modifying and supplementing the method
proposed by Lynch and Grison<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and the
details are as follows: ankle joint mobility was promoted in a sitting position, an exercise
to move the weight toward the paretic side and get up was repeatedly performed, the weight
was moved in various directions in a standing position, and upper extremity task training
was performed in a standing position. This program was implemented for a total of 15&#x02005;min.
The ankle exercise program used was created by modifying the method proposed by Chaitow<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects lay in a supine position on
a bed and performed dorsal flexion of the ankle joint with 20&#x02013;30% of the total muscle
strength that could be mobilized by the subject. In addition, the therapist provided
counter-pressure equal to the pressure of the subject&#x02019;s ankle joint dorsal flexion using
manual resistance so isometric contraction could occur in the muscle anterior to the tibia.
The subjects took a rest for 10&#x02005;s after the contraction. This exercise was performed three
times repeatedly with a rest of 10&#x02005;s after each trial. During the trials, the therapist
helped the subject so that accurate movements could be made without the occurrence of
compensation by the ankle joint<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ankle
dorsiflexion, ankle plantarflexion, ankle eversion, and ankle inversion were performed for a
total of 15&#x02005;min.</p><p>The FS group received FES for 30&#x02005;min and performed ankle stretching exercises for 30&#x02005;min in
60-minute sessions, five times per week for six weeks.</p><p>For the stretching exercises, the subjects were instructed to apply force toward the sole
in a prone position and the therapist applied the same level of force in the opposite
direction to maintain isometric contraction for 6 s. While the subject relaxed the muscle
for 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;s after the contraction, the therapist extended the length of the muscle for further
stretching. At this time, the therapist&#x02019;s hands moved to the point where the hands were
stopped by the muscle, and the position was maintained for 15&#x02013;16 seconds. The subjects were
instructed to maintain the relaxed state and to take a rest for 10 s. This exercise was
performed repeatedly for a total of 15&#x02005;min<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thereafter, the subjects held the therapist&#x02019;s hand in a standing
position, leaned against a wall, stood on a tripod, and performed stretching for 15&#x02005;min with
the ankle joints at 15&#x02013;20&#x000b0;. A rest was allowed when the patient felt pain or needed a rest
and the exercise was performed again thereafter.</p><p>In the present study, a balance ability measuring and training system (Analysis Systems by
Biofeedback, AP1153 BioRescue, France) was used to measure subjects&#x02019; balance ability. The
measuring method was demonstrated to the subjects before measuring their balance ability.
With their eyes open and eyes closed, the Romberg test, the measured the migration length of
the center of gravity (COG) and the surface area while standing on the force plate with both
feet was measured for 60 s. The unit of the migration length of the COP was&#x02005;cm and that of
the unit of surface area was mm<sup>2</sup>. In this evaluation, smaller values mean less
sway, which indicates a better balance ability. In the limit of stability (LOS) test, the
COP was moved in eight directions (forward, backward, leftward, rightward, and diagonally)
using a BioRescue software program, and the movement area was recorded in&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> In
this test, direction arrows randomly appear on the computer screen and subjects move their
COP in the arrow direction. Both feet have to be placed on the force plate at all times, and
When subjects lifted a foot off the force plate, the measurement was conducted again from
the beginning. Larger measured values indicate better balance ability. The forward and
backward (FB) test measures the length of migration of the COP while subjects move the
non-paretic side foot to the front of the force plate in a standing position supported by
two feet and then move it back to the original position; smaller measured values indicate
better balance ability. The FB test was conducted three times for each study subject and the
average values were used in the analysis.</p><p>For the functional reach test (FRT), the subjects adopted a standing position on a fixed
surface with the feet shoulder width apart and maximally stretched out an arm while
maintaining the arm horizontal to a bar ruler installed horizontally. With the first
clenched and the elbow joint extended subjects bent forward as far as they could without
losing balance. Then, the distance between the first point and the last point of the distal
part of the third metacarpal bone was measured. The measurement was conducted three times
for each study subject and the average values were used in the analysis. For this test an
intra-rater reliability of r = 0.98 and an inter-rater reliability of r = 0.99 have been
reported<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Berg balance scale (BBS) is a tool for measuring the balance of elderly persons with
damaged balance functions. It evaluates their ability to perform functional tasks and the
tasks are largely divided into three areas: sitting, standing, and postural changes.
Fourteen items are scored from 0 to 4 and thus, the maximum possible score is 56 points.
This test is used to measure the ability to maintain dynamic balance and it is widely used
to measure the balance ability in movements or standing positions of patients with
hemiplegia due to a senile disease or stroke. This test is highly reliable for the
measurement of balance and it has been reported to have an intra-rater reliability of r =
0.98 and an inter-rater reliability of r = 0.97<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The timed up-and-go (TUG) test is used to evaluate simple functions by measuring the time
it takes to get up from a chair, walk to a turning point at a distance of 3&#x02005;m from the
chair, and return, and sit on the chair. Each subject completed the TUG test three times,
and the average value was calculated. The test-retest reliability of the TUG test for stroke
patients is reported to be high, r = 0.95<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses in this study were conducted using PASW 18.0 for Windows. For the
general characteristics of the two groups, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to analyze
ankylosis, sex, diagnoses, and the side of brain lesions. The patients&#x02019; heights, weights,
Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and time since the onset of stroke were analyzed using
the independent samples t-test. Normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Repeated
measures ANOVA was conducted to examine differences within the two groups among the
treatment times (zero, three, and six weeks of training) and to examine differences between
the two groups resulting from the therapeutic exercise methods before the training, after
three weeks&#x02019; training, and after six weeks&#x02019; training. A statistical significance level of &#x003b1;
= 0.05 was used in all tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the study subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects (N=22)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FS (n=11)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FPS (n=11)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54.9 &#x000b1; 14.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.0 &#x000b1; 13.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.2 &#x000b1; 5.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.3 &#x000b1; 2.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.0 &#x000b1; 11.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.1 &#x000b1; 9.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE-K (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.1 &#x000b1; 1.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.5 &#x000b1; 1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (72.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (54.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (27.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (45.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Brain lesion location</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cortex level</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (18.2%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (18.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subcortex level</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (45.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (36.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mixed</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (36.4%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (45.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (63.6%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (63.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemmorhage</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (36.4%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (36.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (54.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (72.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (45.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (27.3%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are N (%) or Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, ns: not significant, FS: FES with

exercise programs on stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability were examined. According to the
results, balance ability improved in both groups and in the comparison of the two groups,
the FPS group was revealed to have improved more.</p><p>Regarding the changes in balance ability of the two groups, the FPS group showed
significant differences in the COP migration length, surface area, LOS test, and FB test.
Though the results were inconsistent with the results of a previous study indicating that
ankle strengthening training did not have any effect on stroke patients&#x02019; postural sway<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, in a study conducted by Niam et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> of 13 stroke patients, it was reported
that compared to subjects with intact ankle proprioceptive sense, subjects with damaged
ankle proprioceptive sense showed increased sway speed and decreased balance ability. The
results of the present study are consistent with the results of the study conducted by
Lisinski et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, who divided 26 stroke
patients into a balance training group and a no training group, and examined the effects of
balance training on motor skills. The group that received balance training showed reductions
in the asymmetry of bilateral weight-bearing and could perform selective movements. The
results of the present study are also consistent with the results of a study conducted of 16
stroke patients which examined the effects of task-oriented exercise programs on postural
stability, The study reported that the experimental group that performed task-oriented
exercises and received ankle joint proprioceptive sense inputs showed significant
improvements in COP movements<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, to improve balance ability, the muscles around the ankles need to be activated
and ankle joint proprioceptive sense inputs should accompany the activation. The diverse
inputs derived from ankle joint muscle strengthening and functional electrical stimulation
applied together with repetitive ankle movements appeared to have great effects on the
promotion of motor learning, and balance control ability improved because the body
perception regarding changes in the position of the body increased in an environment in
which these elements were provided, so the environment and proprioceptive sense interacted
with each other and they were integrated.</p><p>In the present study, BBS, FRT, TUG, and balance ability tests showed significant
differences after the intervention in both groups and in the comparison of the groups, and
improvements the FPS group were significantly greater than in the FS group. These results
are consistent with the study conducted by Geiger et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> of 13 stroke patients. They reported that the TUG result improved
from 23.08&#x02005;s to 14.62&#x02005;s in the group that performed an additional exercise program using a
balance master. Out present results are also consistent with a study conducted by Park et
al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> who reported that when an ankle
joint proprioceptive movement control program was conducted for 13 stroke patients, sway
speed and distance decreased, balance ability improved, and TUG values decreased from 20.5&#x02005;s
before the experiment to 17.9&#x02005;s four weeks after the start of the experiment and to 15.3&#x02005;s
eight weeks after the start of the experiment. Given these results, it can be seen that the
ROM was increased by the ankle muscle strengthening exercises, so the stability limit
increase and the feed-back and feed-forward control mechanisms were improved thanks to
proprioceptive sense inputs. Thus, the ability to establish and maintain correct posture
improved through the provision of information on the movement and location of individual
parts of the body. In addition, the ability to appropriately control balance during sway was
improved through better coordination and mobilization of the senses and muscle
functions.</p><p>Limitations of the present study include the possibility of interference of balance factors
could not be excluded because the subjects&#x02019; daily lives could not be completely controlled,
and whether or not ankle muscle strengthening exercises and proprioceptive sense training
have continuous effects was not determined through follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, the two groups showed differences in balance ability between each other at
three and six weeks after the start of the experiment, and the FES, ankle proprioception
exercise, and ankle muscle strengthening group showed greater improvements. The treatment
method that added a program centered on ankle muscle strengthening to FES and ankle
proprioceptive exercises was more effective at enhancing balance ability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Sahmyook University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kerrigan</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Karvosky</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>PO</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Spastic paretic stiff-legged gait: joint
