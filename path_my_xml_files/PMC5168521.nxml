<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The NCD burden in low and middle income countries is growing particularly fast.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In Kenya, NCDs account for 27% of deaths (about 370&#x02005;000 per year) among people between 30 and 70&#x02005;years old, and the probability of dying prematurely from NCDs is about 18%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>As in most low and middle income countries, medicines to treat NCDs are difficult to access or too expensive for many Kenyan households.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> According to a recent survey, only 33% of Kenyan patients prescribed NCD medicines have them in their home. Furthermore, 82% of NCD medicines purchased are paid for out-of-pocket.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As a result, NCD sequelae which are often avoidable with proper treatment account for more than half of hospital admissions in the country.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Global stakeholders have signalled a commitment to confronting the growing burden of NCDs by including them in the Sustainable Development Goals.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Increasing access to essential NCD medicines is a fundamental part of these efforts.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Against this backdrop, Novartis/Sandoz has recently launched <italic>Novartis Access</italic>, an initiative to provide a low-cost portfolio of NCD medicines in 30 low and middle income countries over the next 5&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The portfolio includes patented and generic medicines to treat diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidaemia, breast cancer and asthma. All medicines in the portfolio are included on the WHO's Model List of Essential Medicines.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Novartis Access will be implemented in programme countries in close partnership with local governments and non-governmental organisations, with a focus on strengthening public sector systems.</p><p>In 2016, Kenya will be the first country to receive <italic>Novartis Access</italic> medicines. The portfolio of medicines will be distributed solely through the Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS), the main supplier for the large network of private (often faith-based) non-profit health facilities in the country, and also a key supplier for public facilities. In Kenya, NCD services are provided in the public and private non-profit sectors at dispensaries up through hospitals, and these facilities will be eligible to purchase <italic>Novartis Access</italic> medicines. Pricing policies for NCD medicines sold through the public sector in Kenya are determined at the county level, and substantial variation exists. The price paid by patients in the public sector is generally lower than in the private sector. For example, the median public sector price paid for glibenclamide, a common treatment for diabetes, is less than one-quarter of the price paid in the private for-profit sector.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Private for-profit facilities and drug sellers will not be allowed to purchase <italic>Novartis Access</italic> medicines, and will continue to purchase standard Novartis products through existing mechanisms.</p><p>This study will be a cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of <italic>Novartis Access</italic> on the availability and price of NCD medicines at health facilities and households in Kenya. Eight counties will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. In the intervention counties, public and non-profit health facilities will be allowed to order low-cost <italic>Novartis Access</italic> NCD medicines. The results of this evaluation will provide much needed rigorous evidence of the impact of a new large NCD medicine access programme, and will help inform the design and evaluation of similar initiatives in the future. It will also provide Novartis with valuable feedback that can be used to improve <italic>Novartis Access</italic> as it expands.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants, interventions, and outcomes</title><p>Eight counties have been non-randomly selected for inclusion in the study.

Data will also be collected for a set of acute disease medicines to provide contextual information. The household questionnaire includes information on demographics, household assets, and key information on medicines, including whether prescribed NCD medicines are currently at the home, locations where medicines are most often purchased, prices paid, and overall household expenditures on medicines (and on other goods). The household questionnaire will be translated into local languages as appropriate.</p><p>A subsample of health facilities and subsample of households will also be administered a qualitative interview during baseline, midline, and end-line visits. A purposeful subsample of five level 2 dispensaries and five level 3&#x02013;5 facilities will be selected in each county (80 facilities in total), and one staff member will be selected for the interview. A purposeful subsample of 10 households in each county (80 households in total) will be selected for qualitative interviews, which will be administered to one individual in the household who also completes the general household survey. Facilities and households will be selected for qualitative interviews to maximise variation in the viewpoints represented (eg, age, disease, wealth). The qualitative instrument has been designed to explore in depth key issues related to medicine access.</p><p>Surveillance data will be collected quarterly from all health facilities and a subsample of households. For health facility surveillance, a shortened version of the structured questionnaire with basic information on medicine availability and price will be administered over the phone each month to a rotating one-third sample of health facilities, such that all facilities are surveilled once per quarter. For household surveillance, a random sample of half of all study households with phones will be selected; half of study households will not be surveilled at all, to allow for an analysis of the potential effect of surveillance on household behaviour. Those households selected for surveillance will be administered a shortened version of the structured questionnaire with basic information on medicine availability and purchases over the phone. As with health facilities, a rotating one-third sample of households selected for surveillance will be surveyed by phone each month, such that all surveilled households are surveyed once per quarter. A 5% subsample of the surveilled health facilities and households will be visited in person to audit phone responses and confirm medicine price and availability through direct observation.</p><p>A local partner who specialises in the implementation of randomised controlled trials will manage fieldwork.

Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP, 2015). Surveillance data will be explored to understand trends in outcomes over time. Finally, transcripts from qualitative interviews will be analysed using NVivo software (NVivo qualitative data analysis Software; QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 11, 2015).

First, household data on medicine prices will rely on participant reporting which may be subject to recall bias. In particular, if patients purchased multiple medicines at once, they may have difficulty recalling prices paid for individual medicines. Second, households without a mobile phone will be excluded from surveillance data collection, which may introduce bias. However, high mobile phone coverage is expected in the study population&#x02014;according to the 2014 Demographic and Health Surveys, around 90% of households in Kenya have a mobile phone.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A thorough analysis of this potential bias will be conducted using household baseline data. Finally, no health outcome data will be collected, and it will therefore not be possible to draw any conclusions as to the health impacts of <italic>Novartis Access</italic>. If the intervention is found to improve medicine price and availability, future studies should explore impacts on health outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Informed consent will be obtained from all participants at the start of the trial. If a household member expresses interest in participating in the study, a study team member will explain the study in detail, verify eligibility, and obtain informed written consent where appropriate. Consent is not required prior to eligibility screening. As is standard in Kenya, all participants in the health facility and household surveys will be given compensation for their time. They will each receive 30&#x02005;min of mobile phone airtime, a value of US$0.53.</p><p>All identifying information collected from participants will be kept strictly confidential through the use of unique identifying numbers. An initial tracking file including participant names, study numbers, and address information, will be generated to allow for follow-up activities, but will be kept separate from all other data and will be password-protected, maintained on computers in locked offices, and only accessible to authorised study personnel. It will be destroyed within 6&#x02005;months after the study is completed. All study results presented in written form will be aggregated, with no individual identifying information.</p><p>The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, international conferences, and meetings and events organised with local and international stakeholders.
