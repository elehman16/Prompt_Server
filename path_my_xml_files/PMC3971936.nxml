Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of study treatment (study 1, bimatoprost 0.01% once daily or bimatoprost 0.01% once daily plus brimonidine 0.1% three times daily; study 2, bimatoprost 0.03% once daily or bimatoprost 0.03% once daily plus fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%/timolol 0.5% twice daily). Patient evaluations at weeks 4 and 12 included IOP at 8 am, 10 am, and 4 pm and safety assessments. Results in the monotherapy study arms (bimatoprost 0.01% or 0.03%) are presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Latanoprost-treated baseline mean diurnal IOP (&#x000b1; standard error of the mean) was 22.2&#x000b1;0.3 mmHg and 22.1&#x000b1;0.4 mmHg in the bimatoprost 0.01% and bimatoprost 0.03% treatment arms, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.957). In both treatment arms, mean (&#x000b1; standard error of the mean) reduction in IOP from latanoprost-treated baseline was statistically significant at each time point at both follow-up visits (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), ranging from 3.7&#x000b1;0.4 (17.0%) mmHg to 4.4&#x000b1;0.4 (19.9%) mmHg with bimatoprost 0.01% and from 2.8&#x000b1;0.5 (12.8%) mmHg to 3.9&#x000b1;0.5 (16.7%) mmHg with bimatoprost 0.03%. Mean percentage IOP reduction from latanoprost-treated baseline was numerically greater with bimatoprost 0.01% than with bimatoprost 0.03% throughout follow-up. The incidence of conjunctival hyperemia of mild or greater severity increased from latanoprost baseline after 12 weeks of treatment only in the bimatoprost 0.03% treatment arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Many patients who do not reach their target IOP on latanoprost can achieve additional IOP lowering and maintain monotherapy by replacing latanoprost with bimatoprost. Reductions in IOP from latanoprost baseline were larger with bimatoprost 0.01% than with bimatoprost 0.03%, and bimatoprost 0.01% had a more favorable tolerability profile.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bimatoprost</kwd><kwd>intraocular pressure</kwd><kwd>latanoprost</kwd><kwd>monotherapy</kwd><kwd>prostaglandin</kwd><kwd>prostamide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Treatment for ocular hypertension and glaucoma aims to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) to protect against damage to the optic nerve and progressive loss of visual field.

The studies were conducted at 17 sites in the USA from February 2012 to October 2012 (study 1) and eleven sites in the USA from December 2009 to September 2010 (study 2) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice regulations and guidelines. An institutional review board approved the study protocol at each site, and all patients provided written informed consent. The studies are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifiers NCT01525173<xref rid="b10-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (study 1) and NCT01170884<xref rid="b11-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (study 2).</p><p>Patient selection for study participation was similar in the two studies. Entry criteria for both studies included diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma, chronic angle-closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy, or ocular hypertension, best-corrected visual acuity of 20/100 or better in both eyes, and currently using no more than two (study 1) or three (study 2) IOP-lowering medications at screening. IOP in the study eye was required to be &#x02265;20 mmHg and &#x0003c;34 mmHg at 8 am and 10 am (study 1) or at 8 am (study 2) at baseline after at least a 30-day run-in on monotherapy with latanoprost 0.005% (Falcon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA [study 1] or Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA [study 2]). Key exclusion criteria for both studies included active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension that would interfere with the study interpretation, corneal abnormality that would prevent accurate applanation tonometry, history of or active ocular infection or inflammation, history of any intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser surgery within 3 months prior to enrollment, uncontrolled systemic disease, end-stage glaucomatous visual field loss, and known sensitivity or allergy to the study medications or their components.</p><p>A schematic of the study designs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-8-643">Figure 1</xref>. Each study had four study visits, ie, screening, baseline, week 4, and week 12. At the screening visit (2 to 30 days prior to the baseline visit), patients who were using any IOP-lowering medication other than latanoprost discontinued the medication and began a 30-day washout period. Patients who were using latanoprost at screening continued on latanoprost monotherapy; all other patients began latanoprost monotherapy. Open-label latanoprost 0.005% was dispensed to patients at the screening visit with instructions to administer the drop once daily in the evening. The baseline visit was scheduled after at least 30 days of latanoprost monotherapy.</p><p>Following evaluations at the baseline visit, patients who met all eligibility criteria, including baseline latanoprost-treated IOP &#x02265;20 mmHg in the study eye, were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms. In study 1, the treatment arms were bimatoprost 0.01% (Lumigan&#x000ae; 0.01%) monotherapy and bimatoprost 0.01% plus brimonidine 0.1% (Alphagan&#x000ae; P 0.1%) combination therapy. In study 2, the treatment arms were bimatoprost 0.03% (Lumigan 0.03%) monotherapy and bimatoprost 0.03% plus fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2%/timolol 0.5% combination therapy. All study medications other than latanoprost were manufactured by Allergan, Inc. (Irvine, CA, USA) and dispensed in over-labeled bottles supplied in identical packaging. Patients in the monotherapy treatment arms (bimatoprost 0.01% or 0.03%) also received an artificial tear (three times daily in study 1, twice daily in study 2) for masking monotherapy versus combination therapy. In each treatment arm, bimatoprost 0.01% or 0.03% was dosed once daily in the evening at 8 pm.</p><p>Patient assessments were identical in the two studies. IOP was measured in each eye by Goldmann applanation at 8 am, 10 am, and 4 pm at baseline, week 4, and week 12. Two measurements of IOP were taken, and if they differed by &#x02264;2 mmHg, the mean of those measurements was recorded on the case report form and used for analysis. If the measurements differed by &#x0003e;2 mmHg, an additional measurement was taken, and the median of the three measurements was recorded on the case report form and used for analysis. The primary efficacy outcome measures were IOP and change from baseline IOP at 8 am, 10 am, and 4 pm at weeks 4 and 12, diurnal IOP averaged over the 8 am, 10 am, and 4 pm time points, change from baseline diurnal IOP, achievement of diurnal IOP &#x0003c;14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 mmHg, and achievement of a &#x02265;15% reduction in diurnal IOP from baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in diurnal IOP from baseline at week 12 in study 1 and mean diurnal IOP at week 12 in study 2. Safety measures included adverse events and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Biomicroscopy findings were graded on a scale of 0 (none), +0.5 (trace), +1 (mild), +2 (moderate), and +3 (severe). Corneal erosion was evaluated with fluorescein staining on biomicroscopic examination.</p><p>This report focuses on the study arms evaluating monotherapy (bimatoprost 0.01% or 0.03%). Efficacy results were evaluated in the per protocol population of all patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment without significant protocol violations. If both eyes were eligible for the study, results were analyzed for the eye with the worse IOP at baseline, or if the IOP was the same in both eyes, the right eye. Observed values were used for the analyses with no imputation of missing values. Safety results were evaluated in all patients who received study treatment. JMP 7.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 were used for statistical analysis. Analysis of change in IOP and percentage change in IOP from baseline used analysis of covariance models with treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline IOP as the covariate. Within-group changes in IOP from baseline were analyzed with paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Baseline mean IOP was compared between groups with <italic>t</italic>-tests. Comparisons of categorical variables used Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Patient characteristics and disposition</title><p>A total of 67 patients were randomized to bimatoprost 0.01% monotherapy and 62 patients were randomized to bimatoprost 0.03% monotherapy following at least 30 days of latanoprost monotherapy.

The 2010 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services considers intervention to be successful if it produces at least a 15% reduction in IOP from the preintervention level (AAO Preferred Practice Pattern).<xref rid="b12-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> At week 12, a &#x02265;15% reduction in IOP was achieved by 61.0% of patients who replaced latanoprost with bimatoprost 0.01% relative to 48.2% with bimatoprost 0.03%.</p><p>It is recommended that patients using a PG/PM who have inadequate IOP lowering switch within class to another PG/PM before adding other therapy.<xref rid="b4-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Previous studies have shown that many patients with either no response or an inadequate response to latanoprost demonstrate additional IOP lowering upon a switch to bimatoprost 0.03%.<xref rid="b13-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The present results are confirmatory and further suggest that patients on latanoprost who need additional IOP lowering may obtain even greater benefit from a switch to bimatoprost 0.01%. Bimatoprost 0.01% demonstrated a numerical advantage in lower mean IOP at each follow-up time point in the studies, and a majority of patients achieved diurnal IOP &#x0003c;18 mmHg after 12 weeks of bimatoprost 0.01% treatment. In addition, the reduced drug concentration in bimatoprost 0.01% results in improved tolerability compared with bimatoprost 0.03%.</p><p>Conjunctival hyperemia associated with PG/PM treatment typically peaks within 4 weeks of starting medication.<xref rid="b17-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> After 4 weeks of treatment, bimatoprost 0.01% was associated with an increase in the incidence of hyperemia from the latanoprost baseline of only 2.0% compared with 12.9% for bimatoprost 0.03%. By week 12, the rate of hyperemia had improved to be below the latanoprost baseline for bimatoprost 0.01% but was maintained at an elevated level with bimatoprost 0.03%. These results suggest a more favorable tolerability profile of bimatoprost 0.01% compared with bimatoprost 0.03%, consistent with the results of head-to-head clinical comparisons of the formulations.<xref rid="b9-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Corneal staining scores also suggested a more favorable tolerability profile of bimatoprost 0.01%, as the percentage of patients with corneal staining had decreased from latanoprost-treated baseline by week 12 only in the bimatoprost 0.01% treatment arm.</p><p>In a Phase III clinical trial, bimatoprost 0.01% was associated with a lower incidence and less severe hyperemia compared with bimatoprost 0.03%.<xref rid="b9-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In contrast with the Phase III trial, all patients in the present studies were run in on latanoprost, and there was no washout prior to beginning bimatoprost treatment. Previous studies have shown that bimatoprost-related hyperemia is reduced in patients switched directly to bimatoprost from latanoprost.<xref rid="b19-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The present analysis demonstrates that there appears to be a discernible difference in the hyperemia profiles of bimatoprost 0.01% and bimatoprost 0.03% even in patients run in on latanoprost. The results are consistent with a recent observational study (the Canadian Lumigan RC Early Analysis Review [CLEAR] study) showing a significant decrease in conjunctival hyperemia in patients switched from bimatoprost 0.03% to bimatoprost 0.01%.<xref rid="b20-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, bimatoprost 0.01% was associated with a low incidence of conjunctival hyperemia even in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients.<xref rid="b21-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>When a patient using a single IOP-lowering medication needs additional IOP lowering, switching within PG/PM class rather than adding a second medication may allow the patient to retain the many benefits of monotherapy. These benefits include reduced risk of side effects, lower costs, and an uncomplicated treatment regimen that enhances compliance.<xref rid="b22-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The studies presented demonstrate that patients treated with latanoprost monotherapy who need additional IOP lowering can benefit from a switch to bimatoprost monotherapy, and further suggest that outcomes of a switch to bimatoprost 0.01% are most favorable.</p><p>A limitation of the present analysis is that the two bimatoprost formulations were tested in separate studies. Although the studies were almost identical in study design, and the study populations were similar in demographic characteristics and latanoprost-treated baseline diurnal IOP, differences in the study populations could have affected the results. The study population consists of patients with IOP of 20 mmHg or higher on latanoprost who may benefit from additional IOP lowering, though the historical untreated baseline IOP of patients was not taken into account. Patients who may not achieve significant IOP lowering with latanoprost, described in the literature as 4%&#x02013;19% of the general population,<xref rid="b23-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> were not specifically excluded. Also, although deemed equivalent by regulatory authorities, the latanoprost used for run-in was from two different manufacturers. There was a difference between studies in the incidence of hyperemia on latanoprost at baseline (9.0% in the bimatoprost 0.01% treatment arm compared with 1.6% in the bimatoprost 0.03% treatment arm), yet the change from baseline hyperemia, as well as the incidence of hyperemia at 12 weeks, was reduced in the bimatoprost 0.01% treatment arm compared with the bimatoprost 0.03% treatment arm. A direct head-to-head comparison study would allow further comparison of the effects of bimatoprost 0.01% and bimatoprost 0.03% in patients using latanoprost who need additional IOP lowering.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of baseline IOP &#x02265;20 mmHg could have led to a regression to the mean in subsequent measurements. However, diurnal IOP at baseline was &#x0003e;22 mmHg in each study, suggesting that the IOP on latanoprost was sustained above 20 mmHg and not a chance observation. Further, the reduction from baseline IOP with bimatoprost 0.01% (mean diurnal 4.0 mmHg) and bimatoprost 0.03% (mean diurnal 3.2 mmHg) is greater than the expected fluctuation in IOP between visits in treated patients. Inadequate time on latanoprost could be argued to have undermined the measured efficacy of latanoprost. However, a 30-day run-in has been used in multiple prior studies.<xref rid="b18-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b25-opth-8-643" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In summary, these studies have demonstrated that many patients treated with latanoprost who need lower IOP may achieve additional IOP lowering and maintain monotherapy by switching to bimatoprost. Of the available bimatoprost formulations, bimatoprost 0.01% had the more favorable efficacy and safety profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA.
