The objective in this secondary analysis was to determine whether patients reporting pain have different depression and pain outcomes over time in response to acupuncture, counselling or usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Self-reported ratings of depression and pain from 755 patients in a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of acupuncture (302) or counselling (302) compared to usual care alone (151) are described and analysed using a series of regression models and analysis of covariance. Patient-reported outcomes of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 for depression, SF36 bodily pain and EQ-5D, all at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, 755 patients reported EQ-5D pain categories; 384 (50.9%) reported moderate-to-extreme pain. Controlling for baseline depression, a linear regression model showed that the presence of pain at baseline was associated with poorer depression outcomes at 3&#x02005;months mean difference=&#x02212;1.16, (95% CI 0.12 to 2.2). Participants with moderate-to-extreme pain at baseline did better at 3&#x02005;months if they received acupuncture (mean reduction in Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) from baseline=6.0, 95% CI 5.0 to 7.1 and a mean reduction in SF-36 bodily pain=11.2, (95% CI 7.1 to 15.2) compared to improvements for those who received counselling (4.3, 95% CI 3.3 to 5.4; 7.6, 95% CI 3.6 to 11.6) or usual care (2.7, 95% CI 1.50 to 4.0: 7.2, 95% CI 2.3 to 12.1). In comparison, no notable differences were seen between treatment arms within the no pain comparator group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients with depression and pain at baseline recovered less well from treatment over 3&#x02005;months than those with depression and no pain. Reductions in both depression and pain were most marked in the acupuncture group, followed by the counselling group and then the usual care group.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Comorbid pain</kwd><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Counselling</kwd><kwd>Usual Care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study targets the under-researched area of how pain may impact on the outcome of different treatments for depression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The research questions were clearly defined to establish the prevalence of pain in a depressed population, to describe the demographic profile of depressed people in pain compared to those who are depressed and pain free, to determine the impact of pain on the treatment outcomes, and in turn determine the effect of treatment for depression on the level of pain reported in the months subsequent to receiving treatment for depression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As a substudy of a larger pragmatic trial, the findings are important for three reasons; first, the emphasis on external validity with findings that are generalisable to primary care patients with depression across the UK. The method of randomisation to treatment allocation is a feature that was maintained through the subgrouping into a &#x02018;pain group&#x02019; and &#x02018;no pain group&#x02019; to provide control for temporal effects and random factors that might influence the outcome of treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study was a substudy of a larger trial which was not powered to detect differences between the subgroups of moderate to extreme pain and no pain.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of the BDI&#x02013;II outcome was not measured at 3&#x02005;months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes to factors such as sleeplessness, energy loss from within the BDI&#x02013;II could not be assessed at the primary outcome point.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The name of the medication prescribed to participants and the frequency of use was not recorded at baseline or as follow-up data, therefore the impact of the treatment on the types of antidepressant and analgesic medication used or the frequency of use could not be established.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Around 50&#x02013;66% of patients who are depressed also report pain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Depression accentuates existing pain problems<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> adding to the emotional distress and poor sleep irrespective of whether the pain had a known cause.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Increased pain symptoms may also represent a greater severity of depression rather than a poor prognostic factor.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In terms of treatment, comorbid pain and depression are present in two-thirds of depressed primary care patients who start antidepressant therapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Pain is known to interfere with routine activities in 42% of primary care patients prior to starting pharmacological treatment for depression<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and has a strong negative impact on achieving remission.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Too frequently there is a focus on the treatment of either pain or depression. The use of complementary therapies alongside conventional treatments for depression is widespread; this uptake may be attributed to the perceptions of ineffectiveness to patients, the distress of continued symptoms and the unwanted side effects of medication.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Treatment outcomes may be enhanced by taking a holistic approach, and delivering treatment options that address both pain and depression together.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>A meta-analysis of 18&#x02005;000 participants data from 25 high-quality trials has shown that acupuncture is an effective treatment option for several chronic pain conditions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Acupuncture is also regularly provided by acupuncturists to treat depression<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> although not routinely available as a treatment option for depression within the UK's National Health Service (NHS).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Counselling for depression is widely available in primary care practices<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> however there is limited evidence for counselling compared to usual care as a treatment for patients with depression and a chronic physical health problem.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A recent randomised controlled trial of acupuncture or counselling provided to patients with depression found that both interventions significantly reduced depression at 3&#x02005;months when compared to usual care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Pain was a secondary outcome in this trial, but has not yet been reported, and it will be of interest to compare the treatment outcomes of patients who had comorbid pain and depression with those who had depression alone.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to find out whether people with depression who are also in pain have better or worse depression outcomes than those without pain. In terms of objectives, we document the prevalence of pain in a depressed population, the demographic profile of patients in pain and the relationship between pain and depression. We then determine depression and pain outcomes following treatment with acupuncture or counselling when compared to usual care alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>This research is a substudy nested within a three-arm randomised controlled trial of acupuncture or counselling as adjuncts to usual care compared to usual care alone.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Full details of the Acupuncture, Counseling, and Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial protocol are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

The research questions were clearly defined to establish the prevalence of pain in a depressed population, to describe the demographic profile of depressed people in pain compared to those who are depressed and pain free, to determine the impact of pain on the treatment outcomes, and in turn determine the effect of treatment for depression on the level of pain reported in the months subsequent to receiving treatment for depression. As a substudy of a larger pragmatic trial, the findings are important for three reasons; first, the emphasis on external validity with findings that are generalisable to primary care patients with depression across the UK. Second, the method of randomisation to treatment allocation is a feature that was maintained through the subgrouping into a &#x02018;pain group&#x02019; and &#x02018;no pain group&#x02019; to provide control for temporal effects and random factors that might influence the outcome of treatment. Finally, the standardised treatment protocols allowed for treatment to be tailored to individual patient's needs regarding pain and depression while maintaining high standards of care, qualifications and practice experience. In terms of limitations, with regard to missing data; the patients who did not respond to follow-up at 3&#x02005;months were divided equally between the pain group and no pain group, and their baseline levels of depression were similar to those who did respond. This study was a substudy of a larger trial which was not powered to detect differences between the subgroups of moderate-to-extreme pain and no pain. The use of the BDI&#x02013;II allowed for physical symptoms of depression to act as predictors to treatment outcome at 3-month follow-up, however this outcome was not measured again at 3&#x02005;months. Therefore, changes to factors such as sleeplessness, energy loss from within the BDI&#x02013;II could not be assessed; however, these attributes will be explored qualitatively in a follow-up paper. A further limitation is that the actual medication prescribed to participants and the frequency of use was not recorded at baseline or as follow-up data, therefore the impact of the treatment on the types of antidepressant and analgesic medication used or the frequency of use could not be established.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Relationship to literature</title><sec id="s4c1"><title>Incidence of comorbidity</title><p>In terms of comorbidity, the estimated prevalence of moderate-to-extreme pain within our study population of depressed patients is 51%, which is comparable with the 50&#x02013;66% in previous literature.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

The doubling of adverse events reported by patients in moderate-to-extreme pain may be accounted for by attendance for hospital investigations and overnight admissions in relation to existing illnesses. However, patients with comorbid pain and depression tend to exhibit a cognitive bias specific to negative aspects of health<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and are more likely to report less favourable outcomes of treatment.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, it is possible that treatment-related minor adverse events are more likely to be reported by patients who suffer from chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4c2"><title>Predictors of depression</title><p>Evidence from the English longitudinal study of ageing<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> identified pain and mobility disability at baseline as predictors of comorbid pain and depression. In a large European study, a higher number of pain locations, pain of the joints and longer duration of pain (for 90&#x02005;days or more), daily use of pain medication and more severe pain at baseline were found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of still having a depressive or anxiety disorder after 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Together these factors are known to adversely affect the outcomes of treatment for depression.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

Patients who received counselling also reported a more gradual reduction in pain over the 12-month follow-up period. This finding is consistent with a Cochrane Review<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which reports that psychological therapies, primarily CBT, can help people with people with chronic pain, reduce negative mood (depression and anxiety), disability and to a lesser degree reduce pain over a 6-month period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications for clinical practice and future research</title><p>Frequently patients with comorbid pain and depression will attribute their complaint to one or other of the conditions and seek help accordingly.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Patients presenting with pain or sleep disturbances are at risk of having a diagnosis of depression missed.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For treatment success, pain and depression should be recognised and treated from the outset. The evidence emerging for the current study is that both acupuncture and counselling appear to have the potential to reduce symptoms associated with pain and depression concurrently, potentially affording patients&#x02019; relief from symptoms of depression and reduced intensity of pain in both the short and longer term.
