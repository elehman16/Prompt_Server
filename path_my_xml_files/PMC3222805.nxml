In study 1, a total of 40 pigs in five units, all cross-breds between Large White and Mong Cai, with an average initial body weight of 20.5&#x000a0;kg were randomly assigned to four treatments consisting of a basal diet containing 45% of dry matter (DM) from ensiled cassava leaves (ECL) and ensiled cassava root supplemented with 0%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.15% <sc>dl</sc>-methionine (as DM). Results showed a significantly improved performance and protein gain by extra methionine. This reduced the feed cost by 2.6%, 7.2% and 7.5%, respectively. In study 2, there were three units and in each unit eight cross-bred (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) pigs with an initial body weight of 20.1&#x000a0;kg were randomly assigned to the four treatments. The four diets were as follows: a basal diet containing 15% ECL (as DM) supplemented with different amounts of amino acids <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>dl</sc>-methionine to the control diet. The results showed that diets with 15% of DM as ECL with supplementation of 0.2% lysine +0.1% <sc>dl</sc>-methionine and 0.1% lysine +0.05% <sc>dl</sc>-methionine at the 20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;kg and above 50&#x000a0;kg, respectively, resulted in the best performance, protein gain and lowest costs for cross-bred (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) pigs.

Cassava leaves have a high crude protein (CP) content of which almost 0.85 is true protein (Ravindran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1993</xref>). Furthermore, cassava leaf protein has an essential amino acid (EAA) content which is higher than soybean protein (Eggum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1970</xref>; Phuc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>; Montagnac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). The high protein content and the relatively good EAA profile are reasons for the inclusion of cassava leaves as a protein source in diets for pigs in many countries. Cassava roots and leaves, however, contain large amounts of cyanogenic glucosides that give rise to toxic hydrocyanic acid (HCN) which limits the use of these products as an animal feed ingredient (Oke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1978</xref>; Ngudi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>; Cardoso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). Ensiling cassava roots and leaves reduce the HCN content (Gomez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1985</xref>; Phuc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>; Loc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) and allow increased incorporation in animal feeds.</p><p>Several studies have determined the ileal apparent digestibility of a number of protein-rich foliages (cassava leaves, leacaena leaves, groundnut foliage, sweet potato leaves) available in tropical countries (Phuc and Lindberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2001</xref>; An et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2004</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010a</xref>). In the case of cassava leaves, the first limiting amino acid for growing pigs is methionine closely followed by lysine (Chauynarong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Montagnac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010a</xref>). Methionine is not only required for growth and maintenance of body protein but also for in vivo detoxification of hydrogen cyanide (Job <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1975</xref>; Tewe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1992</xref>) to non-toxic thiocyanate (Oke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1978</xref>) when pigs are fed cassava leaf or root ingredients. Although it is well-known that methionine is the first limiting amino acids in cassava protein for rats (Eggum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1970</xref>), little research has focused on the supplementation of diets containing ensiled cassava proteins with methionine or lysine on the performance of monogastric production animals. Loc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) reported studies in cross-bred pigs (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) fed ensiled cassava root-based diets supplemented with methionine. Performance as measured by growth rate and feed conversion ratio were found to increase with <sc>dl</sc>-methionine supplementation. There have been no studies reported in the literature on the effects of pig performance and the economic viability of methionine and lysine addition to pig diets containing cassava protein.</p><p>The aim of the two studies reported here was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of synthetic <sc>dl</sc>-methionine alone or in combination with synthetic <sc>l</sc>-lysine to diets which contain ensiled cassava leaves (ECL) and ensiled cassava roots (ECR) as the major protein source in diets for pigs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experiments reported here were carried out in eight units in the Huong Van commune, which is one of the main pig production areas of Thua Thien Hue province in Vietnam. The protocol of the study was approved by the ethical committee of Hue University, Hue, Vietnam.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation and preservation of ensiled cassava leaves</title><p>Fresh leaves of cassava were collected at the time of root harvest and spread out for 5&#x000a0;h on the floor for wilting during which time the dry matter (DM) content increased from 24% to 28&#x02013;29%. After wilting, the leaves were separated from the stems and petioles, chopped into small pieces (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;cm), mixed with 0.5% NaCl and rice bran at 5% of the wilted weight of the cassava leaves. The mixture was kept in air tight nylon bags with a capacity of 30&#x000a0;kg and stored during 2&#x000a0;months before use. This ensiling procedure resulted in a stable silage pH and a low cyanide content.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Animals, experimental design and feeding</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study 1: <sc>dl</sc>-methionine supplementation</title><p>Forty cross-bred pigs (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) with an average initial body weight of 20.5&#x000a0;kg (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) and of similar ages were randomly allocated to five units.

It is well-known that cassava roots are high in starch but low in crude protein, while cassava leaves are rich in crude protein. The protein quality of a food is the product of its AA content and the nutritional availability of these AAs. Eggum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1970</xref>) and Phuc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>) reported that the concentration of the sulphur-containing amino acids is low in cassava leaves and roots which cause a relatively low biological value of this protein ranging from 44 to 57. Recently, several researchers have reported that methionine is the most limiting AA both in cassava leaves and roots for growing pigs and poultry, followed by lysine (Loc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>; Chauynarong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Montagnac et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010a</xref>). In addition, the high cyanide content further limits the use of cassava leaves as a protein source in diets for pigs. Methionine not only plays a role as an EAA in protein deposition but is also important in the hydrogen cyanide detoxification process, particularly in rations with high levels of cassava roots or leaves. Therefore, pig diets with a high inclusion level of cassava root and leaves could benefit from additional supplementation with synthetic methionine and lysine. In order to determine the magnitude of the effect of supplementation, we formulated diets to contain 45% of ensiled cassava root and leaves and added increasing levels of supplementary <sc>dl</sc>-methionine (from 0% to 0.15% in DM) to diets for growing pigs. The results show that there were significant effects of the diet on the final BW, ADG, FCR and protein deposition. Increasing levels of supplementary <sc>dl</sc>-methionine from 0.05% up to 0.15% in the diets improved ADG and FCR. These results can be explained by the fact that the supplemental methionine was not used for protein deposition and provided sulfydril groups (&#x02212;SH) necessary for the detoxification of cyanide as the HCN content of the diets ranged from 29.3&#x02013;43.5&#x000a0;mg/kg DM. In the body, cyanide is detoxified by the enzyme rhodanese, forming thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine (Oke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1978</xref>; Tewe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1977</xref>).</p><p>The estimated fat and protein deposition of F<sub>1</sub> (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) pigs were significantly affected by the dietary treatment. The data in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> show that protein deposition in the <sc>dl</sc>-methionine supplemented diets were higher than in the control animals. Increased levels of supplementary methionine decreased fat deposition because at the same ME intake, less of the MEp is available for lipid gain. Supplementation with 0.15% methionine gave the highest protein deposition among diets although this was not significantly different from the protein deposition of the pigs fed the control&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.10% methionine diet. These results confirm the studies by Eggum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1970</xref>) who reported that addition of synthetic methionine to diets for rats increased the biological value of cassava protein. Loc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) studied the addition of <sc>dl</sc>-methionine (0%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%) to diets containing 20% to 40% of the DM ensiled cassava root to F<sub>1</sub> (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) pigs. This author showed that an increased performance, as measured by growth rate and feed conversion ratio could be achieved with <sc>dl</sc>-methionine supplementation. In the present study, supplementary <sc>dl</sc>-methionine at 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15% in diets containing 45% (in DM) ensiled cassava (30% ECR&#x02009;+&#x02009;15% ECL) reduced the feed cost by 2.6%, 7.2% and 7.5%, respectively.</p><p>Study 2 was designed to test whether further increases in performance can be obtained by adding lysine to methionine-supplemented ensiled cassava leaves and root-containing diets. Identical methionine supplementation levels were used compared to study 1. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> shows that supplementary <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>dl</sc>-methionine in diets of growing pigs improved ADG, FCR and protein deposition. In this study, final BW, ADG and protein deposition were highest at the two highest levels of supplementation (medium and high). The FCR and protein deposition were lower in the control diet than in the other three diets with supplemented <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>dl</sc>-methionine. The final BW, ADG and protein deposition of the pigs were highest, and the FCR was the lowest at the medium level of supplementation with lysine and methionine. It appears that those levels met the requirements for lysine and methionine&#x02009;+&#x02009;cysteine for growing F<sub>1</sub> (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai) pigs. The content of lysine and methionine in the high supplemented diet was somewhat higher than the requirements for lysine and methionine as set by (NRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>). The reason for the numerical increase in FCR from the medium to the high level of supplementation is difficult to explain. Loc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) also found a slightly reduced daily gain of pigs fed 0.30% supplemental methionine compared to the 0.20% when fed an ensiled cassava root-based diet. In study 1, no reduction in growth rate, FCR or protein deposition was observed indicating that this effect was likely due to the lysine addition instead of the methionine.</p><p>The most common procedures for reducing the cyanide content in cassava are sun drying and ensiling (Phuc et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Borin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010b</xref>). Considerable amounts of cassava leaves are readily available as a by-product at the time of harvesting the roots. However, in many tropical countries, the harvest season of cassava roots coincides with the rainy season making sun drying difficult or unfeasible. Ensiling is a suitable alternative way of preserving the roots and leaves (Van Man and Wiktorsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>) and recently Nguyen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>c) showed that ensiling cassava leaves for 90&#x000a0;days reduced the HCN concentration by 70&#x02013;80%. Our results in study 2 show that the diet supplemented with 0.20% <sc>l</sc>-lysine and 0.10% <sc>dl</sc>-methionine, and 0.10% <sc>l</sc>-lysine and 0.05% <sc>dl</sc>-methionine in the growing and finishing periods, respectively, resulted in the highest economic returns for farmers.</p><p>The present study further develops the practical and economical feasibility of using ensiled cassava leaves in diets for pigs. By supplementing diets containing ensiled cassava leaves with methionine and lysine, the performance of Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Mong Cai pigs can be significantly increased as well as the economic benefits for farmers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The financial support for this study was provided by the MEKARN programme supported by the Swedish
