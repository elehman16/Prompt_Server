<italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (chlamydia) is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection (STI) in England; approximately 70% of diagnoses are in sexually active young adults aged under 25. To facilitate opportunistic chlamydia screening in general practice, a complex intervention, based on a previously successful Chlamydia Intervention Randomised Trial (CIRT), was piloted in England. The modified intervention (3Cs and HIV) aimed to encourage general practice staff to routinely offer chlamydia testing to all 15&#x02013;24 year olds regardless of the type of consultation. However, when the 3Cs (<bold>c</bold>hlamydia screening, signposting to <bold>c</bold>ontraceptive services, free <bold>c</bold>ondoms) and HIV was offered to a large number of general practitioner (GP) surgeries across England, chlamydia screening was not significantly increased. This qualitative evaluation addresses the following aims:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Explore why the modified intervention did not increase screening across all general practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Suggest recommendations for future intervention implementation.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Phone interviews were carried out with 26 practice staff, at least 5&#x000a0;months after their initial educational workshop, exploring their opinions on the workshop and intervention implementation in the real world setting. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed and further examined using the fidelity of implementation model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants who attended had a positive attitude towards the workshops, but attendee numbers were low. Often, the intervention content, as detailed in the educational workshops, was not adhered to: practice staff were unaware of any on-going trainer support; computer prompts were only added to the female contraception template; patients were not encouraged to complete the test immediately; complete chlamydia kits were not always readily available to the clinicians; and videos and posters were not utilised. Staff reported that financial incentives, themselves, were not a motivator; competing priorities and time were identified as major barriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Not adhering to the exact intervention model may explain the lack of significant increases in chlamydia screening. To increase fidelity of implementation outside of Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) conditions, and consequently, improve likelihood of increased screening, future public health interventions in general practices need to have: more specific action planning within the educational workshop; computer prompts added to systems and used; all staff attending the workshop; and on-going practice staff support with feedback of progress on screening and diagnosis rates fed back to all staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12875-017-0618-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorised users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chlamydia</kwd><kwd>Testing</kwd><kwd>Training</kwd><kwd>Educational intervention</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Fidelity</kwd><kwd>Qualitative</kwd><kwd>Evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Leonardo Da Vinci Lifelong Learning programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>2012-1-GB2-LEO05.08044</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is the most commonly diagnosed STI in England, with 206,774 diagnoses made in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sexually active young adults aged under 25&#x000a0;years old continue to be at the highest risk of contracting an STI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Chlamydia infection can cause significant short and long-term morbidity with complications including: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy in females; and epididymo-orchitis and possible infertility in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP), established in 2003, aims to control chlamydia through early detection and treatment of asymptomatic infection, so reducing onward transmission and the consequences of untreated infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A means of achieving this is through opportunistic screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As the majority of young people visit their GP surgery at least once annually, young people see it as an accessible and acceptable setting to receive sexual health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>To facilitate opportunistic screening, Public Health England (PHE), in consultation with a primary care led advisory group comprising of general practitioners and practice nurses, developed a more complex intervention, based on a previously successful Chlamydia Intervention Randomised Trial (CIRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whereas the only aim of CIRT was to increase chlamydia screening, the modified intervention, 3Cs and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], incorporated updated national policy change, such as the integration of chlamydia testing with other sexual health and reproductive services. It aimed to encourage general practice staff to routinely offer chlamydia testing, and provide information about the provision of contraceptive services and free condoms (the &#x02018;3C&#x02019;s) to all 15&#x02013;24 year olds, regardless of their reason for consultation. Additionally, practice staff were encouraged to offer HIV screening in line with national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The 3Cs and HIV intervention, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], consisted of two educational workshops, delivered by trained local sexual health staff, and an optional follow up with the trainer (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for details). The first workshop focussed on the routine offer of 3Cs (chlamydia, contraception and condoms); and the second on facilitating HIV screening. The workshops, delivered between August 2013 and July 2015, were supported by a range of materials to engage practice staff and patients (posters, invitation cards and/or leaflets) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], such as: advertising the availability and confidentiality of the service, in waiting areas; as a prompt for clinicians, in consultations. These resources were developed based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with engagement in mind. The intervention encouraged a &#x02018;whole practice&#x02019; approach to screening, encouraging all staff members (clinical and non-clinical) to attend the educational workshops; and suggested a 3Cs champion be appointed to motivate, encourage and facilitate discussions and feedback within team meetings.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The 3Cs and HIV intervention with the components that aim to increase chlamydia screening and diagnosis rate highlighted in red</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2017_618_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Following the protocol for the 3Cs &#x00026; HIV programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], both quantitative and qualitative methods were planned to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in relation to increasing chlamydia screening (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for more details on how the intervention was designed to increase chlamydia screening, specifically).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Modified logic model of how the suggested components of the intervention could have been implemented to increase chlamydia screening</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2017_618_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Although immediately after the workshop, practice staff who attended the educational workshops fed back that they intended to increase their chlamydia screening as a result of the training, the quantitative evaluation shows that there was no overall significant increase in chlamydia testing or diagnosis across all of the practices offered the workshops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, chlamydia testing and diagnosis significantly increased in practices that received specific payments for testing before the intervention began. These practices were reminded about these incentives during the educational workshop.</p><p>This qualitative arm of the service evaluation aimed to: a) explore why an intervention based on a successful trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] did not achieve the same sustained results in the wider pilot, b) make recommendations for future interventions, and their implementation, within the general practice setting in an effort to improve outcomes.</p><p>The fidelity of implementation model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) has been used to facilitate this research. The theory provides a conceptual framework referring to the degree to which an intervention or programme is delivered as intended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Unless such an assessment is made, it cannot be determined whether a lack of impact is due to poor implementation or inadequacies inherent in the programme itself, so called Type III error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The concept of implementation fidelity can be described in terms of five elements: adherence to an intervention; exposure or dose; quality of delivery; participant responsiveness; and programme differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This paper will explore each of the first four elements, the relationship between them and suggest essential components of the intervention (programme differentiation, the fifth element) based on the qualitative and quantitative findings.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Modified conceptual framework for fidelity of implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2017_618_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recruitment and sampling</title><p>Practices that had participated in the 3Cs and HIV intervention were stratified by chlamydia screening rate per 100 registered 15&#x02013;24 year old patients, from January 2013 until September 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Practices were then contacted in a random order from this list via the practice managers. Interviews were arranged with practice staff that had previously attended the educational workshops. Data saturation was achieved after 18 interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, as the quantitative analysis showed locally enhanced service (LES) payments to be a relevant factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], purposive sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was used recruit a further 8 participants from areas with an existing LES, at the time of the intervention. At this stage, male practice staff were prioritised, where there was an option, to reduce the gender imbalance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interview schedule</title><p>The interview schedule explored staff&#x02019;s opinions on the 3Cs and HIV educational workshop as a whole; which components of the intervention they had implemented and their opinion on these (ie. posters, cards, prompts, champion, further discussion); and the impact the intervention had had on their chlamydia testing, HIV testing and sexual health provision. Participants were specifically asked about any barriers to offering basic sexual health services in their practice and ideas on how these could be alleviated. In the initial stages of qualitative data collection, the interviewers were not aware of the quantitative findings. The semi structured interview schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was modified and developed throughout the data collection process, based on the findings from previous interviews and, following the results of the quantitative analysis, to assess why the intervention was not successful, overall (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Appendix 2). Interviewers were practiced in the skill of interviewing, using probing as opposed to leading questions. Length of interviews ranged from 12.8 to 50.6&#x000a0;min, with an average length of 31.6&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interview sessions</title><p>Interviews were conducted by telephone, as practice staff reported that they had insufficient time for face-to-face interviews. Although visual cues cannot be obtained during telephone interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], results compared between telephone and face-to-face interviews are very similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In order for the interviewee to feel they could speak openly and not be influenced by a pre-existing relationship with the interviewer, the interviewer had not facilitated the training or had any previous contact with the participants. Therefore, in order for the interviewer to build rapport with the practice staff, emails and phone calls were exchanged, in order to: set up a time for the interview; discuss the purpose of the research; and ensure the participant was fully informed before written consent was provided. Interviewees were explicitly encouraged to discuss all positive and negative features of the intervention, in order to understand facilitators and barriers to implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><p>Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed using a modified framework analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Transcripts were initially read through for accuracy and data familiarisation. Two researchers independently coded categories and themes: the lead researcher coded all transcripts and a second researcher coded 10% of the transcripts, to ensure coding consistency; minor discrepancies over specific terminology of themes were resolved through discussion and referral to the original transcripts until agreement was reached. Use of NVivo software (version 10) facilitated the organisation of the data. The one sheet of paper (OSOP) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used to clarify findings within, and between, themes. As the quantitative evaluation found that the intervention was not successful in increasing chlamydia screening and diagnosis rates in all general practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], deductive analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was used, whereby the principles of the fidelity of implementation model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were applied to further analyse the themes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From July 2014 to May 2016, at least 5&#x000a0;months post intervention, 26 members of practice staff were interviewed to see whether there had been a sustained behaviour change. Both clinical and non-clinical staff were interviewed, as everyone had been encouraged to attend the educational workshops. More women participated in the interviews than men, which is also reflected in attendance of the educational workshops.

</p><p>The themes that emerged from the interviews were further examined using the fidelity of implementation model as outlined below.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Quality of delivery</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Opinion on the trainer/training</title><p>Practice staff were very positive about the trainer, quality and format of the training received.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;actually quite interested to hear all the statistics because she did say a lot about the (<italic>geographical location</italic>) area and what was relevant to us rather than just about the whole country&#x0201d; (KIKT122- receptionist)</p><p>&#x0201c;The advantages of training like the 3C are that staff can talk to each other at in group sessions, and any sort of group training is good because, people, not from what you learn particularly from the lecturers, but from what you learn from the colleagues&#x0201d; (YNYCR126- nurse)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Participants felt that it was relevant to all staff, regardless of their previous sexual health training or their current role within the practice.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;I found it very useful, and it was&#x02026; delivered at the right level&#x02026; we had admin staff with varying knowledge and years of experience working in the NHS as well as two clinical staff attend. So she pitched it at the right level, made it interesting, made it informative and yeah, she&#x02019;s a very pleasant lady and I think she did very well&#x02026; Yes, no complaints whatsoever. It was easy to understand. There wasn&#x02019;t any massive medical jargon. It gave a bit of background history as to each point and yeah, she delivered it well.&#x0201d; (DRA2- practice manager)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The training raised staff awareness of chlamydia and was facilitated by the fact that the trainer came to the practice and held the training over lunch, so it was not an added burden to staff&#x02019;s workload. In a couple of practices, the 3Cs and HIV educational workshop prompted individuals within the practice with an interest in sexual health to provide further training sessions for staff.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;I think it&#x02019;s made people more aware, because what we did was, we also expanded on the contraceptive side of things and we actually gave a very short training session to the staff as to the types of contraceptive that we actually offer&#x02026;&#x0201d; (DRA2- practice manager)</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Suggestions for the future</title><p>Most staff said that they did not: receive the 3Cs and HIV newsletter provided by the trainer to the practice for dissemination; or any other feedback on their progress; and were not aware of any further contact with the trainer following the start of the intervention.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Never, ever had any feedback after the training&#x02026;The training was very good, it was comprehensive, but I was asked then, to produce these figures and I&#x02019;ll never know what they were for.&#x0201d; (DRA2- practice manager)</p><p>&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t think we got any support from my memory, I can&#x02019;t remember having anything&#x02026;which I think would have been helpful&#x0201d; (NSCR122- GP)</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Participants recommended regular updates circulated to all staff, as initially staff were motivated and focussed, but as time passed, this was not sustained.<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;We did have quite a big drive originally, and things just tend to drop off sometimes&#x02026;</p><p>What do you think could be changed so that it doesn&#x02019;t drop off?</p><p>I think just keeping up with this kind of training, really, and keeping us on our toes, I suppose&#x02026;. we just need to do the reminders, I think, more than anything else.&#x0201d; (LIRA2- nurse)</p></disp-quote>

Some practices did not plan who was going to take the intervention components forward and how this would be done. For example, patients often did not complete the test immediately and the main reason given was that kits often were not made up and in the clinicians&#x02019; rooms.</p><p>Additionally, although the educational workshops specifically encouraged the use of computer prompts and templates, practices generally only added a 3Cs prompt to the female contraception template. Many practices did not develop automatic computer prompts for all patients aged 15&#x02013;24 years old; therefore, men were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, if all patients attending their GPs for a contraception consultation had completed a chlamydia screen, the intervention effect would have been greater than observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], suggesting that this did not happen.</p><p>Furthermore, although the educational workshop explicitly addressed some misconceptions of patients&#x02019; preferences, practice staff&#x02019;s opinions and beliefs had not always changed. This is highlighted in the opinion of a few practice staff that patients would just pick up a self-testing kit if they wanted to be screened; although the point of the intervention was to routinely offer a chlamydia screen to all 15&#x02013;24 years olds, even if un-symptomatic and in un-related consultations. Although screening may be available through other services, the evidence provided at the educational workshops showed that young people see the GP setting as a non-threatening place for them and therefore an appropriate setting to be offered chlamydia screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many participants stated that, as chlamydia screening is becoming more routine, many patients had already completed a test recently and therefore refused the offer. It should be acknowledged that the number of times practice staff offered the test was not reported in the quantitative results; only the number of complete chlamydia screens. It may be that, as chlamydia screening kits are more readily available, young people are getting screened through other means, but as data shows that 60&#x02013;70% of young people in the target age group visit the GP surgery at least annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], practice staff should still be encouraged to offer chlamydia screening to 15&#x02013;24 year olds, routinely.</p><p>Practice staff were not aware of any on-going support with the trainer, which is a key difference from the successful CIRT trial; and, although trainers provided regular newsletters, these were not always circulated around the whole practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, in CIRT, the trainer was funded from a research grant; whereas the 3Cs &#x00026; HIV intervention used existing staff resources to see whether the intervention was achievable and sustainable in a real world setting. The results suggest there are many challenges with moving from an RCT to real world setting.</p><p>Competing priorities, and time were the main barriers for implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These competing priorities were: within the general practice, overall; within a consultation, when the patient came in with many symptoms to discuss. Staff reported that financial incentives themselves were not a motivator as targets were too hard to achieve, however the quantitative results show that the practices with financial incentives had a significant increase in chlamydia screening and diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

For example, a mixture of male and female: GPs, nurses, practice managers and receptionists; from a range of sized practices with or without a LES, were interviewed. Furthermore, data saturation was reached and no new themes emerged, confirming rich data and a rigorous methodology.</p><p>A further strength includes the consideration of the role of the interviewers. The interviewers had not delivered the workshop to the participants and therefore had not developed a relationship with the participants around the intervention delivery. However, the interviewers had been involved in intervention development and/or analysis and therefore had a good understanding of how the intervention was intended to be delivered and the reasoning behind this. This allowed for informed probing by the interviewer, but the participant was not affected by social desirability bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] as they did not link the intervention and the interviewer. The primary analyst had not been involved in the intervention development, and therefore was not biased in their analysis.</p><p>As this was a service evaluation across England, it was not possible to video the educational workshops to ascertain whether they were delivered as intended. Trainers were encouraged to adapt the presentation to suit their own presentation style and add statistics to make it applicable to the local authority. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether the presentation was delivered exactly as intended and whether the key messages were relayed in their entirety. This highlights the difficulty in ensuring a high fidelity of delivery when working with a wide range of people in differing contexts. For example, trainers reported that, sometimes, there were not the facilities to play the video clips role-playing typical situations, and occasionally there was no training room, so the educational workshop was delivered in the waiting room with staff huddled around the trainer (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Comparison to other literature and recommendations</title><p>Complex interventions have greater scope for variation in their delivery, and so are more vulnerable to one or more components not being implemented as they should; both in delivery and actions following this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The fidelity of implementation model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) details that various moderators should be taken into consideration when implementing an intervention:</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Facilitation</title><p>Participants in this study were familiar with and positive about the use of prompts and templates. A study by Walker et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] suggest that alerts alone may not be sufficient to significantly increase chlamydia screening, but that they could be included as part of a more complex intervention, such as the 3Cs and HIV. This complex intervention uses prompts in combination with hard copy resources, such as posters and leaflets. Therefore, strategies such as: providing a manual on how to set up a computer prompt based on age; or training the trainer on how to add this prompt to the system, and have the trainer set up the prompt at the first educational workshop, could facilitate implementation, which could have improved the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Provision of chlamydia kits was not part of the 3Cs and HIV intervention, which relied on the use of existing kits, provided by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). The chlamydia kits&#x02019; supplier was not recorded as part of the intervention, but future work may be necessary to liaise with the commissioners of primary care resources, to highlight the importance of providing the complete kits in GP surgeries, as this would resolve the problem of incomplete kits, identified by some participants. This further highlights the differences between an RCT and sustainably implementing change in real-life conditions, using existing resources and procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Intervention complexity</title><p>Research on guidelines intended for GPs found that detailed and clear recommendations were almost twice as likely to be followed as vague and non-specific recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It could have facilitated implementation if trainers had been explicit about the need for chlamydia kits to be available in every consultation room, to facilitate staff making the offer and facilitate patients completing the tests immediately.</p><p>Additionally, more specificity was necessary in regards to where the posters should have been displayed, as the educational workshops suggested that posters displayed in consultation rooms could be used as a prompt or conversation starter, but this was not always adhered to. Furthermore, as the 3Cs and HIV is a complex intervention with multifaceted components and outcomes, a specific action plan detailing staff&#x02019;s roles and responsibilities to implement the intervention should have been agreed at the end of the training session and re-visited at practice meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>The lack of fidelity of implementation of the intervention may also have been a result of not everyone attending the educational workshops. The workshop highlighted that if everyone within a practice understands what the 3Cs offer is and how it works in their practice, it makes a huge difference in increasing successful outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Francis and Young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] define a team as &#x0201c;an energetic group of people who are committed to achieving common objectives&#x0201d;. However, as not everyone attended the training sessions, there was rarely a whole team approach, which may have resulted in an inconsistent approach to testing, reported by participants, and thus, an overall reduction in fidelity of implementation. By: accessing existing protected learning time and networks; making attendance mandatory; or providing more regular training opportunities, the educational workshop would be attended by a higher percentage of staff, and therefore a whole team approach would be more likely.</p><p>Robbins and Finley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] argue that team failure is often due to: mismatched needs; confused goals; unresolved roles; insufficient feedback and/or information; ill-conceived reward systems, some of which are consistent with the findings of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this qualitative study indicate that the overall lack of significant increases in chlamydia testing across all general practices involved in the intervention could be due to lack of adherence to the intervention as it was intended, and how it was suggested in the educational workshops. CIRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] highlighted key components of the chlamydia intervention that resulted in a successful and sustained increase in chlamydia screening. However, this study highlights that, although in theory these components are known, it is not always possible to implement them outside of a research setting. Further research is required to explore the differences between research and real-life settings; however, this qualitative evaluation suggests minor modifications to the presentation, and support provided within the intervention, which could greatly facilitate implementation and may increase chlamydia screening (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Programme differentiation: &#x0201c;key&#x0201d; components identified, without which, the intervention may not have its intended effect</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Components of the intervention that were not implemented as intended</th><th>Importance of the component</th><th>Recommendations for improvements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Whole practice attendance at the educational workshops</td><td>If everyone understands what the 3Cs offer is and how it works in their practice, it makes a huge difference in increasing successful outcomes</td><td>Make the 3Cs and HIV training mandatory and offer more frequent educational workshops.

LES financial incentives, in themselves, may not be a driver, but CCG reminders that coincide may improve chlamydia screening rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>The majority of practices were initially very motivated by the educational workshop, but were not able to sustain this focus, which resulted in drop off in fidelity of implementation. To counter this, it is essential that contact is sustained between the trainer and the sexual health champion identified within the educational workshop, so that any questions are answered and ensure that the suggested changes have been implemented. Although the third educational workshop was optional, the majority of practices opted for this to be carried out by phone or felt that they did not need or have time for it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In an attempt to build relations, it could be advised that the trainer return to the practice to be able to see in person whether the intervention is being implemented as intended, give suggestions for improvements, and their presence would act as a reminder for staff to re-focus on their role. Although trainers attempted to find a suitable time to return to the practice, this was not always possible due to lack of time, both for the trainer who was not given additional funding or time to complete the role; and the practice who highlighted lack of time as their main barrier for implementation. It is a suggestion that practices without a locally enhanced service should be targeted first for extra support as there was not a significant increase in chlamydia testing within this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that the additional complexity of the 3Cs and HIV intervention in contrast to CIRT was not fully appreciated, and the additional support and facilitators required for implementation was not foreseen. Therefore, in an attempt to increase fidelity of implementation and consequently improve likelihood of increased screening, the intervention needs to have: more specific action planning; computer prompts added to systems and used; all staff attend the workshop in dedicated learning time; and on-going practice staff support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
