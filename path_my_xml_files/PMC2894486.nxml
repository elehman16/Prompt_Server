They were randomly divided in two groups, group A and group B. Group A(n=15) received 0.25%bupivacaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and Group B (n=15) received 0.25% bupivaeaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as single shot caudal block. Postoperative pain was assessed by a modified TPPPS (Toddler-Preschool Postoperative Pain Scale) and analgesic given only when the score was more than 3. In the first 24 hrs it was observed that the mean duration of time interval between the caudal block and first dose of analgesic was significantly long(9.1hrs) in Group B as compared to Group A (6.3hrs) which was much shorter(p&#x0003c;0.01). There was no significant haemodynamie changes, motor weakness or respiratory depression in both groups. This study concluded that addition of tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to caudal 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> significantly prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia in children without producing much adverse effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Caudal analgesia</kwd><kwd>Bupivacaine</kwd><kwd>Tramadol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The society of Paediatric Anaesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>, on it's 15<sup>th</sup> annual meeting at New Orleans, Louisiana (2001) clearly defined the alleviation of pain as a &#x0201c;basic human right&#x0201d;, irrespective of age, medical condition, treatment, primary service response for the patient care or medical institution. Finely et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref> observed that many types of so called &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d; surgery (e.g. circumcision) can cause significant pain in children.</p><p>The goal of post operative pain relief is to reduce or eliminate pain with minimum side-effects and in our setup as cheaply as possible. Effective pain relief means a smooth postoperative period, increased patient compliance and an early discharge from hospital. Langlade et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> suggested that the postoperative pain treatment must be included in the anaesthetic planning even before induction of anaesthesia, adopting the idea of &#x02018;managing pain before it occurs&#x02019;.</p><p>Over the years various regional anaesthetic procedures has gained popularity for postoperative analgesia because in addition to providing effective postoperative pain relief, they also reduce the requirement of general anaesthesia intraoperatively without significant side-effects and maintaining a smooth intra and postoperative period. Caudal block has proved useful in a variety of subumbilical operations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref> in children for providing both intra operative and post operative analgesia. Objective of present study was to compare the quality and duration of analgesia, after a single shot caudal block with bupivacaine alone and bupivacaine plus tramadol, and thereby try to find out whether tramadol can be an effective adjuvant to bupivacaine for providing postoperative analgesia in children undergoing subumbilical surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval and parental written informed consent, thirty children aged between 2-5yrs, weighing between 10-18 Kg and of ASA I and II physiologic status were enrolled for the study. These patients were scheduled for sub-umbilical surgeries like herniotomy and penile surgery under general anaesthesia by a single surgeon. The patients were randomly allocated in two groups.</p><p>Group A received single shot caudal block with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and Group B received 0.25% bupivacaine 0. 5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> plus tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, after induction of anaesthesia. Any children having allergy to bupivacaine or any contraindication to neuraxial blockade were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were induced with halothane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen inhalation via face mask. Intravenous cannulation was done using 22G cannula, then atropine 0.02mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, ondansetron 0.1mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and midazolam 0.1mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were given i.v as premedication. After induction, caudal block was then given in right lateral position by a 22G needle under aseptic condition. Syringes containing an equal volume of either 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5m1.kg<sup>1</sup> or 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> plus tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were prepared and given to the investigator who was blinded to the identity of drug(s). He gave the caudal blocks. Then the surgery was continued under inhalational anaesthesia via mask. Intraoperative heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (NIBP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was monitored. After recovery from general anaesthesia the patient was shifted to PACU and his vitals and pain was assessed by a 10-point TPPS score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>) by a blinded investigator. The child's motor power, any side-effects and sedation score(0= Eyes open, 1= Eyes open to speech, 2=Eyes open when shaken, 3= unrousable) was also noted. Assessment was done every 5-min for the first 30-min, then every 15-min for next 1hr, then hrly for next 2 hrs and then at 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 24hr by the same blinded investigator.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pain assessment method in children(TPSS Score<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="T000F1">*</xref>)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score 0</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score 1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Verbal complaint/cry</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Once Only</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;once</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Groan/Moan/Grunt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Once only</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;once Facial</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expression</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neutral</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">One Grimace</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grimace&#x0003e;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Restless Motor behaviour</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">One episode</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;one episode</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rub/ touch painful area</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Once only</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;Once</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="T000F1"><label>*</label><p>According to Toddler-Preschool Postoperative Pain Scale</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Data Processing</title><p>ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used for comparisons between the groups.

Caudal administration of bupivacaine is a widespread regional anaesthetic technique for intra- and postoperative analgesia during lower limb, anoperineal, penoscrotal and abdominal surgical procedures in children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>&#x02010;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>. Tramadol is a centrally acting opioid analgesic, used for treating moderate to severe pain. It is a synthetic agent, made of racemic mixture of two enantiomers- (+) tramadol and (-) tramadol and it appears to have actions at the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor as well as the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>. Tramadol was developed by the German pharmaceutical company Gr&#x000fc;nenthal GmbH in the late 1970s and marketed under the trade name Tramal. As an analgesic it's equipotent to meperidine without any respiratory depressant action. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions are nausea, vomiting, sweating and constipation. Drowsiness is reported, although it is less of an issue than for opioids.</p><p>In our study, we found that by adding tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to caudal bupivacaine (0.025%) 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in children undergoing sub-umbilical operation, significantly increased the duration of pain free period post-operatively. Similar results were reported by Gune et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref> during a study of children undergoing hypospadias repair showed that caudaltramadol provides better and longer lasting postoperative analgesia than i.v tramadol. Senel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref> in a study on children undergoing herniorrhaphy showed that, caudal administration of bupivacaine with the addition of tramadol resulted in superior analgesia with a longer period without demand for additional analgesics compared with caudal bupivacaine and tramadol alone without an increase of side effects. The incidence of emergence agitation, which is frequently seen during recovery from inhalational anaesthesia in children, were much less in children with preoperative caudal block in both groups and it was more less in Group B and this is supported by a previous study of Weldon et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref> who reported that effective postoperative analgesia may reduce the incidence of emergence agitation with sevoflurane anaesthesia. The degree of sedation was comparable in two groups. The potency of single shot caudal bupivacaine was increased by addition of tramadol because in our set up it was neither technically possible nor cost effective to use caudal epidural catheter and maintain postoperative analgesia with bupivacaine alone. A prolong and effective postoperative analgesia to children means a cooperative child with less emotional and haemodynamic stress and rapid recovery with less hospital stay. Mean duration of postoperative analgesia with caudal bupivacaine was 6.3 hrs whereas with addition of tramadol it increased up to 9.1 hrs, without increasing the dose as well as the side effects of bupivacaine as it was shown in various studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>. A higher dose of tramadol could have caused nausea and vomiting whereas increasing the dose of bupivacaine could have caused more motor weakness and urinary retention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref></p><p>Our study concluded that caudal administration of tramadol 2mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> along with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> significantly increased the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing sub-umbilical operation, without producing significant adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
