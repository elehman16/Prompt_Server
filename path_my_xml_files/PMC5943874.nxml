Approved pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation are marginally effective, underscoring the need for improved pharmacotherapies. A novel approach might use glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, which reduce alcohol and drug use in preclinical studies. GLP-1 is produced in the intestinal L-cells and in the hindbrain. The peptide maintains glucose homeostasis and reduces food intake. Several GLP-1 agonists are used clinically to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, but none have been tested in humans to reduce smoking.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>We will examine whether extended-release exenatide reduces smoking, craving, and withdrawal symptoms, as well as cue-induced craving for cigarettes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We will enroll prediabetic and/or overweight treatment seeking smokers (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;90) into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

Over 16 million Americans suffer from chronic diseases caused by smoking, and these diseases cost the US $170 billion in direct medical care and over $156 billion in lost productivity annually.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>The first-line pharmacological therapies for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride, and varenicline tartrate. Nearly 50 million Americans smoke cigarettes, and although many report wanting to quit, the 12-month abstinence rates with the use of these therapies range from 22% to 33%.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The relatively modest long-term improvements in abstinence rates underscore the importance of developing improved therapeutic approaches to assist smoking cessation.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> One innovative approach is based on animal studies showing that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists attenuate rewards induced by alcohol,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> cocaine,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> amphetamine,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and most relevant here, nicotine.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In mice, treatment with a GLP-1 agonist at a dose with no other behavioral effects attenuated nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation, nucleus accumben's dopamine release, and reduced the expression of nicotine conditioned place preference.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>GLP-1 is produced endogenously in the intestinal L-cells and in the hindbrain nucleus tractus solitarius<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> in response to nutrient ingestion. Acting primarily via GLP-1 receptors in hypothalamus and brain stem, GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis via increasing the secretion of insulin<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and suppressing the secretion of glucagon.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> GLP-1 also reduces food intake<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> in part by reducing appetite.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> A GLP-1 agonist exenatide is food and drug administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and a related GLP-1 agonist liraglutide is FDA approved for the treatment of obesity in patients with or without DM. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in many brain regions. In addition to the hypothalamus and brain stem, GLP-1 receptors are expressed throughout the mesolimbic dopamine system,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> and GLP-1 containing neurons extend directly into the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> &#x02013; areas that are intimately associated with the regulation of reward. These data suggest that the role of GLP-1 extends beyond its glucose regulatory effects to reward regulation and that the GLP-1 system may represent a target for pharmacological treatment of addictive behaviors.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our objectives are to evaluate, for the first time, the impact of treatment with extended-release injectable exenatide on smoking abstinence and cue-induced craving for cigarettes among prediabetic and/or overweight adults. In addition, to obtain preliminary evidence for a larger follow-up study that will evaluate the mediating effects of craving and withdrawal symptoms on abstinence in smokers treated with exenatide, we will assess the impact of exenatide on postquit craving and withdrawal symptoms &#x02013; proximal factors that can covary with and predict future abstinence.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and rationale</title><sec><label>2.1.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial will be conducted in a research clinic associated with the academic center.

All participants, including those in the active medication group and those in the placebo group, will receive transdermal NRT (nicotine patches) and individual behavioral smoking cessation counseling. Quit date will be set following 2 weeks of exenatide/placebo treatment because we anticipate that it will take 2 weeks for the effects of exenatide to emerge.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Smoking abstinence will be evaluated via self-report and confirmed during weekly clinic visits via breath carbon monoxide (CO) measurements.</p><p>Rationale: Administration of extended-release exenatide (2&#x0200a;mg) results in therapeutic concentrations of &#x0003e;50&#x0200a;pg/mL in approximately 2 weeks, and the steady-state concentrations of approximately 300&#x0200a;pg/mL are achieved within approximately 4 to 6 weeks.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Based on these pharmacokinetics, we selected to set the quit date following 2 weeks of exenatide treatment and to evaluate the primary outcomes following a total of 6 weeks of treatment. This is the first study to evaluate the effect of exenatide treatment on smoking outcomes; therefore, the optimal time points for quit date and assessment of the primary outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.

The incidence of hypoglycemia with the use exenatide is low because the release of insulin following administration of exenatide is glucose mediated. Although there have been questions about the safety of incretins such as exenatide, as treatment may be associated with increased rates of pancreatitis, a meta-analysis of 60 studies (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;353,639), consisting of 55 randomized controlled trials (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;33,350) and 5 observational studies (3 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 case&#x02013;control studies; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;320,289) has shown that incretin treatment was not associated with increased rates of pancreatitis.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Ongoing postmarketing monitoring is also underway. In addition, data from rodent studies suggest that GLP-1 agonists may be associated with an increased risk of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and C-cell tumors; however, experiments with monkeys did not show proliferation of C-cells in thyroid gland after chronic administration of GLP-1 agonists. Longitudinal data from clinical trials have not demonstrated a causal association between GLP-1 agonists and thyroid C-cell pathology over a 2-year period.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> To address the concerns regarding the risk of pancreatitis and/or thyroid cancer associated with GLP-1 agonists, potential participants with abnormal levels of pancreatic enzymes, history of pancreatitis, or at risk for pancreatitis, as well as those with personal and/or family history of thyroid C-cell tumor or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 will be excluded from participation in this study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.3.2</label><title>Placebo</title><p>Sterile saline will serve as the placebo for exenatide.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.3.3</label><title>Criteria for withholding study treatment</title><p>Subsequent doses of exenatide will not be administered if any of the following occur: hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity, pancreatitis, or severe injection site reaction or the study PI believes that there may be any reason to withhold exenatide.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.3.4</label><title>Criteria for participant discontinuation following study initiation</title><p>Participants will be discontinued from the study participation if they are unable to comply with the study procedures or if they meet discontinuation criteria because of side-effects/adverse events associated with the study treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.4.4</label><title>Stopping criteria</title><p>The frequency of the treatment-related adverse events will be monitored.

Subsequently, participants will take part in a VR session that is viewed using a head-mounted device (NIVS SX-60, NIVS, Reston, Virginia) with a head tracker (Ic3 inertia cube, Intersense) connected to a desktop computer. Participants are exposed to VR neutral cues (nature scenes), followed by series of VR smoking-related cues. VR smoking cues are personalized to match each participant's preferred brand of cigarettes. Similarly, the style of music played in the VR party contexts is also adjusted based on participant preference. Cue reactivity will be assessed within the VR environment immediately after each VR scenario with the aid of a gamepad to answer craving-related questions (using a visual analog scale of 0&#x02013;100). VR neutral context consists of a nature video; VR active paraphernalia context consists of proximal smoking-related objects (packs of cigarettes, ashtrays, bottles of alcohol) placed on tables around the room; and VR party context consists of similar smoking cues and includes interactions with avatars at the party where cigarettes are offered, drinks are poured, and conversations are held while people light up cigarettes. Exposure to each VR environment (neutral, paraphernalia, party) lasts approximately 3 minutes and follows a timed path where at certain points participants are visually directed for a few seconds to pay attention to nonsmoking or active cues to standardize some of the VR exposure within the environment. This VR paradigm was used in a previous study that showed that self-reported levels of &#x02018;craving&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01) and &#x02018;thinking about cigarettes&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.0001) were significantly greater after exposure to the active cues versus nonsmoking cues and that there were significant positive correlations between self-reported craving prior to the VR session and craving induced by active VR cues (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01).<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.4.8</label><title>Data collection and measures</title><p>The MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview will be administered during screening to determine whether study participants meet the diagnostic and statistical manual-5 criteria for nicotine-use disorder and to rule out presence of exclusionary conditions noted in 2.3.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup></p><p>Nicotine dependence will be assessed during screening using the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND).<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> The FTND is a valid and reliable 6-item questionnaire that evaluates the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence.</p><p>Baseline smoking status will be assessed during screening via self-reported smoking of &#x02265;10&#x0200a;cigarettes/day for &#x0003e;1 year and with recent smoking confirmed by an expired air CO level of &#x02265;10&#x0200a;ppm.</p><p>Self-reported abstinence from smoking will be confirmed via time-line follow back procedures.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> Biochemical verification of abstinence (expired CO level of &#x02264;5&#x0200a;ppm) will be performed during clinic visits.</p><p>Withdrawal symptoms will be assessed using WSWS.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> WSWS is a valid and reliable questionnaire which includes subscales of anger, anxiety, concentration, craving, hunger, sadness, and sleep.</p><p>Craving for smoking will be evaluated using the QSU,<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> a 32-item scale that assesses the intention and desire to smoke and an anticipation of relief from the withdrawal-associated negative affect.</p><p>Positive and negative affect will be assessed using the positive and negative affect schedule,<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> a 20-item questionnaire that asks participants to rate the extent to which they experience positive (i.e., excited, inspired, proud) or negative (i.e., irritable, distressed, upset) emotions.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.9</label><title>Study visits</title><p>Following determination of the study eligibility, qualified participants will return to clinic for 6 weekly visits.

Upon the completion of the treatment phase of the study, the participants who were abstinent following 6 weeks of treatment will be contacted via telephone at 1- and 4-weeks posttreatment to ascertain continued abstinence from smoking. Those who report being abstinent, will be invited for in-person visit for the biochemical verification of abstinence.

Frequent statistics that are based on dichotomous null hypothesis testing (i.e., estimating the probability of observing the data, or data more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true) would be less informative in the context of this early-phase project. We, therefore, selected a Bayesian approach to data analysis. Bayesian probability estimates incorporate prior information about plausible parameter values with the observed data, forming the posterior distribution and thereby, allow estimates of the probability that the true value of the parameter falls in some range. The Bayesian approach will thus allow us to bet on the alternative hypothesis and ascertain the probability that the treatment confers some level of benefit, given the observed data.<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> According to the FDA, Bayesian statistics offer improved methodological efficiency for early-phase projects aimed to &#x02018;repurpose&#x02019; existing therapies for new indications.<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</sup> Decision-making based on an initial trial of a compound for a new indication is assisted by estimates of the probability of an effect of some specified magnitude, even with small sample sizes.<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An intent-to-treat approach will impute those who drop out of the study being counted as continuing to smoke. Demographic and baseline characteristics of the study participants by group that show correlations with both treatment group and outcomes may be potential confounders and result in 2 sets of analyses, those including and those excluding the salient demographic or baseline characteristic to ascertain the degree to which this is the case. If these analyses suggest evidence of confounding, we will report both unadjusted estimates of treatment effect and estimates statistically adjusted using covariance analyses for the potentially confounding factors. For retention, group differences in the time to dropout over the 6-week study period as a function of treatment will use Cox proportional hazards survival analysis. Data analyses will use generalized linear and multilevel models. Binomial regression models (with a log link to permit estimates of relative risks) will be used to assess the effect of treatment on the 7-day point prevalence abstinence following 6 weeks of treatment and 1- and 4-weeks posttreatment. Multilevel models will be used to assess the effect of treatment on craving and cue-induced craving for cigarettes (QSU score), and withdrawal symptoms (WSWS score). Lastly, multilevel models will be used to examine the trajectory of abstinence throughout the course of the study. Vague, neutral priors provide a basis for initially evaluating the trial results: for linear Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression, priors for coefficients will take the form &#x0223c;normal (&#x003bc;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, &#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>6</sup>) in the linear, log-hazard, and log-relative risk scales. Priors for error or dispersion terms will use &#x0223c;gamma (a&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001, b&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001) and &#x0223c;uniform (11,000) for level 1 and 2 effects, respectively. We will investigate the robustness of the resulting posterior distributions using a variety of neutral and pessimistic priors representing vague, weakly informative, and skeptical informative perspectives. Informative priors will use extant information (e.g., meta-analytic findings<sup>[<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup> for smoking outcomes). Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding the probability that effects of varying magnitudes exist, given the data.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Dissemination of findings</title><p>After the study is completed, the results of the analyses will be published.

If our hypotheses are confirmed, the results of this project would provide strong preliminary data in support of a definitive follow-up study. In a follow-up study we would assign study participants to placebo and exenatide with quit dates at 2 and 6 weeks of treatment to determine the onset of clinical effects. We would then increase the study duration to at least 12 weeks. This would enable us to clarify the length of time needed to achieve the therapeutic levels and would provide a clearer test of efficacy. We will also examine the mediating effects of craving, withdrawal symptoms, and gustatory sensation on abstinence, which would elucidate the mechanisms by which GLP-1 agonists enhance smoking abstinence. Last, we will examine other important abstinence-related outcomes, such as weight and glycemia, among others.</p><p>Overall, there are at least 2 aspects of this study that are highly important:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1)</label><p>This is the first clinical study to evaluate exenatide as potential treatment for nicotine dependence.
