Certain cereal foods which are rich in indigestible carbohydrates (DF and resistant starch, RS), e.g. barley kernels based products, appears to facilitate glucose regulation in a semi-acute perspective, e.g. after 10&#x02013;12 h (e.g. from an evening meal to a subsequent breakfast) <xref rid="pone.0059985-Thorburn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previously we reported that the benefits on blood glucose regulation were positively related to breath hydrogen excretion <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and plasma levels of butyrate <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson4" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, indicating a role of colonic fermentation. An additional finding was that perceived satiety correlated with breath hydrogen excretion <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This indicates that colonic fermentation of DF and RS may affect key parameters involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and satiety.</p><p>Epidemiological studies have linked bean consumption to lower risk of overweight and obesity. Among American adults, bean consumers displayed a 23% lower risk of obesity, and additionally displayed a lower systolic blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0059985-Papanikolaou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Studies in Brazilian adults have further indicated that a habitual diet including beans was associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity in both men (&#x02212;13% ) and women (&#x02212;14%) <xref rid="pone.0059985-Sichieri1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, intake of non-oil-seed pulses improved markers of long term glycaemic control <xref rid="pone.0059985-Sievenpiper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as judged from meta-analysis of medium to long-term studies, including both subjects with and without diabetes. However, whereas beans seem to prevent obesity, no acute benefits of pulses (navy beans) were seen on postprandial appetite or energy intake <xref rid="pone.0059985-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, the inverse relations between pulse consumption and obesity seen in epidemiological studies must be explained by other factors. The underlying mechanisms are yet unknown; however in addition to their low GI, legumes are good sources of indigestible carbohydrates such as DF, oligosaccharides and RS.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential prebiotic effects of indigestible carbohydrates in Swedish brown beans (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> var. <italic>nanus)</italic> in relation to cardiometabolic risk markers and appetite regulating hormones. For this purpose sixteen healthy young adults were provided a brown bean- or reference white wheat bread (WWB) evening meal, respectively, followed by a standardised breakfast, using a randomized cross over design. At fasting, and in the postprandial phase (0&#x02013;180 min) after the standardised breakfast, blood glucose, serum insulin, markers in blood of inflammatory tonus (Interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-18, adioponectin), appetite regulatory hormones (oxyntomodulin (OXM), ghrelin, PYY, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)), GLP-2, free fatty acids (FFA) and subjective appetite sensations were measured. In parallel, measures of colonic fermentative activity were determined from analysis of plasma short chain fatty acids ((SCFA), including also branched chain fatty acids (BCFA)) and breath hydrogen excretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The trial protocol for this study and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059985.s001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059985.s002">Checklist S1</xref>.

The serving sizes of beans and WWB were set in order to provide 35 g available starch. The amount of available starch was chosen to allow for a realistic meal size of beans. A pilot study indicated that a portion brown beans corresponding to 50 g available starch, commonly used for e.g. glycaemic index measurement, was not realistic for consumption as a late evening meal. However, due to the bulkiness of beans, glycaemic index measurements of bean products are performed at lower available carbohydrate levels e.g. 30 g <xref rid="pone.0059985-Tovar2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The evening meals were prepared by the test subjects in their home according to a detailed written description of the cooking and thawing procedure of the beans and WWB, respectively. The brown beans were soaked in water for 12 hours before being boiled. The beans were boiled for 30 min, and consumed directly after preparation. The WWB was baked according to a standardized procedure in a home baking machine (Severin model nr. BM 3983; Menu choice, program 2 [white bread, 1000 g, quick (time2&#x02236;35)]). The bread was made from 540 g of white wheat flour (Kungs&#x000f6;rnen Ab, J&#x000e4;rna, Sweden), 360 g water, 4.8 g dry yeast, 4.8 g NaCl. After cooling, the crust was removed, the bread was sliced and portions (89 g) were wrapped in aluminium foil, put into plastic bags and stored in a freezer (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C). The test subjects received a serving of frozen bread to be put in their freezer without any delay. At the day of consumption of the WWB, the test persons were instructed to thaw the bread at ambient temperature, still wrapped in aluminium foil and in the plastic bag. Water, optional amounts, was consumed with the test- and reference products.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Standardized Breakfast</title><p>A standardized breakfast was provided at the test days, consisted of a commercial white wheat bread corresponding to 50 g available carbohydrates with the crust removed (122 g Dollar storfranska, Lockarp, Sigvants bageri AB, Malm&#x000f6;, Sweden), and water (250 ml).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Physiological Test Variables</title><p>Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken for determination of blood glucose (HemoCue&#x000ae;B-glucose, HemoCue AB, &#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden).

</xref>. Participants were randomly assigned, by use of Excel &#x0201c;Random&#x0201d; formula, to start with beans or WWB. The subjects were encouraged to standardize their meal pattern, and to avoid food rich in DF the day before an experimental day. Furthermore, they should avoid alcohol and excessive physical exercise in the evening, and they should not have consumed antibiotics or probiotics for two weeks (no participants had consumed antibiotics during the last months). The test evening- and reference meals were consumed in a random order, separated by approximately one week. The experimental meals were consumed at 9 pm, and thereafter the subjects were fasting until the standardized breakfast. The subjects arrived at the experimental department (Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University) at approximately 07.45 the next morning, and an intravenous cannula (BD Venflon, Becton Dickinson, Helsingborg, Sweden) was inserted into an antecubital vein to be used for blood sampling. After 10 min resting in a sitting position, fasting blood tests were collected and subjective appetite sensations and breath H<sub>2</sub> registered, and thereafter the standardized breakfast was served. The breakfast was consumed within 10 to 12 minutes. Physiological test markers were measured repeatedly during 3 h. Blood glucose and appetite sensations were determined fasting and every 15 min during the first hour, and then every half hour until 180 min after start of the breakfast. Insulin was determined fasting and every half hour until 120 min. Breath hydrogen was determined at every half hour until 180 min post breakfast. Plasma ghrelin, p-PYY, p-OXM, and p-GLP-2 were determined at fasting and at 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, and p-Glp-1 was determined at fasting and at 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min. Serum IL-6, s-IL-18, and s-adiponectine were determined at fasting and at 60, 120, and 180 min. Serum FFA was determined at fasting and at 180 min, and SCFA at fasting and at 60 min. The subjects were told to maintain a low physical activity throughout the 3 hours of blood sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Calculations and Statistical Methods</title><p>Data are expressed as means &#x000b1; SEM. Incremental areas under the response curves (IAUC) for glucose and insulin, and areas under the curves (AUC) for GLP-1, ghrelin, and appetite sensations, were calculated for each subject and test meal, using the trapezoid model. GraphPad Prism (version 4 and 5, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for graph plotting and calculation of IAUC and AUC. The individual highest peak increase (Ipeak) in postprandial blood glucose concentration after the standardized breakfast was determined following each test meal, and the mean (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) was used in comparison of effects of evening meals on peak glucose responses. Significant differences in test variables after the different test meals were assessed with ANOVA (general linear model), in MINITAB Statistical Software (release 14; Minitab, Minitab Inc, State College, PA). In the cases of non-normal distributed data (tested with Anderson-Darling and considered unevenly distributed when <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), Box Cox transformation were performed on the data prior to the ANOVA. Differences between the products at different time points were evaluated using a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS release 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) with repeated measures and an autoregressive covariance structure. Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relation among dependent measures with the use of Pearson correlation in MINITAB Statistical Software (release 14; Minitab, Minitab Inc, State College, PA). For test variables where the variation in the concentration scarcely changed over time, a weighted mean were produced with means for each 60 min intervals. <italic>P</italic>-values &#x02264;0.05 were considered statistically significant, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Power Calculation</title><p>Primary outcome measure was change in blood glucose incremental area under the curve 0&#x02013;120 min (IAUC) after the standardised breakfast.

Also plasma GLP-2 levels were increased at breakfast when preceded by the brown beans evening meal. The over-night stimulation on appetite regulatory hormones following brown beans was accompanied by a decreased sensation of hunger. Breath H<sub>2</sub> concentrations, propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate were significantly increased (trend for butyrate) after brown beans compared to after WWB, indicating a higher colonic fermentative activity after brown beans.

However, the over-night suppressive effects on inflammatory markers, e.g. IL-6, was more evident with brown beans in comparison to barley kernels (&#x02212;35% versus &#x02212;17%, respectively). In contrast, in the current study no significant effects of a brown beans evening meal was seen in s-FFA or adiponectin, as previously seen with barley kernels.</p><p>The beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk variables previously seen at breakfast, following barley kernels evening meals, were proposed to originate from events related to colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Also brown beans are a rich source of indigestible and potentially prebiotic carbohydrates. In accordance with the increased breath H<sub>2</sub>- and SCFA concentrations it is likely that the beneficial effects seen after brown beans stem from gut microbial fermentation. The brown bean evening meal in the present study corresponded to a total load of 31 g DF, including RS and oligosaccharides, of which a high proportion is potentially fermentable in colon. In contrast to cereals, beans are rich in the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)); mainly raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose, resulting in 3.2 g RFO (mainly raffinose) in the evening meal with brown beans, compared with minute amounts of RFO in the WWB portion. In pigs <xref rid="pone.0059985-SmirickyTjardes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and in in vitro models of colonic fermentation <xref rid="pone.0059985-HernandezSalazar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059985-SmirickyTjardes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it has been shown that GOS increase the formation of propionate and butyrate.</p><p>It is possible that differences between e.g. barley kernels and brown beans in botanical integrity and composition of colonic substrates may affect the metabolism of the gut microbiota differently, thus explaining some of the differences seen in host metabolic responses. Both beans and cereals contain other bio active components which also may infer metabolic effects. However, the present study with beans confirm previous data with barley kernels suggesting benefits of evening meals rich in indigestible carbohydrates on key metabolic parameters in an over-night perspective.</p><p>In this study, a brown bean evening meal yielded substantial effects on satiety- and hunger hormones the next morning. Consequently, plasma PYY was increased by 51%, and ghrelin lowered by 14%, in comparison with the WWB evening meal. The concentrations of PYY in the morning after brown beans were inversely correlated to a decreased willingness to eat. The over-night effects on appetite sensations are an important finding, which may be useful in the dietary control and maintenance of a healthy weight. Previously, 2 weeks dietary supplementation with inulin (16 g/day) in healthy normal weighted subjects <xref rid="pone.0059985-Cani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> resulted in lowered hunger rates, increased satiety hormones (GLP-1 and PYY) and improved glucose tolerance. In addition, feeding oligofructose to obese mice for 14 weeks increased gut bifidobacteria <xref rid="pone.0059985-Cani2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The increase in bifidobacteria was accompanied by improved glucose regulation, a reduced inflammatory tonus, and increased breath H<sub>2</sub> excretion, indicating a prebiotic mechanism. The metabolic benefits obtained in mice fed with diets supplemented with pure fructooligosaccharides thus appear similar to those obtained in the current over-night study in healthy humans, indicating a prebiotic effect also of the intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates present in boiled brown beans. Consequently, it is possible that prebiotic benefits on metabolic risk variables may occur in an over-night perspective e.g. already within 11&#x02013;14 hours. To our knowledge, this is the first time prebiotic over-night effects of beans are reported in healthy subjects. The indigestible substrates that potentially may be responsible for the metabolic benefits in the present study include fermentable poly- and oligosaccharides, including RS and RFO. Also polyphenols, which are present in beans <xref rid="pone.0059985-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> may constitute a colonic substrate <xref rid="pone.0059985-Parkar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>In rats, GOS stimulated growth of bifidobacteria after 4 and 7 days, and promoted maintenance of the intestinal barrier function in rats with impaired barrier function <xref rid="pone.0059985-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The gut hormone GLP-2 has implication in gut barrier functions by reducing the intestine wall permeability to e.g. endotoxins. It has been shown in mice models that prebiotic (oligofructose) modulation of the gut microbiota improves intestinal barrier functions by mechanisms involving GLP-2; resulting in reduced endotoxaemia and systemic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0059985-Cani3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Low-grade chronic systemic inflammation is associated with obesity and insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0059985-Wellen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A diet induced increase in endotoxemia and increased low grade inflammation has been demonstrated in mice models when fed with a high fat diet for 4 weeks <xref rid="pone.0059985-Cani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The increase in endotoxemia was accompanied by an increased proportion of an LPS-containing microbiota <xref rid="pone.0059985-Cani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, the present study revealed an increase in p-GLP-2 at breakfast after an evening meal with brown beans, and a concomitant decrease in plasma of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and IL-18). The relationships between gut microflora and lowered inflammation previously seen in mice makes it feasible to suggest that the decreased concentrations of inflammatory markers obtained in the present study in part may be related to an improved gut barrier, involving increased GLP-2.</p><p>The gut peptides GLP-1, GLP-2 and oxyntomoduline are proglucagon derived peptides, secreted from intestinal L-cells in the small intestine and colon. Although not proglucagon derived, also PYY are secreted from L-cells in the gut. The gut peptides play an important role in energy homeostasis, e.g. glucose- and appetite regulation <xref rid="pone.0059985-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059985-Dalvi1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. GLP-1 and PYY are considered anti-diabetic and anti-obesity hormones, and GLP-1-based therapies are currently used as a novel treatment for type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0059985-Ahren1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The present and previous <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nilsson3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> studies show that release of gut peptides are affected by choice of diet, and increased by certain indigestible colonic substrates. Dietary stimulation of endogenous gut peptide secretion thus may be a promising approach for prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. All together the present study shows that, within a time frame of 11&#x02013;14 h, brown beans are potent in this respect. No effects of brown beans were however detected on GLP-1 concentrations in the current study, despite the significant effects obtained on other gut peptides also released, or even co-secreted, from L-cells <xref rid="pone.0059985-Baggio1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>BCFA are involved in the regulation of intestinal Na absorption, and contribute to some extent to intestinal energy supply <xref rid="pone.0059985-Nyangale1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059985-Musch1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, the role of BCFA produced by the gut microbiota in relation to systemic metabolism is poorly elucidated. On the contrary, several metabolic effects have been suggested for SCFA. In rats fed RS for 10 days, GLP-1 and PYY secretion were stimulated, and it was shown that bacterial fermentation and production of SCFA in the gut were associated with increased proglucagon and PYY gene expression <xref rid="pone.0059985-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. SCFA are produced during colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates, and in addition to providing energy to colonic enterocytes, SCFA also function as signaling molecules. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that SCFA produced by bacterial fermentation may trigger signalling cascades through acting on SCFA receptors (FFAR2 and FFAR3) on L-cells (in vitro model), resulting in increased release of gut peptides such as GLP-1 and PYY <xref rid="pone.0059985-Tolhurst1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The increase in PYY concentrations seen in the present study can thus be suggested to result from the increased production of SCFA. SCFA receptors are not only found in the intestine, but are expressed also in e.g. immune cells and human white adipose tissues <xref rid="pone.0059985-AlLahham1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are closely associated with chronic inflammation, predominately in adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0059985-Hotamisligil1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In adipose tissue, propionate has been found to be a ligand for the SCFA-SCFA receptors <xref rid="pone.0059985-AlLahham1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and in an adipose tissue cell culture, propionate was shown to have anti-inflammatory effects <xref rid="pone.0059985-AlLahham2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The effects were accompanied by improved expression of lipoprotein lipase and GLUT4. These effects on adipocytes in cell culture provide a link between colonic fermentation- and anti-diabetic effects, and are coherent with the presently reported results in humans.</p><p>The present study had certain limitations. An evident constraint is the unbalanced gender participation since 10 out of the 16 participants were women. However, an ANOVA calculations of glucose IAUC (primary outcome) revealed that there were no main effects of gender, or gender*treatment interactions (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The study design was an &#x0201c;over-night&#x0201d; study to investigate effects of the test product in an 11&#x02013;14 h perspective. The design was set in part to overcome the inconvenience it may have caused the participants of staying at the experimental department over a whole day (from morning to evening). The over-night metabolic effects seen on the test variables can probably partly be generalised to concern similar metabolic effects if the test product was consumed in the morning, and test variables determined in a similar time perspective over the day.</p><p>In summary, it was shown that an evening meal of boiled brown beans, in comparison with WWB, have beneficial effects on glucose regulation, satiety, and inflammatory markers at a following standardized breakfast. Plasma propionate and isobutyrate were significantly increased after brown beans compared to after WWB. The study indicates that colonic fermentation of intrinsic indigestible carbohydrates present in certain foods, e.g. in brown beans, may constitute a mechanism for a promising approach aiming at dietary prevention and/or treatment of obesity and the metabolic syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0059985.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
