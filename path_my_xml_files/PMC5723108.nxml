However, the pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction was not clear by the coadministration of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe. This study investigated the pharmacodynamic (PD) and PK interactions between rosuvastatin and ezetimibe through a crossover clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>A randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover study with two treatment parts was conducted in healthy male subjects. Study part A involved rosuvastatin, and study part B involved ezetimibe. A total of 25 subjects in both parts completed the PK and PD evaluations. Rosuvastatin (20 mg) or ezetimibe (10 mg) was administered once daily for 7 days as monotherapy or co-therapy. The plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, total ezetimibe and free ezetimibe were measured for 72 h after day 7. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) were investigated for the PD assessments on day 1 (pretreatment) and day 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe presented multiple peaks. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios for the peak plasma concentration at steady state (C<sub>max,ss</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve during the dosing interval at steady state (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub>) of rosuvastatin and total ezetimibe were within the range 0.8&#x02013;1.25. However, the coadministration increased the systemic exposure of free ezetimibe. In the PD assessments, rosuvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapy reduced the LDL-C and TC levels effectively. In addition, the lipid-lowering effects of the coadministration corresponded to an approximate summation of the effects of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapy. However, no significant changes in HDL-C were observed with rosuvastatin or ezetimibe treatment. No significant safety issue was noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The coadministration of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe revealed a bioequivalent PK interaction. Additional lipid-lowering effects, including decreased LDL-C and TC, were observed as expected in combination therapy without significant safety concern.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>drug interaction</kwd><kwd>rosuvastatin</kwd><kwd>ezetimibe</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Statins are used as a first-choice treatment in lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, approximately one-third of statin-treated patients experience difficulty in reaching their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals because of poor compliance, variability in drug response, inadequate titration of applied doses and safety issues associated with higher doses.<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Among statins, rosuvastatin is the most efficacious and is relatively safe, with low rates of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and renal failure.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Because of its high hydrophilicity, hepatoselectivity and low systemic bioavailability, rosuvastatin is minimally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system and is likely excreted mainly by organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP 1B1).<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that blocks the transport of dietary and biliary cholesterol from the small intestine.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> After oral intake, ezetimibe is biotransformed to ezetimibe glucuronide, which is an active metabolite in the intestinal mucosa and liver.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Regarding the pharmacological activity in the blockade of cholesterol absorption, ezetimibe glucuronide is more potent than the parent drug.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The beneficial effects of ezetimibe combination therapy with statins have been demonstrated in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease or a severely high LDL-C level.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, one report demonstrated that when rosuvastatin was coadministered with ezetimibe in healthy hypercholesterolemic subjects, an additional LDL-C-lowering effect could be expected compared to that with rosuvastatin monotherapy and ezetimibe monotherapy, without a significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, since this result was obtained in a small, parallel-group study, the PK interaction did not meet the bioequivalence acceptance criteria.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The aim of the current study was to evaluate the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions between rosuvastatin and ezetimibe in healthy Korean male subjects after multiple oral administrations through a crossover clinical study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population and design</title><p>Healthy male subjects between 19 and 45 years of age and within &#x000b1;20% of their ideal body weight were eligible if they did not have clinically significant medical histories, physical examination findings, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) readings or clinical laboratory testing results.

Both study part A and study part B were randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover studies and were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Korean Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registry number: NCT02289430). In total, 56 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two sequences (28 in each). In study part A, rosuvastatin (20 mg) or rosuvastatin (20 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) were administered once daily for 7 days. In study part B, ezetimibe (10 mg) or rosuvastatin (20 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) were administered once daily for 7 days. A 14-day washout period was required between the dosing periods. The subjects received the study drug during outpatient visits for 6 days. The last dose was given during a 2-day hospitalization period, and the PK assessment was then conducted. The subjects were given the study drugs with 240 mL of water while in a fasting state.</p></sec><sec><title>PK assessment</title><p>Blood samples at steady state (day 7) were collected prior to dosing (0 h) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post-dosing to evaluate the plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, free ezetimibe and total ezetimibe (free ezetimibe and ezetimibe glucuronide). Blood samples were obtained in K2-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The separated plasma was frozen and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>For the analysis of rosuvastatin, 300 &#x003bc;L of plasma sample was mixed with 100 &#x003bc;L of sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.0, 0.2 M). After the addition of 20 &#x003bc;L of internal standard (rosuvastatin-d6 sodium salt) solution (200 ng/mL) into 200 &#x003bc;L of this mixture, the mixture was extracted with 1.2 mL of methyl <italic>tert</italic>-butyl ether for 20 min and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The organic phase was dried with nitrogen gas, and the residue was dissolved in 150 &#x003bc;L of mobile phase and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shiseido Nanospace SI-2 system; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS, TSQ Quantum Discovery MAX; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ionization mode were used for the quantitative analysis of rosuvastatin with an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was performed at 40&#x000b0;C using a Unison UK-C18 column (75&#x000d7;2.0 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m; Imtakt, Kyoto, Japan) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile:deionized water:formic acid (45:55:0.1, v/v/v). The detection range for rosuvastatin was 0.5&#x02013;300 ng/mL. The intrabatch precision and accuracy of the quality control samples were less than 15.7% and 93.7%&#x02013;107.5%, respectively. The corresponding interbatch values were less than 10.5% and 94.2%&#x02013;105.4%, respectively.</p><p>For the analysis of free ezetimibe, 100 &#x003bc;L of plasma sample and 20 &#x003bc;L of internal standard (ezetimibe-d4) solution (100 ng/mL) were mixed and extracted with 1 mL of methyl <italic>tert</italic>-butyl ether for 20 min. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, the separated organic phase was dried with nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved in 500 &#x003bc;L acetonitrile and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and then 5 &#x003bc;L of supernatant was injected into liquid chromatography&#x02013;MS/MS system. For total ezetimibe, 100 &#x003bc;L of plasma sample and 10 &#x003bc;L of internal standard (ezetimibe-d4) solution (5,000 ng/mL) were transferred to a polypropylene tube. Then, 75 &#x003bc;L of sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M, pH 5.0 with acetic acid) and 15 &#x003bc;L of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase were added. After vortexing for 15 s, the mixture was incubated at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min. In addition, 75 &#x003bc;L of sodium borate solution (0.1 M) was added into the tube. The solution was extracted with 1 mL of methyl <italic>tert</italic>-butyl ether for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The organic phase was dried with nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved in 500 &#x003bc;L acetonitrile and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.</p><p>The plasma concentrations of total ezetimibe were measured with an HPLC&#x02013;MS system, which consisted of a Nanospace 5200A spectrometer (Nasca; Shiseido) and a triple-quadrupole linear ion trap MS system (6500 Q-Trap; AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).</p><p>The detection range for total ezetimibe was 0.5&#x02013;500 ng/mL. The intrabatch precision and accuracy of the quality control samples were less than 9.4% and 90.8%&#x02013;100.4%, respectively. The corresponding interbatch values were less than 6.9% and 94.1%&#x02013;95.2%, respectively.</p><p>The plasma concentrations of free ezetimibe were measured with an HPLC&#x02013;MS system consisting of a Shimadzu Prominence instrument (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a triple-quadrupole linear ion trap MS system (API5000; AB Sciex). The detection range for total ezetimibe was 0.2&#x02013;200 ng/mL. The intrabatch precision and accuracy of the quality control samples were less than 5.3% and 95.0%&#x02013;105.9%, respectively, and the corresponding interbatch values were less than 5.0% and 95.6%&#x02013;103.7%, respectively. The chromatographic separations of both ezetimibe and total ezetimibe were performed at 40&#x000b0;C using a Unison UK-C18 column (75&#x000d7;2.0 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m; Imtakt) with a mobile phase of 5 mM ammonium acetate:acetonitrile (35:65, v/v). The accuracy of short-term stability at room temperature and long-term stability at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C for plasma rosuvastatin, ezetimibe and total ezetimibe was within 85%&#x02013;115%. The precision of short-term stability and long-term stability for these three analytes were under 15%.</p></sec><sec><title>PD assessment</title><p>Blood samples for the measurement of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) were obtained pre-dose (day 1) and at steady state (day 8). Blood (5 mL) was collected in serum separator tubes and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. The serum levels of LDL-C, HDL-C and TC were determined by the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Gachon University Gil Medical Center using an ADVIA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Chemistry XPT System (Global Siemens Headquarters, Munich, Germany). The detection ranges for LDL-C, HDL-C and TC were 0&#x02013;1,000 mg/dL, 5&#x02013;115 mg/dL and 10&#x02013;675 mg/dL, and the intra-assay coefficients of variation were 0.5%&#x02013;0.6%, 1.1%&#x02013;1.5% and 0.5%&#x02013;0.6%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>PK and PD analyses</title><p>The primary PK parameters (peak plasma concentration at steady state [C<sub>max,ss</sub>] and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve during the dosing interval at steady state [AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub>]) for rosuvastatin, ezetimibe and total ezetimibe were estimated based on the non-compartmental method of WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 6.4 (Pharsight Co., Cary, NC, USA). C<sub>max,ss</sub> was directly obtained from the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles. AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> was calculated using the linear-up/log-down trapezoidal method. The slope of the terminal log-linear phase in the plasma concentration&#x02013;time profile was used as the elimination rate constant (&#x003bb;z), which was estimated by a least-squares linear regression. The terminal elimination half-life at steady state (t<sub>1/2,ss</sub>) was determined as ln(2)/&#x003bb;z. Log-transformed C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> were analyzed to evaluate the PK interaction. The mean difference between treatments was back-transformed to calculate the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the GMRs. The GMRs of C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> between the treatments were estimated with a linear mixed-effects model that included sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. If the two-sided 90% CIs for the GMRs between mono- and co-therapy were within the range 0.80&#x02013;1.25, the drug interaction was considered insignificant.</p><p>The lipid-lowering effects of rosuvastatin or ezetimibe monotherapy and co-therapy on LDL-C, HDL-C and TC were also compared in a mixed-effect model based on the percent changes in the lipid profiles from baseline (pre-dose) to steady state. Statistical significance was considered at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was applied for these evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>Safety and tolerability were investigated via spontaneous reporting and inquiries regarding adverse events (AEs). Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG and laboratory tests, such as hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis, were also performed for tolerability monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>In each part of the study, 28 subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two sequences.

None of the subjects withdrew from this clinical study due to AEs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Statin combination therapies with ezetimibe are commonly considered to control blood cholesterol for the successful management of cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Indeed, in a previous study, the coadministration of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe was effectively reported to reduce LDL-C and TC levels without a significant PK interaction in a small number of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, the primary PK parameters, including C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>, did not satisfy the bioequivalence criteria.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This multiple-dose, crossover clinical study presented quantitative information about the PK and PD interactions between rosuvastatin and ezetimibe at steady state in healthy Korean subjects with sufficient power.</p><p>In the current study, a once-daily dose of rosuvastatin administered for 7 days resulted in multiple peaks of plasma concentration, with a terminal half-life of 10.4&#x02013;12.2 h and a mean accumulation ratio at steady state of 1.3&#x02013;1.4.

Since the multiple peaks of free ezetimibe caused by enterohepatic recirculation were more remarkable than those found for total ezetimibe, the terminal half-life and accumulation ratio of free ezetimibe could not be determined.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mean systemic exposure of free ezetimibe based on the AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> was 13.6%&#x02013;14.5% of total ezetimibe. When ezetimibe was administered in combination with rosuvastatin, rosuvastatin increased the systemic exposure of free ezetimibe. However, the 90% CIs of the GMRs for both the C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> of total ezetimibe were within the range 0.8&#x02013;1.25 (ie, the bioequivalence limits). In terms of pharmacological activity, total ezetimibe was considered the primary end point to evaluate the drug interaction instead of free ezetimibe because ezetimibe glucuronide, the metabolite of ezetimibe, is as potent as the unchanged form in the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Consequently, the PK interaction between rosuvastatin and ezetimibe was not significant and satisfied the bioequivalence criteria.</p><p>Rosuvastatin is mainly eliminated unchanged in feces, and ~10% of the oral dose undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 2C19.<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Because the major metabolite, <italic>N</italic>-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is produced primarily by CYP 2C9, exhibits one-sixth to one-half of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition of rosuvastatin, the drug interactions of the metabolically mediated drug may be clinically insignificant.<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In contrast, more than 80% of ezetimibe is metabolized to pharmacologically active ezetimibe glucuronide in the intestine and liver.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, 1A3 and 2B15 are responsible for the glucuronidation of ezetimibe.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the metabolic pathway of rosuvastatin, glucuronidation was found to be partially involved in the metabolism of statins, possibly resulting in PK interactions between rosuvastatin and the glucuronidation-metabolized drug.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, the competitive inhibition of glucuronidation, which is a common metabolic pathway, may contribute to the increased exposure of free ezetimibe. The overall PK interaction between ezetimibe and rosuvastatin was not significant due to either the existence of multiple clearance pathways or the extensive capacity of UGT enzymes.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>PD effects were investigated through changes in LDL-C, HDL-C and TC according to the PK interaction. At steady state, the coadministration of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe exerted significant lipid-lowering effects on LDL-C and TC. The coadministration led to reductions in LDL-C that were 19.4% and 41.3% greater than those achieved with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapies, respectively. For TC, co-therapy led to reductions that were 10.3% and 26.4% greater than those observed for rosuvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapies, respectively. These enhanced effects observed for co-therapy were similar to the summed effects of the corresponding monotherapies studied in the opposite part of the clinical trial. Rosuvastatin exerts lipid-lowering effects through the competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol uptake by binding to a specific transport protein, including Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, in the wall of the small intestine.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These lipid-lowering mechanisms were independent between rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, and thus, the coadministration of these drugs can produce additive effects in the reduction of LDL-C and TC.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Regarding HDL-C, it did not show a significant change at steady state after either co-therapy or monotherapy and no difference was found between the individual monotherapies and co-therapy. Although a modest increase in HDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia was reported in some previous studies of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, meaningful effects on HDL-C were not detected in this study of healthy subjects.<xref rid="b17-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-3461" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At steady state, rosuvastatin and ezetimibe showed no significant interaction in terms of tolerability or PK and PD profiles. The extents of LDL-C and TC reduction were additive with the coadministration of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe. Therefore, in our crossover clinical trial, combination therapy with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe resulted in additive lipid-lowering effects with PK bioequivalence, as expected.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Navipharm Co., Ltd, Suwon, Korea, supported by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) and funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant numbers: HI17C1919 and HI14C2750).
