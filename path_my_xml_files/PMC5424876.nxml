Symptoms of GERD include heartburn and acid regurgitation, which can severely reduce quality of life in patients. The prevalence and chronic nature of the disease also constitute a significant burden on the healthcare systems and economies of affected countries. GERD can be classified into two broad categories: nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and erosive esophagitis (EE). EE is characterized by injury to the esophageal mucosa, which results from exposure to refluxate [<xref rid="bibr1-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Altomare <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>].</p><p>The severity of the mucosal injury can be graded according to criteria outlined in the Los Angeles (LA) Classification system using endoscopic examination [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Lundell <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>].</p><p>Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the standard treatment for EE, owing to their high efficacy for EE healing [<xref rid="bibr4-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Cicala <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>]. Despite the effectiveness of PPIs, a significant proportion of patients with EE have been shown to be resistant to PPI treatment. Approximately 10&#x02013;15% of patients do not achieve complete healing following 8 weeks of treatment with PPIs [<xref rid="bibr11-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Maradey-Romero and Fass, 2014</xref>]. Despite continued treatment with PPIs, 15&#x02013;23% of EE patients with LA grades A and B and 24&#x02013;41% of EE patients with LA grades C and D experience a relapse within 6 months [<xref rid="bibr11-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Maradey-Romero and Fass, 2014</xref>]. It has been suggested that insufficient acid inhibition is a major reason for the lack of EE healing observed in some patients. Of note, some PPIs are able to provide effective acid inhibition during the day, but have been found to be less effective overnight [<xref rid="bibr13-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Morelli <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>].</p><p>Vonoprazan (TAK-438) is a novel, potassium-competitive acid blocker developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Vonoprazan has a different mechanism of action and a number of advantages compared with PPIs; it does not require an acidic environment for activation, it is acid stable, and it has been shown to rapidly exert an acid-inhibitory effect (PPIs require 3&#x02013;5 days for maximal effect). Preclinical studies demonstrated that the acid inhibition achieved by vonoprazan was more potent and longer lasting than that with PPIs [<xref rid="bibr6-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Hori <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bibr7-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Matsukawa <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Importantly, recent clinical trials have also shown vonoprazan to be noninferior to the PPI lansoprazole in terms of EE healing [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>]. Furthermore, Ashida and coworkers showed that at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg, vonoprazan was more effective than lansoprazole in some patients with severe EE (LA grades C/D) [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. This suggests that vonoprazan may be useful for treating patients with EE who have not completely responded to standard doses of PPIs.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effects and the efficacy of vonoprazan at two different doses (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with PPI-resistant EE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-1756283X17705329"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section7-1756283X17705329"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effects and the efficacy of vonoprazan (20 mg and 40 mg) in patients with PPI-resistant EE.

These changes were measured as the percentage of time the pH was &#x02265;4, referred to as the pH 4 holding time ratio (HTR). Gastroesophageal pH monitoring of patients (over a 24-hour period) was carried out twice; once on the day before the end of the run-in period (following at least 6 days of receiving lansoprazole), constituting the baseline and once 2 weeks after the start of the treatment period (following at least 7 days of vonoprazan treatment). Gastroesophageal pH was measured for at least 24 hours using a glass pH electrode (CM-200W; Chemical Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) and a pH monitor (PH-101ZG; Chemical Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The catheter-guided pH electrode was calibrated using standard pH 4 and pH 7 solutions before being inserted transnasally into the patient&#x02019;s stomach; correct positioning of the probe was confirmed by X-ray.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1756283X17705329"><title>Evaluation of efficacy</title><p>The secondary endpoint of the study was the EE healing rate after 8 weeks of treatment with vonoprazan. Healing was defined as having no endoscopically confirmed mucosal breaks. The EE healing rate was defined as the percentage of patients with endoscopically confirmed EE healing, as decided by the investigator. Photographs of each patient&#x02019;s esophagus under fasting conditions was examined by the investigator, who graded the severity of the EE according to the LA classification system. In this study, no mucosal break was classified as grade 0. Patients were enrolled in the study based on the assessment of the severity of their EE at baseline by the investigator. A central adjudication committee (CAC) also assessed and graded the severity of EE in patients at baseline, according to the LA classification system. The analysis of healing rate excluded patients for whom baseline EE was classified as grade 0 by the CAC. However, the originally planned healing rate analysis was to have been conducted using the investigator-determined classifications of EE grade.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1756283X17705329"><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>Safety variables assessed included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory test values, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, vital signs, and levels of serum gastrin and pepsinogen I/II.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1756283X17705329"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 10 patients per group (20 in total) was planned for evaluation of the primary endpoint; the sample size for this study was based on what was considered feasible and was not statistically derived.

For the primary endpoint, the gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs and their changes from baseline were described using descriptive statistics and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each group. The point estimate of the difference in change from baseline between groups (40 mg group&#x02013;20 mg group) was calculated for gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs with 95% CIs using an analysis of variance with treatment group as a fixed effect. The analyses of gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs over the 24-hour period were also repeated for the same measurements made during the two 12-hour periods. For the secondary endpoint, the point estimate and two-sided 95% CI of the healing rate were calculated.

This study demonstrated that vonoprazan at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg can effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion over 24 hours. Indication of the efficacy of vonoprazan was suggested by EE healing rates of 44.4% (4/9 patients) and 55.6% (5/9 patients) in the 20 mg and 40 mg groups, respectively. Vonoprazan was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with all TEAEs being mild or moderate in severity. Together, these results indicate that vonoprazan could be an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with EE that is resistant to PPIs.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the fact that it was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, and the fact that the presence of PPI-resistant EE in each patient was confirmed by endoscopy. Furthermore, data on both efficacy (healing rate) and gastroesophageal pH levels were recorded for each patient, allowing a closer examination of the association between acid inhibition and healing of PPI-resistant EE. This study was limited by the small sample size and the lack of a placebo or active control arm. Although the natural healing of reflux esophagitis after failure of PPI is possible, the acid-suppressive effects seen with vonoprazan in this study suggest that our findings are unlikely to be spurious. Another limitation is the fact that efficacy was based solely on the proportion of patients demonstrating complete healing of mucosal breaks. Moreover, the interpretation of the results was complicated by discrepancies between the investigator&#x02019;s and the CAC&#x02019;s endoscopic assessment of LA Grade at baseline.</p><p>It has been suggested that the persistence of EE despite PPI treatment is due to insufficient inhibition of gastric acid. At both doses, patients treated with vonoprazan in this study were able to achieve 24-hour pH 4 HTRs of 90% or greater after 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1756283X17705329">Table 2</xref>). These results are similar to those observed in phase I studies of vonoprazan in healthy male subjects in Japan and the United Kingdom (UK), as described by Jenkins and coworkers [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. At day 7, 24-hour pH &#x0003e; 4 HTRs of 83.4% and 100% were observed for subjects in Japan receiving 20 mg and 40 mg of vonoprazan, respectively [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. For subjects in the UK, 24-hour pH &#x0003e; 4 HTRs of 85.2% and 93.2% were observed for subjects receiving 20 mg and 40 mg of vonoprazan, respectively [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>].</p><p>Similar results were also observed in a cross-over study comparing vonoprazan with esomeprazole and rabeprazole in healthy male subjects in Japan, as described by Sakurai and coworkers [<xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]; vonoprazan was shown to result in 24-hour pH 4 HTRs of 85.8% or greater at day 7. Given that previous studies showing effective acid inhibition by vonoprazan (as demonstrated by pH 4 HTRs) were carried out in healthy subjects [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>], the results of this study indicate that the acid-inhibitory effects of vonoprazan are similar in patients with PPI-resistant EE.</p><p>Vonoprazan has also been shown to inhibit gastric acid secretion throughout the night in both PPI-resistant EE patients as well as in healthy subjects [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. In the present study, inhibition of gastric acid by vonoprazan was maintained throughout the night, with pH 4 HTRs of 93% or greater being observed between 12 and 24 hours (9 pm&#x02013;9 am, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1756283X17705329">Table 2</xref>). In the phase I study of vonoprazan by Jenkins and coworkers, pH &#x0003e; 4 HTRs for 20 mg of vonoprazan were between 73.0% and 75.4% throughout the night [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]; in the cross-over study comparing vonoprazan with esomeprazole and rabeprazole, pH 4 HTRs for 20 mg of vonoprazan were between 75.2% and 88.8% throughout the night [<xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. The intragastric pH values of both EE patients and healthy subjects have been observed to follow a circadian pattern, with the pH decreasing during the nocturnal fasting period (the first part of the night) [<xref rid="bibr16-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Zentilin <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>]. Although PPIs are able to effectively control gastric pH during the day, markedly lower pH 4 HTRs have been observed at night-time in patients treated with PPIs [<xref rid="bibr13-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Morelli <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. Maintaining acid inhibition throughout the night is important, as this increases gastric and esophageal pH 4 HTRs, which in turn correlates with improved healing of EE [<xref rid="bibr9-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Katz <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. An especially low intragastric pH during the night-time period may also be a good predictor of low EE healing rate [<xref rid="bibr15-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Yuan and Hunt, 2010</xref>].</p><p>Given that vonoprazan resulted in high (&#x0003e;80%) pH 4 HTRs in this study, as well as in previous studies [<xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>], it was predicted that vonoprazan would be successful in healing the PPI-resistant EE in these patients. Previous studies in patients with EE have shown that treatment with vonoprazan, even with doses as low as 5 mg, resulted in healing rates of &#x0003e;92% after 4 weeks [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>]. Following 8 weeks of treatment with 20 mg of vonoprazan, the healing rate was 99% [<xref rid="bibr2-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>]. Vonoprazan, at both 20 mg and 40 mg, was also shown to be noninferior to lansoprazole 30 mg in terms of efficacy [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>].</p><p>In this study, both doses of vonoprazan were effective in healing PPI-resistant EE, albeit at lower healing rates than observed for patients with EE. The moderate overall healing rate observed may be partly explained by the small sample size, which was reduced further by the fact that the healing analysis excluded a significant proportion (32%) of patients who were classified by the CAC as having no mucosal breaks at baseline (the investigator had classified these same patients as having Grades A&#x02013;D EE at baseline). Vonoprazan did appear to increase gastric pH in nonhealed patients, so factors other than effects on pH may have contributed to lack of healing. Possible reasons for the lack of observed healing may include reflux of bile juices and atypical presentation of EE (e.g. mucosal break in the middle of the esophagus).</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that some patients with PPI-resistant EE derive clinical benefit from treatment with vonoprazan. This is especially important given the limited treatment options for patients with PPI-resistant EE; vonoprazan may be a viable treatment for this subset of patients with EE. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>Vonoprazan was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, which has also been observed in several other studies. In previous trials, vonoprazan was well tolerated, with most TEAEs being mild or moderate in intensity [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr2-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic><italic>et al</italic></italic>. 2016</xref>]. Elevated levels of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and pepsinogen II, resulting from vonoprazan treatment, have also been observed in previous studies [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">Ashida <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-1756283X17705329" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, vonoprazan at doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was found to effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion over a 24-hour period, both during the daytime and night-time, and resulted in the healing of EE in some patients who had failed previous treatment with a PPI. Vonoprazan had a favorable safety and tolerability profile and may be considered a viable treatment option for patients with EE that is resistant to PPIs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants, as well as the following investigators: Kenji Furuta (currently at Otsu Medical Clinic, Izumo, Japan, and formerly of Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Japan); Takahisa Furuta (Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan); Norihisa Ishimura (Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Japan); Ryuichi Iwakiri (Saga Medical School, Saga, Japan); Noriyuki Kawami (Department of Gastroenterology, Nippon Medical School, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan); Tomoyuki Koike (Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan); Nobutoshi Kuniyoshi (Kuniyoshi Hospital, Kochi, Japan) and Shinichi Takahashi (Kyorin University School of Medicine, Mitaka, Japan).
