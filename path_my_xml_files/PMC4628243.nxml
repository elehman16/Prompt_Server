Current recommendations for dietary management of people with MetS involve quantitative and qualitative modifications of food intake, such as high consumption of vegetables, fruits, and whole grain foods. The results from our previous human trials revealed the potential of the dietary components high-oleic acid canola oil (HOCO)-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and high molecular weight barley &#x003b2;-glucan individually in managing CVD risk factors. Foods with a combination of HOCO-DHA and barley &#x003b2;-glucan have never been tested for their effects on CVD risk. The objective is to determine the effects of consuming novel foods HOCO-DHA, and barley &#x003b2;-glucan on managing CVD risk factors in people with MetS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We are conducting a randomized, single-blind crossover trial with four treatment phases of 28&#x000a0;days each separated by a 4-week washout interval. Participants (n=35) will be provided with weight-maintaining, healthy balanced diet recommendations according to their energy requirements during the intervention periods. Participants will receive muffins and cookies as treatment foods in a random order and will consume at least one meal per day at the research center under supervision. The four treatments include muffins and cookies consisting of (1) all-purpose flour and HOCO-DHA (50&#x000a0;g/day); (2) barley flour (4.36&#x000a0;g/day of &#x003b2;-glucan) and a blend of sunflower oil, safflower oil, and butter as control oil (50&#x000a0;g/day); (3) barley flour (4.36&#x000a0;g/day of &#x003b2;-glucan) and HOCO-DHA (50&#x000a0;g/day; dosage of DHA would be 3&#x000a0;g/day); and (4) all-purpose flour and control oil (50&#x000a0;g/day). At the beginning and end of each phase, we will evaluate anthropometrics; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; blood lipid profile; low-density lipoprotein subfractions and particle size; 10-year Framingham CVD risk score; inflammatory status; and plasma and red blood cell fatty acid profiles, fecal microbiome, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cholesterol synthesis will also be studied, using a stable isotope approach.

In North America, 34&#x000a0;% of the adult population are affected by MetS, and MetS occurrence is even higher in other parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, MetS has become a significant public health concern and a burden on the global health care system, as this disorder is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and related health care costs.</p><p>Current recommendations for dietary management in people with high risk for MetS involve quantitative and qualitative modifications in food intake, such as higher consumption of vegetables, fruits and whole grain food components with their inherent bioactive composition. More specifically, the presence of Mediterranean dietary components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], amounts of long chain n-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], types and amounts of carbohydrates and dietary fiber content, are some dietary elements reported to show remarkable positive effects in the management of MetS. Important components include high-oleic acid canola oil (HOCO), barley &#x003b2;-glucan, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</p><p>Canola oil is derived from canola seed, which is obtained from a bright yellow flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Canola oil is considered the third-largest vegetable oil by sales volume after palm and soybean oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Canola&#x02019;s nutritional profile includes a low level (7&#x000a0;%) of saturated fatty acids; significant amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with 61&#x000a0;% oleic acid, 21&#x000a0;% linoleic acid, and 11&#x000a0;% &#x003b1;-linolenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; plant sterols (PSs) (0.53&#x02013;0.97&#x000a0;%); and tocopherols (700&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;ppm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Canola oil has proven efficacy in preventing and/or managing chronic ailments, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result, in 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim for canola oil suggesting that canola oil may help reduce the risk of CVD when substituted for saturated fat in the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>MUFAs, one of the components of canola oil, help reduce CVD risk by lowering blood pressure, blood total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels; inhibiting LDL-C oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; and improving glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Oleic acid&#x02013;enriched canola oil was developed to enhance the health benefits of canola oil related to CVD risk reduction. Its health benefits were compared with regular canola oil in humans in a randomized crossover human trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In that trial, consumption of HOCO for 28&#x000a0;days was shown to lead to reductions in TC and LDL-C levels and LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) values, as compared with regular canola oil and a control diet without HOCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results of a recently completed multicenter randomized controlled trial done at our laboratory validated these findings. In that study, the serum triglycerides (TGs) and 10-year Framingham risk scores, TC/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C ratios, and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced, and HDL was increased, after consumption of HOCO-DHA compared with regular canola and control diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Consumption of fiber has been indicated to reduce the mortality rate in high-risk CVD populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. &#x003b2;-glucan is a polysaccharide found mainly in yeast, mushrooms, oats, and barley in the form of fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. &#x003b2;-glucan fibers are located mainly in the endosperm cell walls of cereals. Among cereals, barley and oats are the richest sources of &#x003b2;-glucan, containing 4.0&#x02013;7.0&#x000a0;% and 2.2&#x02013;7.8&#x000a0;% wt/wt of &#x003b2;-glucan, respectively, compared with other cereals, such as rye and wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similarly to canola oil, &#x003b2;-glucan has gained significant attention among nutritional researchers because it has been shown to have potentially health-promoting effects in animal and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Consequently, in 1997, the FDA approved a health claim regarding &#x003b2;-glucan from whole oats for reducing the risk of heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More recently, the European Food Safety Authority and Health Canada approved similar health claims for foods containing oats or barley &#x003b2;-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In agreement with the previous studies, we also demonstrated the beneficial effects of high molecular weight &#x003b2;-glucan in healthy adults in a recent randomized, controlled-diet, crossover trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35). The results showed that consumption of 3&#x000a0;g or 5&#x000a0;g per day of high molecular weight barley &#x003b2;-glucan is highly effective in reducing TC and LDL cholesterol in adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Long-chain PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA from fish and marine source oils, including algal oil, have commercially emerged as dietary supplements due to their health benefits. Long-chain fatty acids, including DHA, were shown to lower TG and increase serum HDL-C concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. DHA is also capable of acting as an antiatherogenic factor by inhibiting inflammatory processes and thereby inhibiting plaque formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. On the basis of the vast amount of knowledge accumulated over the years, the American Heart Association has recommended the use of n-3 fatty acids, including DHA, for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with documented coronary artery disease.</p><p>Considering the fact that CVD is a multifactorial disease, the dietary approaches that combine different bioactives with enhanced health benefits have recently been well elucidated. For instance, a portfolio containing a low-fat vegetarian diet enriched by the inclusion of PSs, soy protein, viscous fiber, and tree nuts has been shown through our collaborations to markedly reduce LDL-C concentrations to an extent comparable in magnitude with reductions achieved using first-generation statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Likewise, a large body of research has demonstrated the synergetic effects attained by introducing two or more food bioactive components into the diet to achieve maximal health benefits through multimechanistic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accordingly, combining highly bioactive components such as HOCO, barley &#x003b2;-glucan, and DHA is expected to produce great synergistic and pleotropic beneficial effects on CVD risks factors compared with the individual biological actions listed above.</p><p>The overall objective of the present study is to test novel foods containing the most effective bioactives, including n-3 fatty acid&#x02013;enriched dietary oil high in MUFAs and soluble dietary fiber, with aims of managing CVD risk factors in people with MetS and testing the efficacy and safety of these dietary components in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of the human intervention trial</title><p>A randomized, single-blind, crossover trial will be conducted at the Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. The study design will consist of four phases with 28&#x000a0;days per phase, and each phase will be separated by 4-week washout periods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants will consume at least one of three daily meals under supervision, along with the treatment foods during weekdays from days 2 to 29 of each phase. Treatment muffins and cookies for the weekend will be packed and provided to participants to take home on Fridays. The other meals will be purchased by the participants from grocery stores on their own. Almost half of the treatments will be consumed under the supervision of a clinical coordinator to ensure optimal compliance. Participants will be instructed to consume no alcoholic or caffeinated beverages. Participants will be instructed not to consume more than one serving of fish or seafood products per month during the study. A 3-day food record will be collected before the study and after each treatment phase. Participants will be strongly recommended to maintain consistency in their physical activities during the experimental period. Compliance with the treatment products will be determined from checklists and by measuring the amount of leftover food if any in the containers returned by the participants the following day.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the experimental protocol. *Procedures are the same as in phase 1. <italic>Blood</italic> 12-h fasted blood collection, <italic>ANTH</italic> anthropometric measurements, <italic>BP</italic> blood pressure, <italic>IE-CRIT</italic> inclusion and exclusion criteria, <italic>Qs</italic> questionnaires (fish and seafood consumption, concomitant medications, adverse events, physical activity), <italic>3D-FR</italic> 3-day food record collection, <italic>DEXA</italic> dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, <italic>PHYS</italic> physician examination, <italic>GI</italic> gastrointestinal questionnaires, <italic>STOOL</italic> stool sample collection, <italic>D</italic>

Basal energy requirement will be estimated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The basal energy requirements will be multiplied by an activity factor of 1.7 to supply the additional energy needs of mildly to moderately active healthy adults. During the study period, body weight will be monitored. If any of the participants gain or lose weight during the first week, adjustments to their estimated energy requirements will be made. Participants will be given recommendations to follow a typical Western diet that meets the Canadian Dietary reference intake. The nutrient content of the participant&#x02019;s diet, based on the 3-day food record, will be analyzed using Food Processor Nutrition Analysis software (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, USA) to ensure the intake of macro- and micronutrients and compliance with the protocol. Treatments will be isocalorically incorporated into muffins and cookies and consumed at breakfast, in the evening, as snacks, and with supper. Recruited participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment sequences using a Latin square design. Participants will be required to consume one muffin along with their breakfast and two cookies during their evening snack and dinner, respectively.</p><p>The four treatments are as follows: (1) muffins and cookies containing all-purpose flour and 50&#x000a0;g/day HOCO-DHA (85&#x000a0;%/15&#x000a0;%; DHA oil consists of 40&#x000a0;% DHA) (DHA dosage 3&#x000a0;g/day); (2) muffins and cookies containing barley flour with 4.36&#x000a0;g/day of high molecular weight barley &#x003b2;-glucan and 50&#x000a0;g/day of a blend of sunflower oil, safflower oil, and butter as a control oil; (3) muffins and cookies containing a combination of barley flour with 4.36&#x000a0;g/day, high molecular weight barley &#x003b2;-glucan, and 50&#x000a0;g/day of HOCO-DHA; and (4) muffins and cookies containing all-purpose flour and 50&#x000a0;g/day of control oil. The control oil used in the study represents a typical Western diet fat intake as a control treatment composed largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of n-6 linoleic acid common in current North American dietary intakes. Dosages for HOCO-DHA and barley &#x003b2;-glucan were determined on the basis of previous clinical studies done by our research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Muffin and cookie recipes were developed in Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada laboratories at the RCFFN metabolic kitchen. Barley grain (cultivar CDC Rattan) was provided by the Alberta Barley Commission and milled into whole grain flour by the Canadian International Grains Institute. All-purpose flour was obtained from local supermarket. HOCO was provided by Richardson Oilseed Limited. life&#x02019;s&#x000a0;DHA oil was purchased from DSM Nutritional Products (Ayr, ON, Canada). Macronutrients, including protein, carbohydrates, and fiber content of the foods, were analyzed at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada laboratories,&#x000a0;RCFFN, Winnipeg, Canada. Total fat and fatty acid profiles of the foods were measured at the RCFFN laboratories (Winnipeg, MB, Canada). The muffin flavors include vanilla and spice, and the cookies were made in lemon, ginger, and chocolate flavors. The flavors of the muffins and cookies will be provided in rotation with equal numbers of days per flavor during each treatment period.

In addition, they have to be deemed to be otherwise healthy by the study physician. Additionally, participants should also meet at least two of the following criteria: (1) TG &#x0003e;1.7&#x000a0;mmol/L, (2) HDL-C &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;mmol/L for males and &#x0003c;1.3&#x000a0;mmol/L for females, (3) fasting glucose &#x0003e;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L, (4) LDL-C &#x0003e;2.7&#x000a0;mmol/L, and (5) blood pressure &#x0003e;130&#x000a0;mmHg for systolic and &#x0003e;85&#x000a0;mmHg for diastolic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants taking lipid-lowering medications or nutritional supplements known to affect blood lipids, or who have any dietary restrictions that would prevent them from consuming the study diet for 28&#x000a0;days during each phase, will be excluded. Participants with a current or past history of any diseases and disorders that could interfere with fat absorption will be excluded. Individuals with hypertension having systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;150&#x000a0;mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;mmHg will be excluded from the study. Participants planning to become pregnant during the study period will be excluded. Smokers and people consuming more than one alcoholic drink/day or who have a history of alcoholism or drug dependence cannot be included in the study. Use of any experimental medication within 1&#x000a0;month before screening or as concomitant medication is also an exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Twelve-hour fasting blood samples will be collected on days 1, 2, 29, and 30 of each intervention phase. Participants will be advised to be fasted for 12&#x000a0;h and not to consume any alcoholic beverage for at least 48&#x000a0;h before blood collection. Participants will also be instructed to refrain from engaging in intense physical activity (aerobic, spinning, and running) for at least 24&#x000a0;h before each visit. On days of blood collection, a checklist with questions on 12-h diet, 48-h alcohol, and 24-h physical activity will be administered and data recorded to determine participant compliance.</p><p>Blood samples will be centrifuged at 3000&#x000a0;rpm for 20&#x000a0;minutes at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; aliquoted to yield serum, plasma, and red blood cells (RBC); and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analyses. To obtain the plasma lipid profile, average values of days 1 and 2 will be considered as baseline and average values of days 29 and 30 will be considered as the endpoint of each treatment phase. In addition, the influence of these diets on gastrointestinal microbial diversity in the current study population will be measured. For this analysis, stool samples (four or five scoops totaling 4&#x000a0;g) will be collected before and after each intervention phase (days 2 and 30) of the trial. Stool sample collection kits, including containers, will be provided for the participants to collect their stool samples. However, it is optional for the participants to provide the stool samples, and they may still participate if they choose not to provide stool samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Stable isotope tracer intake</title><p>To assess cholesterol fractional synthesis rate (FSR), participants will be asked to consume deuterated water (D<sub>2</sub>O) at the end of each phase. On day 29, 0.7&#x000a0;g of D<sub>2</sub>O per kilogram of estimated body water will be given orally before breakfast as a tracer to measure cholesterol FSR over 24&#x000a0;h. Fasting blood will be obtained on days 29 and 30.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clinical data collection</title><p>Whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Prodigy Advance; GE Healthcare Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) will be conducted to determine changes in body fat composition during the last week of each phase. Blood pressure, body weight, and waist circumference will be monitored at the beginning and end of each treatment period. An automated blood pressure device will be used to measure blood pressure. Participants will be advised to rest quietly throughout the measurements. Blood pressure will be measured four times at 2-minute intervals. The first measurement will be ignored, and the last three measurements will be averaged to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Gastrointestinal tolerability questionnaires will be completed by participants at the beginning and end of each intervention period. The 10-year Framingham CVD risk score will be calculated for each participant during each phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Analytical methodology</title><p>Plasma samples will be analyzed for total lipid profiles, including TC, HDL-C, and TG levels, as well as for glucose levels, using the automated enzymatic methods on a VITROS 350 Chemistry System (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Markham, ON, Canada). LDL-C values will be calculated using the Friedewald equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Subfractions and particle sizes of LDL-C after each treatment intervention will be determined by the proprietary Lipoprint Lipoprotein Subfractions Testing System (Quantimetrix, Redondo Beach, CA, USA).</p><p>Inflammatory markers such as plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A levels will be measured with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Plasma cytokines, specifically interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, will be measured by multiplex human ELISA. Plasma soluble adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and soluble P-selectin and E-selectin will also be measured with commercially available human ELISA kits. Apolipoproteins A1, B, and E will be analyzed with commercially available ELISA kits.</p><p>Fasting plasma insulin concentrations will be determined using an ELISA kit.

Individual fatty acids will be identified by comparison with known standards (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN, USA). Individual fatty acid levels will be calculated according to the peak area relative to the total area and expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids.</p><p>Concentrations of isotope-labeled cholesterol in circulatory cholesterol will be measured over 24&#x000a0;h. In this study, we will measure the deuterium enrichment into RBC cholesterol to calculate FSR of whole-body cholesterol. The initial 24-h interval of D<sub>2</sub>O uptake is considered to be the optimal period for measuring synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The analytical methods for isotope analyses are as follows. For determining cholesterol FSR (%/day), RBC from day 29 and 30 will be saponified with freshly prepared KOH-methanol at 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;h, and the sterol fraction will be extracted with petroleum diethyl ether. RBC cholesterol deuterium enrichment will be quantified using a gas chromatography-pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Delta V Pulse Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

We anticipate that, taken together, the foods containing both HOCO-DHA and barley-derived high molecular weight &#x003b2;-glucan will possess a superior biological action due to their differential mechanistic effects, compared with the individual components, against CVD risk factors.</p><p>In the current proposal, combining these potent groups of food bioactives, such as HOCO-DHA and &#x003b2;-glucan, to achieve parallel multiplication of biological action and to reduce the CVD events substantially is of paramount clinical significance. This study will be the first investigation of the cholesterol-lowering effect of a combination of HOCO-DHA and barley &#x003b2;-glucan. The proposed study will help to improve understanding of the metabolic mechanisms underpinning the health benefits associated with consumption of foods consisting of HOCO-DHA and barley &#x003b2;-glucan. The proposed research will not only support the improvement of the cardiovascular health of Canadians but also increase the marketability of our canola-barley products internationally. The anticipated outcomes of the proposed study are expected to have a high probability of impacting the health and wellness of Canadians because (1) a significant proportion of the population has MetS and (2) scientific data generated by well-designed, unbiased human clinical trials are required to properly substantiate health effects of a combination of HOCO-DHA and barley &#x003b2;-glucan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02091583).
