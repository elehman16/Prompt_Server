The titre of anti-transglutaminase antibodies has a strong relevance in the diagnosis of CD as defined by the ESPGHAN criteria; few studies, at the moment, estimated the variability of the main diagnostic tool for CD, in terms of accuracy and precision. Our study represents the first quality control work on this subject, with strong implication especially in countries with limited resources, where duodenal biopsy is not so easily performed.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A progressive increase in the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) has been recently observed across the Mediterranean Basin[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as well in many other countries in the gluten-consuming world. Together with this &#x0201c;epidemic&#x0201d;, there is a need to standardize the diagnostic tests across the emerging countries. The International working group MEDICEL (Mediterranean Network for Food Induced Disease, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.medicel.unina.it">www.medicel.unina.it</uri>) was set up in 2011 by a EUROPAID action, supported by the Italian Ministry of Health. Eighteen Mediterranean countries participate to the MEDICEL network, sharing the aim to develop local capacities to address the Coeliac Disease &#x0201c;epidemic&#x0201d;.</p><p>The recent European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Diagnostic Guidelines[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] consider the possibility of diagnosing CD without a biopsy on the basis of the presence of clinical symptoms, compatible HLA, a positive EMA test and a high titre (&#x000d7; 10) of human anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA). The chance to avoid the requirement of expensive endoscopic procedures attracted extraordinary interest in the emerging countries, where the scarcity of resources in extended territories limited the possibility to diagnose and care for CD patients. Commercial ELISA kits to analyse TGA are more readily available, but the differences in their antigens and procedures requires an estimation of the variability of each method used in each country of the MEDICEL network.</p><p>ESPGHAN made a significant effort to estimate the variability of the TGA test across Europe, but only a few studies address specific measures of accuracy and precision[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We are also aware that the variability of a test is best evaluated &#x0201c;in-the-field&#x0201d;, not only in specialized referral centres.</p><p>The aim of this study is to verify the precision and accuracy of the estimation of TGA across Mediterranean countries.</p><p>The precision is the &#x0201c;convergence degree&#x0201d; (or dispersion) of the single values from the mean value; in other words, it is the variance, or the standard deviation, from the mean value.</p><p>The accuracy of a measurement is the difference between the observed value and the real value; it expresses how different are the real and the measured values; note that this is a qualitative value that depends on both casual and systematic errors.</p><p>A measurement is therefore more precise when upon repeating the test, all the results are strictly close to a mean value, irrespective of the difference from the real value. Accuracy, instead, represents the amount of systematic error during the measurement; a test is accurate when the mean result is close to the real value.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A central laboratory prepared sets of 7 blinded and randomized serum samples, with a known titrated amount of TGA, obtained by progressive dilution of pooled human samples. Each centre received 7 vials: 5 of these were marked with the codes &#x0201c;S1&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;S2&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;S3&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;S4&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;S5&#x0201d;; the other 2 were a positive and a negative control. The vials S1-5 were all made from a serum highly positive for TGA; this serum is periodically controlled by the manufacturer to verify its concentration, comparing it with other certified lots of sera.</p><p>From this serum, by a progressive dilution, the S5 sample (with a final concentration of 100 IU/mL, verified by titration) was produced; the other samples were obtained by the dilution of this solution. The positive and the negative controls were obtained from a highly positive serum diluted to a concentration between 40 IU/mL and 80 IU/mL (for the positive one) and below 5 IU/mL (for the negative one).</p><p>To prepare the samples for the analysis, with no need for further dilution, the samples were diluted with the same buffer solution used during all the processes. The composition of this solution guarantees that all the essential reactives, such as calcium, needed for the correct function of TGA, are present in adequate amounts.</p><p>Due to these high dilutions, EMA testing was not technically performable.</p><p>No abnormal or out-of-range results were obtained, so no data were excluded.</p><p>To compare the results obtained from different laboratories and kits, we standardized all the results using the manufacturer&#x02019;s scale as a reference scale; to this end, all results were divided by the specific cut-off value and then multiplied by the cut-off value of the reference kit.

Therefore, more attention and clinical significance must be conferred to borderline results.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The overall picture of the variability of the TGA assay across different methods and in very different settings across Mediterranean countries is quite reassuring, but the observed variability should be translated into clinical practice.</p><p>Considering the standard error of the mean of the observed values (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), when a patient produces TGA antibody levels equal to or higher than 1.25 times the cut-off value (generally over 20 IU/mL), the range of possible reported values is &#x000b1; 24.3%(ranging from 15.14 to 24.86 IU/mL).</p><p>If a patient has a real value of 50 IU/mL, the range of possible reported values is from 39.18 to 60.81 IU/mL (&#x000b1; 21.63%). In both these very common cases, the variability of the estimate would have no clinical significance because they are all robustly positive values.</p><p>However, if a patient has a real TGA level of just above the cut-off value (let us say 10 or 15 IU/mL), the variability of approximately 30%-40% may push the patient from a negative or an indeterminate value (6.05 or 10.21 IU/mL, respectively) to an indeterminate or a definitively positive value (13.95 or 19.78 IU/mL, respectively).</p><p>TGA estimation is a crucial step in the diagnosis of CD, and it is considerably more important in emerging countries, where the resources that are necessary to guarantee a safe endoscopy and a histopathological analysis are not readily available. Since the new ESPGHAN diagnostic protocol made avoiding a small bowel biopsy possible in a sizeable percentage of patients (estimated to be from 30% to 50%), with significant expansion in the methods of diagnosing CD, it is essential to estimate the reliability of TGA assays. Unfortunately, the data on the reliability of TGA estimation are currently limited to highly specialized centres participating in the advanced European network[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ours is the first study that aims to estimate the precision and the accuracy of the assays not only &#x0201c;in the field&#x0201d; but in most countries of the Mediterranean Basin. A similar study was performed in 2009 in the United States[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but, in this earlier work, real human sera (not ready for use and so at risk for altered results due to automatic dilutions or other components of the sera) were used; furthermore, commercial laboratories were involved in the study (not only referral centres) that were not all using the same technical methods (16 used ELISAs, and 5 used radio-binding assays), and the study was aimed at determining the differences in specificity and sensitivity and the correlation between laboratories. Another working group in Europe raised the problem of the accuracy of TGA assays (and in the interpretation of their results) in 2015[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and then directed its interest toward the neo-epitope tTg (tTg-neo) autoantibody[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which currently lacks a diagnostic role in the Guidelines and is still not widely available, even in referral centres.</p><p>The average of the observed values across the 8 centres participating in this study tends to underestimate the value proposed by the provider as the reference standard. The underestimation is, on average, approximately 30%-40% of the expected value. This underestimation, however, does not interfere with the aim of our work, which is to analyse the variability of the assay among centres, which is the factor that is then applied to the bedside. We suggest that our observed mean values, obtained from 168 estimations, are closer to the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; TGA titre than the manufacturer&#x02019;s reference standard provided for this study. Indeed, the reference samples were obtained by accurate progressive dilution of a pooled sample; hence a minute variability in the starting sample, before dilution (for example, estimated value 120 <italic>vs</italic> true value 115) would have produced a progressive increasing error of estimates across dilutions, but again, this is not relevant to our study.</p><p>The dispersion of the TGA values around the reference value is moderate (79.17% are &#x000b1; 25%), but even more important, the accuracy and the precision of the analysis progressively improve with increasing TGA titre: the dispersion of the TGA values is quite large for low TGA titres (ranging from -61.54% to -20.84% for 3 IU/mL and from -1.1 to 0.67 for 10 IU/mL); values above 20 IU/mL provide reliable results across all centres, with an Accuracy ranging from -8.29% (at 20 IU/mL) to -7.41% (at 60 IU/mL) and a Precision ranging from -0.02 (at 20 IU/mL) to -0.0095 (at 60 IU/mL). Thus, TGA could be considered a reliable basis for the diagnosis of CD, in light of its robust estimation across Mediterranean countries.</p><p>This contribution aims to provide the paediatrician and gastroenterologist with a safe, specific and sensitive diagnostic test with which to uncover that large number of coeliac patients who remain undiagnosed at present. In the next 10 years, at least 5 million individuals in Mediterranean countries[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] might benefit from the accuracy of TGA estimation, especially in light of the direct correlation between TGA titre and villous atrophy[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The quality of a diagnostic tool (<italic>i.e</italic>., its accuracy and precision) affects not only the patient but also the National Health System; a reliable diagnostic tool implies a reduction in the time to and in the cost of diagnosis. It is also important for clinical trials, and even more so for multicentre studies, in which working with better tools could improve the quality of the study and the relevance of the scientific conclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Thanks to Giovanni Curr&#x000f2;, PhD, who gave significant contribution in performing the analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder with a prevalence of 1%-2% in the general population, and an incidence with an increasing trend in the last 20 years. The cumulative incidence in children at age 5 ranges between 0.089 and 9 cases per 1000 live births while in adults varied from lows of 1.27 to a high of 17.2 cases per 100000 patient years. In the recent years, a significant increase in the incidence of celiac disease has been recorded in the Mediterranean area; to face this &#x0201c;epidemic&#x0201d; diffusion a simple and accurate diagnosis is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>The 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines clearly identify the diagnostic criteria for symptomatic and asymptomatic children or adolescents, giving a central role to the anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA) dosage in the diagnosis. In recent years, several new biomarkers have been studied for the diagnosis of CD but, nowadays, the greatest progresses affect the increase of the precision of the anti-transglutaminase assay. The main point of this paper is to reinforce the validity of TGA dosage for the diagnosis of CD.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>This study is the first quality control study in the Mediterranean area, and clearly shows that the TGA dosage is a precise and accurate method for the diagnosis of CD already for values greater than 1.25 times the cutoff. This appears of great importance especially in countries in which the duodenal biopsy is not always easy to perform.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>This study explored the precision and accuracy of the estimation of TGA across Mediterranean countries and it provides important data on the reliability of this method, with strong implications for all pediatric gastroenterologist and clinicians who face with this diagnosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology</title><p>CD is an immune-mediated systemic disorder related to gluten ingestion in genetic susceptible subjects; it is characterized by the presence of anti-transglutaminase antibodies, as serological biomarker. We investigated two properties of this biomarker, the precision and the accuracy. Precision is the &#x0201c;convergence degree&#x0201d; (or dispersion) of the single values from the mean value; in other words, it is the variance, or the standard deviation, from the mean value. Accuracy is the difference between the observed value and the real value; it expresses how different are the real and the measured values.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer-review</title><p>The authors have evaluated the accuracy of various commercially available TGA kits across different Mediterranean countries. Knowing that TGA values can be determined accurately is important for the use of TGA testing in CD diagnosis, and the study therefore provides useful information for the evaluation of clinical guidelines.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Manuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript</p></fn><fn><p>Specialty type: Gastroenterology and hepatology</p></fn><fn><p>Country of origin: Italy</p></fn><fn><p>Peer-review report classification</p></fn><fn><p>Grade A (Excellent): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade B (Very good): B</p></fn><fn><p>Grade C (Good): C, C, C</p></fn><fn><p>Grade D (Fair): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade E (Poor): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Institutional review board statement: the study was reviewed and approved by all the authors.
