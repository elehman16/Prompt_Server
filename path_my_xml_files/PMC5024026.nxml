Training in pairs &#x02013; also known as dyad practice &#x02013; may allow an increased learner&#x02010;to&#x02010;simulator ratio and thereby improve training efficiency. The effectiveness of dyad practice has been explored in the motor skills learning literature, which demonstrates that learners perform as well or better than those who practise alone despite decreased hands&#x02010;on experience.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Dyad practice may therefore be an attractive method of reducing the costs of simulation&#x02010;based medical education without compromising learning.</p><p>The conceptual theoretical framework underpinning the effectiveness of dyad practice involves peer&#x02010;assisted learning theory,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> neuroscience studies,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> and cognitive load theory (CLT).<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Whereas peer learning theorists emphasise the importance of inter&#x02010;subjective cognitive co&#x02010;construction, shared knowledge and peer feedback,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> experimental motor learning studies involving dyad practice have attributed the benefits of dyad practice to the effects of peer observation.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> The neurophysiological basis for the effects of observation has been provided by the identification of so&#x02010;called &#x02018;mirror&#x02010;neurons&#x02019; located in the prefrontal motor cortex that are activated when an individual observes and performs the same action.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> In other words, observation elicits an internal representation of the performed actions, which allows rehearsal without any actual hands&#x02010;on practice. Cognitive load theory provides yet another view on the potential mechanism of action behind dyad practice.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> From a CLT perspective, dyad practice may divide the cognitive load imposed on learners by shared information processing, thereby making learning more effective and efficient. However, dyad practice may also reduce the effectiveness of learning if the task is characterised by low cognitive load.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>
</p><p>The effect of dyad practice within the simulated setting has been explored in several recent studies in medical education. In a study by Tolsgaard <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> medical students were randomised to dyad or single practice during patient encounter management training in a skills laboratory. A retention test using simulated patients showed the dyad group performed better than the single&#x02010;practice group and demonstrated improved confidence in managing future patient encounters.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> In a study involving simulation&#x02010;based lumbar puncture training, Shanks <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> found no differences in pre&#x02010;, post&#x02010; and retention test performances between students who practised alone and those who worked in dyads. However, the dyad group displayed greater pre&#x02010; to post&#x02010;test gains than the single&#x02010;practice group without using additional practice time.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Finally, a recent study involving virtual reality coronary angiography training did not demonstrate any significant differences in retention test performances between students who were allocated to individual or dyad practice.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Consequently, there is increasing evidence that dyad practice improves efficiency for a wide range of clinical skills without compromising learning. However, it remains unknown whether dyad practice is as effective as individual practice in the context of skills transfer from simulated to clinical performances with patients.</p><p>The process of transfer describes the application of previously learned concepts to a novel problem.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> The transfer process is influenced by multiple factors<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> and performance in a simulated setting may not necessarily reflect how learners perform in the clinical setting with patients.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Consequently, although dyad practice is as effective as individual practice during simulation&#x02010;based training, it does not guarantee equivalent skills transfer. The positive effects of dyad practice on confidence and metacognition reported in previous studies<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> indicate that dyad practice may actually improve the chances of successful skills transfer according to social cognitive theory.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> However, the decreased amount of hands&#x02010;on experience may reduce dyad participants&#x02019; automaticity of skills during simulation&#x02010;based practice, which may impair subsequent skills transfer according to the motor skills learning literature.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>
</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effectiveness of dyad practice compared with individual practice in the context of the transfer of skills from simulation&#x02010;based training in complex skills to clinical performances with patients. We chose a non&#x02010;inferiority design to investigate whether dyad training was as effective as individual practice according to recent recommendations.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In the present study, we focused on simulation&#x02010;based ultrasound training because ultrasonography is a complex skill involving technical and diagnostic aspects of performance.</p></sec><sec id="medu12624-sec-0007"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomised, parallel&#x02010;group, observer&#x02010;blinded, non&#x02010;inferiority trial using a 1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1 allocation ratio to compare dyad and single practice during ultrasound simulation between 1 January and 1 June 2013.

The group was selected to ensure that all participants had an equal knowledge base and minimal practical ultrasound experience. The medical programme at the University of Copenhagen is a traditional 6&#x000a0;year curriculum which provides basic science teaching during the first half of the programme and clinical sciences teaching as well as clerkship training during the second half. During Year 4, all medical students are required to complete a 3&#x02010;hour course on basic abdominal ultrasonography.</p><p>Participants were contacted by e&#x02010;mail and again during the introductory lectures to their gynaecological rotations. The inclusion criterion required participants to be less than 4&#x000a0;months from medical graduation. Exclusion criteria denied the participation of students who had previously undertaken ultrasound courses or had any experience with any kind of virtual reality simulation or ultrasound in obstetrics and gynaecology. Ultrasound experience was defined as any hands&#x02010;on training and did not include the observation of examinations performed by other health care providers. Participants were enrolled on a consecutive basis until the required sample size was reached.</p><p>The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet. All participants underwent simulation&#x02010;based ultrasound training. The gynaecological ambulatory unit was selected because it has a high flow of patients and thus the likelihood that participants would be able to perform transvaginal ultrasound scans was concomitantly high. The patient population included women scheduled for clinical control after medical abortion, as well as women with acute gynaecological conditions (e.g. missed abortion [missed miscarriage], lower abdominal pain). All patients provided written informed consent to their participation in this study. Eligible patients were non&#x02010;pregnant or in an early stage of pregnancy and were required to have a body mass index of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> to ensure some degree of test condition standardisation. All patients were required to be able to read and understand Danish in order to provide informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="medu12624-sec-0009"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants were randomised to dyad or single practice before beginning the training. Simulations were performed using a high&#x02010;fidelity transvaginal ultrasound simulator (ScanTrainer; MedaPhor Ltd, Cardiff, UK). The ultrasound simulator was equipped with a haptic device that provides realistic force&#x02010;feedback to the ultrasound probe. The B&#x02010;mode monitor output was obtained from real patients and presented according to the probe's positioning, while a three&#x02010;dimensional illustration simultaneously demonstrated probe orientation during the scans (Fig. S1). For this study, we selected the general gynaecological training modules, which included nine basic training exercises focused on probe orientation and systematic examination of a normal female pelvis.</p><p>Both groups were provided with a brief introduction (10&#x000a0;minutes) in order to familiarise group members with the simulated environment and the equipment. Participants were then instructed to complete a pre&#x02010;test to assess baseline performance before training, as well as a post&#x02010;test once they had finished training. They were instructed to perform a systematic ultrasound examination of the female pelvis which included the measuring of endometrial thickness within a time limit of 10&#x000a0;minutes. The 3&#x02010;D illustration was not enabled during the pre&#x02010; and post&#x02010;tests and case difficulty was low (normal pelvic anatomy, module 1.1). All simulated and clinical ultrasound examinations were recorded to allow for subsequent performance assessment. All tests were completed individually; participants in the dyad group were not allowed to observe one another's performances.</p><p>Once the pre&#x02010;test was completed, participants were instructed to begin training using nine general gynaecological simulator modules. The training time was fixed for both groups at 2&#x000a0;hours, upon which the post&#x02010;test was completed. Participants in the dyad group were instructed to take turns as the active practitioner and to attempt each module once and then to move on to the next module. The participants in the single group, practising alone, were instructed to attempt each module twice. If any of the participants managed to complete all nine modules within 2&#x000a0;hours, they were instructed to repeat the modules from the beginning. Discussion was allowed between the participants working in pairs, but only one participant at a time was involved in hands&#x02010;on practice.</p><p>All participants were provided with two optional 10&#x02010;minute feedback sessions with one of two simulator instructors (MGT or MEM). The feedback was structured according to a framework for the assessment of ultrasound skills, the objective structured assessment of ultrasound skills (OSAUS) (Appendix&#x000a0;S1).<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> After 2&#x000a0;hours of training, the sessions were ended and participants were briefed on the transfer test scheduled for the following day.</p></sec><sec id="medu12624-sec-0010"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The main outcome measure was clinical performance during ultrasound scans performed the day after the completion of simulation&#x02010;based training (transfer test). All participants were assessed on one transvaginal scan by one of two blinded raters (AO or BSO) using the OSAUS scale. Participants were instructed to perform a systematic examination of the uterus and lateral pelvic wall, as well as to assess free fluid in the pouch of Douglas (the recto&#x02010;uterine pouch), and to measure endometrial thickness. The rater provided the participant with a short oral introduction to the equipment and setting before the participant performed the scans. During the scans, the rater assisted with technical problems, but provided limited verbal instructions unless patient discomfort prompted intervention.

In fact, a significantly higher number of participants in the dyad group compared with those in the single&#x02010;practice group achieved performance scores above a pre&#x02010;established pass/fail level. Consequently, training efficiency was doubled without any sign of negative effects on transfer of learning. The fact that the dyad group needed significantly fewer attempts to achieve a certain simulator score supports the suggestion that dyad participants were able to learn from each other's errors and avoid them during subsequent performance. This confirms existing theories on the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of dyad practice from the motor skills learning and peer learning literature. However, in the present study we did not attempt to explore the relative contributions of observation, feedback, shared knowledge or cognitive co&#x02010;construction on the observed performances in the dyad group.</p><p>Of the 30 participants included, 24 completed the transfer test, thereby fulfilling the study's targeted sample size. Although this study was powered to demonstrate only non&#x02010;inferiority, the dyad group demonstrated superiority with regard to simulator training efficiency and transfer test pass rate. This study used assessment instruments for which validity evidence is documented, rater blinding, and thorough rater training prior to its commencement. Although simulator instructor blinding was not possible, we used standardised instruction and feedback protocols to limit any instructor bias. The fact that the effects of dyad training generalise across several practice domains supports the trustworthiness of the present results. However, the present study included only novice learners, who had limited clinical experience and no prior ultrasound training. By contrast with our findings, Shanks <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> hypothesised that novice learners may not benefit from dyad practice because they lack the knowledge and skills necessary for effective peer teaching. This was supported by an experimental study showing that peer&#x02010;assisted learning in pairs was inferior to computer&#x02010;assisted learning and teacher&#x02010;assisted learning.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> However, the training provided in our study included a combination of computer&#x02010; and teacher&#x02010;assisted learning, and the effects of dyad practice for novice learners may therefore depend on some element of guidance during training.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the effect of dyad practice during complex skills training, but similar results have been demonstrated for simple skills training in a previous study involving lumbar puncture.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Hence, the effectiveness of dyad practice may not exclusively rely on task complexity, as proposed by Kirschner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> as the cognitive load imposed during initial simple skills training may be equivalent to the load after several hours of complex skills training.

Interestingly, the time allocated to dyad practice during simulation&#x02010;based training in the study by Shanks <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> (24&#x000a0;minutes), the present study (2&#x000a0;hours), and the study by R&#x000e4;der <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> (3.5&#x000a0;hours) seems to be inversely related to the immediate gains in learning of the dyad participants. In the study by Shanks <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> the dyad group demonstrated significantly greater pre&#x02010; to post&#x02010;test gains than the single&#x02010;practice group, whereas there were no differences between groups in the present study and slightly worse performances in the dyad group in the study by R&#x000e4;der <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> The trade&#x02010;off between gains from dyad practice in terms of peer observation and shared information processing against the reduction in hands&#x02010;on experience may help to explain the reduced effects of dyad practice beyond initial training. Future qualitative studies may help to explore how these issues affect learning.</p><sec id="medu12624-sec-0017"><title>Limitations</title><p>The limitations of this study include its small sample size and the use of single&#x02010;case assessments for the transfer test. During the transfer tests, only one rater assessed performances, which may have impacted the reliability of ratings. Although the validity of the OSAUS scale has been explored in multiple previous studies involving different trainees and institutions,<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> the validity of a score does not necessarily transfer to a new setting with a different sample of participants. Furthermore, because of the large differences between pre&#x02010; and post&#x02010;test performances, the raters may have been able to distinguish between the types of assessment in the simulated setting. Although this may have resulted in the overestimation of the immediate training effects for both groups, it does not affect the interpretation of the main outcome or affect the overall conclusions of this study as the raters were blind to the allocation of participants in the pre&#x02010;, post&#x02010; and transfer tests. To limit the case&#x02010;mix effect, we aimed for strict selection criteria for the transfer test cases and found no significant differences between groups in the types of pathology participants encountered. To ensure the standardisation of the transfer test conditions between the two groups, we included only scans performed on the day after training. Hence, six of the 30 participants included were unable to complete the transfer test because we lacked eligible patients. We chose to limit the transfer test to include a single scan because aiming for a higher number of scans would have limited the completion rate further.</p><p>The use of different methods for assessing pre&#x02010;, post&#x02010; and transfer test performances may have resulted in bias as there is some evidence that live performances are rated more highly than video&#x02010;recorded performances.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Hence, the extent of skills transfer to the clinical setting may have been overestimated for both groups of participants as a result of rater leniency. Finally, we examined only the immediate effects of dyad practice on skills transfer and did not attempt to evaluate effects on skills retention. This has, however, been examined in several recent studies, in which no significant differences were found between dyad and single practice in the simulated setting after delays of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks.<xref rid="medu12624-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="medu12624-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>
