Due to cardiac side effects of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine is now more commonly used in regional blocks.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There are many studies using adjuvants like opioids with levobupivacaine. But due to opioid-related side effects, nonopiod adjuvants are commonly used instead of opioids. Dexmedetomidine and clonidine are commonly used nonopioids used as an adjuvant but they have side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension and sedation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hence, we have used calcium channel blocker as adjuvant to levobupivacaine in supraclavicular block. Calcium plays an important role in analgesia produced by local anesthetics. The activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may lead to calcium entry into cells and potentiation of spinal cord and plays a role in pain formation. Hence, calcium channel blockers may prevent central sensitization and provide better sensory motor block characteristics.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker can potentiate analgesic action of local anesthetics and reduce postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Due to paucity of studies in literature, we have used verapamil as adjuvant to Levobupivacaine in supraclavicular block. Few studies were there using 2.5 mg of verapamil, showing no impact on onset and duration of sensory motor block. Hence, we have used 5 mg of verapamil as adjuvant to levobupivacaine. The primary aim of the present study was to know whether verapamil (5 mg) as adjuvant to levobupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block would delay the need of rescue analgesia and to find any impact on number of rescue analgesia required in first 24 h of operation. Effect on sensory or motor block characteristics like onset and duration were the secondary aims of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a prospective randomized placebo-controlled, doubled-blinded study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital from June 2016 to December 2016 after approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee. It included sixty patients, aged 18&#x02013;60 years of the American Society of Anesthesiologist Grade I and II of either sex who were scheduled to undergo elbow, forearm, and hand surgery under supraclavicular brachial plexus block. A written informed consent was obtained from each patient after explaining the technique before inclusion in this study. Patient refusal, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, renal or liver disease, circulatory instability, pregnant women, allergy to local anesthetic, coagulation disorder, and neurological deficit were excluded from study. The subjects were allocated by computer generated randomized number into two equal groups of 30 each. In Group A, patients received 30 ml of levobupivacaine 0.5% with 2 ml of normal saline while in Group B patients received injection verapamil (5 mg) diluted to 2 ml in addition to 30 ml of levobupivacaine 0.5%. Drugs were prepared by the anesthetist not involved in the procedure.</p><p>Pulse rate (PR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) and oxygen saturation were recorded just before and after the block. An intravenous line was accessed. Eighteen gauge intravenous (iv) cannula was inserted and ringers lactate was started.</p><p>The brachial plexus block was carried out with the patient lying in the supine position without a pillow. Arms kept at sides and head turned to side opposite to the side being blocked. The upper limb to be anesthetized was adducted and extended along the side toward the ipsilateral knee. About 2 cm above the midclavicular point, just lateral to subclavian artery pulsation, a 24-gauge 1.5 inch needle was introduced and directed caudally and medially to reach the first rib. Paraesthesia was elicited in hand by &#x0201c;walking over the first rib, after which 32 ml of drug solution was injected.</p><p>After injection, patients were pinpricked at every minute to assess for sensory blockade. The palmar surfaces of the index and little finger were used to test the median and ulnar nerve in the hand, respectively. To test the radial nerve, the dorsal surface of the thumb was used. Sensory characteristics of the block were assessed using response to pinprick to 23-gauge hypodermic needle using the Hollmen scale. 1-Normal sensation to pinprick. 2-Pinprick felt as sharp pointed but weaker with the same area in other limb. 3-Pinprick recognized as touch with blunt object. 4-no response to pinprick.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>A modified Lovett rating scale was used for assessing motor block, ranging from 6 (usual muscular force) to 0 (complete paralysis). Thumb abduction was evaluated for the radial nerve, thumb adduction for the ulnar nerve, thumb opposition for the median nerve and flexion of elbow for the musculocutaneous nerve. Lovett Rating Scale: 6-Normal muscular force. 5- Slightly reduced muscular force. 4-Pronounced reduction of muscular force 3-Slightly impaired mobility. 2-Pronounced mobility impairment. 1-Almost complete paralysis. 0-Complete paralysis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Surgery started at sensory block scale-3. The time of onset of sensory block was defined as the interval between the injection of drug to Hollmen sensory scale 2.

Time to the first dose of rescue analgesia was noted.</p><p>PR, SBP, and DBP were monitored at every 15 min interval up to 2 h and then at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and at 24 h. The level of sedation was assessed by Ramsay sedation scale.</p><p>The possible side-effects such as drowsiness, pruritus, nausea/vomiting, horner's syndrome, phrenic nerve palsy, pneumothorax, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia were noted.</p><p>The above assessments were carried out by the principal investigator who was blinded to the drugs administered in the brachial plexus block.

Verapamil has been shown to have potent local anesthetic activity, reflecting inhibition of fast sodium channels. It induces fast channel blocking effects similar to local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We have used verapamil with levobupivacaine in brachial plexus block and concluded that verapamil not only reduced the onset of sensory and motor block but also increased the duration of sensory and motor block. No of rescue analgesia required was low in B Group compared to A Group. Nowycky <italic>et al</italic>. in 1985 reported the evidence of three distinct types of voltage-gated calcium channels in sensory neurons namely L, T, and N type. Of these L and N type of voltage-gated channels have a significant role in regulating neurotransmitter release from neurons.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The N type channel blockers has much more potent antinociceptive effects than L type but are not clinically suitable for their neurotoxicity.
