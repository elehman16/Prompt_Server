</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>SOX plus bevacizumab is an effective regimen for doublet chemotherapy, which can be used instead of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab for first-line chemotherapy in patients with mCRC. Replacement of infusional fluorouracil with an S-1 might be more convenient and reduce the burden on patients and physicians.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluorouracil and leucovorin combined with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab has been widely used as first-line or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, these regimens require visits to the hospital every 2 weeks, placement of a central venous (CV) port, and a portable infusion pump. Such devices can increase the risk of adverse events such as infection, thrombosis and catheter-related problems. Replacement of infusional fluorouracil with an oral anticancer agent (capecitabine or S-1) might be more convenient and reduce the burden on patients and physicians. The NO16966 trial showed that capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOX) plus bevacizumab is non-inferior to FOLFOX plus bevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>S-1 is an oral anticancer agent that combines tegafur (a prodrug of fluorouracil) with two modulators: gimeracil, which reversibly inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (the primary metabolising enzyme of fluorouracil) and thereby maintains effective fluorouracil concentrations in the blood for prolonged periods; and oteracil potassium, which suppresses the activity and toxicity of fluorouracil in gastrointestinal tissue.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>The SOFT&#x000a0;study was a phase III trial designed to validate the non-inferiority of S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) plus bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in terms of PFS in patients with mCRC who had not previously received chemotherapy. In the primary analysis, median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 10.7&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;13.2) in the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group and 11.7 months (95%&#x02009;CI 10.7 to 12.9) in the SOX plus bevacizumab group (HR, 1.04; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.86 to 1.27; less than non-inferiority margin of 1.33, p<sub>non-inferiority</sub>=0.014), thereby demonstrating the non-inferiority of SOX plus bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We now report the results of updated analyses of overall survival (OS), which was based on immature data at the primary analysis, and waterfall plots (WFP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The SOFT study was an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase III trial performed in 82 institutions in Japan.

</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or SOX plus bevacizumab. Randomisation was done centrally using the minimisation method, with stratification according to institution and whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had been given. Investigators and patients were not blinded to the treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Treatment</title><p>On day 1 of each 2-week period during the study, patients in the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group received a 5&#x02009;mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab and a simultaneous intravenous infusion of 85&#x02009;mg/m&#x000b2; oxaliplatin, 200&#x02009;mg/m&#x000b2; <italic>l</italic>-leucovorin, 400&#x02009;mg/m&#x000b2; bolus fluorouracil and 2400&#x02009;mg/m&#x000b2; infusional fluorouracil (46&#x02009;hours), delivered with an infusion pump. On day 1 of each 3-week period during the study, patients in the SOX plus bevacizumab group received a 7.5&#x02009;mg/kg intravenous infusion of bevacizumab, followed by an intravenous infusion of 130&#x02009;mg/m&#x000b2; oxaliplatin. S-1 (40&#x02013;60&#x02009;mg, based on the body surface area (BSA): BSA&#x0003c;1.25&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, 40&#x02009;mg; BSA&#x02265;1.25&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> to&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1.5&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, 50&#x02009;mg; BSA&#x02265;1.5&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, 60&#x02009;mg) was administered orally two times per day from after dinner on day 1 to after breakfast on day 15, followed by a 7-day rest. Maintenance chemotherapy with fluorouracil/<italic>l</italic>-leucovorin or S-1 was permitted after discontinuing oxaliplatin, bevacizumab or both. Cycles were repeated until the criteria for withdrawal of the study treatment were met. Additional details, that&#x000a0;is, dose modifications, have been previously reported.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Assessments</title><p>Tumour assessments (eg, CT or MRI) were performed within 30 days before starting the study treatment and were repeated at 8-week intervals in both groups. The attending physicians assessed response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST, V.1.0). Safety assessments were performed on day 1 of each cycle. (Safety was also evaluated in week 2 of the first cycle.) Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (V.3.0).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end&#x000a0;point was PFS, defined as the interval from the date of enrolment to the date on which progressive disease was first confirmed or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Progressive disease, defined as a greater than 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions from baseline, was assessed solely by the responsible investigator and was included in the assessment of disease progression for target lesions. Exacerbation of underlying disease and the appearance of new lesions were included in the assessment of disease progression for new non-target lesions. Secondary end&#x000a0;points were OS, time to treatment failure, response rate (RR), disease control rate, curative resection rate and adverse events.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>On the basis of previous studies, the median PFS associated with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab was estimated to be 10 months.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Non-inferiority was established if the upper confidence limit of the estimated HR was less than 1.33. We estimated that the required number of progression events would be 388. With a two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a power of 80%, we estimated that we would need 250 patients in each group to achieve the required number of events by 1.5 years after enrolment of the last patient. For the primary analysis, collection of the primary end point data was cut-off on 30 June 2012, and the number of confirmed events was 413.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The cut-off date for this updated analysis was 30 September 2013 (2.5 years after the last patient was enrolled, as prespecified in the protocol). We estimated time-dependent events with the Kaplan-Meier method. We calculated HRs and their CIs with a Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had been given and the treatment groups as covariates. The follow-up periods for PFS and OS were calculated separately for censored patients only. In addition, we performed interaction tests to assess treatment effects according to baseline characteristics, such as history of adjuvant chemotherapy. Early tumour shrinkage (ETS) was defined as &#x02265;20%&#x02009;decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of RECIST target lesions at 8 weeks as compared with the baseline value.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Depth of response (DpR) was defined as the percentage of tumour shrinkage, based on the longest diameters or reconstructed volume at the lowest point (nadir) as compared with the baseline value. In our study, DpR was calculated using the longest diameters, as done in the TRIBE study.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> All statistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.2 software. This trial is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (No. JapicCTI-090699).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Between February 1, 2009 and March 31, 2011, a total of 512 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab or SOX plus bevacizumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The previously reported primary analysis of the present study demonstrated that SOX plus bevacizumab is non-inferior to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in terms of PFS, the primary end&#x000a0;point.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As for the secondary end&#x000a0;point of OS, SOX plus bevacizumab was shown to be equivalent to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. However, at the primary analysis, the median follow-up time was 23.4 months, and many patients had censored data; the OS data were thus immature. In the present updated analysis, the median follow-up time was 37.7 months. Nonetheless, OS was similar for SOX plus bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. Moreover, SOX plus bevacizumab was reconfirmed to be non-inferior to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in terms of PFS, the primary end&#x000a0;point.</p><p>The results of subgroup analyses of OS showed a significant interaction between regimen and number of metastases (1 vs&#x000a0;&#x02265;2) and marginally significant interactions between regimen and lung metastases. SOX plus bevacizumab might have been more effective in these patients, but the reason for the interactions is unclear.</p><p>Recent phase III studies of patients with wild-type K-ras tumours have reported a MST of about 30 months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> In the TRIBE study, the MST of patients who received FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab was 29.8 months.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In our study, the MST in the SOX plus bevacizumab group was 29.6 months irrespective of K-ras status, which was non-inferior to that in patients who received FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab, a regimen combining three chemotherapeutic drugs with bevacizumab. Molecular-targeted agents and investigational drugs were used for third-line and subsequent treatment. Such subsequent treatment is considered one factor contributing to the prolonged survival. Recently, considerable attention has focused on ETS and DpR as prognostic factors for PFS and OS after first-line treatment of mCRC.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ETS was similar in patients who received SOX plus bevacizumab and those who received mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. Previous studies reported an ETS rate of 60%&#x02013;70% for FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor&#x000a0;(EGFR antibody.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In contrast, the ETS rate was about 50% for FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 12</xref> The ETS rate was thus lower in patients who received a two-drug chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab than in those who received chemotherapy plus an anti-EGFR antibody. However, the ETS rate in patients who received SOX plus bevacizumab was 64.2%, which was comparable to that in patients given chemotherapy plus an anti-EGFR antibody. In the TRIBE study, the median DpR rate was 37.8% for FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab and 43.4% for FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In our study, the median DpR rate was 43.5% in the SOX plus bevacizumab group, which was similar to that in the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group (44.4%) and comparable to the median DpR obtained after FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab. Good ETS and DpR were thus obtained in our study, which might have also contributed to OS. SOX plus bevacizumab can be given on an outpatient basis, with patients presenting at the hospital once every 3 weeks, and does not require placement of a CV port. It is thus more convenient for patients than mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. In addition, the incidence of grade 3 or higher neutropenia was distinctly lower with SOX plus bevacizumab than with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, making the former an easy-to-use regimen. A phase III study in South Korea showed that SOX is non-inferior to CapeOX as first-line treatment for mCRC.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The incidence of HFS was lower in patients who received SOX (14%) than in those who received CapeOX (31%), whereas the RR was significantly higher in the SOX group (47%) than that in the CapeOX group (36%). This finding also suggests that SOX plus bevacizumab can contribute to maintaining a good quality of life among patients. In this respect, SOX might be more advantageous to patients than CapeOX.</p><p>In conclusion, our updated analysis reconfirmed that SOX plus bevacizumab is non-inferior to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in terms of PFS in patients with mCRC who had not previously received chemotherapy. The MST was about 30 months and was similar in the SOX plus bevacizumab group and the mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab group. SOX plus bevacizumab is considered an effective regimen for first-line chemotherapy in patients with mCRC and can be used instead of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>We thank all the patients, their families, the investigators and medical staff.
