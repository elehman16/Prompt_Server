Therefore, reduction in the development of posttransplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) or its components should be a major management focus to optimize outcomes after liver transplantation.</p><p>Several studies have shown a link between weight gain, dyslipidemia, PTMS, and increased posttransplantation morbidity.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In a retrospective review of 455 liver transplant recipients from 1999 to 2004, the prevalence of obesity increased from 23.8% at 4 months to 40.8% at 3 years after liver transplant and predicted metabolic syndrome at 1 year posttransplant.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Prior CV disease, hypertension, and diabetes were also associated with increased CV risk. PTMS is associated with higher posttransplantation body mass index (BMI) and with a significantly increased risk of major vascular events.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>The basis of weight gain after liver transplantation is likely to be multifactorial, with an important contribution from immunosuppressive agents. Although a role of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression in weight gain, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in liver transplant recipients has been reported, the relative impact of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition (mTORi) on these factors has not. A study of weight gain in liver transplant patients receiving tacrolimus (TAC) versus cyclosporine A (CsA), with or without corticosteroids, demonstrated similar levels of weight gain between the 2 CNIs with a limited impact of corticosteroids.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, TAC use versus non&#x02013;CNI-based immunosuppression was associated with a reduced risk of CV disease in a retrospective review of 455 liver transplant recipients.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The signaling molecule mTOR is a regulator of cell mass and growth. In animal studies, the use of mTOR inhibitors has been associated with lower body mass when compared with CNIs.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>In liver transplant patients, mTOR inhibitors are known to contribute to dyslipidemia posttransplant.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The early introduction of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (EVR) in combination with reduced TAC is associated with improved renal function 2 years postliver transplantation.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, the effect of this immunosuppressive regimen on body weight and other PTMS related factors is less clear. The aim of the current study was to assess the comparative impact of mTOR inhibition on the course of posttransplant weight gain and the development of components of PTMS in subjects after liver transplantation using data collected in the randomized, controlled RAD001H2304 study.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design and Conduct</title><p>The methodology and inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study have been described in detail previously.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Briefly, this was a 24-month prospective, randomized, multicenter, 3-arm, parallel-group, open-label study in de novo liver transplant recipients during January 2008 to April 2012.

Weight gain posttransplant is also of interest in the context of rapidly increasing frequency of obesity-related liver disease (NASH) as an indication for liver transplantation. In animal studies, mTOR inhibitors have been associated with reduced weight gain compared with CNIs.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Here, we assessed the comparative impact of mTOR inhibition on the course of postliver transplant weight gain and PTMS from baseline to month 24 in 716 patients in the context of a prospective, randomized controlled trial.</p><p>The results of this study provide a unique opportunity to examine the relative effect of EVR on weight gain and components of the metabolic syndrome after liver transplantation. The most important result of this analysis is that that early introduction of EVR with reduced-exposure TAC at 1 month after liver transplantation reduced weight gain assessed at 1 and 2 years posttransplant. Weight gain was even lower in the TAC elimination arm, suggesting that the difference can be attributed to EVR. Stomatitis and mouth ulceration did not impact the extent or pattern of weight gain observed, when the low numbers of patients affected were removed from the analysis, as might be expected for these transitory AEs.</p><p>Subjects who are obese before liver transplantation are likely to remain obese, and those who are overweight may become obese after transplant,<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> with increased comorbidity and risk for major CV events.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the current study, subjects who were of normal weight at baseline who were treated with EVR plus reduced TAC gained less weight than those treated with TAC alone. Weight gain was also reduced in patients with optimal or near-optimal LDL cholesterol and normal HbA1c, suggesting that weight gain is linked to changes in other metabolic factors. Although the frequency of obesity increased posttransplant, there were no significant differences in rates of obesity between treatment arms. The impact of EVR-containing regimens on posttransplant weight gain may be more pronounced among patients with normal BMI at the time of transplantation. Although it is conceivable that there may have been a group of malnourished recipients regaining muscle mass and restoring their nutritional status after liver transplantation, detected as weight gain, there were very few patients who were underweight or had a significant extent of muscle wastage before transplantation in this study and nutritional parameters, such as albumin were not lower in the TAC control arm. Longer, larger studies will be required to determine the impact, if any, of weight gain on posttransplant mortality and/or graft loss.</p><p>The frequency of hypertension increased from baseline over the course of the study, but did not differ significantly between treatment arms. Notably, patients with hypertension, defined as SBP &#x02265;140, gained significantly less weight when treated with EVR-containing regimens than in the TAC control arms. This could in part arise due to additional medication and lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing hypertension. The findings here indicate that EVR does not exacerbate hypertension in liver transplant patients.</p><p>The increased incidence of hyperlipidemia with EVR-containing regimens observed in this study is a known effect of mTOR inhibitors. However, despite the significantly greater increase in LDL and triglycerides, this did not translate into an increased rate of PTMS among EVR-treated patients. The effect of HDL increase at month 24 may offset some of these LDL and triglyceride findings. This suggests that EVR does not exacerbate PTMS. The reduction in weight gain observed with EVR may in part counter the lipid effects. Despite the rise in cholesterol, no increase in cardiac events was observed with EVR. The first line approach to the treatment of hyperlipidemia is lifestyle change through diet, exercise and weight loss<sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>; in those who have maximized lifestyle intervention, statins are effective in reducing CV risk. Weight gain is more challenging to treat.</p><p>Although glycosylated hemoglobin showed a slightly greater increase with EVR-containing regimens in the first year after transplantation, this difference was no longer present at 24 months, potentially due to the use of concomitant glucose-lowering medication. Similarly, to the effects observed with lipids, this transient increase HbA1c does not translate into an increased occurrence of PTMS with EVR. Despite the increase in glycosylated hemoglobin, the rates of diabetes at baseline and after transplantation were similar across the 3 regimens compared. A previous study of diabetes and posttransplant risk found that while diabetes at time of liver transplantation is associated with reduced posttransplant survival, an additive effect was observed for obesity and diabetes.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Whether the reduction in weight gain with EVR-containing regimens, and the absence of any increase in PTMS, translates into long term benefits will require longer follow-up posttransplantation. The impact of lower weight on allograft steatosis and recurrent NASH cannot be addressed in this study. The rates of NASH as an indication for liver transplantation were low, which may reflect the earlier period for recruitment of the study.</p><p>In line with the data previously reported for the RAD001H2304 study,<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the analysis of laboratory measures at 12 and 24 months showed improved kidney function measures with the EVR-containing regimens compared to TAC control. Renal failure rates were also lower in the EVR-containing arms. Since obesity has been linked with chronic renal disease,<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reducing obesity may have even further long-term renal benefits. Patients treated with EVR had higher mean CPK values than controls, which may be attributable to muscle-specific inactivation of mTOR leading to dystrophic effects, as demonstrated in mice.<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Mean values remained with normal ranges, however.</p><p>Many of the study subjects met the criteria for PTMS at baseline. Of those patients with newly occurring PTMS, there were no significant differences between treatment arms in rates of occurrence. Overall, there were no differences in rates of CV adverse events between treatment arms.</p><p>There are several limitations to the current analysis. First, this is a post hoc assessment of weight gain and other parameters. The impact of the attenuated weight gain observed in participants who received EVR is uncertain. In the nontransplant setting, weight gain is strongly correlated with the frequency and severity of components of the metabolic syndrome. The impact of weight gain after liver transplantation, however, has not been well defined. It is also possible that the duration of study follow-up in our analysis (2 years), while long for clinical trials in transplantation, may have been too short to observe any impact on medical consequences of obesity, which can take years to manifest. The open-label design of RAD001H2304 was necessitated by the requirement for careful adjustment of EVR and TAC exposure, but represents a further limitation. The control regimen&#x02014;TAC with steroids either continued or withdrawn 6 months post liver transplant&#x02014;is a standard immunosuppressive regimen, although an addition of mycophenolic acid (to enable lower TAC exposure) has become more common since the protocol was developed. The rates of NASH were low and cryptogenic disease was not separately identified in the analysis. Finally, the study was not powered to detect differences in relatively infrequent 2 year adverse events, such as cardiac events.</p><p>EVR with reduced-exposure TAC decreased post liver transplantation weight gain at 1 and 2 years posttransplant in comparison to a standard TAC containing immunosuppression regimen. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the long-term impact of the reduced weight gain on the development of PTMS, CV complications and related outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>M.C., Novartis paid research support to institution, consulting paid to self.
