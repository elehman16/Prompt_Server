All adults (&#x02265;18&#x02005;years) undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with preoperative placement of an intrabiliary stent will be considered eligible. Exclusion criteria will include patient age &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years and those receiving long-term glucocorticoids. The trial will employ block randomisation to allocate patients to a commercial dual-ring wound protector (the Alexis Wound Protector) or no wound protector and the current standard of care. The main outcome measure will be the rate of surgical site infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 30&#x02005;days of the index operation date as determined by a research assistant blinded to treatment allocation. Outcomes will be analysed by a statistician blinded to allocation status by calculating risk ratios and 95% CIs and compared using Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This will be the first randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.

This condition has consistently been reported to account for up to 25% of all healthcare-associated infections.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Prolonged hospitalisation, more frequent hospital re-admissions after surgery and a greater than twofold increase in costs and mortality have consistently been associated with this condition over the past decade.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As such, an increasing number of studies have cited an urgent need for safe and effective primary and secondary SSI prevention strategies, especially given the rising incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in hospital environments.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>As most cases of SSI are incisional, they are most often restricted to the skin or subcutaneous and deep soft tissues within the incision.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These types of SSI are associated with an increased risk of postsurgical pain, poor wound healing and aesthetic results and an increased risk of incisional hernias.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Antibiotic pharmacotherapy; need for intermittent dressing changes and/or wound debridement, prolonged hospitalisation and after-discharge ambulatory or outpatient care; as well as lost personal work productivity and indirect medical costs also incur significant costs to the patient and healthcare system.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In order to minimise the risk of SSI, several perioperative care interventions, including skin cleansing, hair removal, hypothermia prevention and perioperative antibiotic therapy, have been extensively studied over the past two decades.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, few studies of the efficacy of surgical primary prevention manoeuvres aimed at reducing contamination within the surgical site exist, especially among patients undergoing prolonged and complex gastrointestinal operations. Thus, surgical procedures classified as contaminated or dirty (based on greater bacterial load within the surgical site and/or the elective or emergency opening of gastrointestinal or biliary tracts) remain associated with at least a twofold increased risk of wound infection as compared with clean and clean&#x02013;contaminated surgeries.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Developing a more effective and reproducible primary prevention strategy for incisional SSIs among patients undergoing contaminated or dirty abdominal operations is therefore arguably a logical step towards further reducing the risk of SSI.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Wound protectors</title><p>The use of adhesive membrane barriers over the skin of the surgical site emerged 50&#x02005;years ago as a possible solution to minimise endogenous cross-contamination during surgery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The initial idea relied on the principle of reducing exposure of the surgical site to bacteria inherent in the surrounding skin or to airborne bacteria in the operating room. Major applicability was expected in clean surgeries, where the skin is considered the main source of bacteria. Unfortunately, however, no evidence in support of plastic adhesive drapes was found in a recently updated systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including five studies and 3082 participants.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In fact, a 23% increase in the risk of SSI was found in the group that received adhesive drapes.</p><p>In the 1960s, other devices were described and then developed based on the concept of combining a non-traumatic surgical wound retractor with a protective membrane covering of the incisional margin in abdominal surgeries. Such protective covers or &#x02018;wound protectors&#x02019; were hypothesised to be an improvement over adhesive membrane barriers as they were believed to reduce intraoperative contamination while concomitantly preserving the temperature and humidity of the surgical wound. In support of this hypothesis, early studies demonstrated reduced exposure of the surgical wound to enteric bacteria at the end of gastrointestinal operations.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These results were further supported by several RCTs, which demonstrated that wound protectors were efficacious in reducing the incidence of incisional SSI as compared to usual care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgeries.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>A recently conducted meta-analysis of RCTs by our group, conducted in preparation for the trial described herein, evaluated whether diverse types of wound protectors may reduce the risk of SSI among patients undergoing gastrointestinal or biliary surgery.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Among six trials, which enrolled 1008 patients,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we found that the pooled estimated risk of SSI among patients fitted with wound protectors during surgery was 0.55 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.98) times the pooled estimated risk of SSI in control groups. Moreover, among patients treated with dual-ring versus single-ring wound protectors, the pooled estimated risk of SSI was 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.67) times the pooled estimated risk in the control groups. As blinding status of outcome assessors was identified as a significant source of between-study heterogeneity, the design of the wound protector as well as the method of outcome classification may be important considerations for the design of future wound protector trials.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>SSI in Whipple's procedures with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents</title><p>Over the past several decades, an increasing number of Whipple's procedures or pancreaticoduodenectomies have been performed. Major reasons include its expanding indications, an increasing ability to detect resectable pancreaticoduodenal lesions earlier in the course of the patient's disease, improvements in surgical technique and reduced perioperative mortality in high volume centres.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, despite a number of studies aimed at understanding whether technical factors contribute to outcome,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> postoperative morbidity remains high, ranging from 38% to 50%, and mostly comprised of infectious complications.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Thus, newer studies have examined the importance of a broader approach that involves revising preoperative risk assessment,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and refinement of the indications for preoperative biliary drainage.</p><p>Although preoperative biliary drainage was initially thought to lead to improved outcomes among patients awaiting surgery with bile duct obstruction (which frequently results from a regional mass effect secondary to the pancreaticobiliary pathology), this effect has not yet been demonstrated.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> As such, preoperative biliary drainage is now selectively used in some centres, especially among patients who are to receive neoadjuvant therapy, as well as for patients with jaundice complicated by cholangitis, impeding renal failure and other complications.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Despite this, prolonged waiting time for pancreaticoduodenectomy, such as frequently occurs in ours and many other institutions, is a common and acceptable reason for use of preoperative biliary drainage, which aims to avoid the higher risk of complications associated with prolonged bile duct obstruction.</p><p>While the precise indications for preoperative biliary drainage are still undergoing debate,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> the association between preoperative biliary drainage, bile colonisation with bacteria and other microorganisms and an increased risk of infectious complications has repeatedly been demonstrated. In the early 2000s, three large cohort studies from tertiary care centres provided data supporting an increased risk of infectious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy preceded by biliary drainage procedures. In one of these studies, the risk of infectious complications was 41% with preoperative biliary drainage versus 25% without preoperative biliary drainage among 240 consecutive patients who received a pancreaticoduodenectomy.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Moreover, the odds of surgical wound infection has been reported to be 3.4 times higher among those that underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and received preoperative biliary drainage as compared to those who did not.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Thus, while preoperative biliary drainage may always be indicated for some patients, this treatment is likely associated with a high risk of associated SSIs.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Objective</title><p>Although incisional SSIs represent a common infectious complication following pancreaticoduodenectomy associated with preoperative use of intrabiliary stents,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> the efficacy and safety of wound protectors for reducing postoperative SSI has not yet been studied. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector versus no wound protector and the current standard of care for reducing the risk of 30-day incisional SSI among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>This study will be a single-centre, parallel-group, dual-arm RCT.

As we hypothesise superiority of the dual-ring wound protector over the current standard of care, we plan to examine for evidence of this in statistical hypothesis tests.

We therefore expect a more reliable, and higher, incidence of incisional SSI in our control group as compared to reports from previous retrospective studies. We also anticipate an accordingly greater absolute reduction in the incidence of incisional SSI in the wound protector group.</p><p>A too large sample size may have been initially calculated based on the limited and conservative parameters of incisional SSI incidence assumed for the study groups. Even so, our plan to finish recruitment and data collection in a 2&#x02013;3-years period is justified by the high volume of Whipple's procedure at FMC, and the wide use of preoperative biliary stenting due to our long wait times for surgery.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We will utilise an intention to treat analysis for the evaluation of all outcomes. All continuous variables will be summarised using histograms and measures of central tendency before statistical analyses are performed. Normal, continuous outcomes will be compared using t tests while non-normal, continuous outcomes will be compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Categorical data will be summarised using proportions and by calculating risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. These data will be compared using Fisher's exact test.</p><p>All tests will be two-sided, and those with a p value &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Although the calculation of our primary outcome will be unadjusted for our primary analyses, if covariate imbalances occur between groups despite randomisation we will also adjust our RR estimates using a generalised linear model with a log link and binomial distribution (or a related model where necessary) as a sensitivity analysis. If this is performed, the unadjusted (primary) and adjusted (sensitivity) analyses will be reported in the manuscript. In addition to the calculation of the overall RR for SSI at 30&#x02005;days, we will also conduct a subgroup analysis stratified by the type of operative procedure (palliative bypass vs curative resection). Stata/IC V.12.0 (Stata Corp. LP, College Station, Texas, USA) and R V.3.0.1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) will be used for the conduct of all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This will be the first RCT to assess whether a dual-ring wound protector is efficacious in reducing the risk of incisional SSI among adults undergoing Whipple's procedure preceded by preoperative placement of intrabiliary stents. As wound infection in this population is common and highly morbid, it may comprise a particularly suitable scenario for primary prevention through the use of abdominal wound protectors. Trial results are expected to be publicly available in 2016/2017.</p><p>Our results will be disseminated to surgeons through an integrated and end-of-grant knowledge translation strategy. The International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association, along with its Regional Associations and National Chapters represent a dynamic and consistent network integrating hepatobiliary surgeons across five continents. Two of our investigators (ED, CGB) are stakeholders in this organisation, and will be engaged throughout the conduct of the trial, from the setting of research questions through to the dissemination of results. After completion of the trial, results will be presented at major surgical and hepatobiliary surgery meetings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e195" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005577.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e196" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005577.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CGB is the principal investigator and together with ED, FRS and OB has coordinated and actively participated in all the phases of trial design.
