Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is effective in relieving patients&#x02019; symptoms and improving function. It is, however, associated with substantial risk of complications, pain and major functional limitation before patients can return to full function. In contrast, hip arthroscopy (HA) is less invasive and can postpone THA. However, there is no evidence regarding the delay in the need for THA that patients would find acceptable to undergoing HA. Knowing patients&#x02019; values and preferences (VP) on this expected delay is critical when making recommendations regarding the advisability of HA. Furthermore, little is known on the optimal amount of information regarding interventions and outcomes needed to present in order to optimally elicit patients&#x02019; VP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will perform a multinational, structured interview-based survey of preference in delay time for THA among patients with non-advanced OA who failed to respond to conservative therapy. We will combine these interviews with a randomised trial addressing the optimal amount of information regarding the interventions and outcomes required to elicit preferences. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to either a short or a long format of health scenarios of THA and HA. We will determine each patient's VP using a trade-off and anticipated regret exercises. Our primary outcomes for the combined surveys will be: (1) the minimal delay time in the need for THA surgery that patients would find acceptable to undertaking HA, (2) patients&#x02019; satisfaction with the amount of information provided in the health scenarios used to elicit their VPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB13-506). We will disseminate our study findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and make them available to guideline makers issuing recommendations addressing HA and THA.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Patients' values and preference</kwd><kwd>Total Hip Arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Hip Arthroscopy</kwd><kwd>Patient Written Information</kwd><kwd>Decision Making</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Osteoarthritis and surgical options</title><sec id="s1a1"><title>Osteoarthritis</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic arthritis. Approximately 15% of men and women suffer from symptomatic OA,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> representing a large burden on patients, the healthcare system and society. Symptomatic hip OA is a particularly disabling condition with a cumulative lifetime risk of up to 25%. Conservative management of hip OA includes exercise, weight reduction, physical therapy and medications focusing on relieving symptoms, improving joint function and optimising the quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for severe OA are, however, substantially less effective than surgical treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Consequently, most patients with severe hip OA eventually need total hip arthroplasty (THA).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Total hip arthroplasty</title><p>With an ageing population increasingly interested in staying physically active,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> the frequency and cost of THA continues to grow. Currently, more than a half million THA procedures are performed annually in the UK and USA alone, and in 2010 the global market was estimated to be as high as US$4.7 billion. <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>After the failure of conservative treatment, THA is usually effective in relieving patients&#x02019; symptoms and improving function, with more than 95% prosthesis survivorship at 10-year follow-up and more than 80% survivorship at 25-year follow-up.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, THA is also a major procedure, associated with a substantial risk of complications, and with weeks of pain and major functional limitations before patients can return to full function. Therefore, patients and caregivers are interested in less invasive interventions that could postpone THA.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Hip arthroscopy</title><p>Less invasive interventions include arthroscopy, partial replacements and bone-preserving techniques. They have shown varying success rates among patients with OA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hip arthroscopy (HA) is a new and also the fastest growing procedure within orthopaedic surgery. <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the number of HAs performed is expected to double in the USA in 2013 compared with 2011.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> HA is used to treat intra-articular pathology of the hip, including mild hip OA. Compared with THA, it has the advantages of being minimally invasive and having fewer complications.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Compared with THA, arthroscopy may help patients achieve a higher level of function more quickly with, over the short term, less restriction on exercise. The expectation, however, is that patients&#x02019; underlying OA will progress and THA will ultimately become necessary. The question then arises: what delay in the need for THA would warrant a patient undergoing HA? This is a question of values and preferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Measuring patients values and preferences</title><p>There are a number of techniques available for eliciting patients&#x02019; direct choices of which the probabilistic version of the threshold technique, also called the probability trade-off exercise, is widely used.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Following descriptive and probabilistic information regarding the benefits and harms associated with treatment choices&#x02014;for example, treatment A and B&#x02014;in which the relative benefits of treatment A versus B are large, the respondent is asked to choose one option. Typically, patients will choose treatment A. The interviewer then presents an alternative situation in which the relative benefits of A versus B are very small, and patients typically choose B. The interviewer then presents a small reduction in the probability of benefits, relative to the first scenario, for option A. If the patient continues to choose A, the next scenario presents a small increase in the benefits of A versus B relative to the second scenario. The process is repeated until the indifference point between A and B is established (ping-pong approach).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Utility elicitation uses a very different approach, presenting health states and using one of a variety of techniques to elicit the respondent's rating of the value of the health state on a scale between death (typically 0) and full health (typically 1.0 or 100). The patients&#x02019; responses are used to build a decision model that calculates the treatment option that, given the patient's utilities, achieves the maximum utility-adjusted outcome.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Complementary approaches to assess patients&#x02019; decision-making integrate emotional aspects of the process. One such approach focuses on regret, an aversive emotion people experience when they believe their current situation would have been better had they acted differently in the past.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In theory, regret is influenced by intuitive, affect-based, and analytical, deliberative processes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Reflecting on the anticipated regret of particular decisions (eg, choosing A vs B in the example above) may alert people to the choice that would be most likely to avoid this aversive emotion.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The anticipated regret theory-based approach preserves a rational decision-making framework, while allowing anticipation of the effect of the decision on emotions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Using both (direct choice) trade-off and anticipated regret exercises, our study will provide empirical evidence regarding the delay in the need for THA that patients would find acceptable to undergoing HA.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Amount of information presented to elicit patients&#x02019; values and preferences</title><p>The choices patients make are critically dependent on how the health scenario (HS) that characterises the processes and outcomes of the alternative management options (A and B in the above&#x02014;THA and HA in the current project) is presented. Research in marketing has addressed some of the relevant issues. The information-processing framework<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> suggests that that there are limits to the human ability to assimilate and process information, and that once these limits are surpassed, behaviour becomes confused and dysfunctional.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Evidence suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between information available and decision quality, in which individuals with too little or too much information made poorer decisions than those with an intermediate amount of information.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Other indirect evidence comes from research on written consent forms.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Individuals often skim over consent forms for clinical trials in oncology if they are longer than 1000 words or four pages.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Twenty-seven oncology trials showed that patients obtained significantly higher objective knowledge when the consent form page count was seven or less.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In the area of pharmaceutical product choice, participants have had a better understanding of shorter and easier information presentations.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One might expect, however, that if the information becomes limited, the decision quality will deteriorate.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Patients&#x02019; values and preferences on OA surgical options</title><p>Given the existing evidence, both HA and THA represent reasonable choices for patients with non-advanced OA. The choice may, however, be challenging. On the one hand, HA is likely to achieve only transient improvement in function. On the other hand, the morbidity associated with THA is substantial.</p><p>Therefore, one of the key aspects in the choice between HA and THA is the duration of delay in the need for THA that patients may achieve with HA. If patients demand a delay time much greater than HA can realistically achieve, the procedure should seldom be considered. On the other hand, if patients would be satisfied with a much shorter delay time, the procedure should be frequently considered. There is currently no empirical evidence addressing patients&#x02019; values and preferences regarding the delay they would demand to undertake HA. Knowing typical patients&#x02019; values and preferences regarding this expected delay is likely to be helpful for patients and healthcare providers in the clinical encounter and for guideline panellists when making recommendations regarding the advisability of HA.</p><p>The assessment of patients&#x02019; values and preferences will be valid only to the extent patients receive sufficiently accurate information on the outcomes of available treatment options presented in ways that they can easily process. Thus far, only limited indirect evidence informs us on the optimal amount of information to provide in scenarios when eliciting patients&#x02019; preferences.</p><p>Our study will provide direct empirical evidence on the optimal amount of information to provide when eliciting patients&#x02019; values and preferences. It may also provide insight into the amount of information to provide in shared decision-making, although our study only indirectly addresses that issue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The purpose of this study is to improve the management of patients with non-advanced symptomatic hip OA who failed conservative treatment by determining their values and preferences regarding the choice between immediate THA versus HA.</p><p><italic>In the <bold>Pilot stage</bold> of our study, we will assess the following feasibility issues</italic>: (1) recruitment rate; (2) length of time to conduct the interview and fill out all the study measurements; (3) potential personnel and data management issues.</p><p><italic>In <bold>Study 1</bold>&#x02014;</italic>our primary objective is to determine the minimal delay time in the need for THA surgery that patients would find acceptable to undertake HA (which we will refer to as the &#x02018;delay time&#x02019;).

Indirect evidence suggests that friends or family members&#x02019; medical advice may influence patients&#x02019; preference on medical decisions.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Men, African-American men in particular, are more inclined to discuss their medication concerns and to seek medical advice from trusted friends more frequently than women.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Women are more often inclined to solicit medical advice from their family members. Identifying the factors that may influence patients&#x02019; preferences could provide valuable explanations for the variation on patients&#x02019; values and preferences in future research. Knowing patients&#x02019; previous perception on certain treatment options can help clinicians to explain certain things more clearly and makes clinical consultation more efficient.</p><p>Fourth, we will check for consistencies in the minimal delay patients with HA find THA surgery acceptable. If participants have discrepant answers between the trade-off and anticipated regret exercise, we will provide them the opportunity to change their responses. Interviewers will test patients&#x02019; understanding of the information presented using standardised questions and rate respondents&#x02019; understanding based on their judgement. This ensures the validity of patients&#x02019; values and preference elicitation.</p><p>Our study plan also has limitations. There are conceptual limitations to the anticipated regret exercise. For instance, no one has studied the relationship between anticipated regret and actual regret subsequently experienced. If we find important discrepancies between anticipated regret and the trade-off exercise, the interpretation may be challenging; in particular, it may remain uncertain which method better represents patients&#x02019; real preference. Subsequent studies may be needed to address such questions arising from our results.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Implications</title><p>Although there is increasing awareness regarding shared decision-making and patient centred care, the explicit consideration of values and preferences in the care of individual patients and in the recommendations made by clinical practice guidelines remains limited.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;36</xref></p><p>Given the existing evidence, the choice between HA and THA for patients with non-advanced OA is challenging. The research outlined in this protocol will provide explicit, quantitative expressions of patients&#x02019; valuations of their expected delay of HA on THA. This information will alert clinicians to this issue and may provide guidance in their interactions with patients. It will certainly provide crucial information for guideline developers making recommendations for clinical practice. Identifying the factors that may influence patients&#x02019; preferences could provide insight into variations in the broader perspective of patients&#x02019; values and preferences in future research.</p><p>Our protocol also addresses some of the limitations of the previous studies in the field of written medical information regarding using an adequate amount of information in patients&#x02019; values and preference assessment. Results will have implications for clinical practice in terms of providing patients with the right amount of information in the shared decision-making process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e326" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005536.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e327" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005536.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Matti Sepp&#x000e4;nen, Teppo J&#x000e4;rvinen, Daniel Nightingale, Darryl Yardley, Gloria Preston and Colleen Cupido for their feedbacks on the Health Scenarios.
