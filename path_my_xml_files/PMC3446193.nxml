Jaundice is benign mostly, but if it continues for prolonged periods of time and if the bilirubin level is markedly elevated, it can lead to kernicterus and permanent brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]; social costs imposed on society is large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Newborn infants must be monitored to recognize those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Thus, it is important to treat and abate jaundice quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>].</p><p>Phototherapy is accepted as the primary treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. This treatment also puts the baby at risk of important complications including retinal injury, dehydration, diarrhea and bronze baby syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Therefore, searches in order to reduce the time of phototherapy by a safer treatment have been considered for many years.</p><p>Herbal therapy has recently received particular attention in the search for bilirubin-reducing substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. It is estimated that about 70-80% of people rely on plant resources in traditional medicine to meet their primary health care needs. WHO proposed the use of medicinal plants due to less side effects and complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays in various traditional medications a variety of herbal items are being prescribed to jaundiced infants, often in combination with modern treatment such as phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Their medicinal properties have, however, not been investigated by properly conducted studies, so extensive scientific studies to determine the therapeutic efficacy and potential harmful effects as well as to ascertain safety of the various herbal items are warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>A number of case series have been published showing that herbal treatment using <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> and other herbs resulted in more speedy subsidence of jaundice than those who were treated with western medicines. In the English literature, there is a report on a study investigating the effect of Artemisia, Gardenia, Rheum officinale, and Scutellaria on bilirubin metabolism in rats. Findings showed that treatment with these herbs resulted in induction of UDP-glucuronide-transferase and C-glutathi-one-transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>].</p><p>Yin Zhi Huang contains extracts from four different plants: <italic>Artemisia capillaris, Gardenia jasminoides</italic> Ellis, <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> Baill, and <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi, and have been used for centuries in Asia to prevent and treat neonatal jaundice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Several clinical reports in Chinese medical literature indicate that Yin Zhi Huang treatment can enhance bilirubin clearance in newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. In Iran, limited studies on the effects of herbal medicines in treatment of hyperbilirubinemia have been conducted. Medicinal plants were used by the ancient Iranian families for treatment of neonatal jaundice commonly including <italic>Alhagi pseudoalhagi</italic> (Fruit), <italic>Fumaria parviflora</italic> (whole), <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> (Fruit), Purgative <italic>manna</italic>, and <italic>Chicorium intybus</italic> (whole) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic>, a member of the family Rhamnaceae, is used in India for jaundice treatment traditionally; also is in China[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. There are many drug samples from this plant in different areas of Iran. No side effects have been reported, so they seem to be safe to use[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite common using of this herbal drug in treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in many parts of Iran especially in Kohkiloyeh-Boyerahmad province, its effectiveness remains doubtful and no convincing evidence, either pharmacological or epidemiological, has demonstrated its usefulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The evaluation of the role of this herbal treatment in neonatal jaundice requires properly conducted randomized clinical trials. This study investigated and evaluated effects and side effects of <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> on jaundiced neonates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0006"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This double blind clinical-trial study was carried out at Imam Sajjad Hospital, Yasuj. The protocol used in this study was approved by the institutional ethical committee on human research, and legal representatives of all patients signed an informed consent.</p><p>From April 2008 through March 2009, all 2 and 14 day old neonates hospitalized with jaundice, without any other diseases, were randomly assigned into control group (phototherapy with distilled water) and experimental group (<italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> fruit extract and phototherapy). No one at the local site was aware of the patient's group assignment. The fruits of <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> were collected from Khorasan Province of Iran. The plants were identified by the herbalist. A voucher specimen (H, No. 622) was deposited at Herbal Research Center Laboratory at University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. After collecting, the known species of fruits were dried at 40&#x000b0;C for about 1 week, then drying process continued in room temperature at 30&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C. The dried fruits were cored and crushed This material was ground into powder using mortar and pestle and sieved. The Jujuba fruit extract was provided under sterile conditions and with the quality and microbial control. In brief, the dried and crushed <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> fruit (5 kg) was extracted two times with distilled water in the temperature of 50<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C and vacuum conditions to appropriate concentration (1 mg/ml) (with a yield of 10% dried material from 500g of the powdered plant). Material was steeped in 600 ml of distilled water and heated in water bath for 3 hours at 50<sup>o</sup>C. The mixture was left to cool to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was later freeze-dried yielding a residue corresponding to 1g/ml.</p><p>Concentrated extract was stored in -20&#x000b0;C temperature until usage. To make it ready for use, this extract was solved in distilled water and sterilized in the autoclave. The extract was given to the baby 0.15 milliliter (150 mg) per kg body weight three times a day.</p><p>The serum bilirubin level was measured in both groups prior to the beginning of treatment and 12 hours after and then every 24 hours of treatment till discharge. Free Bilirubin level during hospitalization in both groups was measured in the hospital laboratory by the Diazo Blank method.</p><p>Babies who needed exchange transfusion or developed other diseases such as infection in the course of the study were excluded. Demographic data, stool and urine, were also recorded. Data was analyzed by SPSS 16 software using Mann-Whitney test and ANOVA test and results reported as Mean&#x000b1;SD. <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec><sec id="S0007"><title>Findings</title><p>A total of 121 full term infants (71 [59%] boys and 50 [41%] girls) entered the study.

During last several decades, phototherapy had been used to treat neonatal jaundice. Recently, however, both older and more recent pharmacological approaches in the field of jaundice have been considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>].</p><p>Herbal therapy has recently received special attention in searches for bilirubin-reducing substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. There are also numerous remedies for jaundice in various traditional medicines. Medicinal plants such as Rhubarb, Licorice and Gardenia are mainly used for neonatal jaundice in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>].</p><p>In studies on rats, Yin Zhi Huang, consisting of four plants, had somewhat more potent stimulatory effect on clearance of bilirubin compared with Phenobarbital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Yeung et al reported <italic>in-vitro</italic> effect of a popular Chinese herb, <italic>Artemisia scoparia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. Similar study was done with <italic>Coptis chinensis/japonicum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, traditionally, jujube is used prophylactically for liver diseases. In northern China, the infusion and decoction of <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic>'s fruit are asserted as useful natural remedies for management and/or hepatitis control in folks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. In the belief of Indian and Chinese system of medicine, <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> has hepatoprotective role in treatment of hepatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. It is also prescribed as a tonic to reinforce liver function and in treatment of jaundice. No studies have been conducted with healthy volunteers. Toxicity has been tested on mice, and doses of 150 g/kg revealed no signs of toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. Beside dosage of the extract, characteristics of patients should be considered as limitations of the study.</p><p>Due to this study the average level of bilirubin in experimental group was higher which was noticeably different from that in the control group. Results showed higher clearance rate in experimental group; reduction of the amount of bilirubin in first 12 hours in the experimental group was faster than in the control group, which may be due to impact of the <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> extract in reduction of bilirubin concentrations by means of increase in urination frequency and defecation which leads to decrease in entero-hepatic circulation. Results showed that <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> was effective in treatment of neonatal jaundice in the first twelve hours in comparison with control group, but was not effective in consecutive days. Evaluation of the neonates&#x02019; hospitalization days due to jaundice indicated statistically insignificant decrease in experimental group compared with control group.</p><p>
<italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> fruit contains specific sugars (2.17 to 6.5 percent), protein, vitamin C and minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>], and laxative effect which reduces entero-hepatic circulation due to higher defecation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. As the experiment was done on humans and no reliable research was found to prove the safety of <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic>, high doses of any drug, as well as the herbal agents, cannot be prescribed because of probable side effects and toxicities which make limitations for any treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S0009"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that <italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> extract is safe and effective for short time usage but not effective for long time consumption in treatment of neonatal jaundice; also further studies are needed to test the efficacy and safety of the extract and to find possible materials and methods to combine in order to achieve more effective and safer treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are grateful to the vice chancellor of the Yasuj University for financial support.
