Although obese and inactive children have elevated values, any potentially protective role of elementary school physical education is unknown. Our objective was to determine the effect of a modern elementary school physical education (PE) program on the blood lipid concentrations in community-based children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, 708 healthy children (8.1&#x000b1;0.3 years, 367 boys) in 29 schools were allocated to either a 4-year intervention program of specialist-taught PE (13 schools) or to a control group of the currently practiced PE conducted by generalist classroom teachers. Fasting blood lipids were measured at ages 8, 10, and 12 years and intervention and control class activities were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intervention classes included more fitness work and more moderate and vigorous physical activity than control classes (both p&#x0003c;0.001). With no group differences at baseline, the percentage of 12 year-old boys and girls with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, &#x0003e;3.36mmol.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,130 mg/dL) was lower in the intervention than control group (14% vs. 23%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). There was also an intervention effect on mean LDL-C across all boys (reduction of 9.6% for intervention v 2.8% control, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02), but not girls (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2). The intervention effect on total cholesterol mirrored LDL-C, but there were no detectable 4-year intervention effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PE program delivered by specialist teachers over four years in elementary school reduced the incidence of elevated LDL-C in boys and girls, and provides a means by which early preventative practices can be offered to all children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ANZRN12612000027819 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=347799">https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=347799</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Sources of funding were The Commonwealth Education Trust (New Zealand House, London, UK) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.commonwealth.org.uk/">http://www.commonwealth.org.uk/</ext-link>) and the Canberra Hospital Salaried Staff Specialists Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthresearch.anu.edu.au/documents/PPFVACATION/ppf-major-info-2012.pdf">http://healthresearch.anu.edu.au/documents/PPFVACATION/ppf-major-info-2012.pdf</ext-link>).

Given that overweight <xref rid="pone.0076124-Lamb1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and insufficiently active children <xref rid="pone.0076124-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> are more likely to possess elevated lipid levels, the challenge is to identify and implement strategies capable of reducing obesity and increasing physical activity across the general community.</p><p>An obvious opportunity to mount such a challenge in children is during their attendance at school, especially as physical education (PE) is usually a mandatory component of the elementary (primary) school curriculum. However, whilst modern accurate data were not available from Australian jurisdictions, few specialist PE teachers appear to be employed in the public elementary school systems. For example, in 30 randomly selected primary schools in the local jurisdiction, where planning and educational philosophy were similar to most other states, there were 2 specialists teaching PE. Consequently, the responsibility for delivering a PE program falls on the general classroom teachers, but along with increasing pressure to improve academic standards, generalist teachers themselves have reported difficulties in teaching PE effectively <xref rid="pone.0076124-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The primary objective of this investigation was to determine whether a well-constructed program of specialist taught PE over the final four years of elementary school could benefit lipid profiles. A secondary objective was to determine whether any such effect could be explained by changes in physical activity, fitness or body composition. This was part of a larger multidisciplinary study, the Lifestyle of our Kids (LOOK) study <xref rid="pone.0076124-Telford1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, areas of investigation including cardiovascular risk <xref rid="pone.0076124-Sakuragi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, body composition <xref rid="pone.0076124-Telford2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, academic performance<xref rid="pone.0076124-Telford3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, bone geometry <xref rid="pone.0076124-Ducher1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, body image <xref rid="pone.0076124-Olive1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0076124-Telford4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and pediatric blood reference ranges <xref rid="pone.0076124-Southcott1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Because a control group devoid of PE was not possible, our control group consisted of children whose PE was delivered by general classroom teachers; and to highlight differences in the two programs we employed a systematic method of class observation to classify key characteristics. Consequently we were able to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the effectiveness of the specialist PE program and the current practice of classroom teacher PE to modify lipid profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study in its entirety was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research at the Australian Institute of Sport; parental consent was obtained for all measures and children understood their participation was entirely voluntary.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and Design</title><p>The general schema of this cluster-randomized trial is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076124-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

Class sizes were typically around 25 children and all classes consisted of approximately equal number of boys and girls. As an introductory summary of our design, the intervention consisted of two 50 minute classes of PE conducted by 3 visiting specialist PE teachers, assigned to 13 schools. This replaced 100 minutes of the current curriculum requirement of 150 min/week PE, a requirement all teachers reported to have satisfied. The control group consisted of the usual practice of PE conducted by generalist classroom teachers. To avoid any potential contamination of methodology, intervention and control groups were allocated into separate schools, hence our cluster-randomized design. A condition of inclusion was for parents to indicate in writing that children were in good health, able to participate in vigorous physical activity, willing to provide a venous blood sample, undertake a DEXA scan, participate in fitness and physical activity assessments and likely to remain in school for the four years duration of the study. Notice of acceptance and written informed consent was received from the parents of 708 eligible children, 73% of those invited. Following acceptance, two members of the research team used the sealed envelope system to allocate schools to the intervention and control groups.

Body mass was also measured using portable electronic scales to 0.05 kg and height by a portable stadiometer to 0.001 m.

The socioeconomic status of each school suburb was accessed through Australian government Bureau of Statistics <xref rid="pone.0076124-Australian2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We used a published socioeconomic index that designated advantage (high values) and disadvantage (low values) derived from variables such as income, educational attainment, and employment. The mean and standard deviation of this index for the suburbs in our study (1085&#x000b1;40 and range 982&#x02013;1160) was higher (with a smaller range) than Australia-wide (980&#x000b1;84, 598&#x02013;1251).</p><p>All the technicians, with the sole exception of one involved with physical activity and fitness measurements, were blinded as to which children were in the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Statistical modeling was used to determine whether the specialist-taught PE (intervention) had any effect on lipid levels in comparison with the usual PE (control) program delivered by classroom teachers. The model needed to account for the complexity of factors that influenced lipid concentrations at both the child and school (cluster) levels. Potential explanatory variables explored for inclusion in the model were sex, school grade (or age), weight, percent body fat, physical activity, energy intake and macronutrient intake, pubertal development, medical history and socioeconomic status. The model fits within the general framework of general linear mixed models. Statistical significance of an effect was assessed by calculating adjusted Wald statistics <xref rid="pone.0076124-Kenward1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Where necessary, variables were scaled by square roots or natural logarithms to better meet linearity assumptions. General model checking procedures were routinely used to identify aberrant data and to check the model assumptions. In addition to the above model, differences between mean logit percentage values of SOFIT class observational data and of elevated lipid concentrations were determined with a formal linear mixed model analysis adjusting for random school effects. A further application of our model was to determine the effect of the intervention on the incidence of elevated (at risk) LDL-C. Data were converted to a binary indicator response (1 for elevated LDL-C or 0 normal). Linear logistic regression assessed the significance of difference in the change of the probabilities in the two groups. All procedures were carried out using the statistical package Genstat version13 (VSN International Ltd, Oxford, UK), which accounts for any imbalance if a child was not measured in all years, listwise deletion applying if a covariate value was missing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>

As these effects were measured relative to a control group of usual practice PE conducted by general classroom teachers, our data indicate that the specialist conducted PE offered a means of offsetting early signs of cardiovascular disease that was not available to most children undertaking PE in government schools in this jurisdiction.</p><p>A recent review <xref rid="pone.0076124-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> identified three intervention studies in teenagers <xref rid="pone.0076124-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076124-Eliakim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076124-Stoedefalke1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> which produced little effect on any of the blood lipids, but the reviewers, after considering evidence from observational studies, suggested that 40 minutes of moderate physical activity for 5 days per week over a minimum duration of 4 months may be required to achieve effects on HDL-C and triglyceride in children, and that changes in fitness seemed to be required to achieve any effect. Our data suggest otherwise when the intervention is in the form of the specialized PE provided for this investigation. Only two 50 minute specialized PE classes per week were required to lower the prevalence of elevated LDL-C in boys and girls and to lower mean LDL-C and total cholesterol in all boys when undertaken over 4 years; and this took place without detecting any change in our running-based cardiorespiratory fitness test. Interestingly, in relation to the latter point, the converse has also been reported; improvements in fitness can occur without any effect on lipid levels <xref rid="pone.0076124-Kriemler1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>As to why these specific effects were detected when no effects on lipids were found in other interventions <xref rid="pone.0076124-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076124-Eliakim1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076124-Stoedefalke1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we point to four design characteristics of our study which may have contributed. Firstly, in comparison with the cited studies, the current investigation involved considerably more participants (468 complete results verses 12 to 38) and was therefore in a better position to detect effects. Secondly, our intervention involved specialized PE rather than a physical activity or training program. Thirdly, our intervention was conducted over 4 years rather than the shorter term (1 to 5 months) physical activity or training programs of the cited studies. Finally, our participants were in their pre-teenage mainly pre-pubescent years, and being generally younger than the teenagers involved in the cited studies, may have responded to the intervention differently.</p><p>As this specialist-taught PE program focused entirely on physical activity, and avoided any discussion of the children's body weight or their diet, it is reasonable to assume the beneficial effects on lipid levels were promoted through physical activity itself. Our results would support this assertion as there was no evidence of any intervention effect on total energy or changes in macronutrient content. On the other hand, although there was no intervention effect on percent body fat over the full duration of 4 years, we have reported an effect of this specialized PE to reduce percent body fat during the first 2 years of the study <xref rid="pone.0076124-Telford3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore the possibility remains that the benefits of physical activity may have been mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in percent body fat, especially as the intervention effects on mean LDL-C in the full cohort of boys was most evident in the first 2 years.</p><p>One way a physical activity-based intervention might be expected to contribute towards lowering LDL-C is via a general increase in day-to-day physical activity, but we found no evidence of any effect on average daily pedometer step count. Instead, we suggest three other ways the intervention PE program may have been influential. Firstly, SOFIT showed there was 66% more moderate and vigorous physical activity in the intervention classes than the control classes. This finding was consistent with the final year accelerometer data showing that intervention group boys, but not girls, undertook 17% more average daily moderate physical activity during schooldays than their control group counterparts. (The gender differences in accelerometer data were also consistent with the gender difference in the intervention effect on mean LDL-C). Secondly, there was more directed fitness work in the intervention classes. However, much of this involved muscular activity associated with balance challenges and other relatively stationary exercises, which may explain the absence of any intervention effect on the running fitness test, and an absence of any pedometer-step related intervention effect. Thirdly, the intervention specialist PE classes were sustained over 4 years of elementary school. The importance of a sustained intervention over years, rather than weeks or months, is supported by a previously reported 2-year school-based physical activity intervention <xref rid="pone.0076124-Resaland1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The latter study showed a beneficial effect on total cholesterol, although, as the authors themselves acknowledged, inferences were limited by the design of their study which involved just 2 schools.</p><p>According to the AHA and APA cutoff points for LDL-C, 20% and 16% of the 12 year-old boys and girls respectively in our cohort had elevated values. Given evidence that lipid concentrations track positively into adulthood, and that childhood cholesterol levels are linked with early vascular degeneration in adolescents <xref rid="pone.0076124-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076124-Juonala1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, these percentages are of concern. The beneficial intervention effect on LDL-C suggests that important health benefits can be gained from a PE program with broader educational objectives, distinguishing it from a physical training regime in which sustainability in children is questionable.</p><p>Funding is an obvious barrier to employing specialist PE teachers in many schools, and ways to better prepare classroom teachers to conduct PE are clearly of interest. To this end, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076124-t001">Table 1</xref>, the Bluearth Foundation provider of our PE intervention has developed an in-class professional development program for the classroom teachers, a strategy our government educational authorities may consider worthy of consideration.</p><p>Strengths of our study included the statistical model, the cluster-randomized design and the general objectivity and breadth of our data obtained from a school-based intervention consistent with school curricula objectives and already in operation in some schools. Limitations included a potential lack of sensitivity and specificity of our physical activity, fitness and dietary measurements and that our data from predominantly white children from an affluent, developed country may only be generalizable to similar populations.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Well-designed specialist-delivered PE in elementary school can reduce the incidence of elevated LDL-C in elementary school-aged children and so offers an early contribution to community strategies targeting the prevention of chronic disease. Our findings are of relevance to education and health policy makers, because they show that currently adopted practices of PE as conducted by general classroom teachers do not make this level of contribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076124.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0076124.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076124.s002"><label>Ethics S1</label><caption><p>Ethics Application A.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0076124.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0076124.s003"><label>Ethics S2</label><caption><p>Ethics Application B.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0076124.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We extend our thanks to the Bluearth Foundation, Melbourne, Australia, for providing their physical education program and specialist teachers.
