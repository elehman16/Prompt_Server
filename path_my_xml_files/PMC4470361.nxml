The Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of S-1 for Colorectal Cancer (ACTS-CC) confirmed the non-inferiority of S-1 to tegafur/urcail/leucovorin in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with stage III CRC after curative surgery. However, the 6-month completion rate of S-1 treatment was 76.5&#x000a0;% in the ACTS-CC. Therefore, treatment completion remains an unresolved problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral daily administration and alternate-day administration of S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy in curatively resected stage III CRC.

In Arm B, S-1 will be administered orally on alternate days for 28&#x000a0;weeks from the date of the start of therapy.

The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) reported recurrence rates of 3.7&#x000a0;% for stage I disease, 13.3&#x000a0;% for stage II disease, and 30.8&#x000a0;% for stage III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III CRC is now internationally accepted as standard care for improving patient outcomes. The 2010 JSCCR guidelines recommend four regimens as adjuvant therapy for stage III CRC: i.v. 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oral tegafur-uracil/leucovorin, capecitabine, and FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>S-1 is an oral anticancer agent containing tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].
