It is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, functional decline, hospitalization and significant healthcare costs [<xref rid="AFW091C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFW091C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Most delirium research has focussed on hospital patients. Another expanding group [<xref rid="AFW091C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], for whom the burden of delirium is likely to be considerable, is residents of care homes, with a clustering of delirium risk factors [<xref rid="AFW091C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], especially older age and dementia [<xref rid="AFW091C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We use the term &#x02018;care home&#x02019; to refer to all residential long-term care settings providing group living and personal and/or nursing care for older people.</p><p>Delirium point prevalence in the care home population has been estimated to be 14% [<xref rid="AFW091C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and 33% for residents with advanced dementia [<xref rid="AFW091C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Multicomponent interventions that target modifiable risk factors have been shown to reduce delirium by approximately one-third in hospitals [<xref rid="AFW091C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFW091C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These are areas of care that should be equally applicable to long-term care settings, but the effectiveness of delirium prevention in care homes is not yet known [<xref rid="AFW091C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Delirium has been linked to quality of care [<xref rid="AFW091C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A focus on delirium prevention may, therefore, present an opportunity not only to reduce delirium but also to improve quality of care for older people living in care homes, with potential additional benefits that include reducing morbidity, hospital admissions and healthcare costs. The NICE Delirium guideline, therefore, includes a research recommendation to develop such evidence [<xref rid="AFW091C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In previous work, we used the UK Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions [<xref rid="AFW091C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to design an intervention to prevent delirium in care homes (entitled Stop Delirium!) and demonstrated its feasibility [<xref rid="AFW091C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. &#x02018;Stop Delirium!&#x02019; is an enhanced educational package, incorporating additional strategies to change practice, designed to support staff to target common risk factors for delirium in residents. The intervention has been described in previous publications [<xref rid="AFW091C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and materials can be viewed on the European Delirium Association website [<xref rid="AFW091C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Building on this work, and to address key aspects of future trial design and intervention implementation for the particular circumstances of care homes, we report a feasibility study to test and optimize the protocol for a definitive trial of Stop Delirium! The specific objectives of the study were to (i) estimate recruitment and attrition rates; (ii) estimate the sample size for a subsequent trial with data on the proposed primary outcome, delirium occurrence, its variability and the intraclass coefficient (ICC), and to report data on hospital admission rates (as a potential alternative primary outcome); (iii) explore feasibility of collecting proposed baseline and outcome measures; (iv) test feasibility and refine the strategy for collecting resource use and quality-of-life data to inform the health economics evaluation; and (v) assess implementation, adherence and sustainability of the Stop Delirium! intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A summary of methods is given here with full details available in the published protocol [<xref rid="AFW091C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and setting</title><p>We conducted a parallel group, cluster randomized controlled feasibility trial in 14 care homes providing care for older people. Changes to the original protocol included the introduction of a second phase of resident recruitment 12 months after randomization because of a high attrition rate, and conducting structured case note reviews in order to explore the possibility that reliance on face-to-face assessments alone might be underestimating delirium.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Independent sector care homes providing nursing or residential care for older people in one metropolitan district were eligible. All residents were eligible unless they had severe communication difficulties, were unable to communicate in English or were receiving end-of-life care.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcomes</title><p>For the future definitive trial, the proposed primary outcome is delirium occurrence. Delirium detection ideally requires repeated daily assessments, which would be challenging in multiple care homes. We therefore assessed the feasibility of research staff detecting delirium during a single month, 16 months after randomization. Feasibility of collecting the following secondary outcomes was also examined: severity and duration of delirium episodes; hospital admissions (number, length of stay and time to first admission), falls and mortality during previous 6 months and the number of medications.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size</title><p>The number of homes was determined to allow a maximum range of homes within the research resources available to this feasibility study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participant recruitment and consent</title><p>Informed, written consent was obtained from participants, or for those lacking capacity to consent, agreement from a relative or professional caregiver, following requirements of the UK Mental Capacity Act, 2005 [<xref rid="AFW091C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomization</title><p>Homes were randomized to intervention or control on a 1:1 basis using a computer-generated minimization programme by the Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit that stratified by the size of the home in terms of the number of residents (&#x0003c;20, &#x02265;20) and percentage of residents with dementia (&#x0003c;62%, &#x02265;62%). Randomization took place after completion of the first phase of resident recruitment and baseline assessment. Thereafter, blinding of participants, staff or researchers to allocation was not feasible given the nature of the intervention and resource limitations.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Stop Delirium! intervention</title><p>The study intervention comprised a multifaceted enhanced educational package incorporating multiple strategies to change practice delivered to each care home over 16 months. The intervention has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="AFW091C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="AFW091C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; in brief, it consisted of a specialist Delirium Practitioner (a mental health nurse with expertise in delirium and in providing interactive education and training) who delivered three interactive education sessions and facilitated Working Groups of care home staff. Working Groups identified targets for delirium prevention and developed bespoke solutions for each home. The Delirium Practitioner also trained a Delirium Champion in each home. This was supported by a Delirium Box containing resources designed to support learning and act as reminders.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Control</title><p>Care homes randomized to be controls continued with care as usual. Control homes were offered the Stop Delirium! package after the end of the study, and all seven opted to implement the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data collection</title><p>At recruitment, resident demographics, medications, activities of daily living (ADL) (Barthel index [<xref rid="AFW091C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) and co-morbidity (Charlson index [<xref rid="AFW091C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) were collected from care home records. Tests for visual (Snellen test card), hearing (Whisper test) and cognitive impairment (6-CIT [<xref rid="AFW091C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) were conducted. Trained research assistants also assessed for delirium using the short version Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [<xref rid="AFW091C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and, for those screening positive, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) [<xref rid="AFW091C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Collateral information to inform completion of the CAM was sought from care home staff.</p><p>At follow-up, residents were assessed for delirium on alternate days (except Sundays) over a 1-month period starting 16 months after randomization. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by a second researcher observing the interview and scoring the CAM independently. Delirium severity was assessed using the DRS-R-98 (score &#x0003e;15.25) and duration using the number of days CAM positive for each delirium episode. Structured case note reviews were also undertaken for the same 1-month period using an established method to identify delirium cases [<xref rid="AFW091C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Medications, hospital admissions, falls and deaths in a 6-month period starting 10 months after randomization were collected for each resident from care home records. We also obtained data for hospital admissions for the same 6-month period from hospitals in the catchment area, both for individual consented residents, and by care home postcode. These data are routinely collected by hospitals for &#x02018;Hospital Episode Statistics&#x02019; (HES), a data warehouse containing details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and Accident and Emergency department attendances at NHS hospitals in England.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We explored the feasibility of a number of approaches to capture resource use: care-home-level monthly diaries; resident-level care home record review and hospital record capture, including data obtained directly from hospitals or through a request to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (a provider of national NHS hospital data).</p><p>We administered the EQ-5D and EQ-5D proxy [<xref rid="AFW091C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Social Care Related Quality of Life (SCRQoL) [<xref rid="AFW091C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] at baseline and the EQ-5D and Dementia Quality of Life [<xref rid="AFW091C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (DEMQOL and DEMOQOL proxy) at follow-up to test alternative modes of capturing utility values for this population. Utility is used to weight survival in the calculation of quality-adjusted life years, the recommended outcome measure used in cost-effectiveness analysis [<xref rid="AFW091C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Records were kept of resources used in delivering the intervention and conducting research assessments (staff time). Unit financial costs for health and social care resources were obtained from national sources [Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) Costs of Health and Social Care, British National Formulary (BNF) and NHS reference cost databases] and used to determine costs of the Stop Delirium! intervention and costs for health and social care use by participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Implementation, adherence and sustainability of the intervention</title><p>A process evaluation was conducted alongside the trial, using the Normalisation Process Theory Framework [<xref rid="AFW091C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to describe the process of implementation, integration and sustainability of the intervention and to identify barriers and facilitators. Details of this will be reported in a separate publication.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Analysis</title><p>Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics; analyses focussed mainly on confidence interval estimation rather than formal hypothesis testing.

However, we were able to confirm that the data requested in our application were available from the centre. Data obtained directly from hospitals offered a robust way of capturing secondary care resource use. Using these, the overall cost for residents in the intervention arm was estimated as &#x000a3;3,281 and in the control homes &#x000a3;7,210. In addition, there were lower monthly costs per resident for homes in the intervention arm (&#x000a3;219.72 compared with &#x000a3;253.01, a saving of &#x000a3;33.29).</p></sec><sec id="s3e2"><title>Quality of life</title><p>At baseline, the EQ-5D and SCRQoL were administered with only 4 and 2% missing assessments, respectively.

However, our selection criteria excluded residents with severe communication difficulties because of the nature of the study assessments, thus excluding some of the very residents most vulnerable to delirium. Attrition was high when there was a 16-month interval between recruitment and follow-up. This is consistent with the reported finding of a median survival rate of 12 months for nursing and 16 months for residential care home residents [<xref rid="AFW091C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A cross-sectional design recruiting trial participants nearer to follow-up could address this; we achieved a 96% follow-up rate using this approach for participants recruited in Phase 2. Potential differential recruitment influenced by knowledge of allocation could be addressed by blinding researchers involved in recruitment, although maintaining blinding is challenging with an intervention that is highly visible.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Measuring delirium</title><p>Rates for delirium prevalence and incidence in this study were lower than expected from previous research. It is possible that they are an underestimate of the true rate for a number of reasons. First, although our inclusion criteria were broad, as mentioned above, we excluded residents with severe communication difficulties. Assessments required the participation of residents, excluding those who were too unwell or unwilling to be seen by a researcher. These groups include the very people most likely to be at risk of delirium.</p><p>Second, our study population had a high prevalence of dementia and pre-existing cognitive impairment. Diagnosing delirium superimposed on dementia is challenging, even for experienced clinicians [<xref rid="AFW091C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although researchers had undergone training in using the CAM, they were often reliant on information from care home staff who tended to ascribe any deterioration to the underlying dementia. We anticipated that care home staff would have a good understanding of residents' usual health state and be well placed to report changes. However, this was frequently not the case because of high staff turnover and limited handover of information between shifts. Third, researchers were only able to assess residents during the day, potentially missing changes that manifested during the evening or night and making it more difficult to identify a fluctuating course. As residents were only assessed on alternate weekdays, there were potentially 4 days between some assessments, which may have also missed episodes of short duration.</p><p>Finally, it is also possible that the low observed delirium rate may have been due to higher quality of care or inclusion of residents at lower risk of delirium. However, our rates of dementia and hospitalization were similar to those reported in the published literature.</p><p>The view that our face-to-face assessments underestimated delirium appeared to be supported by care home records reviews, which identified additional cases of delirium. A combination of interview and records review has been recommended previously [<xref rid="AFW091C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, recording of delirium by staff may itself be influenced by the intervention; care home records reviews identified considerably more delirium episodes in the intervention homes, despite a lower observed rate from face-to-face assessments in the present study.</p><p>McCusker <italic>et al</italic>. in a multisite cohort of long-term care residents found a substantial increase in the reported prevalence of delirium when care home nurse-observed symptoms (structured interviews and care home records) were combined with symptoms observed by research staff alone [<xref rid="AFW091C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, there is still the possibility that increased awareness of delirium by staff as a result of the intervention may lead to increased availability of such informant information, influencing delirium detection.</p><p>An alternative approach would be to restrict outcome assessments to those most at risk of delirium (i.e. those with dementia or acutely unwell [<xref rid="AFW091C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) or to use &#x02018;whole home&#x02019; assessments. Delirium screening instruments for use by non-specialists have been developed [<xref rid="AFW091C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which could be administered by care home staff as part of routine care. Using anonymized data from such measures in research would also avoid the problem of excluding residents who are unable to be assessed for reasons that may be related to their delirium risk. However, the validity of these instruments in the care home setting is yet to be established. Again, it is likely that completion of such a measure by staff would be influenced by the intervention, making differentiation between intervention delivery and outcome measurement difficult.</p><p>Delirium detection in long-term care is challenging. Daily review by an experienced clinician using operationalized diagnostic criteria is the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; but would be prohibitively resource intensive in a large trial. Daily CAM administration by a researcher with information from care home staff using structured interviews and review of care home records, despite its limitations, may be the optimum approach. Training and availability of supervision by experienced clinicians for research staff conducting CAM assessments would be important in view of the uncertainties in diagnosing delirium, particularly in people with dementia.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Other outcomes</title><p>An alternative is to use acute hospital admission as a primary outcome (as preventing delirium should reduce the need for hospital admission). An additional attraction in a trial where blinding is not possible is that hospital admission rates are less likely to be affected by observer bias. We were readily able to determine hospital admission rates for care home residents using routine data. However, this approach which relies on postcodes to identify admissions from care homes may not be reliable as homes may share a postcode with other private residences. In a study of hospital use by long-term care residents, 69% of hospital admissions identified as being from a care home using routine data were actually from a nursing or residential home [<xref rid="AFW091C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A feasible alternative is to obtain hospital admission data directly from care homes, as these are increasing collected routinely as part of required reporting to commissioners.</p><p>The routinely collected hospital data also provide the most promising route to assess secondary care resource use. It is anticipated that data linkage with General Practice datasets will additionally provide primary care resource use in future.</p><p>We found that tools to capture health state utility were limited by lack of validity for the long-term care population. The only tool specifically developed for use in this setting (the SCRQoL) will probably not be practicable within the resources available in a large trial. Given the NICE recommendations [<xref rid="AFW091C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], future studies should incorporate the EQ-5D. However, they should also consider additional measures such as the ICECAP-O (ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people) [<xref rid="AFW091C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="AFW091C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], for which there is a recent and growing validation evidence in this group.</p><p>There were significant challenges in conducting this feasibility trial. Nevertheless, we were able to recruit residents successfully and conduct baseline and outcome assessments to a relatively high level of completion. On the basis of this study, we think that a future definitive trial is feasible but will require some modifications to the trial design in light of experience gained in this study.<boxed-text position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key points</title></caption><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Delirium is a distressing but potentially preventable condition common in older people in long-term care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delirium is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, functional decline, hospitalization and significant healthcare costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multicomponent interventions can prevent delirium in hospitalized patients, but their effectiveness in long-term care is not known.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Detection of delirium in long-term care research is challenging and resource intensive.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Routine screening for delirium by care home staff may offer a way forward but requires further validation studies.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text>
