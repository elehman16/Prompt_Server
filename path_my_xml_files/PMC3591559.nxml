Group P received propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Group S received sevoflurane-N<sub>2</sub>O-Oxygen for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Patients with morbid obesity, having difficult airway or tracheostomy <italic>in situ</italic> were excluded. All patients were premedicated with diazepam 5 mg at night before surgery and ranitidine 150 mg with metoclopramide 10 mg in the morning of the surgery.</p><p>Standard monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), capnography (E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>), and bispectral index (BIS) were used during intraoperative period. The patients received fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg 3 min before induction. In group P anesthetic induction was carried out with propofol in 20 mg increments every 5 s till the BIS value reached 60 and maintained with propofol infusion started at the rate of 200 &#x003bc;g/kg/min adjusted in the steps of 25 &#x003bc;g/ kg/ min to maintain the bispectral index between 40 and 60. In group S, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen, with a total gas flow of 6 L/min. Sevoflurane was started at 5% then increased gradually up to 8% till BIS reached to 60. For maintenance of anesthesia 4% sevoflurane was given with 60% N<sub>2</sub>O in oxygen and adjusted in the steps of 0.4% to maintain BIS value of 40-60. Muscle relaxation was achieved with succinylcholine 2 mg/kg and additional boluses (0.5 mg/kg) were given if required. Endotracheal intubation was performed using small size (5.5/6.0 ID) cuffed microlaryngeal tube. Patients&#x02019; lungs were ventilated by intermittent positive pressure ventilation to maintain E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> within 35-40 mmHg. Patient's heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded at pre-induction, after induction, after intubation, after insertion of operating laryngoscope, and then every 5 min till extubation. Any adverse occurrences (cough, laryngeal spasm, and bradycardia) were noted. Hypertension and hypotension were determined by a change in mean arterial pressure &#x0003e;20% of the pre-induction value. Hypotension was treated with ephedrine 5 mg boluses while hypertension and tachycardia (heart rate &#x0003e;100 beats/min) were managed with esmolol. The administration of sevoflurane and propofol was discontinued at the end of surgery. The endotracheal tube was removed when patients were conscious and breathing adequately. The duration of surgery, emergence time (time from the removal of operating laryngoscope to BIS 80), and the time to extubation were recorded.</p><p>Patients were observed in the recovery area by an investigator who was blinded to the anesthesia technique used. The hemodynamic parameters, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were recoded at every 10 min intervals till complete recovery. Recovery was assessed by Aldrete scoring system.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The time at which the patient scored an Aldrete score of 9 was noted and this was taken as recovery time. Any adverse events like, sore throat, pain, dizziness, postoperative nausea, and vomiting were assessed and treated accordingly till discharge of the patient. Patients were asked whether they had any recall of the induction or maintenance periods.</p><p>The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, version 17.0 for Windows). Parametric data were analyzed using paired and non-paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Qualitative or categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. All statistical tests were two-sided and were performed at a significance level of &#x003b1; = 0.05. Sample size was determined to detect a difference of 25% in time to achieve an Aldrete score of 9 with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 58 patients completed the study.

Our results suggest that rapid recovery can be achieved with both the techniques while maintaining intra-operatively a similar degree of hypnosis in both groups. However, sevoflurane provided better intraoperative hemodynamic stability than propofol during microlaryngeal surgery. Mean arterial pressure was better maintained with sevoflurane compared with propofol. Though the difference may be of limited significance for healthy patients, it may be advantageous in elderly patients with coronary artery disease.</p><p>Induction with both sevoflurane and propofol was well tolerated by the patients. Though the inhalational induction with sevoflurane was slower (92 s) than intravenous induction with propofol (63 s), this is clinically acceptable. The induction time of sevoflurane varies from 84 to 186 s depending upon the use of concentration of sevoflurane and technique of induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The ability to administer nitrous oxide and up to 8% sevoflurane allowed for a rapid induction in present study. Our induction time with propofol was similar as reported in previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, heart rate did not differ significantly between the groups but it decreased after induction in both the groups compared with baseline. The mean arterial pressure was more stable in the sevoflurane than propofol group. Induction of anesthesia with propofol was associated with a decrease of approximately 21 mm Hg in mean arterial pressure. In contrast, the decrease in mean arterial pressure with sevoflurane was only 14 mm Hg. Previous investigators also have shown a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure after induction of anesthesia with propofol than with sevoflurane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Propofol has a direct arterial vasodilator effect, responsible at least in part for the decrease in arterial pressure when it is administered during anesthetic induction. Sevoflurane maintains cardiovascular stability better then propofol even when used in higher concentrations. Husedzinovic <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] compared the effect of sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia on myocardial contractility using transesophageal echo-Doppler and found that stroke volume was significantly higher in the sevoflurane than in the propofol group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) after induction of anesthesia. In older patients and in those with hypertension, the hemodynamic effects of the induction of anesthesia with 8% sevoflurane were found similar to those with propofol 1.2 mg/kg,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] in contrast to a larger dose of propofol (2.3 mg/kg) in healthy patients. In our study the mean arterial pressure also differed between the groups after insertion of rigid laryngoscope, whereas mean arterial pressure was more in propofol group. Microlaryngoscopy leads to intense adrenergic stimulation resulting in marked fluctuations in blood pressure. Sevoflurane can block the adrenergic reflexes and hemodynamic consequences during surgery. When used with N<sub>2</sub> O, 1.5 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration of sevoflurane can prevent the hemodynamic response to skin incision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Watson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] reported significantly higher consumption of alfentanil during intraoperative period in patients receiving total intravenous anesthesia with propofol compared to sevoflurane nitrous oxide group.</p><p>The doses of sevoflurane and propofol infusion were titrated according to the bispectral index monitoring for keeping an adequate depth of anesthesia. The use of small, cuffed endotracheal tube instead of jet ventilation permitted the administration of sevoflurane anesthesia without any difficulty during surgical procedure. We used fentanyl instead of remifentanil in our study because fentanyl was found effective in abolishing cardiovascular reactivity to laryngoscopy in microlaryngeal surgery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and more cost effective than remifentanil infusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The incidence of bradycardia and postoperative pain are also high with remifentanil.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our emergence times were equally rapid in both the groups and comparable with previous studies using remifentanil and alfentanil based anesthesia for ear-nose-throat surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were less in both the groups. This is probably due to the administration of antiemetic premedication to the patients. No other significant adverse effect was reported.</p><p>In conclusion, inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane and intravenous anesthesia with propofol both provided early recovery after microlaryngeal surgery. Sevoflurane showed advantage over propofol in respect of better intraoperative hemodynamic stability. Sevoflurane provides a suitable alternative to propofol for anaesthesia in patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
