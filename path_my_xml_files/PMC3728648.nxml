examining the effectiveness of arthroscopic acromioplasty in the
treatment of stage II shoulder impingement syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 140 patients were randomly divided into two groups:
1) supervised exercise programme (n = 70, exercise group); and 2)
arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a similar exercise programme
(n = 70, combined treatment group).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The main outcome measure was self-reported pain as measured on
a visual analogue scale. At the five-year assessment a total of
109 patients were examined (52 in the exercise group and 57 in the
combined treatment group). There was a significant decrease in mean
self-reported pain on the VAS between baseline and the five-year follow-up
in both the exercise group (from 6.5 (1 to 10) to 2.2 (0 to 8);
p &#x0003c; 0.001) and the combined treatment group (from 6.4 (2 to 10)
to 1.9 (0 to 8); p &#x0003c; 0.001). The same trend was seen in the secondary
outcome measures (disability, working ability, pain at night, Shoulder
Disability Questionnaire and reported painful days). An intention-to-treat
analysis showed statistically significant improvements in both groups
at five years compared with baseline. Further, improvement continued
between the two- and five-year timepoints. No statistically significant differences
were found in the patient-centred primary and secondary parameters
between the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differences in the patient-centred primary and secondary parameters

syndrome</p></sec><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Shoulder pain is a common complaint, sometimes described as the
second most common musculoskeletal disorder after low back pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref></sup> Impingement is often cited as the
leading cause of pain in the shoulder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref></sup> which was initially thought to arise
from the mechanical friction of the tendon under the acromion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref></sup> However, further
studies and treatment trials have not been able to demonstrate a
pure mechanical aetiology for this syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref></sup> and
therefore current treatment options remain controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Impingement of the shoulder has a severe and long-lasting effect
on the patient, with costs of treatment and absence from work causing
economic consequences.</p><p>The syndrome is traditionally divided into three stages: Stage
I, oedema and haemorrhage; Stage II, fibrosis and tendinitis; and
Stage III, tears of the rotator cuff, biceps ruptures and bone changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> The condition
usually begins gradually and then over time becomes continuous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref></sup> Its diagnosis
is based on clinical examination, which makes its nature somewhat
imprecise. The first mode of treatment is non-operative, involving
rest, subacromial corticosteroid injections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref></sup> oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref></sup> and
physiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref></sup> Although surgical treatment has
not been conclusively shown to be superior to conservative treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> arthroscopic
acromioplasty is still a popular procedure with a rising incidence
over the last decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Clear indications for different modes of treatment based on randomised
clinical trials have not yet been defined. It seems that the expectations
of both the surgeons and the patients and the availability of the arthroscopic
technology affect the demand.</p><p>We designed a randomised clinical trial to investigate the eventual
additional effect of arthroscopic decompression with acromioplasty
on a supervised exercise program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> We now report the five-year results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study design was a prospective, controlled and randomised
trial. Patients were recruited from the area of Kanta-H&#x000e4;me Health
Care District (population 165&#x000a0;000) between June 2001 and July 2004.
The full exclusion and inclusion criteria are provided in Table
I. The eligibility of the patients was examined at baseline by a
physician (a specialist in rehabilitation or orthopaedics). Impingement was
tested with Neer&#x02019;s method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref></sup> by
assessing whether lidocain injected into the subacromial space relieved
the pain. All patients had a plain radiograph and MRI of the symptomatic
shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup> The
risks and benefits of both treatments were discussed and the patients
were also given written information. Included patients were asked to
sign a written consent in which they voluntarily agreed to comply
with the randomised treatment protocol and follow-up visits, with
the right to withdraw at any time without giving reason for it.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria

of 47.1 years (23 to 60) were recruited to the study, which was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District. Patients
were randomly assigned to the treatment groups using computer-generated
numbers sealed in envelopes prepared by an independent statistician
not otherwise involved with the study.</p><p>Demographic data and disability-values and a structured Shoulder
Disability Questionnaire (SDQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref></sup>were collected
at baseline. The SDQ contains common situations referring to the
preceding 24 hours (yes/no/not applicable (i.e. not occurred)).
The score is calculated by dividing the number of positive scores to the total
number of applicable items subsequently multiplied by 100 (0&#x000a0;no
disability, 100 all applicable items positive). All patients had
received various types of physiotherapy including massage, heat,
transcutaneous nerve stimulation and exercises, but had not been
treated by a specialised physician before entering the study.</p><p>The control visit assessment, including SDQ-score and the clinical
measurements, were performed by an independent, blinded investigator
(physiotherapist), not otherwise involved in the study or rehabilitation,
at three and six months and at one, two and five years. The health-related
quality of life was measured at the five-year visit using the 15D
quality of life tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup></p><sec><title content-type="h3">Supervised exercise</title><p>Physiotherapeutic training was based on home exercises, for which
the patients received individual guidance and general information during
an average of seven visits to an independent physiotherapist.</p><p>The aim of the supervised exercise treatment was to restore painless,
normal mobility of the shoulder complex and to increase the dynamic
stability of the glenohumeral joint and the scapula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup> Series of long
painless movement with repetition were undertaken with the aim of
strengthening the tendons. Patients were instructed to do nine different
exercises at least four times a week, with three courses of 30 to
40 repetitions. As the self-assessed ability and strength improved,
resistance was increased and repetitions diminished. The progress
was evaluated at control visits (mean of seven) and continued until
the patient and the therapist considered that the trainee was independently
able to maintain the practise level.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Combined treatment: surgery</title><p>One independent experienced orthopaedic surgeon performed all
the arthroscopic decompressions under regional anaesthesia at Kanta-H&#x000e4;me
Central Hospital, H&#x000e4;meenlinna, Finland. Debridement and decompression
were performed with a shaver and/or a vaporisator. Acromioplasty
was undertaken with a burr drill (Arthroscope Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen,
Germany). A standard posterior portal was used to analyse the structures
of the glenohumeral joint and to reach the subacromial space. An
anterolateral portal was used to perform debridement and decompression.
The range of movement was tested under arthroscopic visualisation
to check for any local impingement.</p><p>The use of a collar cuff sling was recommended for one week,
after which mobilisation was allowed with free active movements,
starting with pendular motion. In the rehabilitation period patients
in the combined treatment group received similar training instructions
from a physiotherapist as were provided for the exercise group with the
same kind of follow-up schedule. The training programme was individually
planned and progressive. It started progressing once the post-operative
pain had started to diminish. Like in the supervised exercise treatment
group, the progress was evaluated at the visits to the physiotherapist
(mean of six visits).</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Follow-up</title><p>At five years one trained independent physiotherapist, who had
not been involved with the patients before evaluation and who was
blinded to the mode of treatment, performed all standardised assessments.
Patients were instructed not to indicate their treatment group and
they wore a T-shirt to cover eventual operation scars.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Outcome measures</title><p>Self-reported shoulder pain, as the primary outcome measure,
was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (extreme pain). Secondary outcome measures included
disability (measured on a VAS from 0 (no disability) to 10 (total
disability)), working ability (VAS from 0 (totally unable to work)
to 10 (no restriction on work)), pain at night (VAS from 0 (no pain)
to 10 (extreme pain)), SDQ score, number of painful days during
the previous three months and the proportion of pain-free patients
(defined as a VAS for pain &#x02264; 3). The health related quality of life
was measured at the five-year visit using the 15-D tool and compared with
the age-adjusted population values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Statistical analysis</title><p>Power calculations were performed based on the use of self-reported
pain (VAS) as the primary outcome measure. Using 1.5 (<sc>sd</sc> 2.5)
as a clinically important change,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup> the sample size was estimated to 45&#x000a0;patients
per group, if 5% type I (&#x003b1;) and 20% type II (&#x003b2;) errors were allowed.
As the standard deviation of the outcome measure was only a rough
estimate, a total of 70&#x000a0;patients were included in both groups.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
for Windows v19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Descriptive statistics
are presented as percentages, frequencies, and means. The independent
samples <italic>t</italic>-test was used for group comparisons,
paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test for comparisons within groups
over time and the chi-squared test for equal proportions of pain-free
patients between groups. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to represent
statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study groups did not differ at baseline in any pre-operative
measure (Table II). During the follow-up between two and five years,
a total of four patients in the exercise group had undergone acromioplasty
and one patient had undergone operation of a rotator cuff rupture.
The mean time after randomisation until these five operations were
performed was 2.9 years (2.6 to 3.3). Additionally, a total of 12
patients originally allocated to the combined treatment group refused
operation; one of whom went on to undergo surgery at a follow-up
of 2.6&#x000a0;years. The total number of operated patients in the exercise
group was 18. All these patients were invited to and attended the
five-year control visit. The follow-up results were analysed using
an intention-to-treat approach, but the outcome is also described
based on the actual treatment using a per protocol approach.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table II</label><caption><p>Results in the intention-to treat

already at enrolment). In the combined
treatment group five were retired, one due to old age and four on
a disability/unemployment pension unrelated to shoulder symptoms.
In the exercise group 11 patients were retired, three due to old
age and eight were on a disability/unemployment pension, two of
which were due to shoulder-related reasons. Two additional patients
were part-time retired, one due to shoulder-related reasons (exercise
group).</p><p>Seven patients in each group reported that changes had been made
in their working arrangements due to shoulder-related reasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study suggests that treatment with arthroscopic decompression
combined with structured exercise treatment did not provide better
results at five years compared with structured exercise alone, when assessed
by self-reported pain. The same pattern was seen in the secondary
outcome measures of disability, pain at night, SDQ score, number
of painful days and the proportion of pain-free patients.</p><p> The improvements seen in both groups at the two-year follow-up
continued to the five-year follow-up, resulting in highly significant
improvements compared with the baseline values. However, there were
no statistically significant differences between the groups. These
five-year results indicate that arthroscopic decompression does not
have any additional effect on conservative structured exercise.
Furthermore, based on the current results, arthroscopic decompression
does not have any prophylactic effect from a five-year perspective
because the non-decompressed conservatively treated patients did
as well as those who underwent operative release of the impingement.</p><p>Some parameters of the 15D quality of life index were slightly
worse in patients treated for shoulder impingement than in the age-adjusted
general population, but there were no differences between the treatment
groups in these health-related quality of life parameters.</p><p>There have been randomised controlled trials comparing conservative
and operative treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref></sup> and others have investigated the
effect of the treatment on disability and working capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> In these earlier studies, failure
to respond to regular physiotherapy and other conservative treatment was
used as an inclusion criterion. In contrast, the present study aimed
to examine whether operative treatment provided any additional value
to a conservative structured exercise treatment. At all follow-up
visits the patients were evaluated by a blinded, independent assessor,
thus minimising any bias. Selection and drop-out biases were minor
as all eligible consecutive 140 patients volunteered to the study
and the drop-out rate even at five years was relatively small (six
of 140 at two years and 31 of 140 at five years).</p><p>As the study was conducted in an ordinary provincial hospital
setting, not in a highly specialised shoulder centre, the external
validity is relatively good. All operations were performed by one
experienced orthopaedic surgeon and without any significant surgical
complications. Although it concerns patients&#x02019; health and their decision, in
reality patients do not always follow the given guidance. The similarity
of the groups at baseline confirms a successful randomisation. Therefore,
the adherence to the treatment was probably rather similar in both
study groups.</p><p>The diagnosis of the impingement syndrome requires a thorough
patient history and
a careful clinical examination to exclude other conditions that
may mimic impingement. All patients were examined also with MRI
at baseline, in order to exclude conditions such as penetrating
ruptures of the rotator cuff.</p><p>The age limits for inclusion were set at 18 and 60 years in conformity
with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref></sup> In patients aged &#x0003c;
18 years, glenohumeral instability is the leading cause of shoulder
problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup> However,
our study included only four patients aged &#x0003c; 30 years. The frequency
of rotator cuff tears is higher in patients aged &#x0003e; 60 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref></sup> hence their exclusion from our study.</p><p>Luyckx et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref></sup> described
166 patients who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression,
and reported a mean time between operation and full activity of 11.1&#x000a0;weeks
(with a minimum of one week). In the present study, patients in
the combined treatment group reported a mean of 28.1 days leave
of absence due to shoulder-related reasons at the month follow-up
visit and additional 4.6 days between the three- and six-month follow-up
visits due to surgical procedure (Table III). The use of sick leave was
minimal between the two- and five-year follow-up visits. Values
were slightly higher in the exercise group, probably due to shifts
in the group and operations performed between the two- and five-year
visits. The difference in the total number of sick leave days was
not statistically significant between the study groups (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.11),
but still almost double in the combined treatment group, which raises
the overall health care costs. </p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table III</label><caption><p>Leave of absence from work due

are complex. This trend may be driven by patient, surgeon, technology,
society and/or employer related reasons. At present, expenses and
best evidence must also be taken into consideration. Based on our two-year
results we concluded that acromioplasty is not cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref></sup> Structured exercise
treatment should be the treatment of choice for shoulder impingement
syndrome. Operative treatment should be offered with discernment.
In 2010 the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare reported
that the combined incidence of open and arthroscopic acromioplasties
was 91.6/100&#x000a0;000 in Finland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref></sup> In
the New York area the incidence was 101.9/100&#x000a0;000 in 2006 and has
risen vastly in the previous decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref></sup> The indications for arthroscopic acromioplasty
should also be thoroughly discussed. We believe that the natural
course of the disease should be better defined to improve the judgement
of different treatment options.</p><p>The indications for arthroscopic acromioplasty in the treatment
of shoulder impingement syndrome should be reconsidered. Based on
our results, it seems that the mere presence of an uncomplicated
shoulder impingement syndrome is not an indication for arthroscopic
acromioplasty <italic>per se</italic>, as conservative treatment
with a structured exercise program provides as good results at five
years at a lower cost.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Conclusions</title><p>The additional effect of acromioplasty on top of structured exercise
is not significant in the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome
when evaluated at two and five years. Approximately 75% of patients recover
well and the rest continue to have discomfort despite the treatment.
The effects of the arthroscopic acromioplasty may have been overestimated
due to regression to the mean and the natural long-term course of
the shoulder impingement syndrome.</p><p>The authors would like to thank A-M. Lampela, Physiotherapist,
for assistance in examining the patients and Professor H. Sintonen
for providing the 15D age-adjusted general population data for comparison.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="bjr-block"><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions:</bold>S. Ketola: Planning of the study (overall planning), Substantive
