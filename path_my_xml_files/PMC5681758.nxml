In Germany, about 68,000 patients die annually because of septic diseases, characterized by a complex systemic inflammatory response. Causal treatment of the underlying infection is essential for successful management of sepsis, but the course can be positively influenced by supportive and adjuvant measures. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) represents a new approach to adjunctive therapy of septic diseases and can be pharmacologically activated by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (Anticholium&#x000ae;). Promising effects can be found in several in vitro and in vivo models of sepsis, such as a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Anticholium&#x000ae; per Se is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric trial to assess whether the CAP can be transferred from bench to bedside. In this pilot study, 20 patients with perioperative sepsis and septic shock as a result of intra-abdominal infection are enrolled. According to randomization, participants are treated with physostigmine salicylate (verum group) or 0.9% sodium chloride (placebo group) for up to 5&#x000a0;days. The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score during treatment and subsequent intensive care of up to 14&#x000a0;days is used as surrogate outcome (primary endpoint). Secondary outcome measures include 30- and 90-day mortality. An embedded pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study investigates plasma concentrations of physostigmine and its metabolite eseroline. Further analyses will contribute to our understanding of the role of various cytokines in the pathophysiology of human sepsis. A computer-generated list is used for block randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This randomized, controlled, monocentric trial investigates for the first time the adjunctive use of physostigmine (Anticholium&#x000ae;) in patients with perioperative sepsis and septic shock and may be a pivotal step toward the clinical use in this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">EudraCT Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2012-001650-26/DE">2012-001650-26</ext-link> (entered 14 August 2012), ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03013322">NCT03013322</ext-link> (registered on 1 Jan 2017).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2231-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physostigma venenosum</kwd><kwd>Antilirium</kwd><kwd>Cholinesterase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Continuous administration</kwd><kwd>Eserine</kwd><kwd>Eseroline</kwd><kwd>Intra-abdominal infection</kwd><kwd>Critically ill</kwd><kwd>Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway</kwd><kwd>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><p id="Par39">In Germany, septic diseases kill approximately 68,000 patients each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. About 280,000 (335 of 100,000) contract sepsis, approximately 115,000 of whom (138 of 100,000) experience severe sepsis or septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For those with severe sepsis, the probability of dying in hospital is about 44%, and increases to 59% for septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">In view of these alarming figures, new approaches in treatment are required. One new treatment concept is based on the results of the group of Tracey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In an in vitro test series with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human macrophage cultures, acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, significantly inhibited the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-18, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Suppression of TNF-&#x003b1; was reversed with &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin, but not with atropine, a specific muscarinic inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, the peripheral vagus nerve was stimulated electrically, i.e., directly, in rats that had received the endotoxin intravenously. Stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve inhibited TNF-&#x003b1; synthesis in the liver and decreased peak serum TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The decrease in blood pressure following endotoxemia was reduced significantly, and consequently, the progression from sepsis to severe sepsis and septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, the inflammatory response can be influenced via &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.</p><p id="Par42">These results have been confirmed by other groups in various sepsis models and have deepened our understanding of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Taking into account the toxicity of the substances, concentrations used in test series, and ethical reservations about the direct electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, the CAP must be accessible for patients in a different way.</p><p id="Par44">Physostigmine salicylate is a peripherally and centrally acting inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and has been licensed and in clinical use for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Acetylcholinesterase catalyzes the cleavage of acetylcholine to acetate and choline. Via decreased cleavage of the endogenous neurotransmitter, it thus alters acetylcholine levels. In an in vivo test series with mice that had undergone cecal ligation and puncture (a recognized sepsis model), we showed that physostigmine salicylate significantly inhibited the release of various cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6); similar to the results of the group headed by Tracey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B, a specific transcription factor, and activity of myeloperoxidase, a measure of pulmonary neutrophil invasion, was also attenuated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The treatment diminished the decrease in blood pressure following infection, and lethality was reduced to the same extent as with nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the inflammatory response can be influenced by the use of physostigmine salicylate and this well-tolerated drug reduces the mortality in what is sometimes called the standard model for polymicrobial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Pharmacological properties of physostigmine have been studied in animals including guinea pigs and of course rats, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pyrroloindole alkaloid is predominantly metabolized in the liver and for a lesser part hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, with a respective half-life of 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min. Metabolites are excreted with urine and feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Usually, physostigmine is administered by intravenous injection or short infusion. A few studies describe continuous infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, reliable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) data are still sparse, especially for patients with sepsis and septic shock. Note that the human subjects mentioned earlier were healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and some patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In patients with sepsis and septic shock, however, the distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs are altered by complex and sometimes opposing changes and mechanisms including fluid extravasation, hemodynamic instability, and organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], possibly influencing pharmacodynamic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric pilot study on the use of physostigmine salicylate (Anticholium&#x000ae;) as an adjunctive measure in perioperative sepsis and septic shock is conducted to provide evidence of the effectiveness of physostigmine in humans - a clinical trial on an approved drug in a new indication.</p><p id="Par48">Plasma concentrations of physostigmine and its metabolite eseroline are determined and a population pharmacokinetic model will be developed.
