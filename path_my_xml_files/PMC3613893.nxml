Study design: Sixty patients, aged 12-18, with orthodontic fixed appliances were randomly assigned into three groups as follows: Group 1 (n=20): 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol varnish (Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus); Group 2 (n=20): Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus+ 0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% sodium fluoride (900 ppm fluoride) (Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel)); and Group 3 (n=20): 0.1% fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector&#x000ae;). Mutans streptococci (MS), lactobacilli (LB) levels, buffering capacity (BC), visible plaque index (VPI), and gingival bleeding index (GBI) scores were evaluated at four stages: T0, before orthodontic bonding; T1, one week after orthodontic bonding; T2, one week; and T3, four weeks after the first application, respectively. Inter and intra group comparisons were made by the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests with Bonferroni step-down correction (P&#x0003c;0.017). 
Results: Significantly lower MS and LB levels were found in Group 2 than Group 1 (T2) and 3 (T2, T3) (P&#x0003c;0.017). Groups 1-2 (T2) showed significantly higher BC (P&#x0003c;0.017) and lower VPI and GBI (P&#x0003c;0.017) scores compared with Group 3. Decreased MS levels at T2 (P&#x0003c;0.017) and T3 (P&#x0003e;0.017) were found in Group1-2 compared with T0. Significantly lower LB levels were recorded in Group 2 at T2 compared with T0 (P&#x0003c;0.017) while no significant differences were seen in Group 1 and 3 (P&#x0003e;0.017).
Conclusions: Addition of Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus+Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel combination to the standard oral hygiene regimen may be beneficial for orthodontic patients for maintaining oral health by reducing bacterial colonisation and gingivitis.

Fixed orthodontic appliances modify the oral flora and reduce the potential benefits of brushing and salivary flow on plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The increased amount of plaque adjacent to bands and brackets commonly results in poor oral hygiene and changes in the oral flora, including increased levels of <italic>Mutans streptococci</italic> (MS) and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> (LB), increased plaque and bleeding scores, and reduced levels of buffe-ring capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Insufficient removal of supragingival plaque may cause development of white spot lesions and gingival diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Preventive programs should be implemented to avoid the potentially detrimental consequences of fixed orthodontic appliances in the oral environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The application of antimicrobial therapies with common commercially produced antibacterial agents, such as varnishes, mouthwashes, or dentifrice gel formulations, particularly with chlorhexidine (CHX), have been found to be a beneficial preventive strategy for reducing undesirable outcomes of fixed orthodontic appliances such as peridontal problems and white spot lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Several studies investigated the effects of various concentrations of chlorhexidine on oral microflora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It was shown that with a concentration as low as 0.2%, chlorhexidine is an effective antimicrobial agent to reduce <italic>Streptococcus Mutans</italic> levels in oral flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Chlorhexidine and thymol (Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus) combination as a varnish treatment was found to be beneficial in inhibiting salivary MS levels and reducing gingivitis therefore improves oral hygiene in orthodontic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Chlorhexidine-based toothpastes as an adjunct to mechanical cleaning facilitate the removal of plaque and providing better oral hygiene in orthodontic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Topical fluoride application by toothpastes, gels, rinses, and varnishes were found to be beneficial in patients with fixed appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, a fluoride varnish regimen alone was postulated as an ineffective effort to improve oral hygiene status of orthodontic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, fluoride varnishes were suggested to be used in combination with other forms of fluoride supplements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Additionally, a combined antimicrobial strategy with antibacterial agents and fluoride has been considered a more effective way to reduce possible caries-associated problems in orthodontic patients who undergo fixed appliance therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, a recently developed gel formulation was introduced with a combination of 0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% sodium fluoride (Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel).</p><p>The main aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effectiveness of chlorhexidine-thymol varnish (Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus) alone, its combination with chlorhexidine-fluoride containing dentifrice (Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel) and fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector&#x000ae;) by measuring salivary <italic>Mutans streptococci</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> levels and buffering capacity, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index scores in patients who underwent orthodontic fixed appliance therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This research was designed as a prospective randomized and blind clinical study. Individuals who were scheduled to start their fixed orthodontic treatment at the orthodontic clinic of Faculty of Dentistry, Karadeniz Technical University, were included. The patients or their parents were informed about the study and signed informed consent forms. Ethical approval was taken from The Karadeniz Technical University Ethics Committee before the study was initiated (2011/36).</p><p>The selection criteria for inclusion in the study were as follows: Patients with complete permanent dentition, good general health and no use of pharmacotherapics for the last three months and aged between 12 to 18 at the initiation of fixed appliance therapy were included in the study. All the individuals underwent fully banded, non-extraction edgewise treatment. There was no evidence of decalcification on the teeth. There was no known hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine and fluoride. No restorations on the anterior teeth were present. All volunteers presented a minimum level of preexisting gingivitis and plaque.</p><p>Sixty patients were included in the study. Patients were advised to use fluoride-free dentifrice, toothbrushing and flossing for two weeks at home before bonding of the brackets. The bonding procedure was as follows: All buccal surfaces of the teeth to be bonded were pumiced with a rubber polishing cup using a low speed handpiece. Then the teeth were rinsed with water, air dried and etched with 37 % orthophosphoric acid for 30 seconds. The acid was rinsed off and the teeth were dried until the enamel exhibited an ice frosted appearance. Transbond XT primer (3M Unitek) was applied on the etched enamel surface and air thinned. Finally .022 edgewise brackets were placed on the teeth with an appropriate amount of Transbond XT (3M Unitek) applied on the bracket base. Excess adhesive around the brackets was removed with a scaler and light cured for 15 seconds with LED (Elipar Freelight 2, 3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany). After bracket bonding, comprehensive oral hygiene instructions were given to the patients by the treating orthodontist (initials of the treating Ortho here probably OB).</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into three groups</p><p>-Group 1 (n=20): 1% chlorhexidine diacetate and 1% thymol (Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The individuals received a Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus varnish application one week after bonding of the brackets.</p><p>-Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus application procedures were as follows: the tooth surfaces were cleaned thoroughly dried with an air syringe and isolated with cotton rolls. Three drops of Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus were poured into a dappen dish. A thin coat of varnish was applied by means of a Vivadent applicator on all of the surfaces of the bonded teeth (buccal, lingual, occlusal, and proximal areas). The varnish was dispersed with air and allowed to dry and the cotton rolls were removed after 30 seconds. Patients were instructed not to rinse, eat/drink or brush for one hour. They were also told to use fluoride-free dentifrices for four weeks at home. Parents were also told not to provide any other oral hygiene products. A paediatric dentist called the parents and children (every second day) to motivate them in order to provide valid participation in the trial.</p><p>-Group 2 (n=20): 1% chlorhexidine diacetate and 1% thymol (Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) plus 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.2% sodium fluoride (900 ppm fluoride), (Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The individuals received a Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus varnish application one week after bonding of the brackets. The application procedure of the Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus was the same as Group 1. After the application of the varnish, patients were told not to eat/drink or brush for one hour. In this group, the patients were instructed to brush their teeth with Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel as a dentifrice for four weeks at home. They were instructed to brush their teeth three times a day for 2 min. Parents were also told not to provide any other fluoride-containing dentifrices or oral hygiene products.</p><p>-Group 3 (n=20): 5 wt% difluorosilane corresponding to 0.7 wt% F-, (Fluor Protector&#x000ae;, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The individuals received a Fluor Protector&#x000ae; varnish application one week after bracket bonding.</p><p>-Fluor Protector&#x000ae; application procedure was as follows: The tooth surface was cleaned thoroughly and dried with an air syringe and isolated with cotton rolls. A thin layer of Fluor Protector&#x000ae; was applied on all tooth surfaces (buccal, lingual, occlusal, and proximal areas) using a suitable single-use applicator (Vivabrush G). The varnish was dispersed with air and allowed to dry, and cotton rolls were removed after 60 seconds. Patients were instructed not to rinse their mouth. After the application of varnish, patients were told not to eat/drink or brush for 45 minutes. The patients were told to use fluoride-free dentifrices for four weeks at home. Parents were also told not to provide any other oral hygiene products. In order to assess plaque accumulation the following parameters were analysed: Salivary <italic>Mutans streptococci</italic> (MS) and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> (LB) levels and buffering capacity (BC), visible plaque index (VPI), and gingival bleeding index (GBI).</p><p>-Bacteria in saliva: CRT&#x000ae; bacteria (CRT&#x000ae; Intro Pack - Caries Risk Test, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was used to determine the MS and LB count in saliva by means of selective culture media.</p><p>-CRT&#x000ae; bacteria procedure: Salivary secretion was stimulated in the patients by chewing an enclosed paraffin pellet and saliva specimens were collected in a suitable container. The agar was removed from the test vial. A NaHCO3 tablet was placed at the bottom of the vial. The protective foils were carefully removed from the two agar surfaces. Both agar surfaces were wetted with saliva using a pipette without scratching the agar surface. The test vial was placed upright in the incubator (Cultura/ Ivoclar Vivadent Schaan, Liechtenstein) and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C/ 99 &#x000b0;F for 48 hours. After removal of the vial from the incubator, the density of the MS and LB colonies were compared with the corresponding evaluation pictures in the enclosed model chart. Findings of 105 CFU (colony-forming units) or more of MS and LB per ml saliva indicated a high caries risk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CRT&#x000ae; bacteria (CRT&#x000ae; Intro Pack - Caries Risk Test, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein): Bright agar surface: determination of LB count in saliva, Blue agar surface: determination of MS count in saliva.

The patients sat upright in a relaxed position. Salivation was stimulated by having the patient chew a paraffin pellet. The saliva was collected in a calibrated container. The entire yellow test field was wetted with saliva using a pipette. To determine the buffer capacity of saliva, the colour of the test field was compared with the colour samples after exactly five minutes of reaction time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>CRT&#x000ae; buffer (CRT&#x000ae; Intro Pack - Caries Risk Test, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein): Blue indicated a high, green indica-ted a medium, and yellow indicated a low buffer capacity of saliva.

The number of surfaces with plaque was divided by the total number of examined surfaces.</p><p>-Gingivitis: The Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) was assessed by using a 0.5 mm diameter periodontal probe. The gingiva was lightly air-dried, and the probe was gently inserted into the gingival crevice parallel to the long axis of the tooth until slight pressure was felt. At this point, the probe was run along the crevice in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Minimum axial force was used to avoid undue penetration into the tissue, and the probe was moved around the crevice, gently stretching the epithelium. Only the gingival margin at the mesiolabial surfaces was evaluated for every bonded tooth. Bleeding was recorded as &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and no bleeding as &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;. The number of elicited bleeding points was added up and divided by the number of sites probed.</p><p>All of the above-mentioned recordings and measurements were collected and/or measured by two experienced operators and assessor blinding was ensured throughout the trial period. One of the examiners collected the saliva samples for bacteria and executed the buffering capacity procedures. This examiner performed all of the procedures according to the instructions for CRT&#x000ae; bacteria and CRT&#x000ae; buffer procedures for an individual patient. He also recorded all of the measurements for each stage of the study for each individual patient (T0, T1, T2, and T3). The other examiner measured the VPI and GBI values (T0, T1, T2, and T3).</p><p>Staining of the teeth and temporary bitter taste problems were also recorded.</p><p>These parameters were evaluated at four different time points:</p><p>T0 (Baseline): The first samples and measurements were taken just before the bonding procedure. T1 samples and measurements were taken one week after bracket bonding prior to varnish application. Also the varnishes were applied at this stage.

Preventive measures such as good oral hygiene, noncariogenic dietary habits, and regular fluoride application should be carefully carried out throughout the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, these attempts may not always be sufficient to avoid microbial colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, adjunctive preventive applications i. e. applying chemotherapeutic agents, may be a key factor in reducing the potential risks of cariogenic microflora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>It is also important to provide better oral hygiene features by regular toothbrushing and flossing at home, particularly for the orthodontic patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Therefore, in addition to professionally applied varnish treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), brushing teeth regularly with Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel formulations (with respect to its usage indications) and monitoring in four-week recall periods could be considered as an average interval follow-up period for patients in our study. As previously stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), home-based self-application treatments may decrease the plaque accumulation around the bands and brackets. Because of the above reasons, the short-term (T2, one week; T3, four weeks) combined effects of Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus+Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel (Group 2) formulations were compared with one-visit varnish treatments in terms of MS, LB, BC, VPI, and GBI levels of orthodontic patients with fixed appliances.</p><p>This study demonstrated that combination therapy with Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus (one-visit application) and Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel (through toothpaste usage at home) is beneficial in reducing salivary bacterial counts and improving oral hygiene features compared with one-visit Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus and Fluor Protector&#x000ae; applications in up to four weeks.</p><p>Increased levels of MS and LB were commonly found in the oral cavity after bonding orthodontic attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In this study, the CRT chair-side test was used to measure MS, LB, and BC levels. Different studies have also supported this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Additionally, a significant correlation had been found between conventional analysis with MSR agar and the MS or LB chair-site tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To analyze the caries-associated parameters (MS, LB, and BC), a blind (had no idea about the treatment groups) experienced examiner conducted the test. This examiner collected all saliva samples and measured salivary bacterial counts and BC levels. VPI and GBI scores were presented as the key factors indicating the oral hygiene status of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Thus, in order to screen the oral hygiene features of the patients, another blind examiner (initials of the blind examiner) measured these parameters.</p><p>According to the initial MS and LB measurements of this study, the study group could be considered a high caries risk group (&#x0003e;105) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, T0 (baseline) and T1 values were not significantly different according to the MS, LB, BC, VPI, and GBI parameters among the groups (P&#x0003e;0.017). These findings could facilitate the data analysis among the groups, particularly at T2 and T3 periods. From this standpoint, undesirable individual responses to all treatments could be minimized. This is also concurrent with the randomly selected high caries risk group of the presented orthodontic clinic.</p><p>Increased MS levels in saliva and around the bonded teeth had been reported three months after bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this study, both MS and LB levels increased compared with T0 values after the bonding period (T1), in all groups. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Fluoride treatment may be beneficial in eliminating the possible complications of fixed orthodontic treatment. However, a valid fluoride application regimen has not been described yet in terms of providing reasonable oral hygiene features in orthodontic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Previous reports indicated that fluoride and CHX combination therapy could be beneficial in increasing the bacterio-static effect of fluoride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, commercially available tooth gel formulations have been recommended to provide better oral hygiene features in patients undergoing orthodontic treatments with fixed appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). CHX-based gel formulations have recently been found to decrease the gingival bleeding scores in patients with special care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, the potential staining risk and temporary bitter taste of toothpaste formulations containing CHX must be carefully considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In order to reduce the staining effect of CHX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), reduce the concentration of CHX from 0.75% to 0.50% in dentifrice. They postulated that 0.50% CHX reduces the staining risk without compromising the its effectiveness against gingivitis and bleeding. However, Sari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) showed that although 0.2% CHX reduces S. Mutans levels, it does not have any effect on Lactobacillus count in saliva. Nevertheless, manufacturer instructions indicate that using Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel formulation for about four weeks can help avoid possible side effects, including staining of the teeth and temporary bitter taste problems. No staining or temporary bitter taste problems were recorded in this study. One-visit varnish treatment model was used to compare the potential use of CHX tooth gels over longer periods and to observe the exact desirable or undesirable effects of combined therapies for future studies.</p><p>The most common preventive application during fixed orthodontic treatments was repeated varnish treatments in different time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Various varnish treatment procedures and frequencies have been documented in the literature regarding the use of Cervitec&#x000ae;Plus or fluoride varnishes in orthodontic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Moreover, fluoride varnish treatments were found to reduce salivary bacterial counts and decrease the plaque index and bleeding scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Possible positive effects of applying repeated varnish treatments documented in the literature were reducing bacterial counts and plaque scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, findings which indicate that repeated applications did not always result in better antimicrobial suspension or acceptable oral hygiene features with evidence of long-term outcomes cause controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Previous findings revealed that MS suppression could persist after a single application of CHX-containing varnish for two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), three weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), or six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Additionally, such investigation designs or methodologies clearly showed that varnish treatment with CHX or therapeutic fluoride materials was used in various ways either before (intensive) or after the bonding procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, an effective way to apply varnish immediately after the bonding procedure was found to be a main concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Furthermore, in this study, because one-visit application procedures and combined therapy (to avoid the side effects of self application of CHX gel formulation) were utilized for short follow-up periods, an intensive application period was not used. However, if varnishes are used before bonding, similar to previous study designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), negative microflora alterations after the bonding procedure (T1) and the effect of combined therapy might be concealed since the varnishes could have a prolonged cumulative antimicrobial effect up to the T2 and T3 periods. In this way, the study aimed to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of combination therapy over one-visit varnish treatment models in a dental clinic, particularly after the bonding procedure.</p><p>Regarding intergroup comparisons, MS and LB levels in Group 2 decreased significantly better than Groups 1 (at T2) (P&#x0003c;0.017) and 3 (at T2 and T3, distinctly) (P&#x0003c;0.017). This evidence showed that the self-application of tooth gel formulation could increase the success of one-visit varnish treatments. This feature might be attributed to remaining CHX particles around negatively ionized tooth surfaces with regular tooth brushing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This study also confirmed that one-visit application of CHX-based varnishes (Group 1) showed better antimicrobial properties over the fluoride (Group 3) varnish treatments, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The limited/biased factor of Group 2 should also be taken into account, as it had a potential advantage since the home-based self-application of Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel could increase treatment success over professionally applied varnishes in terms of providing acceptable oral hygiene features. Furthermore, since the short-term present outcomes of varnish treatments (in Groups 1 and 3) were found to be less successful, sealing all areas with the varnishes should not be overlooked since a great deal of care was declared, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, the application of varnish treatments (in Groups 1 and 3) could be almost difficult when high viscosity features of these agents clearly obstruct their potential usage around bands and brackets after bonding procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The possible failure problems related to varnish treatments were documented as rapid recolonization and returning of MS bacteria to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) . In this study, Group 1 and, in particular, Group 2 exhibited significantly lower (P&#x0003c;0.017) MS levels in saliva at T2 and T3 compared with individual T0 values. Moreover, in Group 3, the lower but insignificant (P&#x0003e;0.017) MS levels were found at either T2 or T3 compared with individual T0 values. Considering LB bacteria, such differences were found compared with MS. Group 1 and, in particular, Group 2 exhibited lower but insignificant (P&#x0003e;0.017) LB levels compared with T0 values. Also, in Group 3 the LB levels were found almost higher at T2 and T3 compared with individual T0 values (P&#x0003e;0.017). After the varnish treatments, the chosen test periods (T2, one week and T3, four weeks) could also reflect risk of recolonization since this problem could be observed at about two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These periods (one week and four weeks) may be considered worst-case scenario conditions for all groups. Therefore, after observing the above findings, the rapid bacterial recolonization feature is understandably more risky in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> Table 2</xref>). These findings may also be gained from the acceptable intragroup variations of the tested groups, which simplified screening of the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches and increased the power of the present study.</p><p>After application of the fixed orthodontic appliances, the destructive effect could be minimized only with the BC of the saliva. Moreover, the metallic bracket features have been shown to induce specific changes in the oral environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In this study, the BC was found higher in Groups 1 and 2, and significantly different during T2 and T3 (P&#x0003c;0.017) compared with Group 3. Also, Group 2 exhibited higher BC values at T2 and T3 (P&#x0003e;0.017) compared with Group 1. These findings highly extrapolated that the use of a combined therapy would be beneficial, particularly during the early stages of the fixed orthodontic treatment. Recommending home-based CHX containing tooth gel formulations with professional varnish therapies seemed to improve oral hygiene features as shown by the BC results of this study.</p><p>Since increased plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding are known as possible side effects of fixed orthodontic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), this study also evaluated VPI and GBI values. Bonding teeth with metallic appliances increases plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In this study, the VPI and GBI scores tended to increase at T1 (immediately after bonding) compared with T0 for all groups (P&#x0003e;0.017), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Group 3 exhibited higher VPI and GBI scores compared with Groups 1 and 2 at T2 (P&#x0003c;0.017) and T3 (P&#x0003e;0.017). For Group 1, a positive effect was found, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Group 2 also experienced lower plaque accumulation and bleeding problems compared with Group 1 (P&#x0003e;0.017) at T2 and T3. In addition, in Group 2 the VPI and GBI scores were also found significantly lower at T2 and T3 compared with T0 (P&#x0003c;0.017). Considering all of the parameters, the possible beneficial effects of combined therapy over one-visit varnish applications (Groups 1 and 3) verified by the decreasing VPI and GBI results found in this study. Previous findings revealed that six or 12-weeks application of low concentrated CHX-based tooth gel formulations (0.50%) might be beneficial in reducing plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding without considering side effects such as staining and bitter taste during orthodontic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In this study, reduced concentration of CHX (0.2%) tooth gel formulation with 0.2% sodium fluoride was used in a self-application procedure and was also found to be a promising agent for the prevention of decalcification in orthodontic patients. Findings of this study are in agreement with the previous CHX-based toothpaste studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although the one-visit varnish treatment procedure could increase the effectiveness in Group 2 compared with Group 1, the relatively beneficial prolonged effect of the present results at T3 of this study showed that Cervitec&#x000ae;Gel formulation could be a part of routine oral hygiene in orthodontic patients. From another perspective, further investigations are needed on a more frequent, home-based self-application procedure combined with repeated varnish treatments over a long evaluation period.</p><p>The measured parameters being better in Group 2 than Groups 1 and 3 may also be explained by the Hawthorne effect. Children were highly motivated when they were told to brush their teeth with the specific gel formulation in Group 2. Thus, recommending home-based preventive applications instead of routine toothbrushing practices in different time intervals could be useful in motivating children undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. This may have been a confounding factor, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Overall, within the limitations of this study, the combination of chlorhexidine varnish and chlorhexidine-fluoride containing dentifirice was found to be a successful and promising alternative for improving oral hygiene features of patients lacking sufficient oral hygiene characteristics during orthodontic treatment. Moreover, the possible side effects of toothpastes must be carefully monitored and, if required, eliminated by the clinician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>One-visit chlorhexidine varnish treatment combined with a home-based chlorhexidine-fluoride gel formulation may be implemented as a caries prevention strategy, for patients undergoing fixed appliance treatment and particularly under high risk of caries.</p><p>Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness of repeated preventive procedures.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
