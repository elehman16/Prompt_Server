However, no systematic study has been done to examine the influence of the site of pharyngeal packing on postoperative throat complaints. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the postoperative throat effects of nasopharyngeal packing and oropharyngeal packing in patients undergoing nasal surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval from the Ethics Committee, this randomized comparative study was conducted in American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Grades I and II adult patients posted for nasal surgery having a Mallampatti Grades of I and II and presumed to undergo routine orotracheal intubation. Written informed consent was obtained prior to commencement.</p><p>Patients who underwent nasal surgeries like unilateral or bilateral functional endoscopic sinus surgery, sub mucous resection, septoplasty, and rhinoplasty satisfying the following criteria were eligible:</p><p>

</p><p>After wheeling to patient in operation theater a firm pad (7 cm in height) was placed under the patient's occiput and all noninvasive monitored were attached as per standard protocol. After this, the patient was preoxygenated through a facemask for a minimum of 3 min. Anesthesia was induced with an induction dose of propofol 2.0&#x02013;3.0 mg/kg intravenous and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg was given for analgesia. Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal tubes with a low-pressure high volume cuff were utilized. 8 mm and 7 mm inner diameter tubes were used to intubate male and female patients, respectively. The cuff was inflated just to the point of obtaining a seal in the presence of positive airway pressure. The ventilation was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide levels of 30&#x02013;35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 0.5&#x02013;1.5% in combination with 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Oropharyngeal suction before extubation was performed under direct vision to avoid trauma to the pharyngeal mucosa, with standard recommended suction pressure. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 5 mcg/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 mcg/kg after completion of the surgery. Prior to extubation patient was given lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg to produce smooth extubation.</p><p>In Group A, the oropharynx was packed with saline soaked gauze once the patient was under anesthesia. In Group B, the nasopharynx was packed in a similar manner as for Group A. In both groups, the otolaryngologist under vision carried out packing of the pharynx.</p><p>Nearing the completion of the planned surgical procedure prior to extubation, the pharyngeal pack was removed by the otolaryngologist. This was followed by an examination of the oropharynx, epiglottis, laryngeal inlet, and vocal cords under direct laryngoscopy by the otolaryngologist to note any lesions of the same.</p><p>Patients were interviewed postoperatively for any throat complications. Complaints of the patients such as sore throat, difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), hoarseness of voice, throat irritation, and any other symptom pertaining to the study were noted during the interview. The observations were made at the following intervals: Half hour after extubation, 2 h after extubation, 6 h after extubation and 24 h after extubation.</p><p>Sore throat was graded as following:</p><p>

Minor complications, however, are common. These include sore throats, hoarseness, pain and difficulty in swallowing, pharyngeal ulceration and even aphonia.</p><p>Sore throat is a common complaint after anesthesia and surgery, and the incidence can be as high as 80%.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Some of the common causes include:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Trauma during tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The laryngoscope blade can cause injury to the pharynx and tonsillar fauces</p></list-item><list-item><p>Trauma to the larynx.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This is more likely if a red rubber tracheal tube is used rather than a plastic disposable tube, or if the tube has been forced through the vocal cords. A poorly stabilized tube causes more frictional damage to the larynx than one that is securely stabilized</p></list-item><list-item><p>Trauma to the pharynx. This may occur during the passage of a nasogastric tube or insertion of an oropharyngeal or laryngeal mask airway and is particularly common when a throat pack has been used. Occasionally the pharynx or upper esophagus may get perforated during difficult tracheal intubation and severe pain in the throat is often the first symptom. Sore throat is likely if a nasogastric tube remains <italic>in situ</italic> during the postoperative period. In the absence of a nasogastric tube POST is usually of short duration, most patients are symptom-free within 48 h</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other factors. The mucous membranes of the mouth, pharynx, and upper airway are sensitive to the effects of nonhumidified gases; the drying effect of anesthetic gases may cause POST. The antisialagogue effect of anti-cholinergic drugs may also contribute to this symptom. Movement of the head, use of cuffed or un-cuffed tubes, site of surgery, bucking and coughing with the endotracheal tube in place are some of the factors, which play a role in the development of POST.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Hoarseness is another major complaint following endotracheal intubation. It is almost always associated with tracheal intubation and is caused predominantly by the prolonged abduction of and pressure on the vocal cords. However, traumatic tracheal intubation can cause direct trauma to the vocal cords resulting in prolonged hoarseness.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In this randomized comparative study two groups of 20 adults were analyzed, each one them had an oropharyngeal pack or nasopharyngeal pack depending on the group they were allocated to and their postoperative throat complaints were studied for incidence of sore throat, dysphagia, hoarseness and throat irritation at definite intervals of time. The study was designed primarily to elucidate whether the location of a throat pack (nasopharynx vs. oropharynx) makes any difference as to the occurrence of pharyngeal and laryngeal morbidity in the postoperative period.</p><p>The scoring scale used for assessing POST was the same as described by Elhakim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Dysphagia, hoarseness and throat irritation were scored as present or absent, as there is no scale described for them in the literature.</p><p>A major problem was the assessment of the throat soreness.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hartsell <italic>et al</italic>. found only 5.7% of their patients who were intubated actually complained of sore throat. This corresponds well with Griffiths <italic>et al</italic>. who found that 5% of their patients volunteered information concerning sore throat, but on direct questioning the figure was 44%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This difference may be due to the fact that patients concentrate on symptoms directly related to the operative site and do not immediately associate sore throat with anesthesia and surgery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In the study conducted, it was observed that patients in Group A were more likely to have POST than patients included in Group B (the at all-time intervals after extubation. The overall mean incidence of POST in Group A and Group B were 30% and 18.75%, respectively. The mean incidence for POST &#x000bd; h after extubation was 31.66% in Group A and 21.66% in Group B. 2 h after extubation it was 31.66% in Group A and 20% in Group B. 6 h after extubation the incidence was 30% and 18.3% in Groups A and B respectively. The incidence of POST fell to 28.3% and 15% in Groups A and B respectively 24 h after extubation. These findings imply that site of pharyngeal packing does influence incidence of POST.</p><p>Approximately, 70&#x02013;80% of patients in Group A had moderate POST, &#x000bd; h and 2 h after extubation. On the other hand, only 10&#x02013;20% of patients in Group B had moderate POST &#x000bd; and 2 h after extubation. At 6 and 24 h after extubation, Group A patients had an incidence of 15&#x02013;30% of moderate POST, while only 5% of patients in Group B had moderate POST at the same time interval. The study by Griffiths <italic>et al</italic>. utilized three types of sterile throat packs (gauze soaked in sterile saline, gauze soaked in Vaseline, and tampons soaked in sterile saline), which were placed in the oropharynx of the patient.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Subsequently patients were observed for POST. The overall incidence of sore throat in the Griffiths <italic>et al</italic>. study was 70%. Moreover, 24% of patients in the study had a sore throat lasting longer than 48 h. The study pointed out that there was no statistical difference in the incidence of sore throat produced by any of the three different throat packs. This corresponds to the incidence of POST in Group A patients in our study. This again suggests that the site and type of pharyngeal packing influences the incidence of POST.</p><p>During the course of our study it was noted that 13.7% patients had severe POST in Group A where as in Group B the incidence of severe POST was only 1.25%. This suggests that the site of pharyngeal packing does influence the severity of POST.</p><p>In our study, it was also noted that patients included in Group A had a higher incidence of dysphagia up to 6 h after extubation when compared to patients who were included in Group B. The mean incidence of dysphagia in Group A patients up to 6 h after extubation was 75%, whereas in Group B patients, it was 25%. These results were found to be statistically significant. After 24 h the incidence of dysphagia in Group A was 40% and Group B it was 20%. However, this was not statistically significant.</p><p>In this study, the incidence of hoarseness and throat irritation was slightly higher in the oropharyngeal pack group, in comparison with the nasopharyngeal pack group. The results failed to show any significant difference with regard to the site of throat packing in the incidence of hoarseness and throat irritation. The mean incidence of hoarseness was 40% in Group A, and 20% in Group B. The mean incidence of throat irritation in Group A and Group B were 53.75%, and 42%, respectively.</p><p>Conway <italic>et al</italic>., studied 1480 patients and found that the insertion of gauze pharyngeal pack moistened with water was associated with a high incidence of sore throat.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] About 42% of patients had mild sore throat, and 19% had severe sore throat. This is comparable to the overall incidence of sore throat as per our study. Conway <italic>et al</italic>. did not study whether the location of a pharyngeal pack influences incidence and severity of sore throat.</p><p>Marais and Prescott studied subjective pain assessments at 6 and 24 h postoperatively, in patients who had oropharyngeal throat packs that consisted of either gauze or tampon.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The study showed that 38% of patients had moderate or severe throat pain in the gauze group, while the tampon and control groups it amounted to only 15% and 1% respectively. The study also noted that a significantly higher proportion of patients in the former group had moderate or severe sore throat at 24 h. Intubation alone resulted in sore throat postoperatively in 50% of patients, but 85% of those who had sore throat, the severity was graded as mild. Marais and Prescott concluded endotracheal intubation often causes POST and this is aggravated by pharyngeal packs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Tay <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on POST after routine oral surgery and the influence of a pharyngeal pack on the incidence of POST.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Two groups were studied, patients with pharyngeal pack and patients without any pack. The study showed that overall incidence of sore throat immediately after recovery was 76% and after 24 h was 53%. There was no significant difference between the groups either immediately after the surgery or 24 h later. They concluded that the incidence and severity of POST is not influenced by the insertion of a pharyngeal pack. This finding is however conflicting with conclusions of Conway <italic>et al</italic>. and Marais and Prescott.</p><p>There were several drawbacks in our study. The sample size was only forty patients. A larger sample size would have made it easier to apply the results to the general population. The observations were made only up to a period of 24 h after extubation whereas patients continue to complain of throat discomfort up to 48 h after extubation. Extension of the study up to 48 h after extubation might have led to a clearer picture on the entity of postoperative throat discomfort. The study contained no control group, but only Group A and Group B where throat packs were inserted into the oropharynx and nasopharynx respectively. A control group, in which there were no throat packs used, would have been helpful to ascertain whether throat packs do increase the severity and incidence of postoperative throat discomfort although eliminating a throat pack in nasal surgeries would increase the likelihood of trachea-bronchial contamination from blood and debris.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
