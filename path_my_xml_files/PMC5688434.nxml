Products that are effective in eliminating microfilariae (MF) in dogs harboring resistant heartworm infections could be important in reducing the spread of heartworm resistance. The current study was conducted to investigate the potential for ProHeart&#x000ae; 6 (PH 6; Zoetis) and ProHeart&#x000ae; SR-12 (PH 12; Zoetis) to reduce MF in dogs experimentally inoculated with an isolate of <italic>D. immitis</italic> (ZoeMo-2012) confirmed to be resistant to MLs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Twenty-three dogs with preexisting heartworm infections (via surgical transplantation) were randomly allocated to four groups based on pretreatment (Day &#x02212;14) MF counts. On Day 0, dogs received a subcutaneous injection of either saline (placebo-treated control, 6 dogs), PH 6 (0.17 mg/kg, 6 dogs), PH 12 (0.5 mg/kg, 5 dogs) or a single oral dose of moxidectin powder in a gelatin capsule (0.25 mg/kg, 6 dogs). All dogs were bled for MF counts (modified Knott&#x02019;s test) on Days 0 (pretreatment), 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 84. Dogs in control and PH 6 groups were also bled for MF counts on Days 112, 140, and 168. No adverse events associated with treatment were observed for any dog.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Average reductions in MF counts compared with controls for PH 6 were 9.7% on Day 1, increasing to 75.0% on Day 7, and further to 86.5% on Day 28. On Day 42, average MF reduction increased to 90.3%. Reductions increased further over the next several months with reductions of 91.3, 96.8, 96.6, and 98.9% on Days 56, 84, 112, and 140, respectively. On Day 168, the reduction was 99.3% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Much is yet to be learned, however, about the nature and extent of this resistance in natural populations. A better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of heartworm in areas where resistant strains of heartworm occur is necessary to estimate how this resistance may spread. Work is being undertaken to gain more information on these factors, but the progress is somewhat slow due to the complicated and multifaceted aspects of this inquiry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Baseline survey data on the current level and geographical distribution of resistance are required, along with factors underlying and contributing to the development and the spread of this resistance.</p><p id="Par11">Reducing the availability of resistant microfilariae in nature for transmission to other competent hosts would be beneficial in reducing the spread of resistant heartworms. Recent publications have shown that several ML-based products that were originally potent microfilaricides failed to substantially reduce or clear some dogs of circulating microfilariae (MF) later identified as resistant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

The purpose of the current investigation was to determine the activity of PH 6 and PH 12 in reducing microfilarial levels in dogs surgically implanted with a resistant isolate (ZoeMO-2012) of <italic>D. immitis (</italic>see &#x0201c;<italic>D. immitis</italic> Isolate&#x0201d; following).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par12">The study was a masked, negative placebo-controlled, randomized laboratory efficacy study conducted in Michigan, USA.

All personnel conducting observations or animal care or performing infestations and counts were masked to treatment allocation. The protocol for this study was approved by the Zoetis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and the study was conducted in accordance with state and national/international regulations regarding animal welfare.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par13">Twenty-five (25) dogs with preexisting adult heartworm infections, established via surgical transplantation (10 pairs of adult heartworms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] with an isolate (ZoeMO-2012 isolate), confirmed to be resistant to MLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were available for this study. The dogs had not been treated with a monthly oral preventive dose of a ML for at least 180&#x000a0;days before inoculation with heartworms. Dogs were identified individually by unique numeric ear tattoo or digital microchip. For at least 14&#x000a0;days prior to treatment, dogs were acclimated to the study facilities. For the duration of the study, dogs were housed in individual enclosures, which prevented physical contact with adjacent animals. Dogs were offered water ad libitum and were fed an appropriate standard commercial canine diet. Prior to inclusion in the study, dogs were examined for overall general physical health and study suitability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><italic>D. immitis</italic> isolate</title><p id="Par14">The heartworm isolate used in this study was designated ZoeMo-2012. A blood sample was collected from a heartworm-positive dog, originally from Pittsfield, Illinois, USA, on December 4, 2012, which was used to infect <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Liverpool strain) mosquitoes. On December 19, 2012, two dogs were each inoculated with 50 infective larvae (L3) that developed in these mosquitoes. On July 18, 2013, these two dogs were positive for MF on a modified Knott&#x02019;s test, validating passage of this isolate. This isolate was taken from the same parent dog from which the original JYD-34 isolate had been taken 2.5&#x000a0;years earlier (John McCall, personal oral communication, August 2013). The dog had been maintained in mosquito-proof quarters with no additional macrocyclic lactones administered during the intervening time from JYD-34 isolation to ZoeMo-2012 isolation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p id="Par15">On Day &#x02212;14, 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to treatment, dogs were tested for adult <italic>D. immitis</italic> antigen and were examined by the modified Knott&#x02019;s method for MF. Animals with MF counts &#x0003e;1000 MF/mL and that had positive results on a heartworm antigen (DiroCHEK&#x000ae;; Zoetis) test on Day &#x02212;14 were included in the study. Two of the 25 dogs available for the study did not meet the minimum requirement for MF on Day &#x02212;14 and were excluded from the study. The remaining 23 animals were randomly allocated to four treatments based on MF counts as follows: placebo-treated control (six dogs), ProHeart&#x000ae; 6 (PH 6, six dogs), ProHeart&#x000ae; SR-12 (PH 12, five dogs), and oral moxidectin (six dogs/group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Treatment</title><p id="Par16">On Day &#x02212;7, each dog was weighed and given a physical examination.

However furthur reductions were not observed during the following 2&#x000a0;months. On Day 84 (the final time point), the reduction was 92.6%.

A mean of 15.3 and 16.7 of the 20 worms/dog initially transplanted were recovered from the control and PH 6-treated, respectively, indicating no effect of PH 6 on adult heartworms over the 168-day study period.

Lack of efficacy of approved monthly preventive products containing selamectin, milbemycin oxime and ivermectin against the JYD-34 isolate has been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], suggesting that this isolate is resistant to approved doses of some MLs.

However, none of these products, except ProHeart&#x000ae; 6 and ProHeart&#x000ae; SR-12 reported here, has demonstrated microfilaricidal potency against a resistant heartworm isolate.
