This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether pre-training of basic skills, as laparoscopic camera navigation (LCN), hand-eye coordination (HEC), and bimanual coordination (BMC), and the combination of the three of them, has any beneficial effect upon the learning curve of LICK. The study was carried out in a private center in Asunci&#x000f3;n, Paraguay, by 80 medical students without any experience in surgery. Four laparoscopic tasks were performed in the ENCILAP model (LCN, HEC, BMC, and LICK). Participants were allocated to 5 groups (G1&#x02013;G5). The study was structured in 5 phases. In phase 1, they underwent a base-line test (<italic>T</italic>

In phase 2, participants underwent different training programs (30 consecutive repetitions) for basic tasks according to the group they belong to (G1: none; G2: LCN; G3: HEC; G4: BMC; and G5: LCN, HEC, and BMC). In phase 3, they were tested again (<italic>T</italic>

The LICK group learning curves fitted better to the two-phase exponential decay model. From these curves, the starting points (<italic>Y</italic>0), the point after HEC training/before LICK training (<italic>Y</italic>1), the Plateau, and the rate constants (<italic>K</italic>) were calculated. All groups, except for G4, started from a similar point (<italic>Y</italic>0). At <italic>Y</italic>1, G5 scored already better than the others (G1 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004; G2 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04; G3 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.0001; G4 NS).

Indeed, to achieve proficiency through this model seems unacceptable for both practical and ethical reasons, such as the limited number of tutors, the fewer surgical cases in daily practice, the increased operating time, the higher complication rate, and the long learning curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery demands both surgical and psychomotor skills that not necessarily should be trained together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with increasing evidence suggesting that psychomotor skills must be trained earlier and outside the operating room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Following this philosophy, the European Academy of Gynecological Surgery has developed the LASTT (Laparoscopic Skills Training and Testing) model for training basic laparoscopic psychomotor skills, such as laparoscopic camera navigation (LCN), hand-eye coordination (HEC), and bimanual coordination (BMC).

The supervisor indicated the first symbol to be shown, which was identifiable from a panoramic viewpoint. Participants looked throughout the model for this symbol, found it, and focused on the small symbol situated next to it, which was shown on the center of the screen from a close-up viewpoint.

The repetition ended either when all objectives (12 figures identified for LCN, 6 rings transported for HEC, 6 pushpins transported for BMC) were accomplished or when the time limit expired. The quality of the objectives was obvious, and thus, the supervisor just counted the number of objectives accomplished. If within the time limit at least one objective was achieved, the score was calculated dividing the time actually used (1&#x02013;180) by the number of objectives accomplished (LCN 1&#x02013;12, HEC 1&#x02013;6, BMC 1&#x02013;6).

The specific aim of the study was to characterize the LICK learning curve under different pre-training conditions (i.e., one control group with no pre-training, three study groups with pre-training of only one basic skill each (LCN, HEC, or BMC) and one study group with pre-training of the three basic skills (LCN, HEC, and BMC)). This was done in order to define whether pre-training of one basic skill shortens the LICK learning curve and moreover if pre-training of all basic skills has some additive beneficial effect.</p><p id="Par39">For each participant, the scores registered at all points were plotted and individual and group learning curves were observed. For most individuals, as well as for most groups, the one-phase exponential decay was the best-fitted model. From the group curves, the starting point before any training (<italic>Y</italic>0), the point before LICK training (<italic>Y</italic>1), the Plateau, and the learning constant (<italic>K</italic>) were calculated. The <italic>Y</italic>1 was included to evaluate specifically the impact of previous training. Although the real values at baseline of all groups were comparable, the calculated values at <italic>Y</italic>0 were surprisingly different, being better/lower for G4. All other groups had comparable starting points (<italic>Y</italic>0) and improved their scores at the next evaluated point of the curve (i.e., <italic>Y</italic>1). Since this effect was observed even for G1, the influence of repetition cannot be neglected. This effect was more pronounce in G2 and even more in G3 and G4, indicating the importance of training LCN, HEC, and BMC, respectively. However, the greater effect was observed in G5, which also scored significantly better than all other groups. In spite of these differences at the beginning of the curve, all groups reached a similar Plateau but at different speed. Indeed, G5 has a quicker learning as demonstrated by the higher learning constant (<italic>K</italic>). All these together indicate the relevance of training all laparoscopic psychomotor skills first in order not only to start the LICK training from a better point but also to achieve proficiency sooner.</p><p id="Par40">It has been sufficiently proved that training improves laparoscopic skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which also applies specifically to training in box models as recently reported in a meta-analysis, at least in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The majority of the studies base this conclusion upon measurements performed at two or few points (before and after training). The effect of training however can be better appreciated if several points are taken into consideration, allowing tracking the improvement in performance over time, which is defined as a learning curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although learning curves have been observed for many health technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], only recently they have become regularly used and reported for laparoscopic procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Our data about LICK learning curves are consistent with previous studies.

Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Thiyagarajan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] have also reported in 20 trainees learning curves with an exponential decay shape.</p><p id="Par42">There are few studies evaluating the effect of previous training upon LICK. Consistent with our study, Stefanidis et al. demonstrated in 20 novices that training basic laparoscopic skills (bean drop, running string, block move, checkerboard, and endostitch) shortened the learning curve of a more complex laparoscopic task like suturing. They have also claimed the additional benefit of substantial cost savings because the trained group required significantly less active instruction and less overall costs of the suture material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In spite that learning curves were not reported, Fried et al. have also demonstrated in 215 surgeons that training a basic task (i.e., pegboard transfer) improves significantly the performance of LICK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">We believe that one of the strength of our study derives from the study population. Indeed, our sample size was larger than required to achieve our objectives and comprises medical students without experience in practicing surgery (neither laparotomy nor laparoscopy), which ascertains that the skills acquired derive exclusively from the training offered by this study, guaranteeing the purity of the data without external influences. Furthermore, the fact of being last-year students provides them with sufficient knowledge to define their interest in surgical practice. This issue was specifically evaluated, and in spite of the overall great interest reported in the general population, we failed to demonstrate an effect in the results, in contrast with previous studies reporting better results in trainees with higher interest in surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">We also did not find any effect of the other variables evaluated (age, gender, dominant hand side, hand size, interest in video games), which is consistent with other studies showing that the learning curves are not substantially affected by previous exposure to surgery, either by assisting or by watching laparoscopic interventions, nor by personal characteristics, such as leisure activities, eye dysfunction, eye correction, dominant hand, personality, and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For this latter factor, however, Thorson et al. have claimed that among medical students with no previous exposure to laparoscopic trainers, women had a worse performance than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which might be explained by their smaller sample size than in our study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 vs. 80 participants).</p><p id="Par45">As in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], our scores were based upon the widely used time taken for task completion system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The system was slightly modified in the sense that the time was limited to 300&#x000a0;s based on previous results indicating that the vast majority of participants would have finished the task within these limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This was done because it would be practically impossible to carry out a large-scale measurement without time restrictions. It can be argued that this scoring system could be a limitation for our conclusions. We have to admit that time alone is not necessarily an accurate assessment of surgical skills and that accuracy and precision should be incorporated into the scoring system. In our system, however, these factors were implicitly incorporated because only knots correctly performed were scored without penalty.</p><p id="Par46">For the aims of this and future studies, we developed a novel box trainer model, the ENCILAP model, based on the LASTT model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in order to make it more versatile and portable and with a more rigorous and precise design. Since the tasks performed were the same as those reported and validated in the LASTT model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and since this new model is basically the same, except for the design, a specific validation was not necessary. The experience gathered during this and other studies still being conducted, and the data reported, indicates that the simple concept of rectangular block modules placed at different places of a platform, and fitted accordingly, is feasible for training not only the basic skills (i.e., LCN, HEC, BMC) but also LICK, and that can be used as an alternative to the LASTT model or to any other box trainer developed with this aim.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">In conclusion, our study confirms that training improves laparoscopic skills and demonstrates that pre-training of at least one basic task shortens the LICK learning curve and moreover that this beneficial effect is additive and more pronounce when the three basic tasks are pre-trained. Our data also demonstrate that the LICK learning curve is not significantly affected by confounding variables such as age, gender, dominant hand side, hand size, interest in surgery, and interest in video games. The study demonstrates the feasibility of the ENCILAP model for training both basic and advanced laparoscopic skills. It remains to be elucidated the potential effect of continuous tutoring during training and moreover the impact of all these factors upon real surgery in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
