The incidence of LOS varies amongst neonatal units from 11% to 27% for infants of very low birth weight (VLBW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The morbidity and mortality of episodes of hospital-acquired sepsis are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with morbidities including longer duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, and delays in establishing feeding. Studies also implicate neonatal infections as one of the risk factors for adverse neurological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Risk factors for LOS include immaturity, intravascular catheters, mechanical ventilation, and prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Importantly, some studies have suggested that PN is one of the most significant sepsis risk factors in VLBW infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although the evidence is virtually all retrospective and has not been able to account for immaturity in the analyses. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether PN is causal in sepsis or merely associated with the presence of a venous catheter in situ.</p><p>Strategies reported to have the most significant impact in reducing the incidence of LOS have involved bundles focussing on various combinations of hand washing, infection control practices and intravenous central line management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Few single interventions have been reported to significantly influence LOS. Aly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] however found a reduction in LOS after the introduction of a closed medication system in comparison to a historical control group.</p><p>Little attention has been paid to studying the effects of PN administration methods. In a historical cohort study, Maas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia in neonates following the introduction of a new catheter care protocol. The protocol maximised aseptic precautions and was supported by a continuing education program. There have been randomised controlled trials investigating the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risks of PN associated sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but we could find no randomised controlled trials investigating different methods of PN line management.</p><p>Our usual practice has been to administer PN through multiuse intravascular lines with the PN bags, syringes and tubing being changed by one nurse using a clean, no touch technique. A retrospective case-control audit in our NICU indicated that the majority of episodes of LOS in VLBW infants occurred in the first 28&#x000a0;days of life and after adjustment for birth weight, receiving PN was the factor associated with the greatest risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The study aimed to evaluate whether a bundle of line management measures focused on reducing the risk of contamination of PN lines would reduce the incidence of LOS in VLBW babies. The hypothesis was that the study intervention; comprised of a strict sterile technique for line changes and minimising the administration of other medications or fluids through PN lines would reduce catheter contamination and by minimising breaches would reduce the incidence of LOS when compared to the standard technique routinely used in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The secondary hypothesis was that the intervention would result in an improvement in developmental outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective randomised controlled trial enrolled infants managed in the NICU at the Mater Mothers&#x02019; Hospital (MMH), Brisbane. Ethics approval was obtained from the MMH Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee. The trial was registered with the Interdisciplinary Maternal Perinatal Australasian Collaborative Trials (IMPACT) Network (Trial registration number: PT0363) and with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (Trial registration number: ACTRN12617000455369 [retrospective registration]). Informed written consent was obtained from a parent prior to study enrolment.</p><p>Two techniques of PN line management were employed, designated - standard and study intervention techniques. Eligible babies were randomly allocated to each technique, using a web based randomisation program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://randomization.com">Randomization.com</ext-link>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). Randomisation sequence and block size were masked in blocks of 10 stratified by birth weight (500-999&#x000a0;g and 1000-1499&#x000a0;g). Allocation was sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes prepared by an administrative staff member not involved in the study.</p><p>VLBW infants with a birth weight&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1500&#x000a0;g were eligible if they survived at least 48&#x000a0;h, and were considered by the clinical team to require PN. Infants were excluded if they were not expected to survive to randomisation, had major congenital anomalies (including any infant expected to need neonatal surgery in the first 28&#x000a0;days) or had early onset sepsis (positive blood or CSF culture at &#x0003c;48&#x000a0;h of life). Once the decision had been made to commence PN on eligible infants and after parental consent had been obtained, babies were randomized to one of the two methods of PN line management used in the study. These are described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and in more detail in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

Probable sepsis was defined as a positive blood culture plus only one of: a raised hematologic sepsis score in the absence of physical signs, new onset thrombocytopaenia or a raised CRP measurement, or physical signs of sepsis and normal laboratory investigations. For the purpose of analysis, episodes of probable sepsis and definite sepsis were combined.

The present study confirmed that most episodes of LOS in premature neonates requiring PN coincide temporally while the babies are receiving PN. It is possible that the association of PN with LOS is not causative and that the need for PN is a marker of the vulnerability for these fragile infants. This may be because infants receiving PN tend to have more invasive procedures such as placement of intravascular catheters and blood sampling.</p><p>There is strong evidence that contamination of the catheter hub is an important mechanism for entry of pathogenic bacteria into the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which may occur during PN line changes or during injections of medication. Thus the technique used to disinfect the catheter hub may be more important than infection control measures such as sterile gowns and gloves in preventing hub contamination. In our study, in both the study intervention and standard technique groups the catheter hub was disinfected with a 70% isopropyl alcohol swab.</p><p>It has been shown that intravenous lipid emulsions, which form an essential part of PN, affect immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus PN could exert an additional risk for LOS in premature neonates through its effects on the already immature immune system of the premature infant. Hence the effect of a change in line management technique might be limited. Limitation of the use of PN and the duration of its use could be more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and indeed it has been suggested that PN should be ceased and long lines removed when 120&#x000a0;ml/kg/day of enteral nutrition is attained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that the use of bundles of measures focussed on multiple aspects of hand hygiene, infection control measures and intravascular central line management have resulted in a reduction in the incidence of LOS in neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent multicentred study has also shown that with a bundle of quality improvement measures there was a greater than 50% reduction in infection rates in neonatal intensive care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Unfortunately, comparisons with the current study are not possible as Bowen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] reported infection rates for their total population, whereas our infection rates relate only to infants in the study who were receiving PN. The evidence from previous studies is limited in that infection rates are compared with a historical cohort, but the results are consistent and have led to recommendations for the prevention of infection in the NICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There are likely to be many sources of infection in preterm infants. Any beneficial effects of one intervention may be obscured by the other reservoirs of infection. Our bundle of measures was designed to reduce the contamination of PN line catheter hubs during line changes. However, despite best efforts, lines could become contaminated via the skin breach or by haematogenous seeding.</p><p>There was little evidence that the study intervention was harmful although the study intervention technique was abandoned in four infants (3.2%) because of difficulty in inserting peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) for intravenous medication or infusions. The use of a PIV for medication injections in addition to the intravenous line for PN infusion however was successfully accomplished in the majority of babies.</p><p>It has been shown that preterm infants with infection during the neonatal period are more likely to have neurodevelopmental impairment including cognitive development than for uninfected infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, given that there was no difference in LOS between the study arms, it was not surprising that there was no difference in developmental outcomes between the two groups of infants. The developmental assessment however occurred at 1 year of age with no opportunity for assessment at an older age. If later developmental assessments had been performed, it is possible that differences in cognitive development may have become evident.</p><p>Limitations to the study include the fact that the study was undertaken more than a decade ago during which time there have been a number of changes in practices in many neonatal units that may reduce the rate of LOS. These include the use of probiotics and the more rapid rate of enteral feed increases resulting in shorter periods of PN. Nevertheless, given that the intervention arm focussed on PN line changes, it is felt that the study provides important information relevant to current management. A difficultly in the diagnosis of neonatal infection is that it is usual practice to withdraw blood from a peripheral vein for culture and not from central catheters. Thus it is possible that rates of sepsis could be underestimated or indeed overestimated as contamination with skin organisms especially coagulase negative staphylococci is a possibility. The diagnosis of infection in our study was rigorous and required additional evidence of sepsis including physical signs and abnormal laboratory results. Thus it is considered that the rate of infection documented in the present study is likely to be accurate.</p><p>The study, however had many strengths including blinding of outcome assessment, intention to treat analysis, relatively large sample size, and the low rate of attrition. Criteria for the primary outcome measure (LOS episodes) and other outcomes were predefined. Although the study was randomised, there were some minor weaknesses. Three infants were withdrawn from the study after randomisation. This was due to mistaken recruitment of two infants &#x0003c;500&#x000a0;g birth weight and one &#x0003e;1500&#x000a0;g, who were not eligible for inclusion. The inadvertent inclusion of these three infants was not a systematic error and post randomisation exclusion was considered appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The bundle of PN line management employing a two-nurse sterile technique and measures to reduce breaches of lines used to infuse the PN did not reduce the incidence of LOS in infants of &#x0003c;1500&#x000a0;g birth weight. There was no evidence from this study to recommend this as a routine practice. Further research is required to assess measures that are potentially effective to reduce what is considered to be a preventable complication of prematurity.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional file</title><p>
