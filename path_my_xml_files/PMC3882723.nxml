This study investigated the possibility of longer in-office follow-up intervals in primary prevention ICD patients under remote monitoring with automatic daily data transmissions from the implant memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>Conducted in 155 ICD recipients with MADIT II indications, the study compared the burden of scheduled and unscheduled ICD follow-up visits, quality of life (SF-36), and clinical outcomes in patients randomized to either 3- or 12-month follow-up intervals in the period between 3 and 27 months after implantation. Remote monitoring (Biotronik Home Monitoring) was used equally in all patients. In contrast to previous clinical studies, no calendar-based remote data checks were performed between scheduled in-office visits. Compared with the 3-month follow-up interval, the 12-month interval resulted in a minor increase in the number of unscheduled follow-ups (0.64 vs. 0.27 per patient-year; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and in a major reduction in the total number of in-office ICD follow-ups (1.60 vs. 3.85 per patient-year; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). No significant difference was found in mortality, hospitalization rate, or hospitalization length during the 2-year observation period, but more patients were lost to follow-up in the 12-month group (10 vs. 3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The SF-36 scores favoured the 12-month intervals in the domains &#x02018;social functioning&#x02019; and &#x02018;mental health&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In prophylactic ICD recipients under automatic daily remote monitoring, the extension of the 3-month in-office follow-up interval to 12 months appeared to safely reduce the ICD follow-up burden during 27 months after implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier</title><p>NCT00401466 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00401466">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00401466</uri>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Implantable defibrillator</kwd><kwd>Office visits</kwd><kwd>Remote sensing technology</kwd><kwd>Patient schedule</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Telemedicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most patients receiving an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for a primary prevention indication have a low rate of events necessitating visits to the ICD clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C2">2</xref></sup> However, regular follow-up is still considered important to monitor ICD function and the patient's condition. Expert consensus advocates clinical checks every 3&#x02013;6 months, with an increased frequency in response to product advisories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C3">3</xref></sup> Alternatively, ICD function and medical events recorded by the implant can be analysed using remote monitoring technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C6">6</xref></sup> Two large randomized clinical trials have shown that the replacement of regular clinic visits with remote data checks results in a faster reaction after events requiring intervention in parallel with a reduced number of in-hospital follow-up examinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup> In both trials, longer in-hospital follow-up intervals combined with remote monitoring were compared with standard follow-up intervals without remote monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Because remote monitoring is about to become the standard of care, it would be of interest to compare longer (e.g. yearly) and standard in-hospital follow-up intervals in patients undergoing the same kind of remote monitoring in both study arms in order to assess the isolated effect of less frequent in-hospital follow-up. Furthermore, the necessity of calendar-based remote follow-up sessions in the form used in the aforementioned trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup> can be questioned for remote systems capable of automatic physician alerting to relevant medical and technical events.</p><p>The REFORM trial randomized patients receiving prophylactic ICD treatment for MADIT II indications to either yearly or quarterly clinic visits. All patients were equally monitored using a remote monitoring system with fully automatic daily transmission and physician alerting after predefined events. The ICD follow-up burden (scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits), generic quality of life (QoL), and clinical outcomes were compared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The Remote Follow-Up for ICD-Therapy in Patients Meeting MADIT II Criteria (REFORM) study was a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-design trial, in which three German and two Czech medical centres participated. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. All patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the trial.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient selection</title><p>To be enrolled, patients had to meet the MADIT II trial enrolment criteria; that is, to be survivors of a myocardial infarction and to have a left-ventricular ejection fraction of &#x0003c;30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C9">9</xref></sup> The exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction within 30 days before enrolment, New York Heart Association functional class IV, a secondary prevention indication for ICD therapy, or living in an area lacking the GSM mobile phone coverage needed for remote monitoring transmission. Patients indicated for cardiac pacing were excluded for safety concerns because the ICDs used in this trial did not have the capability to automatically measure the pacing threshold. Furthermore, patients indicated for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) according to clinically accepted criteria at the time of enrolment were not included because the required remote monitoring system was not available for devices providing CRT.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Remote monitoring</title><p>The ICDs used were equipped with the Home Monitoring (HM) capability (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C15">15</xref></sup> Briefly, the implant transmits data once per day, comprising counts of arrhythmia episodes and therapies, rhythm information, and technical parameters. Transmission of intracardiac electrograms was available in only a few devices used in this study. The message sent by the implant is relayed by the patient device to the HM Service Center (HMSC) via the mobile phone network. The HMSC makes the data available to the treating physician on a secure internet site, and also sends alerts by e-mail or SMS if the data meet user-defined criteria. For long-term performance, HM was designed to require the patient only to switch on the patient device and keep it by the bedside. Transmission performance is calculated as the number of days with data transmission divided by the total number of days since the first message.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Patients were evenly randomized to quarterly clinic visits (Q-group) or yearly clinic visits (Y-group). After implantation of a single- or dual-chamber ICD (Belos&#x000ae;, Lexos&#x000ae;, or Lumos&#x000ae;; Biotronik, Berlin, Germany), patients in both study arms received the HM patient device. They were under continuous, automatic remote monitoring during the entire study. The response to HM alerts was left to the investigators' discretion. No calendar-based remote data checks or remote follow-up sessions were scheduled. All treatments up to the 3-month follow-up were done according to institutional standards and were equal in both study arms (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHT207F1">1</xref></italic>).

An improved left-ventricular ejection fraction (&#x02265;30%) or the development of a permanent pacing indication was ground for exclusion from the trial. The devices were programmed as follows: ventricular demand pacing with 40 beats per min (bpm); ventricular tachycardia zone from 180 bpm with anti-tachycardia pacing therapy; ventricular fibrillation zone from 200 bpm with shock therapy; stability and sudden onset criteria for arrhythmia discrimination &#x02018;ON&#x02019;. This programming was subject to adjustments after the occurrence of a first event.</p><p>Patients were followed for 2 years after the 3-month follow-up. They were instructed to refer to the investigational site for ICD-related issues and heart rhythm disorders. Care for the patients' concomitant diseases, most prominently heart failure, was provided by specialists as clinically indicated; however, they had no role in the study. Study data were collected by staff dedicated to the trial under the direct supervision of the principal investigators. Data management was provided by the sponsor. Data processing was supervised by the clinical team of the first author.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Scheduled follow-up visits</title><p>Patients assigned to the Q-group were scheduled to return for outpatient visits every 3 months, and those assigned to the Y-group had visits at 3, 15, and 27 months after discharge (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHT207F1">1</xref></italic>). A follow-up examination was classified as regular if occurring within a window of 4 weeks before or after an appropriate date relative to the discharge date. At each outpatient visit, the ICD was interrogated and tested and its memory was analysed in order to adapt patient management accordingly. The generic health-related QoL was assessed by the 36-item General Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire at baseline, 15-month follow-up, and 27-month follow-up, in both study arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Unscheduled follow-up visits</title><p>Patients were seen outside of the scheduled visits for the following pre-specified HM alerts: (i) elective battery replacement indicator; (ii) any lead impedance out of range; (iii) delivery of a first shock after discharge of the patient from the hospital; (iv) delivery of &#x02265;5 episodes of anti-tachycardia pacing; (v) delivery of &#x02265;2 shocks per month for the first time, or occurrence of &#x02265;2 supraventricular tachycardia or VT episodes per week. Patients could also be seen at unscheduled visits due to HM trend data or for any other reason, upon the patient's request or initiated by the investigator. Scheduled and unscheduled follow-up examinations were conducted similarly.</p><p>To get an estimate of additional patient contacts to medical professionals, the patients were instructed to notify such visits in a diary and were interviewed at each ICD follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Study hypothesis and endpoints</title><p>The primary study hypothesis was that the rate of unscheduled ICD follow-up visits in the Y-group would exceed the rate in the Q-group by &#x0003c;1.0 per patient-year, after the 3-month follow-up point. A confirmation of this non-inferiority hypothesis would mean that the total rate of scheduled and unscheduled ICD follow-up visits would be substantially lower in the Y-group than in the Q-group.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were the intra-individual difference in QoL scores between 27 months and baseline, total and cardiovascular mortality, and the rate and duration of all hospitalizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Furthermore, we made a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of all available arrhythmia and therapy data (12 different items) extracted from the HMSC database. The data comprised, per study group, the numbers of patients fulfilling various criteria such as having episodes in different arrhythmia zones, started or delivered therapies, or unsuccessful maximum-energy shocks. The underlying arrhythmias in this analysis were not adjudicated by the investigator. Shock therapy was considered ineffective if the device delivered more than one shock during one arrhythmia episode, and this could include cases of repeated shocks in episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was based on the primary study hypothesis and calculated on a Blackwelder-type test of non-inferiority. Unscheduled ICD follow-up visits were assumed to occur independently from one other, to have a daily probability (equivalent to 0.21 or 0.96 visits per patient-year in the Q-group and the Y-group, respectively), and, hence, to obey binomial distribution. Assuming a 2-year attrition rate of 28% in both groups, a sample of 150 patients needed to remain in the study after the 3-month follow-up (for 1-&#x000df; = 80%).</p><p>All patients with baseline QoL data were included in the intention-to-treat based QoL analysis. Missing 27-month QoL data were accounted for using the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method. Due to slight post-implantation increase in patients' QoL and greater loss to follow-up in the Y-group, this approach can be considered conservative.</p><p>For normally distributed continuous data (verified using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test), mean values and standard deviations were calculated. For non-normally distributed data, median values, interquartile ranges (IQR), and mean values, if appropriate for comparison with reference data, are shown. For categorical data, the absolute and relative frequencies were calculated. Continuous data were compared using the <italic>t</italic>-test (if normally distributed) or the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney rank test (if non-normally distributed). Categorical data were compared with a &#x003c7;&#x000b2; test according to Pearson's or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. One-sided statistical significance for the primary study hypothesis, or two-sided statistical significance for all other tests, was established as <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of 155 patients enrolled in the study, 78 were randomly assigned to the Q-group and 77 to the Y-group.

The most frequently claimed reason was &#x02018;arrhythmia and/or ICD therapy&#x02019; (five in the Q-group, 21 in the Y-group). This marked difference between the two groups can be attributed to a less need to see the affected patient outside regular follow-up schedule in the Q-group, because of the relative proximity of the next regular visit. Similarly, the number of unscheduled visits caused by &#x02018;patient malaise or need for reassurance&#x02019; in susceptible patients increased directly proportionally to the prolongation of the regular follow-up interval, with nine such visits in the Y-group and one in the Q-group. Furthermore, during &#x02018;hospital stay or visits unrelated to ICD treatment,&#x02019; unscheduled follow-ups were undertaken more frequently in the Y-group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) than in the Q-group (<italic>n</italic> = 5), reflecting a greater likelihood for the physician to check the ICD function opportunely in a patient who was not supposed to be seen soon (or was not seen recently) on a regular basis.

TRUST enrolled a typical contemporary ICD population and used the same remote monitoring system as REFORM. Replacing follow-up visits at 6, 9, and 12 months by scheduled checks of remote data in the HM study arm reduced the number of total in-hospital follow-ups by 45%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C7">7</xref></sup> Even higher reduction in REFORM (58%) can be attributed to starting the observation period after the mandatory 3-month follow-up. The numbers of unscheduled visits per patient-year were similar in TRUST (0.78, HM group) and REFORM (0.64, Y-group). In a mixed population of ICD and CRT patients, the CONNECT trial replaced visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with remote follow-ups performed using a substantially different technology (Medtronic CareLink).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup> The increase in the number of unscheduled clinic visits in CONNECT (0.29 per patient-year)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup> was, however, similar to that in TRUST (0.28) and REFORM (0.37).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Quality of life</title><p>The term &#x02018;follow-up burden&#x02019; is mainly understood as the hospital's burden, taxed by limited resources and budgets. The patient, however, may also perceive follow-up visits as a burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C23">23</xref></sup> In REFORM, mental health and social functioning were improved in the Y-group at 27 months compared to baseline, while they deteriorated in the Q-group. The recent literature mostly relates QoL in ICD recipients to the number of ICD shocks. However, the necessity of frequent follow-up examinations may also require consideration, since patients undergoing less frequent clinical examinations might feel less ill and less distracted from their normal lives. REFORM offers a first indication that most patients have positive attitude to longer follow-up intervals, although the cohort studied was too small for final answer. As some patients may not agree with the mainstream opinion (one patient randomized to the Y-group wanted to see his physician more often), physicians should carefully discuss the pros and cons of remote monitoring concepts with patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C24">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Safety aspects</title><p>The main concern about lengthening follow-up visit intervals is that patient condition deterioration may remain undetected for a longer time. Additional physiological sensors are therefore desirable to mirror patient health status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C25">25</xref></sup> However, in REFORM, no significant difference was found between the Y-group and the Q-group regarding mortality, hospitalization rate, or hospitalization length, neither for all causes nor for cardiovascular causes. Likewise, the incidence of arrhythmias and therapies, as indicated by a variety of device counters, did not differ significantly between the two groups. These findings are in agreement with TRUST where mortality and adverse event rate were equal in both groups. Albeit, patient exclusion criteria were more stringent in REFORM in that patients with any cardiac pacing indication were excluded; in TRUST, only pacemaker dependent patients were left out. Also CONNECT identified no safety issues, but unlike REFORM and TRUST patients, CONNECT patients were contacted by telephone for remote follow-ups and had thereby the opportunity to report health-related issues. Recently, the EVOLVO study showed that remote monitoring of heart failure patients with ICDs or an ICD for CRT reduces emergency department and urgent in-office visits and, in general, total healthcare use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C26">26</xref></sup></p><p>The REFORM study adds three safety relevant aspects to the growing evidence favouring longer follow-up intervals in remotely monitored patients. First, the follow-up period was 27 months, or 1 year longer than that in TRUST and CONNECT. Secondly, we did not schedule remote data checks in 3-month intervals, but relied entirely on automatic HM alerts. Our results support the assumption that regular remote data checks are not needed in a sufficiently reliable and frequent automatic alerting system. Thirdly, both our study groups were under the equal remote surveillance. One might argue that TRUST and CONNECT only show that the safety of longer follow-up intervals <italic>with</italic> remote monitoring is not inferior to standard follow-up intervals <italic>without</italic> remote monitoring. The best possible care in theory, however, should combine standard follow-up intervals <italic>with</italic> remote monitoring. Yet, REFORM findings do not support the superiority of this option over 12-month follow-up intervals.</p><p>The only concerning result is that more patients were lost to follow-up in the Y-group (10 vs. 3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The administration staff in follow-up facilities may therefore need to adapt their efforts in tracking patients with longer follow-up intervals. Based on the information provided in the last section of Results, however, it is unlikely that the larger loss to follow-up in the Y-group may have hidden a significant increase in mortality. Moreover, as hospitalizations were calculated per patient-year, the greater patient attrition in the Y-group should not have influenced group comparisons importantly (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHT207TB4">4</xref></italic>). Of note, cumulative follow-up duration was numerically even longer in the Y-group (117.9 months) than in the Q-group (111.6 months) (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHT207TB4">4</xref></italic>).</p><p>Both TRUST and CONNECT investigated the median time from clinical event to clinical decision and found remarkable improvements in the remote monitoring arms (&#x0003c;2 days to clinical decision in TRUST and 4.6 days in CONNECT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C8">8</xref></sup> REFORM did not investigate this issue because remote monitoring was equally used in both study arms, but it corroborated the other two trials in that follow-up interval lengthening is feasible and that physician can rely on remote monitoring information to decide on the necessity of an unscheduled in-office ICD follow-up. As the reimbursement for, and legal aspects of, remote monitoring are unsolved in many countries, a broader clinical implementation of the concepts proposed in these trials may, however, be delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHT207C27">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The investigators were aware of the patients' group assignment when deciding on the need for unscheduled ICD follow-ups. This could have introduced a bias such may be inclination not to initiate unscheduled ICD follow-ups for borderline reasons in the Y-group. A blinded approach, however, was not possible because all patient's data were needed to judge on the necessity of an in-office follow-up. Likewise, the QoL results could have been affected by the patient's knowledge of group assignment.</p><p>Our analysis was restricted to ICD-related visits because the follow-up burden at ICD and CRT follow-up clinics has been increasing exponentially. Although we also assessed the number of patient contacts to other physicians (for concomitant diseases) based on patient diary and on interviews at each ICD follow-up, these data might have been biased towards less contacts reported in the Y-group because patients may have more difficulty in remembering all contacts since 12 months than since 3 months ago. The total economic effect of our follow-up concept will need to be investigated.</p><p>More than one-third of the enrolled patients did not reach the regular end of the study. The drop-out rate was only slightly higher than expected and was reasonably balanced between study groups, eventually not affecting the evaluation of primary study hypothesis that reached statistical significance. On the other hand, a larger study cohort would have enhanced the accuracy of secondary endpoints evaluation. In addition, only half of the enrolled patients contributed to the QoL analysis; the rest of patients did not fill out the QoL questionnaire either at baseline or at a later time-point.</p><p>REFORM results are not transferrable to patients receiving ICDs for secondary prevention or an ICD for CRT, who potentially have different needs for remote monitoring and for in-office follow-up visits. The follow-up duration of 27 months was insufficient to evaluate the results towards the end of the device's life cycle, when the risk of failures increases.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In prophylactic ICD recipients without cardiac pacing indications and under automatic daily remote monitoring, the extension of the 3-month follow-up interval to 12 months appeared to safely reduce the ICD follow-up burden during 27 months after implantation. In contrast to the previous trials, we did not schedule regular remote data checks but fully relied on automatic HM alerts. The SF-36 scores favoured the 12-month interval in the domains &#x02018;social functioning&#x02019; and &#x02018;mental health&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was supported by <funding-source>Biotronik SE &#x00026; Co.
