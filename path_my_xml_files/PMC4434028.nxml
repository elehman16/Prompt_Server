strengthening exercises for the neck flexors and scapular retractors performed on a Swiss
ball and a mat. [Subjects] Twenty student volunteers were the subjects. [Methods] The
students were randomly assigned to two groups: Mat group (n=10), and Swiss ball group
(n=10). At pre-test, post-test, and 1-week follow-up pain was assessed using the visual
analogue scale (VAS), the pain pressure threshold (PPT) of the shoulder was measured with
an algometer, and neck mobility was measured with a Zebris. [Results] The data analysis
revealed that there was a significant decrease in pain and significant increase in neck
flexion in both groups, and the Swiss ball group showed better results. [Conclusion]
Strengthening the neck flexors and scapular retractors for stabilization of the neck using
exercises on a Swiss ball was more effective at reducing the pain and stabilizing the neck
than mat exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Visual display terminal syndrome</kwd><kwd>Swiss ball</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In 2012, the Korea Internet Security Agency, KISA, reported that over 50% of the population
of Korea are using smart phones, which were introduced in 2009, with an average usage of 2.7
hours per day<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are large numbers of
workers employed in tasks involving the use of video display terminals (VDTs), which are
associated with musculoskeletal and skin problems, eye discomfort, fatigue, and stress<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Computer related neck and upper extremity
pain has been reported among college and graduate students over the last ten years<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. While using a VDT, static sitting postures
increase muscle tension, resulting in pain, numbness, loss of function, and a variety of
neuromuscular symptoms, most often in the upper body<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A forward head posture (FHP) is commonly adopted by VDT users<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and approximately 60% of individuals with neck pain had FHP or significantly increased FHP
as a result of using computer for more than 2 hours a day<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP and trunk flexion may
gradually develop into a fixed postural habit when workers use a VDT<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and may also affect normal shoulder elevation, as elevation
of the upper extremity requires the same amount of cervical spine extension<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>FHP is defined as the external auditory meatus being anterior to the acromion process<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Support of the cervical segments is
provided by the muscular sleeve formed by the longus colli, which has a major postural
function in supporting and straightening cervical lordosis; the longus capitis which
attaches to the cranium and anteriorly spans the upper cervical motion segments and the
craniocervical (CV) region; and the semispinalis cervicis and cervical multifidus,
subocciptal extensor, semispinalis, and splenius capitis muscles which span the CVregion
posteriorly<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weak neck flexors and
high density muscle spindles reduce the ability to maintain an upright posture and cervical
posture. A computer model showed regions of local segmental instability when the large
superficial muscles of the neck were stimulated to produce movement, particularly in the
near-upright and neutral postures<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakness of the scapular retractors,
middle-lower trapezius, and rhomboids, causes increased scapular abduction during relaxed
standing<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are various self-correction exercises like chin-tuck, for strengthening the neck
flexors and stretching neck extensors, and improving the endurance and tone of the cervical
muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thoracic manipulation is
also effective at reducing neck pain, improving dysfunction, neck posture, and neck ROM of
patients with chronic mechanical neck pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, only a few studies have used a Swiss ball, which has many
benefits such as allowing free weight resistance exercises, neuromuscular demands on the
whole body for motor coordination and facilitate on of multi-angle resistance training which
elicits greater ROM<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, for the neck stabilization. Moreover, none have compared the
effects on neck support of Swiss ball and mat exercises.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects on shoulder pain and
neck mobility of strengthening neck flexors and scapular retractors using a Swiss ball to
provide useful clinical guidelines for reducing pain or increasing cervical ROM, in
comparison with mat exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>One-hundred thirty-seven university students answered 17 questions about VDT syndrome and
20 university students (4 males, 16 females) aged 21 to 23&#x02005;years participated in this study.
The subjects had experienced VDT syndrome but had not received treatment for it and didn&#x02019;t
do any regular exercise. All participants signed a written informed consent form approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic University of Daegu. After selection, the
subjects were randomly and equally allocated to one of two groups: a Swiss ball group which
performed strengthening exercises for the neck flexors and scapular retractors, and a mat
group which performed the same exercises on a mat. The study was conducted on college
premises and the exercises were performed under the supervision of an instructor. The
subjects were asked not to receive any specific intervention for neck-shoulder pain.</p><p>For strengthening the neck flexors, subjects lay supine with the head up and chin-tuck.
Both hands were placed on the abdomen<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The mat group placed a towel on middle of the thorax to reduce abdominal muscle tension. For
strengthening the scapular retractors, the subjects lay prone with the shoulders in 90&#x02013;120&#x000b0;
abduction, then extended spine by external rotation of the arms with chin-tuck<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both groups performed the same exercises
twice a week for 4 weeks, a total of 8 sessions. The training consisted of 10 repetitions
10- second holds in the first two weeks, followed by 15 second holds in the final two
weeks.</p><p>Upper trapezius pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale and an algometer (JETCH,
Japan), and a Zebris (Zebris Medical GmbH, CMS100, Germany) was used to measure neck
mobility. Measurements were taken at pre- and post test, and a follow-up was also performed
a week after the intervention.</p><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS version 18.0. The independent t-test was used to compare
age, heights, and weight between groups. The independent variable in this study was
strengthening exercises and the dependent variables were shoulder pain and neck mobility.
Repeated measures ANOVA was used to find significance of differences in the dependent
variables according to time between groups. The results were accepted as significant for
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were 20 subjects, 2 males and 8 females, in each group. Subjects mean ages, heights,

).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects on neck-shoulder pain and mobility
of exercises using a Swiss ball for strengthening the neck flexors and scapular retractors,
and neck and scapular stabilizers performed by young adults who had prolonged daily exposure
to VDTs.</p><p>The results for the upper trapazius VAS show that the Swiss ball group had significantly
decreased right upper trapezius pain at the follow-up test (p&#x0003c;0.05), and left upper
trapezius pain at the post-test (p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>). In previous studies of neck stabilization exercises using the hold-relax
technique for the upper trapezius, levator scapula, scalenus, and suboccipitals, VAS
decreased significantly from 3.35 to 1.65 (p&#x0003c;0.001) for the neck, and from 4.55 to 2.05
for the shoulder (p&#x0003c;0.001), and the pain pressure threshold (PPT) of the four muscles
increased (p&#x0003c;0.001), but ROM did not differ<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In core stability programs using a Swiss ball, Thera-bands, and a
mat, The thera-band group showed the most reduced VAS followed by the Swiss ball group, and
the mat group<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cranio-cervical flexor
and thoracic mobilization was effective at reducing VAS<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chin tucks, chest stretch, wall stretch, on your back chest
stretch, axial extension with neck isometrics, wall angels, Bruegger exercise, dead bug,
quadruped, upper back cat performed 4 times a week for 8 weeks results in significant
changes in the CV angle (p&#x0003c;0.001), cervical ROM (p&#x0003c;0.001) and PPT (p&#x0003c;0.001)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is moderate negative correlation
between CV angle and neck disability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mat
exercise had a longer retention effect<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These results show that strengthening the neck flexors and scapular retractors is effective
at reducing the pain and changes the CV angle. They also show that Swiss ball exercise is
more effective at reducing pain than mat exercise.</p><p>The results of Zebris measurements of neck mobility show that there was a significant
increase in neck flexion at the follow-up (p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and significantly decreased neck lateral flexion and extension, and
significantly increased right-left rotation (p&#x0003c;0.05). Patients with small a CV angle have
greater FHP and disability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment for
poor cervical posture should focus on recovering normal ROM of neck flexion and extension.
Increasing neck flexion reduced the CV angle and that contributed to reduce the FHP for
stabilization of the neck<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous
studies have demonstrated that Swiss ball exercise elicits greater total core muscle work
than mat exercise. Petrofsky<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> compared
core muscle activities in exercises on a Swiss ball, 7- inch mini ball, and the floor. In a
comparison of exercises on a Swiss ball and mat, floor crunches required about two thirds of
the work used for the same exercises on a Swiss ball. The Swiss ball provides greater
extension and flexion but the extent of that movement is limited by the diameter of the ball
with a larger diameter eliciting less movement. Chek<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the size of the ball enables athletes to train
certain muscles through a greater ROM. While lying with the lower back on the center of the
ball, athletes can perform abdominal crunches beginning with the abdominal muscles in the
stretched position. This stretched position can&#x02019;t be worked while lying on a flat,
horizontal surface. It is claimed that the effect of the pre-stretch and potential strength
development in the stretched position can enhance the effectiveness of the exercise and make
the task more functionally useful to athletes. The present study didn&#x02019;t start exercise in
the stretched position which can increase ROM on the Swiss ball.</p><p>This study was limited to eight training sessions, and ROM was not compared between the
Swiss ball and mat exercises groups. Also, the CV angle was not measured so we could not
determine if there was any improvement in FHP.</p><p>The results of this study show that pain was significantly decreased by exercises on a
Swiss ball, which also and increased neck flexion for stabilization of the neck. Exercises
on a Swiss ball, which has a small base of support, should be used for reducing pain and
stabilization of the neck, and exercises on a mat for increasing ROM. The Swiss ball and mat
could be used selectively either for training or the purpose of the treatment. Further study
should compare the motions of both Swiss ball and mat exercises and investigate the
neurophysiological benefits of the former.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Korea internet security agency,
