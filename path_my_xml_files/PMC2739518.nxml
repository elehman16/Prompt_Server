STS growth does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms in early stages, making early detection uncommon. Some STS such as synovial sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and certain neurogenic sarcomas tend to invade peripheral tissues, such as nerves, vessels and bones, and are thus have a relatively poor prognosis and are difficult to cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of limb STS have traditionally included surgery, which can involve extensive muscle excision or resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Amputation is not an ideal treatment measure, and is generally opted for only when other treatment has proven unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For advanced limb STSs with large tumor mass, distinct local infiltration or post-surgical relapse, chemotherapy or radiotherapy combined with surgery is often the first choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Apart from reducing tumor volume, chemotherapy before surgery can also produce a reaction zone between the tumor and peripheral tissues, which serves as an operational tissue space for surgery. However, it remains unclear whether comprehensive treatment schemes using novel chemotherapy regimens could improve the treatment results and prognoses for advanced limb STS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the present study, we compared pre-operative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and dacarbazine to the traditional pre-operative VAC treatment, with the hopes of determining it's safety and to assess whether this regimen imparts a greater advantage, in terms of reducing the tumor margin and increasing progression free survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>&#x02460; Between 14 years and 70 years of age. &#x02461; Female patients that were pregnant or lactating were excluded. &#x02462; No history of chronic primary organ disease, heart failure or other major organ malfunction. &#x02463; The sarcoma originated in limb soft tissue. &#x02464; Belong to G1-3T3N0M0 or G1-3T1-3N0-1M1, that is, stage IV according to the Russell GTNM staging system. &#x02465; No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Between November 2005 and November 2008, the Department of Surgical Oncology of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital in China received and treated 31 patients with stage IV limb STS. 15 of these were randomly assigned to the experimental group, and the remaining 16 were assigned to the control group.

Chemotherapeutic response was evaluated using the RECIST criteria. Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of tumors (on the basis of CT scan results) for over 4 weeks, partial response (PR) was defined as the reduction of overall tumor volume by more than 50% for over 4 weeks, and stable disease (SD) was defined as a less than 25% reduction in tumor volume.

This combination chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events were noted during or after chemotherapy. Compared to a traditional VAC regimen, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis over the median follow-up duration of 24 months and improved the negative rate of surgical margin to a greater degree in patients with stage IV limb STS. Importantly, oxaliplatin combination therapy significantly increased progression free survival over the study period. These results indicate that oxaliplatin-dacarbazine chemotherapy can effectively improve tumor remission in patients with advanced limb STS compared to traditional VAC scheme.</p><sec><title>Safety of the Oxaliplatin-Dacarbazine Treatment</title><p>In this study, we used a combination of oxaliplatin and dacarbazine as neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy to determine the safety and efficacy of this treatment for advanced limb STS. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first report for the use of oxaliplatin in the treatment of advanced STS. Previously, oxaliplatin has been used to treat malignant tumors in the digestive system, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, small cell lung cancer, among others and its safety has been widely confirmed. A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of pemetrexed in combination with oxaliplatin was ever performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Thirty-six patients with advanced tumors were observed, including 5 patients with sarcomas. This study demonstrated that the combination of pemetrexed plus oxaliplatin is feasible and can be safely administered every 21 days in patients with solid tumors. Toxic effects were predictable, reversible and manageable, with neutropenia being the primary toxicity and no unexpected toxicity observed. The recommended dosage for oxaliplatin was 120 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Dacarbazine is considered a critical chemotherapeutic agent in comprehensive treatment regimes for advanced STSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Patients in both the experimental and control groups experienced grade 1 to 2 adverse effects, consisting mainly of digestive and blood system toxicity. All patients had mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy, which remitted following the drug treatment, as expected from previous studies. No severe adverse reactions occured in the experimental group suggesting that oxaliplatin-dacarbazine combination treatment is likely to be tolerable and safe for patients with limb STS.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced limb STS</title><p>Despite the small sample size of this study, our results show a clear advantage in the use of oxaliplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy: the tumor response rate in the experimental group was 87%, limb-preserving operations were carried out in all cases. In addition, this combination therapy may also prove beneficial for the treating of distant metastatic tumors, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that one patient's lung metastasis disappeared after the first cycle of chemotherapy.</p><p>Our follow-up analysis at a median of 24 months revealed that all patients from the experimental group who showed significant benefits of chemotherapy before surgery were still alive, including survivors with and without tumors. The only death occurred in a patient who did not respond to the chemotherapy and had metastases in both lungs before surgery. In general, the prognoses for patients with distant metastases were much worse, with a shorter progression-free stage. Prognoses were best for patients who had no distant metastasis before surgery and who showed significant chemotherapeutic response, this was similar to observations seen in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Patients in the experimental group mainly benefited from tumor-free survival, without a corresponding increase in overall survival. There was no significant difference in overall survival time between experimental and control groups, which may reflect the short follow-up time and the small sample size of the study. Future studies using larger cohorts and a longer follow-up time may reveal survival benefits. In addition, we discovered that the two CR cases from the experimental group were both patients with neurogenic tumors. Whether neurogenic tumors are more sensitive to oxaliplatin-dacarbazine treatment is worthy of further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XYZ conceived the study, carried out all experiments and drafted the manuscript.
