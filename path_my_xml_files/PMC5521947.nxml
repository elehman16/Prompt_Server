Despite the high preoperative incidence of DVT in these patients, it remains controversial whether patients with femoral neck fracture can benefit from thromboprophylaxis before surgery. In Europe, anticoagulation therapy was usually initiated 12&#x0200a;hours before surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> to optimize antithrombotic effectiveness,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> because clinicians found that DVT typically developed perioperatively. However, Perka<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and Liu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that the effectiveness of preoperative initiation of anticoagulation therapy was comparable to that of postoperative anticaogulation therapy. In addition, opponents of preoperative anticoagulation therapy stated that it could add to the risk of postoperative intraspinal hematoma<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and lead to longer delays of surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Such discrepancy in clinical practice has led to a need to determine the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulation therapy, which may facilitate the prophylaxis of DVT in patients with femoral neck fracture.</p><p>Rivaroxaban, a new and selective factor Xa inhibitor, has been reported to reduce the risk of VTE<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> without a significant increase in major bleeding rates<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and is more effective than enoxaparin.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> But there is still a lack of evidence for rivaroxaban's use, particularly regarding its efficacy and safety in patients with femoral neck fracture. Herein, the aim of the present randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio of 10&#x0200a;mg once daily oral rivaroxaban compared with conservative treatment in patients with femoral neck fracture. Our primary hypothesis was that preoperative thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban reduces the risk of preoperative DVT for these patients compared with those who received conservative treatment. A secondary hypothesis was whether preoperative thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban increases the risk of bleeding.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>Between November 2014 and August 2015, 109 consecutive patients with femoral neck fracture were finally recruited for this study. Patients aged at least 60 years and with a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;30&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were considered for inclusion. All patients received a bilateral color Doppler ultrasound scan immediately after admission. Exclusion criteria were as follows: having DVT on admission; presenting with trauma affecting more than 1 organ system; having more than 10 days between the causative trauma and hospital admission; requiring long-term anticoagulant for a chronic comorbidity condition; undergoing any type of anticoagulant or fibrinolytic therapy or dextran therapy; and having severe organ insufficiency such as congestive heart failure, liver insufficiency, renal failure, malignancy or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Twenty-nine patients were not randomized in this study because, among other reasons, 5 patients had confirmed DVT on admission, and there was lack of consent for 6 patients; however, the 2 study groups did not differ significantly with respect to reasons for exclusions. Finally, a total of 80 patients met the selection criteria for randomization and completed the study. Baseline characteristics were measured for each patient, including age, sex, history of thromboembolic disease, any comorbidities, intraoperative blood loss, postsurgical wound drainage, duration of surgery, and length of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, comparative trial. Approval was obtained from our ethics committee. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups according to a computer-generated random sequence. Patients were assigned to receive treatment with oral rivaroxaban, 10&#x0200a;mg once daily, or conservative treatment from admission to surgery. The first drug dose was given the night of admission if there was no clinically evident bleeding. Prophylaxis was continued until 1 day before the operation. The patients in the conservative treatment group were instructed to stay in bed and keep mobilization without receiving any thromboprophylaxis drugs. Postoperatively, all patients received rivaroxaban 6 to 8&#x0200a;hours after surgery. The administration of rivaroxaban was scheduled for 7 to 11 days. In case of confirmed VTE, the anticoagulation treatment was discontinued and conventional thrombolysis treatment was then performed. The end point of this study was the moment when the patients finished the treatment. Drains were removed when the drainage volume was less than 50&#x0200a;mL/24&#x0200a;h. Written informed consent was obtained from all individual participants before randomization.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Medications</title><p>In the oral rivaroxaban group, patients were treated with oral rivaroxaban, 10&#x0200a;mg once daily.

Throughout the study, the following medications that could affect the patients&#x02019; blood coagulation system were prohibited, including aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant, and thrombolytic agents.

Sixty-one patients underwent total hip arthroplasty and 19 patients underwent hemi-arthroplasty. The study groups did not differ in terms of type of surgery. Moreover, the 2 groups did not differ in the number of treatment days from admission to surgery. Details of the operation are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The mean duration between admission and surgery was 3.9&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.9 days and 4.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.2 days (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.485) for the oral rivaroxaban group and the conservative treatment group, respectively.

The incidence of preoperative DVT was significantly lower in the oral rivaroxaban group than in the conservative treatment group (2.6% vs 19.5%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.016). Before the operation, there were 9 incidences of DVT and 0 non-fatal PE. Eight incidences of DVT were detected in the conservative treatment group, and 1 incidence of DVT was detected in the oral rivaroxaban group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). All 9 cases of DVT were asymptomatic, and 7 of them were isolated muscular calf vein thromboses; in addition, 5 DVT were found in the ipsilateral extremity as the fracture, 3 patients had DVT in both extremities and 1 in the contralateral. All the 9 patients were successfully treated with thrombolysis and supportive measures. Moreover, following surgery, DVT was newly detected in 3 patients in the oral rivaroxaban group and in 4 patients in the conservative treatment group when the routine color Doppler ultrasound screening was evaluated 3 days postoperatively. In addition, 1 non-fatal PE occurred in the conservative treatment group, but there was no occurrence in the rivaroxaban-treated patients. Among the 7 incidences of postoperative DVT, 4 DVT were found in the ipsilateral extremity as the fracture, 2 in the contralateral, and there was 1 patient with DVT in both extremities. After including the incidences of DVT that occurred preoperatively, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of DVT with rivaroxaban compared with the conservative treatment (29.3% vs 10.3%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.034). If the preoperative DVT were excluded, there was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative DVT between the 2 groups (7.7% vs 9.8%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.744).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Incidence of venous thrombosis embolism events<sup>&#x02217;</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7604-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Safety outcomes</title><p>There was no fatal bleeding or bleeding in a critical organ in either treatment group.

The total primary safety outcome was therefore 2 minor bleeding episodes in oral revaroxaban group (5.1%), compared with 1 in the conservative treatment group (2.4%). The incidence of adverse events, including severe thrombocytopenia, and overall mortality did not differ between groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Patients with femoral neck fracture are commonly at an increased risk of VTE.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In a previous study, Roberts et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> reported a 9% incidence of DVT in 176 patients with hip fracture prescribed with low-molecular-weight dextran. Smith et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> reported an incidence of 11.9% of radiologically identifiable DVT in 101 patients who were given subcutaneous injections of heparin. Subsequently, several studies have investigated the incidence of thromboembolic disease in this patient group, the rate of which ranged from 10% to 62%.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In this study, the incidence of DVT was 19.5% in the conservative treatment group, which was higher than that reported by Chan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and by Cho et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Of note however, Chan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> only recorded the DVT proximal to the popliteal vein, which could explain the low incidence in their study. Given the high incidence of preoperative DVT in patients without anticoagulation, it has been recommended that routine thromboprophylaxis should be initiated during the time between hospital admission and surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In addition, Hull et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> found that the initiation timing of LMWH therapy significantly affected the effectiveness of DVT prophylaxis. However, some researchers have recommended against preoperative anticoagulation therapy because of the concern that it may increase the risk of bleeding complications such as the increase of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> and the rate of intraspinal hematoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In addition, it has been reported that there was no difference between the preoperative and postoperative initiation of anticoagulation therapy regarding its efficacy and safety.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> The discrepancy in these studies reflects the need for a well-designed study that should comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and the risk of initiating early prophylaxis.</p><p>For the first time, this study demonstrated that rivaroxaban can effectively prevent VTE in patients with femoral neck fracture when initiated immediately on hospital admission. This study shows that in this high-risk population, the incidence of preoperative DVT was markedly reduced when rivaroxaban was prescribed preoperatively at a dose of 10&#x0200a;mg per day. Previous studies have well documented the relationship between the timing of initiation of LMWH therapy and the effectiveness of DVT prophylaxis.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> However, some studies have observed limited effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy in preventing DVT.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Liu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> retrospectively evaluated 222 patients with hip fracture, who were allocated to 2 groups receiving either preoperative or postoperative initiation of LMWH therapy. They concluded that preoperative anticoagulation therapy may not increase intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, and the risk of postoperative DVT or PE. We noted that in these studies, however, the authors identified DVT primarily based on clinical symptoms without performing routine venography or color Doppler ultrasound for patients, thereby reducing the accuracy of their outcome data. By contrast, in the current study, color Doppler ultrasound was performed for every single patient, which added to the accuracy of the diagnosis of early asymptomatic DVT.</p><p>As a complication of chemoprophylaxis, the incidence of bleeding was also of concern to surgeons when deciding on the initiation time of anticoagulation therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Some authors have observed a risk of bleeding and an increase of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> In this study, preoperative anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban did not appear to increase the risk of minor and major bleeding events. Moreover, no significant differences were detected in terms of intraoperative blood loss and postoperative wound drainage in the 2 groups, which was similar to the results found by previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, 9 patients with preoperative DVT were treated without using the filter. None of them showed any sign of PE and the thrombosis resolved spontaneously later during their care. To our knowledge, retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters were previously frequently used in patients with DVT undergoing orthopedic surgeries.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> However, a recent randomized clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up demonstrated that patients with acute VTE did not benefit from the use of a retrievable IVC filter.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Thus, for patients with preoperative DVT who are at the risk of an intraoperative pulmonary embolism, further studies are needed to investigate whether the IVC filter should be applied.</p><p>Despite the fact that our data were derived from a randomized controlled trial, several limitations still existed in our study. First, the patient sample of this study was relatively small, which could lead to insufficient statistical power to detect small difference in clinical outcomes. <underline>Second</underline>, the average time period before surgery in both groups was between 3 and 4 days, which is longer than that of most US hospitals, and this prolonged immobility probably predisposed these patients to developing DVT. However, some necessary delays of surgery are common in tertiary care facilities caused by transferring from community hospitals and by preoperative assessment and optimization. Third, only early postoperative incidences of DVT were tested by using color Doppler ultrasound, which may lead to missing patients with DVT after discharge. However, it has been reported that more than 85% of documented DVTs occur within 1 day after surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Moreover, once patients were diagnosed with negative DVT following early color Doppler ultrasound in our study, they would subsequently receive an aggressive rehabilitation program, which might have reduced the risk of DVT substantially.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban prior to surgery can effectively reduce the risk of DVT for patients with femoral neck fracture without increasing the bleeding rates.
