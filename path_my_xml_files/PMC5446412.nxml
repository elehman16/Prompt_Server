Primary endpoints were DSM265 safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Randomisation lists were created using a validated, automated system. Both parts were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12613000522718 (part 1) and number ACTRN12613000527763 (part 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>In part 1, 73 participants were enrolled between April 12, 2013, and July 14, 2015 (DSM265, n=55; placebo, n=18). In part 2, nine participants were enrolled between Sept 30 and Nov 25, 2013 (150 mg DSM265, n=7; 10 mg/kg mefloquine, n=2). In part 1, 117 adverse events were reported; no drug-related serious or severe events were reported. The most common drug-related adverse event was headache. The mean DSM265 peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) ranged between 1310 ng/mL and 34&#x02008;800 ng/mL and was reached in a median time (t<sub>max</sub>) between 1&#x000b7;5 h and 4 h, with a mean elimination half-life between 86 h and 118 h.

The median minimum inhibitory concentration of DSM265 in blood was estimated as 1040 ng/mL (range 552&#x02013;1500), resulting in a predicted single efficacious dose of 340 mg.

The progress achieved towards the elimination of malaria is challenged by the development and spread of resistance. During the past decades, fixed-dose artemisinin combination therapies, recommended by WHO to be given for at least 3 days, have become the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Unfortunately, resistance against artemisinin and its partner drugs is developing in the Greater Mekong subregion of southeast Asia,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> with reports of multidrug-resistant strains.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> New compounds are urgently required as potential new therapeutics.</p><p>The target product profile of an antimalarial drug is a combination therapy that would increase compliance, potentially allowing directly observed therapy, and prevent transmission.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This profile would imply shortening the course of therapy from 3 days preferably to a single dose. Any new combination therapy should be composed of molecules with different modes of action, different resistance mechanisms, and complementary pharmacokinetics. In recent years, several new classes of antimalarials have entered clinical studies in malaria patients. These include the fast-acting agents artefenomel (OZ439),<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> cipargamin (KAE609),<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and KAF156,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> whereas ferroquine remains the only long-acting novel antimalarial in clinical development.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, a need exists for additional long-acting molecules.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>Although the incidence of malaria has declined drastically in the last 15 years, WHO estimated that in 2015 there were more than 200 million cases worldwide, resulting in 429&#x02008;000 deaths. The WHO Global Technical Strategy goal is to reduce malaria case incidence and mortality rates by 90% by 2030. To achieve this, new treatments for malaria will be needed. Additionally, the emergence of parasite resistance to current first-line antimalarials is threatening progress towards malaria elimination. To reduce the development of resistance, new treatments for malaria formulated as combination therapies are required. Such combinations should include components with different, and preferably novel, mechanisms of action. DSM265 is a new antimalarial candidate that was discovered through a target-based research strategy aimed at inhibiting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an essential enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p><p>We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 1, 2016, using the terms &#x0201c;dihydroorotate dehydrogenase plasmodium inhibitor&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;DSM265&#x0201d;, and the clinical trials registries <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR). DSM265 is currently the first DHODH plasmodium inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of malaria. Preclinical studies predicted a safety profile for DSM265 supporting human studies, as well as a long half-life in human beings. The in-vitro antiplasmodial activity of DSM265 was comparable with mefloquine and chloroquine. Recently, further clinical trials have been done to test the antimalarial activity of DSM265, including a study to assess its chemoprophylactic activity and a phase 2 study in clinical malaria.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Integration of a malaria challenge cohort within a phase 1 human study allowed concurrent assessment of DSM265 safety, pharmacokinetics, and antimalarial activity. Our results show that DSM265 has a favourable safety profile in human beings, and a pharmacokinetic profile characterised by a long half-life. Plasma concentrations remained above the <italic>P falciparum</italic> minimum inhibitory concentration for more than 8 days, suggesting that DSM265 could potentially result in a single-dose cure when used with a partner drug. Additionally, pharmacodynamic analysis showed that DSM265 acts slowly against <italic>P falciparum</italic>. Therefore, DSM265 could be combined with a fast-acting drug to develop an antimalarial combination therapy.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>The design of this study allowed rapid determination of the key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of DSM265, and estimated an efficacious dose for clinical malaria. This information, together with safety data, was crucial to enable the progression to a phase 2 study with malaria patients in Peru, accelerating the clinical development of DSM265. This phase 2 trial has already been completed and will be published shortly.</p><p>This study showed that DSM265 is a promising drug combination partner for single-dose treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria. A single-dose treatment would improve patient compliance compared with the current first line of treatment, which requires multiple daily dosing, and would therefore result in a better treatment outcome.</p></boxed-text></p><p>Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is essential for pyrimidine biosynthesis in plasmodia because they lack pyrimidine salvage pathways and rely entirely on de-novo synthesis of pyrimidines. DSM265 was discovered through a target-based research strategy to develop an inhibitor of the plasmodial DHODH with high selectivity compared with the human orthologue.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Preclinical studies predicted that DSM265 would have a safety profile to enable study in human beings, and that a single dose of DSM265 could potentially maintain plasma concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for over 8 days. In-vitro efficacy studies show that the DSM265 antiparasitic activity is achieved with a similar kill rate to atovaquone and pyrimethamine. In the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model, DSM265 had potent in-vivo antimalarial activity with 90% effective dose (ED<sub>90</sub>) of 3 mg/kg per day, comparing favourably with chloroquine (ED<sub>90</sub>=4&#x000b7;3 mg/kg) and mefloquine (ED<sub>90</sub>=7&#x000b7;7 mg/kg).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A primary metabolite of DSM265, DSM450, also inhibits <italic>P falciparum</italic> DHODH, but shows much less antimalarial activity than DSM265.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>We undertook this first-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of DSM265 and its metabolite DSM450. A standard phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic study protocol was integrated with an induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) cohort, a controlled human malaria infection whereby healthy participants were inoculated with <italic>P falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes for preliminary assessment of antiparasitic activity.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Using this approach, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters can be determined rapidly, helping both to assess whether the drug should be developed further, and to select doses for subsequent phase 2 efficacy studies in patients.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study consisted of two parts. Part 1 was a phase 1a, single ascending dose, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. Part 2 was a phase 1b, IBSM, open-label, randomised, active-comparator controlled study, in which participants were inoculated with blood-stage <italic>P falciparum</italic> and treated with a single dose of DSM265 or mefloquine. Preclinical efficacy studies done in the SCID mouse model estimated the plasma minimum parasiticidal concentration for DSM265 to be in the range of 1000&#x02013;2000 ng/mL.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Thus, when a single dose of DSM265 reached the targeted human exposure in part 1, and this dose was shown to be safe, part 2 was initiated.

In this first 25 mg cohort, a sentinel sub-cohort (n=3) was dosed on day 1. Safety and pharmacokinetic data were reviewed in a blinded fashion before dosing the rest of the cohort, and before dose escalation in the following cohorts. In the following cohorts, all participants were dosed on day 1. In the 250 mg dose cohort, participants were dosed in a fasted state and returned 21 days after the first DSM265 dose to receive treatment after consumption of a US Food and Drug Administration standard high-fat breakfast.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Participants in all other cohorts received DSM265 after a fasting period of at least 8 h.

The powder was suspended in vehicle (0&#x000b7;1% methocel A4M, 0&#x000b7;1% polysorbate 80, 0&#x000b7;005% simethicone, 0&#x000b7;05% ethyl vanillin, and 0&#x000b7;5% sucralose; 240 mL for 25&#x02013;400 mg doses, 340 mL for 600&#x02013;800 mg doses, and 400 mL for the 1200 mg dose), and given as an oral suspension on site. Plasma concentrations during the absorption phase of DSM265 in the 400 mg cohort showed lower exposure than expected due to incomplete dispersion of the drug. Thus, the preparation instructions were modified to ensure adequate product dispersion, and the 400 mg cohort was repeated, with subsequent dose preparation using the amended instructions. The placebo (Shin-Etsu Chemical Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was supplied as HPMCAS-MF as powder in a bottle, and suspended according to the same protocol.</p><p>In part 2, an IBSM cohort was inoculated as described previously.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Briefly, participants were inoculated intravenously on day 0 with <italic>P falciparum</italic>-infected human erythrocytes (about 1800 viable parasites).

Review of individual reticulocyte count and haptoglobin concentrations of participants across all dose cohorts did not reveal any other clinically significant changes.</p><p>Two cases of isolated and asymptomatic aminotransferase increase were reported in part 1, both not considered as drug-related. One participant (400 mg) showed an increase in alanine aminotransferase (116 U/L, normal range 5&#x02013;40 U/L), and another participant (250 mg, fed conditions) had an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (115 U/L, normal range 10&#x02013;40 U/L). No cardiac arrhythmias or increase in QTc were observed up to the highest DSM265 dose tested.</p><p>In part 2, eight of the nine participants reported at least one adverse event.

There were no adverse events related to DSM265 or any other study treatments, including mefloquine. Most of the adverse events were mild in severity (28 [93%] of 30). The most common adverse events deemed related to malaria were headache (n=8 participants) and fever (n=5 participants). No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters (including white-blood-cell count, platelets, and liver function tests), ECGs, or cardiac telemetry were reported in the IBSM cohort.</p><p>The concentration of DSM265 measured in blood and plasma showed a proportional relationship; DSM265 concentrations in plasma were almost double that in blood (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 23</xref>). This proportionality was confirmed by the estimated slope in the power model (b=0&#x000b7;98, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;98&#x02013;0&#x000b7;99), and an estimated mean proportionality coefficient of 0&#x000b7;52 (0&#x000b7;51&#x02013;0&#x000b7;53). Plasma pharmacokinetic analysis of DSM265 single doses tested in fasted conditions showed that the mean C<sub>max</sub> increased with dose (range 1310&#x02013;34&#x02008;800 ng/mL) in a less than dose-proportional manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Similar inter-participant variability was observed in C<sub>max</sub> across dose cohorts (coefficient of variation [CV%] range 22&#x02013;40%). C<sub>max</sub> was reached in a median range between 1&#x000b7;5 h and 4 h (t<sub>max</sub>). C<sub>168h</sub> increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner (range 217&#x02013;10&#x02008;200 ng/mL). Likewise, plasma AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> increased with dose (range 107&#x02008;000&#x02013;4&#x02008;720&#x02008;000 ng&#x000b7;h/mL) in an approximately dose-proportional manner between 25 mg and 250 mg, and then between 250 mg and 1200 mg, except the 800 mg dose, where sub-proportionality was observed. Inter-participant variability in AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> was similar across dose cohorts (CV% range 18&#x02013;39%). DSM265 showed a long elimination half-life, ranging from 86 h to 118 h across the doses tested.

The C<sub>max</sub> of DSM450 was reached later than for DSM265 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 26</xref>).

The results show that DSM265 has a good safety profile and a long half-life, with a plasma concentration that remained above the MIC for more than 8 days. This prolonged effect against blood-stage <italic>P falciparum</italic> is crucial to the pharmacodynamics of DSM265, supporting its further clinical development as a component of a novel combination antimalarial therapy.</p><p>Although DSM265 showed a good safety profile, the drug-related thrombocytopenia and elevated reticulocytes reported in a participant diagnosed with sickle-cell trait will require further attention in patients with clinical malaria.</p><p>The elimination half-life of DSM265 was the longest of any of the new-generation antimalarials; however, it is still shorter than 4-aminoquinolines or aminoalcohols that have been tested in the IBSM model, such as mefloquine (10 mg/kg)<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> or ferroquine (800 mg).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Importantly, the pharmacokinetic parameters of DSM265 were not altered by food or low levels of blood-stage malaria infection. A mild decrease in C<sub>max</sub> was observed when DSM265 was given with high-fat food but this effect was not clinically significant.</p><p>The activity of DSM265 against <italic>P falciparum</italic> was characterised by an initial lag phase, accompanied by an increase in parasitaemia immediately post-treatment. This increase is probably due to a combination effect of the drug's modest speed of action and the lifecycle stage at which the drug exposure occurred.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> When DSM265 was given (day 8), parasites were mainly in the mature stage and about to undergo schizogony. Thus, an increase in parasitaemia would happen in the following 12 h irrespective of treatment administration. Overall, the activity of DSM265 (150 mg) against blood-stage <italic>P falciparum</italic> was slower (log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> 1&#x000b7;55 [95% CI 1&#x000b7;42&#x02013;1&#x000b7;67]) than other long-acting drugs tested in the IBSM model, such as mefloquine (10 mg/kg, log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> 2&#x000b7;20 [2&#x000b7;11&#x02013;2&#x000b7;28])<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and ferroquine (800 mg, log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> 2&#x000b7;21 [2&#x000b7;15&#x02013;2&#x000b7;27]).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> There was a statistically significant difference between the log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> of the two groups in part 2 (part 2a and 2b), which was not clinically significant, since both values were in the range characteristic of slow-acting drugs. The small size of the groups (n=3) might have contributed to the log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> variability between them. The log<sub>10</sub>PRR<sub>48</sub> reported for mefloquine in this study is in accordance with previous reports, which validates the reproducibility of the IBSM model.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>The dose selected for the IBSM cohort resulted, after initial parasite clearance, in recrudescence in all participants, which allowed calculation of the MIC for DSM265. The design used in this study enabled both identification of the MIC and the prediction of the efficacious dose within 6 months from initiation of clinical development. Applying a conventional development process of separate phase 1 in healthy participants followed by phase 2a proof-of-concept studies in patients would take over 2 years. In the next step of DSM265 clinical development, it would be important to evaluate its efficacy in clinical malaria to confirm the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Data available from previous IBSM studies indicate that the pharmacodynamic parameters estimated in this study will correspond to those obtained in malaria patients.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Furthermore, DSM265 could be combined with a fast-acting antimalarial drug in development to potentially find a single encounter cure.</p><p>Combining DSM265 with a partner drug would be beneficial not only from a pharmacodynamic point of view, but also to reduce the probability of developing drug resistance.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In preclinical studies drug resistance to DSM265 resulted either from point mutation or through <italic>pfdhodh</italic> gene amplification.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> However, no point mutations in the <italic>pfdhodh</italic> gene were identified in the IBSM cohort. <italic>pfdhodh</italic> gene amplification events could not be studied due to low parasitaemia. Antimalarial resistance to other antimetabolites, such as sulfadoxine&#x02013;pyrimethamine and atovaquone, can be more readily induced in vitro and in vivo than for drugs with other mechanisms of action.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Monitoring for the emergence of drug resistance parasites will be required in future studies.</p><p>Generalisability of the study findings is limited by the recruitment of only men due to the contraceptive requirements of the study impeding recruitment of women. Evaluation in a wider population will be needed in further studies. Another limitation of this study was that the preparation of the DSM265 formulation was cumbersome, and drug reformulation will be required in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, DSM265 is a novel antimalarial with a good safety profile. Its long half-life suggests that it is a promising drug combination partner for single-dose treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria. Treatment with single-dose DSM265 could improve patient compliance and thus treatment outcome compared with current treatment options, which require multiple daily dosing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><article-title>World Malaria Report 2016</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2016/en/" id="interrefs20">http://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2016/en/</ext-link><comment>(accessed Dec 15, 2016).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><source>Artemisinin and artemisinin-based combination therapy resistance.
