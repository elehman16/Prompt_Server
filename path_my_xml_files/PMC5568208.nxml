Pharmacological management of OA is aimed at relieving pain through the use of simple analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and opiates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], however these therapies are associated with significant adverse effects, particularly with regular, long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, pain is poorly managed in patients with arthritis especially in the older age group, and such patients frequently use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in an attempt to alleviate symptoms and improve their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Dietary supplements are the most popular form of CAM used by patients with OA and include; vitamin supplements, fish oil and evening primrose oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In recent years glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate have become one of the most widely used CAM for OA although meta-analyses have failed to show consistent benefit in terms of pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel (GLM, <italic>Perna canaliculus</italic>) lipid extracts have shown promise as a treatment for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with several clinical trials showing benefit across a range of outcomes.

This sample size permitted the detection of an odds ratio for decreasing medication in the intervention group compared to the control group of 4.9, using McNemar&#x02019;s test for paired binary data and assuming 50% of pairs are disconcordant (equivalent to a difference in proportions of 0.33, or 8.6% versus 41.4%). Criteria for minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) of pain, patient&#x02019;s global assessment of disease activity, and functional impairment were preset according to OARSI response criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Compliance was compared between the two groups using a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. For outcomes with interim measures available, linear mixed models with a random subject effect were used to compare groups, adjusting for baseline values where available. Linear contrasts were used to compare changes between time points and groups where the interaction between group and time was significant. For outcomes with only week 12 measures available, regression models adjusting for baseline values were used. In all cases, model residuals were checked for evidence of non-normality or heteroscedasticity and log-transformations investigated and used where this improved any unsatisfactory residuals. A per protocol secondary analysis was planned a priori using 80% compliance and the proportion achieving this was compared between groups using a Chi-squared test. Prior to statistical modeling, but after data collection and descriptives, subgroup analyses were planned for those with baseline lower levels of pain and joint damage. For comparing rates of improvement in WOMAC scores (WOMAC-20, WOMAC-50, and WOMAC-70), Chi-square tests were used with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test employed where more than 20% of cells had expected counts below 5. Two sets of variables were considered as overall indicators: QoL (pain VAS, WOMAC-total, OA QoL, global patient assessment and global physician assessment) and functioning (stair climbing, sit-to-stand, dynamic balance, and walking). As STS goes in the opposite direction to the other two variables in that set, this score was reversed by subtracting observed values from the maximal achieved (16 repetitions). All variables were normalized using the relevant baseline mean and standard deviation with lower scores being preferable. The resulting normalized week 12 scores were then modeled using a random effect to accommodate the repeated measures and adjusting for baseline values. Statistical significance was determined by two-sided <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 in all cases. All analyses were performed using Stata 12.1.

Furthermore, a minimum level of pain was a specified criteria for enrollment in the study and obviated a floor effect in response (OA subjects with mild pain, &#x0003c; 30&#x000a0;mm VAS, were excluded). The study was designed to be sufficiently powered and of sufficient duration to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the primary outcome measures. While the sample size calculated was not achieved, the effect on the detectable difference in VAS pain scores would have been increased only slightly from 13&#x000a0;mm to 14&#x000a0;mm. The actual power of the study is reflected in the widths of the presented confidence intervals.</p><p id="Par60">The current study showed no benefit for Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM over placebo for either of the primary outcomes; WOMAC- pain score, VAS pain score and there was no evidence of a response at the 20% improvement level for WOMAC pain or WOMAC &#x02013;total score. Secondary outcomes including patient global assessment, OAQol, HAQ disability score and a range of physical performance tests also showed no significant benefit for GLM over placebo.</p><p id="Par61">Changes over the study period in 2 outcome measures were of interest. Firstly patients in the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM treated arm of the study reduced their intake of paracetamol in contrast to the placebo group and this persisted after the intervention ceased at week 12. Although the reduction in analgesic use was not significant over the whole study period (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.589) there was a significant difference after discontinuation of the active treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). This finding raises the possibility of persisting benefit in the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM treated group.</p><p id="Par62">Secondly, there was a small reduction in stiffness measured by WOMAC-B in the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM treated group between 12 and 15&#x000a0;weeks post-intervention. Although statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), the level of this reduction was unlikely to be clinically meaningful.</p><p id="Par63">To our knowledge, this is the first study to use NSAID equivalent dose calculations to assess the effect on NSAID use for an intervention in OA. The Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM extract did not reduce the use of NSAIDs compared with placebo over the study period. The Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM product did not alter lipid levels or CRP over the course of the study.</p><p id="Par64">The GLM extract appeared safe with no attributable serious or significant adverse events over the15 week study period.</p><p id="Par65">Previous studies have investigated a variety of GLM products, both lipid extracts and powdered products. These products differ in their in vitro efficacy. To date there have been three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLM products in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]: all claim benefit for at least one outcome measure selected. All used a VAS pain scale as an outcome. Gibson et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Audeval et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] showed no significant improvement in pain, but Lau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] did show a significant improvements in pain, although the mean improvement (9.0&#x000a0;mm) is not recognized as clinically meaningful and no minimum pain level was set as a criterion for entry to the study.</p><p id="Par66">In addition, there have been 3 systematic reviews of GLM products for the treatment of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], where these 3 RCT&#x02019;s have been assessed critically. The use of different extraction processes and variable durations have resulted in heterogeneous studies of variable quality. Small numbers of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27 to <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80) and a lack of a priori power calculations are also evident in the literature. There was a high risk of bias for these studies and a meta-analysis of pooled data or results was not feasible. A more recent open label pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] used the WOMAC scale as an outcome measure. In total, 21 patients completed 8&#x000a0;weeks on the GLM preparation. Significant improvements from baseline were noted in the WOMAC total and all 3 subdivisions of the scale. Thus to date, there is limited evidence that GLM extracts reduce pain or improve functional outcomes in OA.</p><p id="Par67">The current study has limitations. Firstly, half the participants had severe OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 radiographic changes). This may have affected the ability to detect improvements in self-reported pain, and more specifically physical function outcomes. Secondly, the recording of NSAID use as an outcome measure was hindered by the surprisingly low use of NSAIDs amongst the study participants, despite high baseline pain scores. Thirdly, as with other studies in OA, the control group demonstrated a prominent placebo response raising the threshold to detect significant differences in pain levels. Fourthly, the sample size calculated was not achieved but this had minimal effect on the detectable difference for VAS pain scores.</p><p id="Par70">Future studies may wish to address some methodological limitations which became apparent on conclusion of this study. Firstly, it was decided not to undertake an initial pilot study given the previous literature of mostly small studies of GLM extracts. Dosage was based on previous studies of GLM extract containing a different profile of lipids compared to Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that a higher dose of the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM extract may have had a greater effect. Secondly, the final follow up assessment was 3&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuation of the study medications. It would have been interesting to see if apparent sustained improvements in some outcomes were maintained beyond this period and for how long. Thirdly, a longer duration of treatment may have been beneficial, and the trends towards the end of the study suggest that this is worth exploring in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par71">In conclusion, in this double blind randomized placebo controlled study of a novel Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM extract administered over 12&#x000a0;weeks the GLM extract appeared safe with no apparent adverse effects. There was no significant improvement in the primary outcome of pain in moderate to severe OA, but there was a significant difference in the use of paracetamol in those taking the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM extract in the 3&#x000a0;week post treatment period, due to the placebo group increasing their paracetamol use to baseline levels, but the Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM maintaining a lower intake. This period was also associated with a significant reduction in stiffness.</p><p id="Par72">Further studies with higher doses of Biolex&#x000ae;-GLM extract for a longer duration are worthy of consideration, particularly to investigate the potential to reduce reliance on paracetamol for analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CAM</term><def><p id="Par8">Complimentary and alternative medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par9">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLM</term><def><p id="Par10">Green lipped mussel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAQ</term><def><p id="Par11">Health assessment questionnaire disability index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p id="Par12">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p id="Par13">Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAQoL</term><def><p id="Par14">Osteoarthritis quality of life index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OARSI</term><def><p id="Par15">Osteoarthritis Research Society International</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OMERACT</term><def><p id="Par16">Outcome measures in rheumatology clinical trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STS</term><def><p id="Par17">Sit to stand test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p id="Par18">Western Ontario and McMasters OA Index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants for giving their time to take part in the study.
