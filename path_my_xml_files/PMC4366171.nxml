It has been reported that long-term survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases has improved significantly in recent years [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>However, up to 70% of patients will have disease recurrence following resection [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Systemic chemotherapy alone in the adjuvant setting after liver resection has been evaluated in several studies [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A meta-analysis showed an increase in disease-free survival (DFS) with the use of systemic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin, but only after adjustment for poor prognostic factors [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Systemic FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) both before and after liver metastatic tumor resection demonstrated a significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) compared with no systemic treatment [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the difference in PFS was not significant in the intention-to-treat population of the study.</p><p>Hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAI using 5-FU) has been shown to increase response rates when treating liver metastases, but the overall survival benefit attributed to HAI with chemotherapy is minimal or negligible due to extra-hepatic recurrence in unresectable liver metastases [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Postoperative HAI alone after liver resection reduces hepatic recurrence but shows no survival benefit [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HAI is thought to be less effective for extra-hepatic tumors because 5-FU is deactivated in the liver circulation [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>As neither systemic chemotherapy nor HAI alone seems to be effective in improving survival after liver resection, the combination of HAI and systemic chemotherapy to control intra-hepatic recurrence and extra-hepatic recurrence, in particular lung metastasis, becomes an important approach [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120064.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Antineoplastons are naturally occurring peptides and amino acid derivatives found in human blood and urine, first described by Burzynski in 1976 [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Antineoplaston A10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2, 6-piperidinedione) was the first chemically-identified antineoplaston. When administered per-orally it yields partially phenylacetylglutamine (PG) and phenylacetylisoglutamine (isoPG) by hydrolysis in the pancreatic juice. PG and isoPG are further metabolized to phenylacetate (PA) in liver. The mixture of PG and isoPG (ratio of 4:1) is formulated as antineoplaston A10 Injection (A10-I). The mixture of PG and PA (ratio of 1:4) has been formulated as antineoplaston AS2&#x02013;1. Antineoplaston A10 and AS2&#x02013;1 have been found to control neoplastic growth in tissue culture study with hepatocellular carcinoma cell-lines [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and in an animal study with transplanted human breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our phase I clinical toxicological study [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated the minimal adverse effects of these agents. Thus, it is postulated that combining these antineoplastons with 5-FU HAI would have the potential to increase antitumor effect without decreasing the patient&#x02019;s quality of life. The antitumor effect of antineoplastons on micrometastases when used as an adjuvant in the experimental lung metastasis model of orthotopically implanted colon cancer in nude rats was confirmed in our study [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this randomized phase II clinical study, we investigated the antitumor effects and toxicity of antineoplastons (A10 Injection and AS2&#x02013;1) in addition to 5-FU HAI after hepatectomy in colorectal metastases to the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0120064.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120064.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma to the liver. Patients were treated with R0 resection of liver metastases and/or complete ablation by radio frequency interstitial ablation therapy between April 1998 and August 2004 at Kurume University Hospital. The inclusion criteria were age &#x02264;75 years, no severe major organ dysfunction, no prior cancer therapy to the liver, no extra-hepatic metastases at study entry, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &#x02264;2, no other malignancy (within the 5 years prior to study entry), white blood cell count &#x02265;3000/&#x003bc;L, absolute neutrophil count &#x02265;1500/&#x003bc;L, platelet count &#x02265;75,000/&#x003bc;L, hemoglobin &#x02265; 10 g/dL, AST/ALT &#x02264; 100 IU, creatinine &#x02264; 1.5 mg/dL and total bilirubin &#x02264; 2.0 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were required to have been carried out within the 6 weeks prior to protocol registration. All patients provided signed informed consent after hepatectomy; the protocol and informed consent were approved by the Kurume University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and registered with study number 9717. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with local ethics committee approval. This clinical study was registered with ID number of UMIN000012099 on the date of October 22th 2013. It was not registered previously because enrollment for this study finished in 2003 before the start of mandatory official registration for clinical trials in Japan (UMIN- CTR) in 2006. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug are registered. This study was started in 1998 and the results were confirmed by comparing cancer-specific survival (CSS) [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], relapse-free survival (RFS) and salvage surgery rate in 10 years.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Randomization and study design</title><p>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive systemic antineoplastons plus 5-FU HAI (AN arm) or 5-FU HAI alone (control arm) by a minimization method using number of metastases (1&#x02013;3 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02265;4) and presence or absence of prior extra-hepatic metastases which were removed completely (R0 resection) at the time of surgery. Randomization used 50:50 weighting to the two arms and was established by computed macro program in Microsoft Excel 97 (Microsoft Cooperation, Redmond, USA).</p><p>The study was an open-label, non- blinded randomized phase II screening design. The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of systemic administration of antineoplastons as an adjuvant added to 5-FU HAI after liver resection. The primary endpoint was CSS and secondary endpoints were evaluation of RFS, status and extent of recurrence, salvage surgery (rate) and toxicity.</p><p>The efficacy of antineoplastons should be demonstrated in RFS, number of sites and extent of recurrence, salvage surgery rate and CSS since only patients with R0 resection (no visible tumor recognized) were enrolled at start of the study. Comparison with a randomized control group would be more convincing than historical comparisons because reported survival varies widely among institutes, studies and timing of trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Treatment schedule</title><p>Patients received HAI with 5-FU (Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Tokyo, Japan) at a dose of 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 4 hours weekly until the cumulative dose reached up to 15,000 mg. HAI with 2-week interval was infrequently allowed, when requested by the patients. Antineoplastons, A10-I and AS2&#x02013;1, provided by Dr SR Burzynski (the patent holder of antineoplaston A10 and AS2&#x02013;1, Burzynski Institute, Houston, TX, USA) were administered from day 15 after liver surgery. In the AN arm, a starting dose of 30 g/day of A10-I was administered intravenously (i.v.) using a pump system with maximum dose of 100 g/day for more than 3 days. After completion of the i.v. administration of A10-I for a week, 10 g/day of AS2&#x02013;1 was administered orally for 1 year. Patients were required to have an absolute neutrophil count &#x02265; 1500/&#x003bc;L(HAI) and 1000/&#x003bc;L (antineoplastons), platelet count &#x02265;75,000/&#x003bc;L, total bilirubin &#x0003c;2.0 mg/dL and creatinine &#x02264;1.8 mg/dL for subsequent cycles of 5-FU HAI and antineoplastons (A10-I, AS2&#x02013;1) to be administered. If counts were below these levels on the scheduled day, HAI was delayed and antineoplaston therapy was interrupted for 1 week.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Assessment of toxicity</title><p>All toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0 (CTC 2.0). Liver function blood tests (LFT) were evaluated every 2 weeks during HAI. Changes in doses of 5-FU were calculated according to the changes in LFT. Because patients entered the study with various degrees of hepatic enzyme abnormalities, hepatic toxicity due to 5-FU treatment was defined as a significant increase over individual baseline values (two-fold or greater for alkaline phosphatase, three-fold or greater for aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase, and a 1.5-fold or greater increase in bilirubin. Doses of 5-FU were lowered to 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> when hepatic toxicity or greater than grade 3 non-hematological adverse effects were observed. Epigastric pain or severe abdominal pain during HAI treatment resulted in the emptying of drug from the pump and evaluation of the source of the pain (including a repeat flow scan to rule out extra-hepatic perfusion).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Follow-up</title><p>CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and LFT were performed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly after 5 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>At the time of the study&#x02019;s design, published data suggested that 70% of patients who undergo resection of hepatic metastases have a recurrence within two years (50% of these recurrences are in the liver) and that the 2-year and 5-year survival rates for these patients is approximately 65% and 35%, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0120064.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hypothesizing based on a 5-year CSS after liver resection in HAI control arm of 35%, a sample size of 57 patients was estimated to screen an additive 20% in 5-year CSS in the AN arm with error levels alpha = 20% and beta = 20%. The decision to initiate a study would depend on additional factors including tolerability of the regimen. CSS was defined as time from liver resection to cancer death or last follow-up. Patients alive or deceased without recurrence were censored at the time of last follow-up. RFS was defined as time from liver resection to any recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxson test, by which test more weight could be placed on later events after disease recurrence, in particular, in CSS. Associations between categoric variables were assessed by using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.</p><p>The treatment and assessment of outcomes had been conducted by the same investigating team through the trial with responsibility of principal investigator KS. YO was in charge of enrolling participants into trial as a coordinator of this study after eligibility was discussed by the team.

The reasons for not completing HAI were failure of catheter placement (three and two patients), development of metastases (one and one patient), and complications such as epigastralgia and catheter obstruction (two and two patients), in the AN and control arms, respectively. No other adverse effects were found in the AN arm compared with the control arm. A total of ten patients did not complete the scheduled antineoplaston therapy. The reasons for not completing antineoplaston therapy were the development of metastases in six patients, epigastralgia in one, phlebitis in one, and fullness of the stomach in two patients,

RFS after liver resection may not fully relate to CSS and overall survivals. Some patients who progressed after liver resection exhibited solitary recurrence in residual liver tissue or had one small lung metastasis which could be resected; therefore, their survival rate remains high. Of interest, the majority of recurrent tumors in the AN arm tended to be eligible for salvage surgery.

We did not observe any neurological AEs such as hypernatremia, or severe bone marrow dysfunction in our study, but it would be important to bear in mind that these potential adverse effects may happen during the course of treatment.</p><p>This side-effect profile of antineoplastons with the dose we used in this study, showing a relatively low level of toxicity, offers another significant advantage when considering postoperative adjuvant therapy, as these results suggest that antineoplastons can be safely combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics.</p><p>We delayed in publication of this study simply because we wished to observe the CSS up to 10 years and because we have a linguistic challenge in the preparation of manuscripts in a foreign language.</p><p>We conclude that in this study antineoplastons have demonstrated a promising level of efficacy against postoperative recurrence with a median CSS time of 67 months in the AN arm versus 39 months in the control arm, achieved via inhibition of early growth in metastatic tumors from colorectal cancer. The administration of antineoplaston AS2&#x02013;1 may be clinically effective as a postoperative adjuvant therapy in liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. The results of this study have warranted the initiation of a new randomized, controlled clinical trial of adjuvant therapy using antineoplaston A10 and AS2&#x02013;1 combined with HAI after hepatectomy in patients with colorectal metastasis to the liver.</p><p>This work was presented as an abstract at the 35<sup>th</sup> EMSO congress in 2010 (Abstract No. 697).
