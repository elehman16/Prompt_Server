The clinical burn depth examination and LDI scan were performed for all burn patients who agreed to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria for the clinical study were patients burned within 72 h, age 18&#x02013;75 years, and agreement to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were age &#x0003e; 75 years, pregnant burn-ed women, mental disease, lack of agreement to participate in the clinical study, and burned patients with a critical condition of health who were treated in the intensive care unit department. The patients were randomized 72 h after the burn. The burned patients were randomized into two groups: the CDE group and LDI group. Randomization of burned patients was done using envelopes with numbers inside them and a list on paper where numbers showed in which group the patients belonged. The CDE was performed by surgeons and the LDI scan was performed by a radiologist. A Moor LDLS laser Doppler line scanner (Moor LDLS Rapid laser Doppler blood flow imaging by Moor instruments) was used for the LDI scan. The distance between the burn wound and scanner was 15 cm and the scan angle was 90&#x000b0;.</p><p>The depth of the injured tissue was assessed during CDE and LDI scan. The depth of injured tissue was divided into superficial (I and IIA burn degree) and deep burns (IIB and III burn degree). The burn wound biopsy was performed by a surgeon in the same burn location to detect the correlation of findings of CDE and LDI scan. The worst burn wound was elected during CDE and LDI scan.</p><p>The CDE, LDI scan and biopsy were performed 72 h after injury, with the second and third CDE and LDI scan on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day after the burn. If during a clinical examination a surgeon decided to perform necrectomy of the burn tissue 7 days after injury, the patients&#x02019; participation in the clinical study was finished. The third clinical examination (CDE group) was performed on the 14<sup>th</sup> day after the burn. The patient's participation in the clinical study was finished when the surgeon decided to perform necrectomy or normal tissue epithelization was seen at that time. The indication for surgery of patients of the CDE group depended on the clinical surgeon's experience. The indication for surgery of patients of the LDI group depended on LDI scan parameters. A deep burn was assessed when perfusion velocity during the LDI scan on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day after the burn was 0&#x02013;250 PU (perfusion units). The patients underwent surgery. If perfusion velocity was &#x0003e; 250 PU it was considered a superficial burn and patients were followed up and treated conservatively. The scheme of patient investigation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. The age, sex, length of inpatient stay, cost of burn treatment, burn depth, cause and location of the burns were analyzed between the two groups. The perfusion velocity of burn tissue was measured during the LDI scan, with results presented in perfusion units (PU). The LDI scan is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Photo 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Scheme of patients&#x02019; investigation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WIITM-9-22140-g001"/></fig><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Photo 1</label><caption><p>LDI scan (the arm).

The burn wound biopsy is recommended to be performed within 48&#x02013;72 h after injury, because the blood perfusion of burn tissue can change during this period and impair the results [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Biopsies of our clinical study were performed 72 h after injury, in order to prevent wrong results. The biopsy is an invasive technique and it can determine undesirable postoperative complications such as wound bleeding or suppuration [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Laser Doppler imaging scan is a non-invasive technique with sensitivity of 97%. Laser Doppler imaging scan allows early diagnosis of deep burns and reduces the length of stay and cost of treatment [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Laser Doppler imaging scan did not correlate with biopsy of three patients from our study. The reason for this could be lubricants which were used during burn wounds dressing and were not cleaned carefully before the LDI scan. Deep burns opposite superficial burns were seen during the LDI scan. Clinical studies show that lubricants used for burn wound dressing reduce detection of blood perfusion during LDI investigation. The recommendation is to clean the burn wound carefully before the LDI scan [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The LDI scan is a non-invasive, painless and easily performed method for burn depth evaluation. Jeng <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proved that the LDI scan helps to assess early superficial burns and prevent unnecessary surgery. There are many discussions between authors about the technique of LDI scan. Some of them propose 15&#x02013;30 cm distance between the scanner and burn wound and a scan angle of 90&#x000b0; [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other authors propose a distance of 50&#x02013;70 cm and scan angle of 30&#x02013;110&#x000b0; [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We decided to choose the first recommendation for our clinical study.</p><p>The blood perfusion is higher compared to normal tissue in the superficial burn tissue and considerably less in the deep burn tissue. The burn wound blood microcirculation becomes worse within 12&#x02013;24 h after the burn. The blood perfusion increases after 48 h and metabolic processes start in the burn wound [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on pathogenesis of burn tissue the recommendation to perform the LDI scan is 36&#x02013;72 h after injury. The results can be false in the case of assessment of burn wound up to 24 h after injury [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our clinical study we performed the first clinical burn depth examination and LDI scan 72 h after the burn.</p><p>According to Jeng <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], if the perfusion velocity of the burn wound was 150&#x02013;250 PU, the burn was deep and these patients should undergo surgery. If perfusion velocity was &#x0003e; 250 PU the burn was superficial and these patients were referred for conservative treatment. However, successful results of conservative treatment were &#x0003e; 50% if perfusion velocity was &#x0003e; 250 PU [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The perfusion velocity of burn wounds was measured repeatedly by other authors [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The results were slightly different: perfusion velocity 0&#x02013;250 PU in the case of deep burns and patients were referred for surgery. If perfusion velocity was 250&#x02013;625 PU, conservative treatment was performed with follow-up and repeated LDI scan later. If perfusion velocity decreased after repeated LDI scan, surgery was indicated. If perfusion velocity was &#x0003e; 625 PU, conservative treatment and spontaneous epithelization of burn wounds finally appeared [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We followed previous authors&#x02019; recommendation for burned patients&#x02019; indication for surgery in our clinical study. All patients of the LDI group with perfusion velocity less than 250 PU underwent surgery and patients were treated conservatively and followed up if perfusion velocity was &#x0003e; 250 PU.</p><p>However, the situation of patients with superficial (first degree burn) and deep (third degree burn) burns is certainly clear. The former are treated conservatively, while the latter undergo surgery. The most complicated situation is with IIA (superficial burn) and IIB (deep burn) degree burns. Sometimes IIA burns needs surgery and for patients with IIB burns enough conservative treatment and normal tissue epithelization is seen. It is necessary to determine a minimal perfusion velocity parameter during the LDI scan, which will enable one to choose the approach of treatment. We had 37 patients (20 patients with IIA degree burn and 17 patients with IIB degree of burn) with these degree burns in our study. Five patients of 20 with IIA degree burn were treated surgically and 4 patients of 17 with IIB degree burn were treated conservatively and normal tissue epithelization was seen. The mean perfusion velocity of these IIA patients was 264.80 PU and 305.50 PU of IIB patients. We did not calculate the prognostic parameter of perfusion velocity using a ROC curve, because we needed more cases of these types of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0007"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Laser Doppler imaging scan is superior compared to clinical burn depth examination. Laser Doppler imaging is effective for assessment of deep burns in the early period of injury. The length of stay and the cost of treatment of burn patients depend on early diagnosis of deep burns and well-timed surgical treatment of burn wounds.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
