Medical abortion is not yet widely used by the Indian health system although trained doctors, working in public or licensed private health facilities are allowed to provide medical abortion up to 63 days of gestation [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The current national medical abortion guidelines mandate three clinical visits carried out by a physician [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while the World Health Organisation guideline suggests that only one clinical visit is required [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mandatory follow-up visits rarely detect conditions women cannot detect themselves and the timing of follow-up rarely coincides with possible complications after an abortion. Instead, routine follow-up visits result in unnecessary direct and indirect costs for both women and health systems [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, it is clinically important to establish the outcome of the abortion to avoid on-going pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To increase convenience for women and providers, current literature suggests means of simplifying medical abortion, such as home-use of misoprostol, established to be feasible in both high and low-resource settings [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and alternative methods of follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of a low-sensitivity pregnancy test (LSPT) at two weeks after a medical abortion is safe and effective in discovering on-going pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The LSPT can be done at home, followed by a phone call from the clinic, assessing the outcome of the abortion based on the test [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Results from this randomized control trial (RCT) establish that women&#x02019;s home-assessment using a LSPT and a pictorial instruction sheet two weeks after medical abortion is as effective as in-clinic assessment by a doctor. Women&#x02019;s home-assessment had a higher abortion success rate (95%) compared with women in the clinic follow-up group (93%), and thus proves efficacy of simplified medical abortion also in a low-resource and rural setting [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Early medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol is safe and effective (&#x0003e;95%) [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and has the potential to enable access to safe abortion services. However, acceptability is an important dimension of access, reflecting the client&#x02014;provider relationship and more importantly the contextual adaptation of services [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Aspects such as confidentiality, decreased numbers of mandatory visits and affordability of services influence acceptability of medical abortion [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, women seeking medical abortion tend to not return to the clinic for their routine follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies evaluating acceptability of simplified follow-up after medical abortion have focused on high-resource or urban settings where telephones, road connections, and modes of transport are essentially available and where women have formal education [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, it is of great importance to evaluate factors influencing access to safe abortion in a low-resource setting. What is the acceptability of simplified services in a context where women&#x02019;s autonomy and mobility is limited, educational attainment is low and access to sanitation, electricity, and health care is poor? This study investigates women&#x02019;s acceptability of home-assessment of abortion and whether acceptability of medical abortion differs by in-clinic or home-assessment of abortion outcome in a low-resource setting in India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (RCT) with the secondary outcome to measure acceptability of home-assessment after medical abortion. However, the trial was primarily designed to measure efficacy of home-assessment. The RCT was conducted at six clinics (three rural, three urban) in a low-resource setting in Rajasthan, India. The study protocol and trial is reported according to the CONSORT guidelines for non-inferiority randomised trials [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The details of study implementation, setting and context in addition to a thorough explanation of the method are described in the study protocol [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the efficacy of the intervention is published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>The three rural clinics are situated in an interior rural area characterized by limited road connections, high level of poverty, and strong gender disparities including lower educational attainment among women (49% literacy) [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Half the population residing in this area belongs to the marginalized social groups, the scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The three urban clinics cater largely to urban women from a broader socio-economic spectrum. All women seeking abortion at the six facilities were screened for eligibility, given that they opted for medical abortion. Women were eligible if they presented with a pregnancy up to nine weeks of gestation as estimated by bimanual pelvic examination; resided in an area where follow-up was possible (within approximately 50 km of the study sites) or had a phone of their own; and agreed to follow-up at two weeks. Women were excluded if they had any contraindications to medical abortion, had a haemoglobin value below 85 mg/l and if they were below18 years of age.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Intervention and procedure</title><p>A research assistant explained the study procedure and obtained written informed consent from eligible women after the administration of mifepristone. Women who consented to participate were randomly allocated to either return to the clinic for follow-up by a doctor (clinic follow-up group), or to assess their abortion outcome at home using an LSPT and a pictorial instruction sheet (home-assessment group). The LSPT used in this study was a DUO-test with a high-sensitivity (5 units/litre) and a low-sensitivity (1000 units/litre) component produced by VEDA Lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vedalab.org/">www.vedalab.org</ext-link>). All women could opt for misoprostol administration at home, given that the doctor found it appropriate judging from gestational age, Hb-value and distance from the woman&#x02019;s house to the clinic. A research assistant contacted women carrying out home-assessment over phone or at home. All women were followed up at 10&#x02013;15 days after mifepristone administration and women that did not return or could not be contacted (maximum three attempts) within one month after the medical abortion were considered lost to scheduled follow-up and were excluded from analysis.</p><p>A doctor or trained midwife assessed women in the clinic follow-up group at the time of follow-up, 10&#x02013;14 days after mifepristone administration. Abortion outcome was established by the LSPT carried out by a health care provider or bimanual pelvic examination, depending on provider preference and standard practice. Side effects and remaining pregnancy symptoms were evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. All women that returned to the clinic for follow-up were reimbursed for travel expenses. Women in the home-assessment group had been instructed to use the LSPT 10&#x02013;14 days after mifepristone administration and were subsequently followed up by a research assistant no later than 15 days post mifepristone administration. Phone follow-up was applied where possible, and women with no phone were followed-up by making a discrete home visit, or a visit according to the woman&#x02019;s preference. Research assistants used a standardized questionnaire to assess abortion outcome by asking the women of their LSPT result, side effects and remaining pregnancy symptoms. If the woman had not done her LSPT, if she had carried out the test too early (within 10 days mifepristone administration) or if she was unsure of the result, the research assistant would ask the woman to carry out the test, provide a new test to repeat the test or ask her to return to the clinic. If it was a phone follow-up, the research assistant would call back later after the woman had carried out the test or ask her to return to the clinic for further assessment. Subsequently, research assistants asked questions regarding unscheduled visits, side effects, abortion experience, and acceptability of the abortion procedure following a standardized questionnaire used for all women.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Study outcomes and measures</title><p>The primary outcome was women&#x02019;s acceptability of the location of follow-up measured at the time of follow-up and compared between study groups. Acceptability was measured as women&#x02019;s future preference of follow-up location, overall satisfaction (satisfactory/ not satisfactory); women&#x02019;s experiences compared to expectations (better/ same/ worse), and women&#x02019;s comparison with previous abortion experiences when applicable (better/ same/ worse). Moreover, future preference of abortion method (medical/ surgical/ either or) was asked. Additionally, travel time, total time spent in the clinic, number of visits, location of misoprostol, unscheduled visits, adverse events, abortion outcome, socio-demographic and reproductive background of the women and whether they were accompanied to the clinic on day one of the abortion were considered as influential factors and used in the evaluation of factors associated with acceptability. Adverse events were defined as conditions requiring hospitalization, blood transfusion, intravenous fluids or intravenous antibiotics. Secondarily, the feasibility of the use of the LSPT among home-assessment group at follow-up was investigated in comparison with acceptability of home-assessment and the overall acceptability.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was estimated based on the success rate of medical abortion (95%) [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to prove the non-inferiority of home-assessment after medical abortion compared with clinic follow-up. The non-inferiority margin (delta) for successful abortion was set to 5% and was based upon perceived clinical significance [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With a two-sided significance level &#x003b1; = 0.05, a power of 80%, and an estimated lost to follow-up of 20% the total required sample size of was 716 women. A total of 731 women were recruited between 23 April 2013 and 15 May 2014 and followed up by 15 June 2014. This study measures the acceptability of the intervention and was a secondary outcome of the RCT.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>A computerised random number generator (random allocation software 2.0) generated the randomisation list [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Details of randomisation are recorded in the study protocol [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Block randomisation with blocks of six was applied to ensure equal distribution over the clinics. The research assistants carried out the randomisation procedure and the group allocation was concealed until the envelopes were opened. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However, the initial clinical assessment by a doctor and mifepristone administration occurred before randomisation. Location of misoprostol administration too, was decided upon before randomization. This decision was made according to the woman&#x02019;s preference in combination with the doctors&#x02019; advice.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Statistical methods and analysis</title><p>All statistical calculations were made using SPSS (version 20) and R (version 3.0.3).

Medical abortion is highly accepted among women in many settings [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Importantly, this study highlights that satisfaction is not determined by educational attainment or lack of resources, enhancing the scope of implementing simplified medical abortion in settings where women have low educational attainment, and family and health system resources are scarce. In line with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], our study confirms that satisfaction is primarily affected by the abortion outcome as well as the presence of side effects or abortion-related symptoms rather than means of follow-up.</p><p>Simplifying medical abortion in terms of task sharing to mid-level providers&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], home-use of misoprostol [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and simplified follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is effective, safe and accepted in high-resource or urban settings. This study confirms the acceptability and feasibility of simplified follow-up in a low-resource, rural setting, in which the majority of women are illiterate, infrastructure is poor and mobile phone possession among women is rare. Showing acceptability in such a setting suggests acceptability to be generalizable to other low-resource settings.</p><p>The use of a pictorial instruction sheet or a checklist has in recent studies of simplified follow-up been regarded as unnecessary or resulting in unnecessary referrals [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Findings from our study indicate that women who used the pictorial instruction sheet were more likely to prefer home-assessment in the future. Keeping in mind that, women who used the instruction sheet may have been more informed or motivated to carry out the home-assessment and were subsequently more likely to be satisfied. We used the pictorial instruction sheet as both an instruction of how to use the LSPT and a checklist of danger signs in relation to abortion [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>For successful implementation of an intervention in a low-resource and complex setting, it is important to understand how clients internalize the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Women in the home-assessment group reported a good overall abortion experience and majority of women correctly carried out and assessed their result of the LSPT. To believe that the abortion was complete, according to the woman&#x02019;s self-assessment based on the information and tools given to her on day one, and having used the LSPT before the research assistant came for follow-up, were both associated with satisfaction. These findings indicate the value to women of enabling home-assessment as an alternative to clinic follow-up, and further strengthened by the fact that a positive LSPT did not result in the future preference of clinic follow-up. This highlights the feasibility of increasing women&#x02019;s autonomy in abortion care and its positive effect on acceptability of abortion services. Moreover, it sheds light on the importance of acknowledging that women&#x02019;s preferences vary, and optimal abortion care must give women a choice of how to assess their abortion outcome.</p><p>There was a greater loss to follow-up in the clinic follow-up group, especially among rural residents. This could partly be explained by the study area&#x02019;s poor road and transport infrastructure and women&#x02019;s lack of autonomy in their family setting. It is common that women do not return for follow-up after a medical abortion [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] however, the follow-up is of great importance to avoid ongoing pregnancies. This loss to follow-up indicates an implicit need for alternative means of follow-up where women&#x02019;s choice to assess their abortion outcome at home is a feasible option. Given that women are provided with sufficient counseling of how to carry out the LSPT and are encouraged to seek care if needed. It is known that women seek care through unscheduled visits if they experience side effects or signs of incomplete abortion, rather than waiting for their scheduled follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A study from Nepal highlights the importance of the provision of sufficient information with regard to medical abortion to improve acceptability [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Qualitative research to explore women&#x02019;s and providers&#x02019; experiences could contribute to a deeper understanding of acceptability of home-assessment.</p><p>A limitation of the study was that women, lost to scheduled follow-up, could not be assessed for acceptability and this may have an effect on the proportion of satisfied women in the clinic follow-up group. However, the high satisfaction in our study corresponds with the high satisfaction reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, women that returned for clinic follow-up were given a travel reimbursement, to decrease loss to follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this may have enhanced satisfaction reported by women in the clinic follow-up group. It is also important to consider that questions regarding acceptability were asked in the clinics for the clinic follow-up group. This may have biased women in their responses of satisfaction, compared with women that were followed-up at home or over phone. Due to the small number of dissatisfied women it is difficult to draw conclusions on characteristics of women that reported dissatisfaction in the different groups.</p><p>Considering the lack of access to safe abortion and the large number of unsafe abortions in India [<xref rid="pone.0133354.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133354.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], simplifying medical abortion through increasing women&#x02019;s autonomy in abortion care can enforce women&#x02019;s reproductive rights and enable access to safe, acceptable abortion services.
