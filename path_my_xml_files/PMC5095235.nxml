In the Study of (E7080) Lenvatinib in Differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT), a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 392 patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), treatment with lenvatinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.21; 99% confidence interval [CI] 0.14&#x02013;0.31; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) by 14.7 months (lenvatinib median PFS, 18.3 mo) compared with placebo (median PFS, 3.6 mo) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Notably, lenvatinib treatment also resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 64.8%, which included four patients who achieved complete responses (CR), compared with an ORR of 1.5% in placebo-treated patients (all partial responses) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). ORR is a key end point in oncology clinical trials and has been correlated with improved overall survival in several studies, including metastatic breast cancer (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and a meta-analysis of mixed tumor types, but not yet in RR-DTC (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In a recent meta-analysis of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, ORR was found to be strongly associated with PFS. An association between ORR or PFS with overall survival, however, was not established, possibly because of the crossover study designs and post-study interventions (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Because the change in tumor volume is central to measuring patient response to therapy, this exploratory analysis examines the rate, magnitude, and duration of tumor size changes in SELECT.</p><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>The SELECT trial</title><p>This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study enrolled male or female patients with RR-DTC, measurable disease, and independently reviewed radiological evidence of progression (by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) within the prior 13 months. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients could have previously been treated with up to one prior VEGF or VEGF receptor-targeted therapy. Further details of the SELECT study design, including relevant protocol approvals, have been previously published (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Briefly, patients with RR-DTC were randomized 2:1 to receive oral lenvatinib (24 mg once daily) or placebo in 28-day cycles until unacceptable toxicity, independently reviewed radiological-confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Blinded, central radiological tumor assessments were performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version, 1.1 criteria every 8 weeks. Dose interruptions and incremental, sequential reductions due to adverse events were permitted (from 24 mg/d to 20, 14, and 10 mg/d).</p><p>Blood samples were collected at baseline, cycle 1/day 15, day 1 of subsequent cycles, and at the end of randomized study treatment. Serum was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C and then shipped overnight on dry ice from the clinical site to the analytical laboratory and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Patients were considered responders at 24 mg if their earliest responses occurred within 30 days of receiving 24 mg/d; otherwise, patients were considered responders at less than 24 mg lenvatinib. The rate of change in tumor size over time was analyzed using a two-segment linear regression model, in which the first segment was from baseline to the first radiological tumor assessment at 8 weeks, and the second segment was from the first radiological tumor assessment onward. The associations between PFS and variables of interest were analyzed by univariate analyses; variables with a univariate <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .2 were then included in a multivariate Cox regression model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>SELECT randomized 392 (male, n = 200; female, n = 192) patients to receive lenvatinib (n = 261) or placebo (n = 131).

Thereafter, a slower, continuous decrease in tumor size was observed at an average rate of &#x02212;1.3% per month. As demonstrated by the proportion of patients who reached nadir tumor size, tumor regression continued throughout the course of the treatment period, even after the rapid decline at the first tumor assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Median percentage change from baseline in tumor size decreased 22.1% at week 8, 28.9% at week 16, and greater than 50% by week 88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This reduction in tumor size occurred concurrently with a decrease in Tg levels that was also observed with lenvatinib treatment.

Because 8 weeks was the earliest assessment time point, it is unclear whether the response might have been even more rapid. It is important that clinicians are aware of the important clinical value that can be attained due to this rapid response, especially because patients with advanced disease are likely to experience pain or other complications because of tumor bulk or burden; therefore, the substantial tumor debulking may delay or abrogate the need for surgical intervention in some patients or make surgery easier.</p><p>After the first radiological evaluation, the tumors of patients treated with lenvatinib demonstrated a slower but continuous decrease in size. A concern regarding most anticancer or antiangiogenic therapies is that tumors often circumvent treatment by up-regulating escape or resistance mechanisms, thus becoming refractory to therapy (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The ongoing tumor reduction observed with lenvatinib treatment is, therefore, especially noteworthy. It may be because of the multitargeted nature of lenvatinib inhibition, specifically inhibition of the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling network and RET, which have shown to play key roles in thyroid cancer development and progression (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The unique binding mode of lenvatinib as a type V multikinase inhibitor could also explain the rapid and prolonged response observed with lenvatinib treatment (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of lenvatinib-induced tumor reduction was correlated both to lenvatinib exposure during the first 8 weeks of treatment and treatment duration. Further, the tumor reduction observed was also associated with a decline in Tg levels, which is often used as a measure of successful thyroid tumor treatment. Although we do not know whether there is a causal relationship, this may provide supporting evidence that the starting dose of lenvatinib should not be lowered, contrary to the practice by some clinicians to try to limit drug-associated toxicities (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Lenvatinib-induced tumor size reduction at 8 weeks was significantly correlated with PFS, although this correlation was diminished once other baseline patient characteristics were considered. This analysis had several limitations, including the lack of quality-of-life assessments and the collection of symptom data, which would provide additional context to the benefit of reducing tumor burden. The lack of data prior to the first 8-week radiological scan also limits the ability to more precisely determine when the reduction in tumor burden is truly occurring.</p><p>In conclusion, lenvatinib treatment in patients with RR-DTC in the phase 3 SELECT trial not only significantly prolonged PFS but also significantly reduced tumor burden, compared with placebo. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
