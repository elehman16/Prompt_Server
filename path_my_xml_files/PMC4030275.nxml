The DIFFICAIR trial compares the effect of two regimens of preoperative airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management.</p><p>Prediction of difficult airway management remains a pivotal challenge in anesthesia. Difficult tracheal intubation and difficult mask ventilation may cause serious patient complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By allocating experienced personnel and relevant equipment, better prediction of difficult airway management may reduce complications and, thereby, associated morbidity and mortality. There is no single predictor that is sufficiently valid in predicting difficult tracheal intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, several studies show that by combining multiple predictors of difficult tracheal intubation, the positive and the negative predictive value of the assessment increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In Denmark as well as internationally, there is no clear recommendation on how to perform airway assessment. Consequently, airway assessment in Denmark is based exclusively on the individual anesthesiologist&#x02019;s preoperative clinical assessment. However, it is poorly documented how accurately this clinical assessment predicts actual airway management conditions.</p><p>The &#x02018;Simplified Airway Risk Index&#x02019; (SARI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] is based on a multivariable model for airway assessment described by El-Ganzouri and colleagues enabling an estimation of the likelihood of a difficult direct laryngoscopy. The SARI contains seven individual predictors for a difficult direct laryngoscopy, each given a weighted score of 0 to 1 or 0 to 2. A summarized value of the SARI score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 indicates that a future direct laryngoscopy will be difficult. It is unknown, whether the SARI score predicts difficult intubation better or worse than a clinical assessment. The rationale for this trial was to prospectively compare the effect of the SARI with an non-specified clinical airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management.</p><p>The target population was adult patients undergoing anesthesia. Twenty-eight departments of anesthesia were randomized to one of two groups. Intervention departments used the SARI score for preoperative airway assessment. The intervention group additionally did an assessment of risk factors for difficult mask ventilation as described by Kheterpal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Departments in the control group continued normal practice of preoperative airway assessment. All data were registered in the Danish Anesthesia Database (DAD). A more detailed trial protocol describing background, design and rationale has been published in <italic>Trials</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In order to prevent outcome reporting bias and results based on data-driven analysis, it is encouraged to prospectively publish a trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The same argument applies for a prospective publication of a statistical analysis plan. Concordantly, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) recommends that clinical trials are analyzed according to a pre-specified plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The primary aim of the DIFFICAIR trial is to compare the effect of using a systematic airway assessment with a standard clinical airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management. The null hypothesis is:</p><p>&#x02022;There is no difference in the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubations when the preoperative airway assessment is based on the SARI score compared with a preoperative airway assessment based on the individual anesthesiologist&#x02019;s assessment.</p><p>The alternative hypothesis is:</p><p>&#x02022;The use of a systematic SARI airway assessment, registration of the SARI and risk factors for difficult mask ventilation, and continuous education in airway assessment will reduce the relative risk of a difficult intubation with 30%, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 180 patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This analysis plan has been written while the data collection from the DIFFICAIR trial was on-going and trial data non-accessible. The data analysis of the main publication will follow this plan. The statistical analysis was approved by the DIFFICAIR steering committee on 29 December 2013. The last day of data collection was 31 December 2013. The involved departments were given one additional month to ensure registration of all patients in the Danish Anesthesia Database. On 31 January 2014, the database was locked and data extracted. The statistical analysis plan was published on (www.clinicaltrials.gov) before the last data entry and before data was extracted and data management commenced.</p><p>The DIFFICAIR trial protocol has been written according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines and has been public on (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.difficair.com">http://www.difficair.com</ext-link>) since the beginning of the trial and is registered at (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT01718561). The Danish Anesthesia Database and the Danish Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive care Medicine (DASAIM) endorsed the trial.</p><p>The trial is carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. The Scientific Ethics Committee of Copenhagen County has declared that it is regarded as a quality assurance project and thus should not be reported to the committee system (Journal number: H-3-2012-FSP2). Further, the need for individual patient consent was waived. The trial is approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (Journal number: 2007-58-0015/HIH-2011-10, I-Suite number: 02079). The reporting of the trial will be in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><sec><title>Randomization and sample size</title><p>Our sample size calculation was based on an adjustment for the stratification and the cluster randomized design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since there are no previous records of the trial&#x02019;s primary outcome measure, &#x02018;unanticipated difficult intubation&#x02019; a baseline study was conducted based on data from the DAD. In order to reject or detect a 30% relative risk reduction in the proportions of unanticipated difficult intubation between the intervention group and the control group approximately 30 departments were required in a 15&#x000a0;months period. Calculations were based on a maximum risk of type 1 error of 5% and risk of type 2 error of maximum 20% (80% power).</p><p>A total of 28 departments were included and randomized 1:1 using a computer generated list. The sample size calculation was based on an average cluster size of 1,611 patients. We estimated the average cluster size in the DIFFICAIR trial to approximately 2,500 patients, giving a total of 70,000 included patients during the trial period. The enhanced sample size allows for a potentially slight loss of clusters according to the power calculation, from 30 to potentially 26. Our sample size estimation may be of a conservative nature, calling for more clusters than necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Populations</title><p>The DIFFICAIR trial focuses on two essential elements of airway management which are tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and mask ventilation. This statistical analysis plan will address analysis of the data regarding tracheal intubation. Data analysis regarding prediction of difficult mask ventilation will be handled in an analogous way, but will not be further elaborated in the present paper.</p><p>The part of the DIFFICAIR trial regarding prediction of difficult intubation comprises two populations; 1) patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy; 2) patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy (population 1) plus patients anticipated to be difficult to intubate and therefore scheduled for and intubated with an advanced method (for example, video laryngoscopic or fiber optic intubation).</p><p>The results of population 1 and 2 will be presented in one publication. Due to the extent of data, further publications presenting data from the DIFFICAIR trial will follow, but further elaboration on data analysis exceeds the content frame of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Adjusting and stratification variables</title><p>Each cluster (department) was randomized to a control or intervention group, making this the intervention group indicator. The trial site may account for further intervention heterogeneity and will be used for adjustment in the analysis of the intervention effect.

In our primary analyses and sample size calculation we employ the same definition.</p></sec><sec><title>General analysis principles</title><p>1. Unless otherwise stated, all main analyses will compare the two intervention groups using intention-to-treat (ITT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>2. In order to ensure a correct type 1 error risk, all main analyses will account for the clustered design of the trial and the stratification variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Analyses will be based on individual patient level data but clustering of patients and the stratification variable will be accounted for in a generalized estimating equation.</p><p>3. In all analyses, a maximum level of 5% (two-sided) type 1 error will be regarded as statistically significant unless otherwise stated.</p><p>4. Main analyses will be according to ITT adjusted for cluster and stratification variables. Sensitivity analyses will be performed adjusted and unadjusted for the prior listed potential confounding covariates. We will discuss if results differ from the main analyses. The conclusion of the trial will be based on the primary analyses.</p><p>5. Test of interaction will be applied for subgroup analyses.</p><p>6. Risks are reported as relative risks and odds ratios. When relative risks are calculated from odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) it will be done according to Zhang and Yu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>7. For missing data exceeding a rate of 5%, and with a statistical significant Little&#x02019;s test, indicating that the missing data is not a completely random sample of the total data, point estimates with 95% CI will be calculated using a worst/best case scenario imputation on the missing values. If the imputation of a worst/best case scenario implies different conclusions, multiple imputations will be performed on the missing values assuming missingness at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Unadjusted and complete case analyses will also be presented.</p><p>8. In order to avoid rejecting a true null hypothesis we will address the problem of multiplicity by Bonferroni adjustments on the secondary outcome measures. If unadjusted analyses are insignificant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05), Bonferroni adjustments will not be applied. In case the adjustment changes an unadjusted significant <italic>P</italic>-value to a non-significant <italic>P</italic>-value, this will be discussed.</p><p>9. To ensure complete objectivity, the author (AN) will be blinded for the intervention group in the primary outcome analysis and, as far as this is possible, for analyses of secondary outcomes. However, analyses of the predictive properties of the SARI will require un-blinding of AN. After data collection, a third party data manager will generate a complete dataset with blinded coding of the intervention groups and other variables possibly revealing the intervention. The statistician performs the primary outcome analysis on this data set. If the primary outcome differs between groups, we will construct different conclusions reflecting the results, considering that significant differences of the intervention could both be of benefit or harm. After writing the conclusions, we will uncover the code of the blinding, and subsequently the correct conclusion will be employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><sec><title>Trial profile</title><p>The flow of study participants will be displayed in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram at a cluster level and at individual level.

We will test the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses with a mixed effects model and finally with a standard <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the means of the outcome at department level in each intervention group.</p><p>The first sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome will be adjusted for the stratification- and cluster-variables as well as baseline covariates assumed as confounders incorporated in a generalized estimating equation.</p><p>In the second sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, we will employ a different cut-off value for difficult intubation using&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 instead of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 as the definition of difficult intubation.</p><p>Further sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome will compare the patients in the control group that met the inclusion- and not the exclusion-criteria with patients in the intervention group who received the protocoled intervention.

The DIFFICAIR trial raises two important questions, which are: is it possible via the intervention to reduce the frequencies of difficult intubation and/or difficult mask ventilation? This plan only addresses the statistical analyses of the population of intubated patients because our sample size calculations were based on this population. Secondly, the SARI was developed as a prediction tool for difficult intubation. Finally, the extent of data necessitates several publications.</p><p>By adjusting our primary outcome analysis for different design variables, such as clustering and stratification, we strive to eliminate inflated type 1 error rates as a consequence of the trial design. A generalized estimating equation is applied based on an evaluation of each variable as having random or fixed effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>When multiple comparisons are performed between two groups, you may risk accepting an intervention effect erroneously (type 1 error). There are several approaches that deal with multiple testing. We will employ Bonferroni adjustments on the secondary outcome measures in order to evaluate, identify and discuss dubious significant outcomes that may be due to statistical multiplicity.</p><p>The value of a diagnostic test is usually presented as sensitivity and specificity. We have chosen (1 - total accuracy), that is the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubations (False Negative, FN) and the proportion of unanticipated easy intubations (False Positive, FP). Both scenarios are of clinical relevance since the FNs are at risk of hypoxia, increased morbidity and even death, while the FPs are at risk of being imposed unnecessary discomfort by, for example, awake intubation. At the same time, both the FNs and FPs can take up unnecessary resources. Sensitivity and specificity are more difficult to interpret intuitively. Consequently, we chose to present more transparent primary outcomes. Using proportions of unanticipated difficult intubation allowed us to perform a baseline cohort study, on which we based our sample size and power calculations.</p><p>By publishing this paper, where we pre-specify our methods and analyses, it is our hope that the results from the DIFFICAIR trial will be as transparent and robust as possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper presents the principles of analyses of the main outcomes in the DIFFICAIR trial for the first publication based on patients who underwent intubation.
