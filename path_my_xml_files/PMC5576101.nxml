In Singapore, there was a 2.2% increase in the proportion of older persons aged 65&#x000a0;years and above in the recent 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This population has greater mental health risks due to perceived social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Amongst the older adults, gardening is a popular leisure-time activity and exposure to nature has been found to increase positive affect and reduction in anger in individuals, as opposed to those in the urban environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This may be due to the restorative effects of nature, such as recovery of directed attention fatigue and stress mitigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore in recent years, there is burgeoning research on therapies which tap on the nature&#x02019;s benefits on human health and one of which is horticulture.</p><p id="Par32">Definitions of horticultural activities in literature vary in scope from a broad perspective encompassing all forms of exposure to nature and plants, to a more narrow focus on active engagement with plants. Defined broadly, horticultural activities have been shown to reduce depression severity and rumination in clinically depressed patients as the garden environment offers a respite from the urban settings and fascination to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Notably, besides reducing negative mood (i.e. tension, depression, fatigue, anger and confusion), horticulture also brings about an increase in positive dimension (i.e. vigor/energy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, a 7-week indoor horticulture activity program was found to improve participants&#x02019; psychological well-being, as compared to the waitlist control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, horticultural activities may be a promising intervention in improving mental health.</p><p id="Par33">An investigation on the efficacy of horticultural activities in improving mental health, cognitive functioning and physical health is merited for its wider implications. If proven to be effective, this innovative and cost-effective intervention could be a nation-wide strategy in health promotion. It has been stated that the healthcare system alone may be limited in promoting public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and that there is a need for public health strategies to focus on the socio-ecological aspects of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, urban parks, which are easily accessible for community-dwelling individuals, are an ideal resource to support the promotion of these aspects of well-being.</p><p id="Par34">Because the present study is a goal-oriented intervention which seeks to enhance the mental, cognitive and physical health of the elderly participants, the definition put forth is adopted:</p><p id="Par35">&#x0201c;Horticultural therapy (HT) is a professionally conducted client-centered treatment modality that utilizes horticulture activities to meet specific therapeutic or rehabilitative goals of its participants. The focus is to maximize social, cognitive, physical and/or psychological functioning and/or to enhance general health and wellness (p. 5).&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Enhanced with the environmental benefits offered by the nature, HT may be a promising intervention in promoting public health and critical in prevention work. However, there is currently a paucity of research on the effectiveness of HT in a multi-ethnic Singaporean population as most studies were conducted either on western societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or Japan and Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to unique social and cultural specificities, it is inappropriate to assume that the findings could be generalized to our local population.</p><p id="Par37">Furthermore, there are limitations in the existing research. Most of the other studies either have small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], short intervention duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], or employed the sole use of questionnaires without collaborating evidence from biological data. In addition, a systematic review found that the randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted thus far have poor methodological and reporting quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further research is therefore needed to determine the effectiveness of HT in improving the health of the elderly in the multi-ethnic Singaporean community.</p><p id="Par38">Therefore the aims of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of HT in improving the mental, cognitive and physical health of the community-dwelling older adults using a RCT design. Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that, as compared to the waitlist control, participants in the active treatment group will 1) have better mental health, 3) have greater improvement of cognitive functioning and 3) have better physical health. In order to have collaborative evidence with measures of psychological health, the immunology of participants will be investigated via blood-based biomarkers. Notably, past research has found that depressive symptomatology was associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and lower levels of trophic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par39">All procedures involved in this trial will be conducted in compliance with the Helsinki declaration and Singapore Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

The intervention will lasts for 6&#x000a0;months with 1-h HT sessions during the first 3&#x000a0;months followed by monthly sessions the next 3&#x000a0;months. Outcome assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months. The 3-months follow-up intervals were decided based on a study by Gonzalez et al. which found that participants&#x02019; depressive symptoms declined after 3&#x000a0;months and these improvements were maintained in the final 6-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par41">Seventy elderly will be recruited from a research center in the western district of Singapore.

The cut-off score of 22 on MoCA is to select participants who have intact cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, older adults will be excluded from the study if they have 1) history of severe psychiatric conditions e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder; 2) dementia; 3) significant visual or hearing impairment; 4) marked upper and lower limb motor difficulties, which may affect their ability to participate in the study; 5) are currently suffering from or have history of severe medical conditions e.g. cancer, stroke, Parkinson disease; or 6) are participating in another therapy at the same time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and baseline procedures</title><p id="Par43">The flow of participants from recruitment to end of study is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The extension of monthly sessions for 3&#x000a0;months is to determine sustainability and longer-term changes. Conducted by a trained practitioner and volunteer facilitators, the intervention is designed to cultivate an interest in gardening and promote relaxation. The participants will be assigned into groups of 7 with a facilitator for enhanced personal engagement. The participants will be with the same group members and facilitator throughout the intervention in order to build rapport and social connectedness. The facilitators are volunteers with the National Parks Board, who were trained with some basic knowledge of horticultural skills such as plant propagation, plant identification, flower arranging, houseplant care, and horticulture crafts. The essential element of the HT program is to communicate to the participants that plants are living things that must be given care. This caring extends the emotional growth of the participants.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Planned activity sessions for the 6&#x000a0;months of intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Topic</th><th>Activity</th><th>Venue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introduction</td><td>1.

</p><p id="Par46">Each session will start with breathing and stretching exercises, before going into the activity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The stretching exercises improve the flexibility of the participants, giving them more freedom of movement for the HT activities. In the first 3&#x000a0;months of weekly sessions, the intervention comprises of 3 main components: 1) indoor horticultural activities, 2) park visits and 3) outdoor gardening. The indoor activities will include making pressed flowers, which is an extension of appreciation for nature, indoor gardening to encourage participants to engage in gardening activity at their home and take ownership of their own plants.</p><p id="Par47">Participants will be brought on visits to various urban parks in Singapore such as the Singapore Botanical Gardens, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Gardens by the Bay. These visit tours will be facilitated by trained park guides who will share their knowledge on the plants and the landscapes with the participants. Participants will also be encouraged to engage themselves actively in the environment by paying attention to the sights and sounds in the nature parks, thereby appreciating the nature and sharpening their focus. Viewing of natural spaces has been found to reduce anger and increase positive affect, due to the restorative effects of nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">For the gardening activities, they will be held fortnightly at the Chinese Garden where participants will be taught to do weeding and seed sowing. Such active participation in the natural environment has been found to improve mood state where participants were less stressed and were invigorated by their experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Vegetables such as ladyfinger, milk cabbage, and choy sum will be planted by the participants. They will be educated on the making of fertilizer as well as knowledge on herbal plants. When their vegetable crops are ready for harvest, the participants will be able to prepare a soup dish together to encourage social connectedness amongst them.</p><p id="Par49">Throughout the intervention programme, there will be an emphasis on education and mental stimulation whereby the facilitation is structured in terms of a series of questions and answers. This encourages active discussion amongst the facilitators and participants and social engagement. Longitudinal studies on mental stimulation and socially integrated lifestyle in late life have been found to have beneficial effect on cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Studies have shown that contact with nature has been associated with positive mood and improved sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and HT which allows for engagement with nature has been suggested to mitigate stress and improve mood state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study will be conducted on a multi-racial Asian population to provide substantiation if HT can improve mental health, cognitive functioning or physical health. With the objective measures of biomarkers as collaborative evidence, the proposed study will make significant contributions, both to a theoretical understanding of mental and cognitive health and to providing needed information to the healthcare providers coping with an ageing population.</p><p id="Par83">In addition, this study is evaluating not only quantitative data but also qualitative data via feedback questionnaire. This will provide information on the subjective experience of the participants, and to inform areas of improvement for future programs as ultimately our focus will be on the benefits to the individual and the opportunities to continue such a program beyond the duration of the project.</p><p id="Par84">HT may offer a playful and enjoyable experience to the participants, thereby providing an intrinsic motivation and increasing compliance. Hence, older adults would be self-motivated to appreciate nature and be engaged in gardening even after the program ends. As a basic premise of this community-based initiative, we seek to build the capacity of the participants and empower them to take charge of their own health. This change in lifestyle will enhance their physical activity levels, and consequently increasing their health and ability to cope more effectively with the challenges faced in their daily life.</p><p id="Par85">Community-based HT may provide an avenue for older individuals to socialize more and improve their mental health. After retirement, they are more likely to lead a sedentary lifestyle, with only 30% of them reaching the recommended level of leisure-time activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and slightly more than half (58%) in Singapore were sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Especially for those who are living alone, they might experience loneliness due to a lack of social interaction, which could in turn increase their risk for mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Participation in HT will help build a sense of social connectedness amongst the older individuals. It is noteworthy that the proposed intervention also includes some physical exercise and educational components aiming to motivate the participants to carry on gardening at home. These various components aim to be holistic in delivering its benefits to the participants, as well as to encourage participants to adopt it as a lifestyle change. In addition, different locations will be used to conduct the intervention. Although this may add to the heterogeneity of such interventions, it reflects that such interventions, which are contingent on its environmental aspects, need to be adjusted to the local and cultural context.</p><p id="Par86">The program can be easily translated to older adults&#x02019; activities of daily living. Singapore, termed a &#x0201c;Garden City&#x0201d; has more than 350 parks which are close to homes for easy access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Hence, urban parks are inexpensive resources readily available for the older adults to engage in walks and gardening activities. In addition, as part of the HT program, plants are given to participants to tend to at home, encouraging them to incorporate gardening as part of their daily routine.</p><p id="Par87">Such community-based interventions supported by volunteers are important as they have the potential to be sustained. With its clinical implications, this initiative will guide future larger research trials and healthcare providers of the need to support cost-effective HT as a strategy to engage older adults in a more active and healthier lifestyle. In the context of the growing worldwide mental illness burden of disease, HT will go a long way in easing public healthcare, social and economic costs.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Study progress</title><p id="Par88">The study has completed data collection.</p><p id="Par89">Intervention programme for the waitlist control and data analyses are currently ongoing.
