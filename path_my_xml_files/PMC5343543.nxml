The aim of the SPARK (Safety Paediatric efficAcy phaRmacokinetic with Kuvan&#x000ae;) trial was to assess the efficacy (improvement in daily phenylalanine tolerance, neuromotor development and growth parameters), safety and pharmacokinetics of sapropterin dihydrochloride in children &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 109 male or female children &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years with confirmed BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia and good adherence to dietary treatment were screened. 56 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg/day oral sapropterin plus a phenylalanine-restricted diet or to only a phenylalanine-restricted diet for 26&#x000a0;weeks (27 to the sapropterin and diet group and 29 to the diet-only group; intention-to-treat population). Of these, 52 patients with &#x02265;1 pharmacokinetic sample were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, and 54 patients were included in the safety analysis. At week 26 in the sapropterin plus diet group, mean phenylalanine tolerance was 30.5 (95% confidence interval 18.7&#x02013;42.3) mg/kg/day higher than in the diet-only group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The safety profile of sapropterin, measured monthly, was acceptable and consistent with that seen in studies of older children. Using non-linear mixed effect modelling, a one-compartment model with flip-flop pharmacokinetic behaviour, in which the effect of weight was substantial, best described the pharmacokinetic profile. Patients in both groups had normal neuromotor development and stable growth parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The addition of sapropterin to a phenylalanine-restricted diet was well tolerated and led to a significant improvement in phenylalanine tolerance in children &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia. The pharmacokinetic model favours once per day dosing with adjustment for weight. Based on the SPARK trial results, sapropterin has received EU approval to treat patients &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive phenylketonuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01376908">NCT01376908</ext-link>.

Most cases of HPA (98%) in North American and European populations are due to mutations in the <italic>PAH</italic> gene but, in rare cases of HPA (1&#x02013;2%), the cause can be a defect in the metabolism of the natural PAH cofactor, the R diastereoisomer of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Owing to the reduced activity of PAH due to either mechanism, patients with HPA have an accumulation of Phe in the blood and body tissues and a relative deficiency of tyrosine and subsequent metabolites such as epinephrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>HPA can present with a spectrum of phenotypes that can be grouped into three main categories according to blood Phe concentrations before therapeutic intervention: classical PKU (Phe &#x0003e;1200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L); mild PKU (Phe 600&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L); mild HPA (Phe 120&#x02013;600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PKU can lead to cognitive impairment and, if untreated, patients can develop mild-to-severe intellectual disability and other neurological sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The therapeutic range of Phe concentration varies according to different guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and there is no international consensus. The US diagnostic and management guidelines recommend that the initiation of treatment for PKU should be undertaken as early as possible, preferably within the first week after birth, with a goal of having blood Phe in the range 120&#x02013;360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L within the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of life, to prevent permanent neurological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The European guidelines recommend target concentrations of 120-360 &#x003bc;mol/L for individuals aged 0-12 years and for maternal PKU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In both, this is largely achieved by a natural protein-restricted diet and Phe-free synthetic amino-acid supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, adherence to a Phe-restricted diet is burdensome owing to the need for long-term dietary counselling and daily micronutrient supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The management guidelines also stipulate that a course of treatment with BH<sub>4</sub> should be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride (sapropterin, Kuvan&#x000ae;, Merck, Geneva, Switzerland, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and BioMarin, Novato, CA, USA) is a synthetic formulation of BH<sub>4</sub> that has been shown to be effective in lowering serum Phe concentrations and/or improving dietary Phe tolerance in a subset of patients with PKU or mild HPA who respond to treatment with BH<sub>4</sub> (known as responders) and in the rare patients with a defect in BH<sub>4</sub> synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on the results of the SPARK (Safety Paediatric efficAcy phaRmacokinetics with Kuvan&#x000ae;) study, the European Medicines Agency has recently extended the indication for sapropterin from the treatment of BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU in adults and children aged &#x02265;4&#x000a0;years and in all BH<sub>4</sub>-deficient adults and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to now include children with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years old, for whom the previous standard of care was a Phe-restricted diet.</p><p>The primary aim of the SPARK study was to evaluate the efficacy (increase in Phe tolerance, defined as the amount of Phe a patient may consume while maintaining blood Phe concentrations within the target range of 120&#x02013;360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L); safety of 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride plus a Phe-restricted diet compared with a Phe-restricted diet alone in children &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years of age with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU or mild HPA; to document the relationship between exposure and response; and to support the posology in this age-group. Although population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) data for sapropterin have been published for infants and young children in the USA and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there are no PopPK data for sapropterin in this age range in the European Union (EU); therefore, a secondary aim of SPARK was to develop a PopPK model for sapropterin in this population. The other secondary endpoints were to document the concentrations of blood Phe during the study and extension periods, to document the change in dietary Phe tolerance, and to monitor blood pressure, growth parameters, and neuromotor developmental milestones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The SPARK trial (NCT01376908) is a 26-week open-label, multicentre, randomized phase IIIb study to assess the efficacy, safety and PopPK of sapropterin in patients aged&#x02009;&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU or mild HPA.

</p><p>The most common TEAEs in the sapropterin plus Phe-restricted diet group and in the Phe-restricted diet group were: pyrexia (63.0 and 66.7%), cough (48.1 and 48.1%) and nasopharyngitis (48.1 and 40.7%), respectively. The most common TEAEs classified as related to sapropterin were amino acid concentration decrease (six patients [22.2%]), rhinitis, and vomiting (two patients each [7.4%]), and one patient (3.7%) each for pharyngitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration and increased amino acid concentration.</p><p>Although the proportion of patients who reported a serious AE (SAE) was higher in the sapropterin plus Phe-restricted diet group compared with the Phe-restricted diet (11.1 vs. 3.7%), all SAEs were assessed as unrelated to sapropterin treatment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Genotype data</title><p>Of 109 patients who were screened, 73 agreed to participate in the pharmacogenetics sub-study.

Until July 2015 there was no licensed pharmacological treatment available in the EU for children with PKU aged &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years, and the standard of care was a Phe-restricted diet. The results of the SPARK study, which was the first clinical trial of sapropterin in patients 0&#x02013;4-years-old with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU or mild HPA in Europe, showed that daily dosing with 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day sapropterin in combination with a Phe-restricted diet led to statistically and clinically significant improved dietary Phe tolerance at week 26 compared with a Phe-restricted diet alone, while maintaining mean blood Phe concentrations within the protocol-specified range. These results were consistent with those seen in children aged 4&#x02013;12 years treated with 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day sapropterin, in whom the mean amount of Phe supplement tolerated had increased at 10&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The results were also consistent with those reported in a study from the USA and Canada in children aged 0&#x02013;6 years old, in whom 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/day sapropterin treatment lowered blood Phe concentrations, enabling, in some cases, an increase in dietary Phe intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of initiating sapropterin therapy in patients younger than 4&#x000a0;years have been highlighted by a post-marketing study conducted in Japan between 1995 and 2001, which reported that all patients who started treatment with sapropterin before the age of 4&#x000a0;years maintained serum Phe concentrations within the recommended range for the duration of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that neurocognitive function was preserved and no neurodevelopmental penalty was reported in patients who started sapropterin therapy between 0 and 6&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and that treatment with BH<sub>4</sub> may enable relaxation of the dietary regimen, leading to improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Patients with mild HPA, who comprised almost a half of the population in this study, retain substantial enzyme activity and will, therefore, likely respond to sapropterin treatment. However, the indication for treatment of mild HPA differs between countries due to weak evidence. US guidelines recommend treatment at a Phe concentration above 360&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while other countries start treatment at Phe concentrations above 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the addition of sapropterin to a Phe-restricted diet in patients &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years old with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PAH deficiency significantly improved Phe tolerance compared with a Phe-restricted diet alone. In the sapropterin-treated group, blood Phe concentrations initially fell at the beginning of treatment (4&#x000a0;weeks), but they slowly increased over the course of the study to reach concentrations similar to those at baseline by week 12 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), while increasing dietary Phe-intake. The observed increase in Phe tolerance reported in patients on the Phe-restricted diet compared with the tolerance at baseline may be explained by the fact that the patients in this group were not at their maximum Phe tolerance in daily practice before starting the study. This observation confirms the expectation that under the tight control of study conditions using a strict algorithm of Phe escalation, dietary Phe tolerance may be further optimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Because of the potential for Phe concentrations to drop below either the normal or the desired therapeutic concentrations owing to the action of sapropterin, careful monitoring and adjustment of therapeutic dose and dietary Phe concentrations was necessary.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of BH<sub>4</sub> can be well described by a one-compartment model that respects the principle of parsimony and provides accurate estimates that describe BH<sub>4</sub> profiles virtually identical to those from a two-compartment model evaluated in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The terminal and absorption half-lives are suggestive of flip-flop pharmacokinetic behavior, in which absorption is the rate-limiting step of drug disposition. Sapropterin exposure was similar across all age groups studied here. With this in mind, a once-daily dosing regimen is justified. Weight was the only covariate that had an effect on the clearance and volume distribution of sapropterin, meaning that dose adjustments based on weight are appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The secondary endpoints of growth and neuromotor development were considered to be normal in the patient population throughout the study and no difference between groups was observed, suggesting no treatment effect on these growth and development parameters. However, the time scale in the study was too short to expect clinically meaningful changes in neuromotor development.</p><p>The safety profile for sapropterin was acceptable and similar to that reported in studies of patients &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and in those &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with no deaths, severe TEAEs or withdrawals reported. Although four patients had SAEs, none of these was deemed to be related to treatment. The number of TEAEs was similar between the two groups and was commonly associated with normal childhood illness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the addition of sapropterin to a Phe-restricted diet in patients aged &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years old with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU, mild PKU or mild HPA was well tolerated and led to a significant improvement in Phe tolerance compared with only a Phe-restricted diet. The pharmacokinetics of sapropterin in patients aged &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years are adequately described by a one-compartment model, and favor once-a-day dosing with dose adjustment for weight. These data led to the approval of sapropterin for individuals with BH<sub>4</sub>-responsive PKU or mild HPA aged &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;years, and will thus change treatment management for this subset of patients in the first week of life.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p>
