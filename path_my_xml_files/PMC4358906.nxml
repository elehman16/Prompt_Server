Each site could enrol in the study population once the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in five children five to 12&#x000a0;years of age was deemed to be effective and well tolerated. The primary efficacy evaluation was the proportion of subjects in both the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations with an adequate clinical and parasitological response (PCR corrected) at Day 28. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval comparing the two groups was 10 percentage points or greater.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 255 children were enrolled in the efficacy analysis (AZCQ, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;124; AL, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;131). The PCR corrected clearance rates were 89% (AZCQ) <italic>versus</italic> 98% (AL) for MITT, a difference of -9.10 (95% confidence interval; -16.02, -2.18) and 93% (AZCQ) <italic>versus</italic> 99% (AL) for PP, a difference of -6.08 (-12.10, -0.05). Early and late treatment failures were more common in subjects receiving AZCQ. Adverse events were more common in subjects treated with AZCQ.

Throughout the world, approximately 207 million cases of malaria were reported in 2012, 80% in Africa. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> accounted for 91% of total cases. The vast majority of the estimated 627,000 malaria deaths occurred in 2012, 90% in Africa, and children under five years accounted for 77% of these deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated malaria caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p>The combination of azithromycin (AZ) and chloroquine (CQ) has been shown to have synergistic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> against CQ-resistant strains of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. AZ and CQ are marketed drugs, and there is extensive experience with each of these agents in the paediatric population. The efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of AZ and CQ (AZCQ) for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in adults were recently demonstrated in two multicentre phase 3 clinical studies in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and in phase 2 studies in India and Colombia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a separate study, a fixed-dose combination of AZCQ is currently undergoing evaluation for intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The objective of this study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00677833) was to establish the non-inferiority of AZCQ compared with the ACT combination artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in African children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an open-label, randomized, phase 2/3 study at six sites (two centres in Burkina Faso and one centre each in Kenya, Ghana, Mali, and Ivory Coast) in sub-Saharan Africa that compared the efficacy (adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR)) of AZCQ with that of AL in treatment of children with symptomatic uncomplicated falciparum malaria. An independent external data monitoring committee (EDMC), comprising international and regional malaria researchers, had oversight of the study. The study was conducted between June 2008 and September 2010.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>To be eligible for participation in the study, subjects were required to be able to receive treatment on an outpatient basis. Subjects were included if age ranged from five to 12&#x000a0;years of age (screening cohort) or between six and 59&#x000a0;months of age (primary study cohort) and had uncomplicated, symptomatic malaria. The presence of malaria was defined as positive blood smears for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, mono-infection with parasite counts between 1,000 to 100,000 parasites/&#x003bc;L, and documented fever (&#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C, rectal or tympanic; or &#x02265;37.2&#x000b0;C axillary or &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C oral), or history of fever within the previous 24&#x000a0;hours. Subjects also had to have a blood glucose &#x02265;60&#x000a0;mg/dL and haemoglobin &#x02265;6&#x000a0;g/dL or haematocrit &#x02265;18% without signs of anaemia-induced congestive heart failure, and a negative urine pregnancy test for females&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;ten years of age. Informed consent for the study and permission from subjects&#x02019; legal guardian for the three-day inpatient stay was also needed. Concomitant use of medications (e.g., anti-emetics, antipyretics) was permitted. Use of medications with known drug interactions with macrolides was closely monitored. Medications metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme were not permitted (contra-indicated with AL). In addition, agents that prolong the QT interval and concomitant administration of other anti-malarial drugs were avoided because of limited safety data with AL.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included subjects with severe or complicated malaria or a peripheral blood smear indicating a mix of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, any history of allergy/hypersensitivity to or contraindication for use of any of the study drugs or history of treatment with anti-malarial drugs within two weeks prior to enrollment, body weight &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;kg or severe malnutrition, and known or suspected cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal abnormality, specific systemic diseases, or other medical conditions that would interfere with the evaluation of therapeutic response or safety of the study drug, other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality, or other common febrile conditions, such as tonsillitis, measles, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study procedure</title><p>In Burkina Faso, the National Ethical Committee for Health Research reviewed and approved the final protocol, informed consent, and any amendments. At all other study centres, this review and approval was done by the institutional review board at each study centre. Oversight of safety data evaluation was provided through the activities of the EDMC. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study protocol was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration under an Investigational New Drug application. All local regulatory requirements were also followed.</p><p>Subject enrolment was carried out in two stages. Each site was required to initially enrol ten evaluable subjects in a screening cohort (Cohort 1) of older children (five to 12&#x000a0;years of age) who were assumed to have some degree of immunity to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> before proceeding with the primary study population cohort (Cohort 2) of younger children (six to 59&#x000a0;months of age). The decision to proceed to Cohort 2 for each site was based on the safety and efficacy of five evaluable AZCQ subjects observed in Cohort 1 at that site. The site could begin enrolling in Cohort 2 if all five evaluable subjects in the AZCQ group of Cohort 1 demonstrated a clinical and parasitological response within the first seven days of treatment initiation, continued clearance of parasitaemia through Day 28, and no clinically significant safety and tolerability issues were noted. If four of five subjects in the AZCQ arm demonstrated parasitological clearance and a clinical response within the first seven days of treatment initiation, the centre continued to enrol approximately ten additional subjects with five evaluable subjects receiving AZCQ. Continuing onto Cohort 2 required that eight or more of ten AZCQ-treated subjects demonstrated a clinical response and parasitologic clearance up to Day 28, and no significant safety and tolerability issues were noted. If fewer than four of five subjects in the AZCQ arm met the above criteria, the EDMC evaluated data from all sites and made recommendations on when to proceed with Cohort 2 enrolment. In all other cases, the decision to move from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 for each centre was made by the investigator, the sponsor (Pfizer), and occasionally the EDMC.</p><p>In each cohort, subjects were randomized 1:1 to either receive an AZCQ fixed-dose combination tablet (30&#x000a0;mg/kg AZ&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mg /kg CQ base) orally once daily for three days (Days 0, 1, 2) or AL orally per prescribing information for three days (Days 0, 1, 2). A computer-generated randomization list was provided to investigators and randomization numbers were assigned sequentially as subjects were deemed eligible to participate in the study. Random assignment to either the AZCQ or AL treatment groups was determined by the assigned number from the randomization list. Two strengths of AZCQ were available for this study: AZ 300&#x000a0;mg/CQ 100&#x000a0;mg and AZ 150&#x000a0;mg/CQ 50&#x000a0;mg. Tablets were scored to allow for dosing by body weight. Subjects received AZCQ 300/100-mg tablets for &#x02265;20&#x000a0;kg body weight: and AZCQ 150/50-mg tablets for 5 to &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;kg body weight. When possible, the study drugs were administered with or immediately after food consumption. Any dose of AZCQ that was vomited within 30&#x000a0;minutes of administration and any dose of AL that was vomited within 60&#x000a0;minutes of administration was repeated once. If vomiting recurred, the subject was discontinued from the study treatment.</p><p>At enrolment, the presence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> was identified using a blood dipstick-based test (Binax NOW immunochromatographic test (ICT)) and confirmed by microscopy on a Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear. All eligible subjects were then hospitalized for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;three days for study drug administration and monitoring of the study key parameters. During this time, blood smears (thick and thin) were obtained every eight hours until two consecutive smears showed absence of parasitaemia. Clinical assessments, including adverse events (AEs), thick and thin peripheral smears and vital signs were evaluated on study Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Electrocardiograms were performed in a limited number of subjects on study Days 0 and 2. At each site, clinical presentation and smear results from each study day were used to determine subject management. Discharge from the hospital occurred following clearance of asexual parasitaemia and investigator approval. All subjects were given insecticide-treated bed nets for use in the hospital and for use at home once discharged.</p><p>Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were collected only in the AZCQ treatment group to determine serum AZ, plasma CQ, and desethyl-CQ concentrations. Whole blood samples were collected on Day 0 (prior to the first dose) at 0&#x000a0;hours (window: -1 to 0&#x000a0;hour); on Day 2 (the day of the third dose) at 0 (pre-dose, window: -1 to 0&#x000a0;hr), three (window: 2&#x02013;4 hours), and eight hours (window: 6&#x02013;10 hours), and randomly on Day 7. Samples were either centrifuged at 3,500&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000b0;C or the centrifuge bucket and rotor were chilled on ice or in a refrigerator for two hours prior to use. Samples were stored within one hour of collection at -20&#x000b0;C until shipped for assay. AZ, CQ and desethyl-CQ concentrations were analysed using validated, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. AZ assays were performed by Bioanalytical Systems, Ltd (BASi) (Warwickshire, UK) and CQ/desethyl-CQ assays were performed by Cetero Research (Houston, TX, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A prospectively planned interim analysis was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy endpoints when approximately 50% of the subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 (approximately 52 evaluable subjects per arm) completed the Day 28 visit. Interim data were reviewed by the EDMC, and a determination to continue the study was made based on a predefined futility criterion (ACPR). ACPR was defined as asexual <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitologic clearance at Day 28 irrespective of axillary, oral, rectal, or tympanic temperature without previously meeting the criteria of early treatment failure or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected late treatment failure. <italic>PCR-corrected</italic> refers to the use of molecular testing to differentiate recrudescence from re-infection when evaluating efficacy (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for full definitions). Filter-paper samples were used for molecular analyses and gene amplification of merozoite surface proteins (MSP-1, MSP-2), Ca1, TA-87, and TA-99 polymorphisms to distinguish recrudescence from new infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A subject was classified as a true failure if the sample was recrudescent with all five genotypic markers (i.e., all five markers matched those found at baseline screening). Cases of post-treatment mixed infection that contained parasites genotypically identical to those from Day 0 were counted as recrudescent. Change of profile in any or all loci was counted as re-infection. Although the study was open-label, the study team was blinded to the emerging cumulative data reviewed by the independent external EDMC.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Because Cohort 1 was only a small screening cohort, although data were analysed, no formal statistical inference was made. Three study populations were defined: 1) all treated subjects (for safety analyses); 2) modified intent-to-treat (MITT), defined as a subset of subjects in the all-treated subjects population who met the specified disease criteria at baseline; and, 3) the per-protocol (PP) population, defined as a subset of subjects in the MITT population who received all three days of assigned study medication.</p><p>External quality checks were conducted for on-site microscopists. At Ivory Coast, all three microscopists failed the parasite-count evaluation; therefore, data (nine subjects) from Ivory Coast were excluded from all ACPR analyses for both the MITT and PP populations, but included in sensitivity analysis for the MITT population.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with PCR-corrected ACPR at the Day 28 evaluation. Two datasets were analysed for efficacy: the MITT and PP populations (excluding data from Ivory Coast). Cohort 2 was the focus of the efficacy analysis. The primary analysis variable was the time (days) to the first occurrence of treatment failure analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for categorization of treatment failure events). Subjects without a treatment failure event during the study were censored using the Kaplan-Meier method as listed below.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Subjects who withdrew from the study due to any reason other than treatment failure were censored on the day of the last available blood smear measurement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subjects who received an anti-malarial concomitant medication for treatment of a reinfection (in a PCR-corrected analysis) were censored at the visit date if the anti-malarial was given after collection of the blood smear on that day. Otherwise, the subject was censored on the day of the last available blood smear measurement taken prior to the visit. Note that in a PCR-uncorrected analysis, this type of censoring only occurred when a subject was treated at a visit based on symptoms but later found not to have parasitaemia.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The proportion of subjects with ACPR at each planned visit (i.e., Days 7, 14, 21, 28 (primary), 35, 42) was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ACPR proportions (AZCQ &#x02013; AL) was constructed. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower boundary of the CI was greater than or equal to -10 percentage points for both the MITT and PP populations at Day 28 (PCR-corrected).</p><p>A sensitivity analysis was conducted to support the primary efficacy analysis for both the MITT and PP populations. This sensitivity analysis considered subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study due to any reason, without having an event, as treatment failures at the time of withdrawal.</p><p>Secondary study endpoints included ACPR (PCR-corrected and -uncorrected) at Days 7, 14, 21, 28 (uncorrected), 35, and 42 as well as early and late treatment failures (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), time to fever clearance, and gametocyte clearance. The time to fever clearance was analysed in a similar manner to ACPR, with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Clearance was defined as the time (in days) from the start of treatment administration to the first of the two consecutive time points at which fever was no longer present. Absence of gametocytes was defined as clearance of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytaemia (i.e., attainment of two consecutive zero gametocyte counts) without subsequent recurrence through the day of consideration.

No deaths occurred during the study. Four serious AEs (SAEs) were reported. Three SAEs occurred in Cohort 1 (malaria (AZCQ group), sepsis and hepatitis B (one each, AL group)), and one SAE (convulsions, AL group) in Cohort 2. None of these SAEs were considered related to study drug by investigators. Seven Cohort 2 subjects (5.6%) in the AZCQ group withdrew from treatment due to an AE, <italic>versus</italic> one (0.8%) in the AL group. No meaningful differences in laboratory parameters were noted between AZCQ and AL treatment groups (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs in Cohort 2 overall were asymptomatic parasitaemia (coded as infection parasitic), vomiting, malaria, and pyrexia (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The most frequently reported AEs in the AZCQ group were vomiting (30.6%), asymptomatic parasitaemia (29.8%) and malaria (21.0%). Those AEs most frequently reported and considered related to AZCQ treatment were vomiting (27.4%), asymptomatic parasitaemia (10.5%) and pruritus (6.5%). Vomiting was a common reason for discontinuation from dosing in the AZCQ group. Vomiting with AZCQ generally resolved quickly (within the day of onset) and appeared to be related to the AZCQ drug combination rather than an age-specific tolerability issue because it was observed at a higher frequency in both cohorts. The most frequently reported AEs in the AL group were asymptomatic parasitaemia (23.7%), pyrexia (20.6%) and malaria (14.5%), with pyrexia (10.7%), asymptomatic parasitaemia (10.7%) and vomiting (7.6%) considered related to treatment.

Although both treatment groups had a high proportion of subjects achieving ACPR at Day 28 (PCR-corrected), the proportion was lower (i.e. inferior) in the AZCQ group compared with the AL group.</p><p>In the PP population, the efficacy was 93% in AZCQ-treated subjects compared with 99% in the AL-treated subjects at Day 28. Similarly, in the MITT, efficacy was 89% in AZCQ-treated subjects compared with 98% in AL-treated subjects. The conclusions from the sensitivity analyses performed for all ACPR endpoints, including subjects from the Ivory Coast and classifying study discontinuations as failures, were no different from the main study conclusion. The evaluability criteria may explain the small difference in AZCQ efficacy observed between the PP and MITT populations, since subjects in the PP population were required to receive all three days of study medication. This study used the Kaplan-Meier curve/product limit estimator to evaluate the primary endpoint. Use of this limit estimator is recommended by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and has been used in analysing the primary efficacy endpoint in late-stage anti-malarial treatment clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Absence of non-inferiority of AZCQ observed in this study was an unexpected outcome because there is evidence of effectiveness of AZ in combination with CQ and other agents for treatment of malaria. In two randomized, comparative studies in African adults with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria, treatment with AZ 1,000&#x000a0;mg and CQ 600&#x000a0;mg resulted in Day 28 PCR-corrected parasitologic clearance rates of 98% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In one study, AZ in combination with artesunate was compared with AL in a population that included children (&#x02265;eight years of age) and adults with uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although the 42-day cure rate was numerically lower (94.6%) for AZ-artesunate than for AL (97%), the difference was not statistically significant and at a level that was therapeutically beneficial. This study was not powered for equivalence. In another study, AZ was combined with artesunate and compared with AL for treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in children six to 59&#x000a0;months of age in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Treatment failures were higher in the AZ-artesunate group, however, the dose of AZ used was lower than in the current study (20&#x000a0;mg/kg <italic>versus</italic> 30&#x000a0;mg/kg). In addition, CQ, alone and in combination with artesunate, AZ, or atovaquone-proguanil, has been used to treat uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in similar-aged children in Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, there were no identified strains of CQ-resistant <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> and the incidence of malaria was similar across the treatment groups.</p><p>In the present study, the serum AZ and plasma CQ concentrations were generally comparable between Cohorts 1 and 2. The large coefficient of variation may limit the ability to draw conclusions from these data. The mean values of AZ, CQ, and desethyl-CQ concentrations at 0&#x000a0;hours on Day 2 (prior to the third dose) and on Day 7 (after the third dose) that were observed in this paediatric study were similar to the concentrations at same PK sampling time points observed in African adults treated with 1,000&#x000a0;mg AZ plus 600&#x000a0;mg CQ once daily for three days. In the African study, the combination of AZ and CQ resulted in an overall efficacy rate of 100% at Day 28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The overall proportion of subjects with AEs was similar across treatment groups within each cohort, although treatment-related AEs were reported more frequently in the AZCQ group in both cohorts. Posthoc analysis of the frequency of AEs in cohort 2 showed that, for most, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups, however, vomiting was more frequent in the AZCQ group and abdominal pain was more frequent in the AL group. Study discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the AZCQ group in Cohort 2. No unexpected safety signals were identified beyond the known AE profile of individually dosed AZ or CQ.</p><p>In this study, efficacy of AZCQ was inferior to AL. Therefore, consideration of future use of AZCQ for IPT or seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis may require additional study to determine whether a combination of AZ with other malaria drug(s) or use of an alternative dosing regimen with higher AZ dosing improves response to treatment with AZCQ in children aged six to 59&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2015_620_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
