Without treatment, vomiting can complicate the pregnancy, so it must be reduced. Wide varieties of treatment have been used for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This study compared the effectiveness of vitamin B6 and dimenhydrinate for gestational nausea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>One hundred and forty pregnant women with a gestational age of &#x0003c;16 weeks who had symptoms of nausea and vomiting were selected. They were randomly allocated into group A (<italic>n</italic> = 70) and group B (<italic>n</italic> = 70). The patients in group A received a vitamin B6 tablet, while the patients in group B received a dimenhydrinate tablet daily; the tablets were identical in appearance. The degree of nausea and vomiting was assessed by physical symptoms of Rhodes score.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred and thirty-five women returned to follow-up. Dimenhydrinate and vitamin B6 significantly reduced nausea and vomiting scores from 8.3 (7.4) to 2.8 (2.0) and from 8.6 (2.9) to 3.8 (2.3), respectively. The mean score change after treatment with dimenhydrinate was greater than with vitamin B6.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Both dimenhydrinate and vitamin B6 were effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Dimenhydrinate was more effective than vitamin B6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dimenhydrinate</kwd><kwd>Iran</kwd><kwd>nausea</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>vitamin B6</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Nausea and vomiting are the common symptoms experienced by women during early pregnancy and affect 50-90% of pregnant women.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Complications of vomiting include fluid and electrolyte disturbances (dehydration), pulmonary aspiration, gastroesophageal mucosal tearing, malnutrition, and rupture of the esophagus.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is still unknown. Therefore, wide varieties of treatment have been used.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>There are a number of medications for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that first-line treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy be started with pyridoxine (vitamin B6).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Pyridoxine (vitamin B6), a water-soluble vitamin and an essential coenzyme in the folate metabolism pathway, was first referenced for use in treating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. The pyridoxine mechanism of affecting nausea is unknown. No teratogenic risks have been associated with the use of pyridoxine, and it belongs to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category A (adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not shown an increased risk of abnormalities to the fetus in any trimester of pregnancy).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A randomized clinical trial (RCT) has found that regular use of pyridoxine is effective in decreasing the severity of nausea, but has no effect on the frequency of vomiting episodes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, Sripramote and Lekhyananda showed that vitamin B6 significantly reduced the degree of nausea and the number of vomiting episodes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Another drug that is used in nausea and vomiting is dimenhydrinate. It is an antihistamine and anticholinergic that acts in the brain to decrease nausea and vomiting. Dimenhydrinate belongs to FDA Pregnancy Category B (animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of dimenhydrinate in the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy has been evaluated in many RCTs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In Thailand, most pregnant women who had nausea and vomiting in the first trimester were given treatment with dimenhydrinate.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Thus, considering the above-mentioned points, and the importance of treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, the safety of dimenhydrinate and vitamin B6, and a more effective administration of these drugs, the present study was conducted with an aim to compare the effectiveness of 50 mg of dimenhydrinate daily and the recommended dose of 50 mg of vitamin B6 daily to treat nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial performed at two antenatal clinics of the referral hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, southern Iran. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using data from a pilot study of 20 cases treated with vitamin B6 and dimenhydrinate. Researchers calculated that if the score change of 30% was clinically important, a sample size of 63 subjects per group would be able to detect this difference with probability of two-tailed type I error of 5% and type II error of 20%. To allow for a 10% dropout rate, a sample size of a total of 70 subjects per group was calculated.</p><p>The target population was pregnant women at or before 16 weeks of gestation who had nausea with or without vomiting and required treatment. Subjects were excluded if they: (1) were hospitalized for severe vomiting; (2) had taken other medications in the past week that might aggravate or alleviate nausea and vomiting, such as iron tablets or antiemetic; (3) were unable to take the medication as prescribed; (4) had other medical disorders such as hepatitis or gastrointestinal diseases that might manifest with nausea and vomiting; (5) were unable to return for 1-week follow-up; and (6) refused to participate in the trial.</p><p>All patients gave written informed consent before enrolling in the trial. They underwent a physical examination and routine obstetrics evaluation. Ultrasonography was performed for evaluating gestational age and fetal heart motion. Then, the 140 participating women in this trial were randomly assigned into two groups: 70 women received a 50 mg tablet of vitamin 6 (group A) and the other 70 received a 50 mg dimenhydrinate tablet (group B) orally every morning for 1 week. Both tablets were identical in size, color, and odor. They were asked to return in 1 week and give back the tablet envelope and the record forms. The women who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the trial.</p><p>Researchers recommended the patients to swallow the tablets. The pregnant women were requested to record their symptoms at first enrollment (24 h before treatment) for the baseline score, and then at noon of each day of treatment. Patients were requested to return on the day after completing their medication to assess their responses to treatment.</p><p>The primary outcome was the change in nausea and vomiting scores (mean of post-treatment scores minus baseline scores). Nausea and vomiting scores were assessed by three physical symptoms (episodes of nausea, duration of nausea, and numbers of vomits) by Rhodes Index. The Index of Nausea and Vomiting (INV), developed by Rhodes <italic>et al</italic>., measures three dimensions of upper gastrointestinal distress [nausea, vomiting, and retching (NVR)]. The revised version of this index (INV2) has been tested with a variety of high-risk populations and found to be a valid measurement tool.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the drug side effects (such as drowsiness or dizziness) were the secondary outcome.</p><p>Data were analyzed by SPSS for Windows (version 14.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The differences of quantitative data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
