of biofilm by mechanical methods, bringing the need of a coadjutant in the control
of inflammation and oral health improvement. </p></sec><sec><title>Objective:</title><p> The aim of this prospective split-mouth blind study was to analyze the effect of
a 40% chlorhexidine (CHX) varnish on gingival growth of patients with orthodontic
fixed appliances. Methods: Healthy teenage patients with fixed orthodontic
appliances and increased gingival volume were recruited (n = 30). Each individual
was his own control, having in the maxilla one control side and one treatment
side. An application of varnishes occurred on the vestibular area of the upper
premolars and first molar crowns, on the control side (placebo varnish) and on the
experimental side (EC40<sup>(r)</sup> Biodentic CHX varnish). The varnishes and
sides were randomly chosen and its identification and group was kept by a third
party observer and it was not revealed to the researchers and participants until
the end of study. In order to establish a baseline registration, digital
photographs were taken by a trained photographer before varnish application at
baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), as well as 14 days (T<sub>14</sub>) and 56 days
(T<sub>56</sub>) after the application. The gingival volume was calculated
indirectly using the vestibular areas (mm<sup>2</sup>) of the upper second
premolars' clinical crowns by RapidSketch<sup>(r)</sup> software, at all study
times. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Turkey-Krammer test. </p></sec><sec><title>Results: </title><p>It was observed, in the final sample of 30 individuals, that at T<sub>0</sub>, the
control and treatment groups were similar. At T<sub>14</sub> and T<sub>56</sub>, a
progressive reduction of the clinical crown area was seen in the control group,
and an increase in the average area was detected in the experimental group
(<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0,05). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p> The use of 40% CHX varnish decreases the gingival overgrowth in patients
undergoing orthodontic treatment. Further studies are necessary to set the action

buildup, as well as increased stimulated salivary flow and inflammatory reaction of
gingival tissues.<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Plaque increases around bands, orthodontic
adhesives and brackets; the composition of the oral flora changes; and cleaning becomes
more difficult for the patient.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Brackets, bands
and other accessories hinder cleaning, which can cause enamel demineralization, dental
cavities and gingival swelling.<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The appearance
of carious lesions during orthodontic treatment can be explained mainly by inadequate
plaque control due to fixed appliances use.<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>Orthodontic patients need to implement an oral hygiene preventive program and pay closer
attention to oral hygiene<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> which is particularly difficult to maintain
when bands, wires and other accessories are present. In this sense, the effective
control of dental plaque by mechanical methods suffer some limitations in fixed
orthodontic appliances patients.<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>With the implementation and application of oral health preventive programs for patients
wearing fixed appliances, patients should be motivated in order to improve their oral
health and, under clinical supervision, be more successful in eliminating plaque and
inflammatory symptoms.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>Thus, the important role of chemical agents used to improve oral health should be
considered. The use of these substances (mouthrinses or dentifrices) might help reduce
biofilm buildup on soft tissue surfaces in the oral cavity, potentially delaying plaque
accumulation over teeth. However, antimicrobial agents, such as essential oil
mouthrinses and dentifrices containing triclosan/copolymer, might affect the subgingival
microbiota by disrupting contiguous supragingival plaque. Similarly, the use of a
dentifrice containing triclosan/copolymer might prevent the progression of attachment
loss in adolescents with a high risk of developing early periodontitis and might prevent
further loss of attachment in patients with a history of periodontitis, particularly in
the absence of a supportive periodontal therapy that includes subgingival
debridement.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p><p>The use of chlorhexidine (CHX) as an agent that prevents caries and gingival disease is
common. The mechanism of action of chlorhexidine against microorganisms is explained by
the cationic ligation to the negatively charged cell walls, which destabilizes osmotic
balance, causing precipitation or coagulation of the cytoplasmic content that kills the
cells. CHX is considered the gold standard of antimicrobial mouthrinses in
Dentistry.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>CHX use has several advantages, such as its anti-bacterial spectrum that covers
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and yeasts to a lesser extent. Also, its
substantivity, the ability of an agent to be retained in particular surroundings, is due
to its ability to bind to carboxyl groups of the mucin that covers the oral mucus and to
be steadily released from these areas in an active form, displaced by the calcium ions
segregated by salivary glands. The use of CHX also has disadvantages because it is not a
virucide, nor it is effective against acid-alcohol resistant bacilli. Furthermore, its
taste is unpleasant and staining of teeth occurs when used in the form of mouthwashes in
the long term.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>The vehicles most often used to administer CHX are mouthrinses (at concentrations of
0.12% and 0.2%), aerosols (0.12% and 0.2%), gels (0.12% and 1%) and varnishes.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>Varnishes have been developed over the past decade. They are the most effective form of
CHX professional application, as they are easy to apply, do not require patients to
cooperate, and although they have an unpleasant flavor, they do not cause
discoloration.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Initially, CHX varnish was
tested for the prevention of caries in high-risk populations and was implemented as a
treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
Currently, three CHX varnishes are manufactured: Clorzoin<sup>(r)</sup>,
EC40<sup>(r)</sup> and Cervitec<sup>(r)</sup>. Chlorhexidine composition and
concentration of EC40<sup>(r)</sup> varnish are 40% chlorhexidine, 36% sandarac and 24%
ethanol. Indeed, numerous applications of EC40<sup>(r)</sup> on the tooth surface create
a reservoir of CHX, thereby suppressing microorganisms of supragingival plaque, and,
thus, lowering their pathogenic potential.</p><p>The use of varnish avoids the undesirable effects of CHX, such as altered taste,
extrinsic staining of the enamel and the need for patient's cooperation. Low bacterial
activity, maintenance of oral flora balance, excellent absorption by the enamel surface
and good tolerance by patients are expected.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>Therefore, treatment strategies using chlorhexidine varnish to prevent early microbial
recolonization ultimately ensure the best chance for clinical improvements.
EC40<sup>(r)</sup> is notably a highly concentrated, easy-to-use CHX varnish which
can be injected into the periodontal pocket. To date, this varnish has been mainly
tested for the prevention of caries in high-risk populations.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>The hypothesis that CHX would have beneficial effects for orthodontic patients was
raised because of the need for adjuvant therapies for these patients, as well as because
of the proven effects of this varnish in improving cases of chronic gingivitis, plaque
buildup and bleeding levels.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p><p>In this study, we assessed the effect of a 40% CHX varnish on gingival growth of
patients undergoing orthodontic treatment, analyzed by a computerized area evaluation of
teeth crowns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was previously approved by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais Institutional
Review Board (protocol #114/8). A total of 30 participants (14 males and 16 females)
aged between 12 and 17 years old who had been assisted at the Department of Orthodontics
of the same university were included in the study after they were informed, along with
their legal guardians, of the research purpose. They also signed an informed consent
form. The number of participants was defined by convenience sample.</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were applied: patients wearing orthodontic fixed
appliances over six months and presenting gingival overgrowth Grade 2<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in maxillary premolars and molars, as
diagnosed by a previously trained examiner (Kappa = 0.92).</p><p>Subjects who had any of the following factors, which could influence gingival growth,
were excluded: antibiotic therapy for the past three months or during the study period;
use of anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers, or other medication
that causes gingival swelling; pregnant and lactating women; signs of candidiasis;
previous use of chlorhexidine as toothpaste or mouthwash for at least 30 days; report of
allergic reactions to any component of the varnish; smokers; and patients who had
undergone periodontal surgery or extraction of adjacent studied teeth in the past four
months.</p><p>Oral and written guidelines of adequate oral hygiene with modified Bass brushing
technique and flossing were given after the placement of fixed orthodontic appliances.
All appliances placed on patients were made of the same material from the same brand.
Research subjects were requested to follow the same oral hygiene standard before and
during the experiment. The CHX varnish used was EC40<sup>(r)</sup> varnish (Biodent,
Arnhem, Netherlands) which consists of 40% CHX, 36% sandarac and 24% ethanol; whereas
the placebo varnish contained 60% sandarac and 40% ethanol (F&#x000f3;rmula &#x00026; A&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o, S&#x000e3;o
Paulo, Brazil). Varnish was applied only once on the buccal surface of maxillary
premolars and first molar crowns on the right and left sides. One side was randomly
selected as control and received placebo varnish, while the other side, the experimental
one, received 40% CHX varnish. The key that identified the varnishes and which group
they belonged to was kept by a third party and was not revealed to the researchers until
the study was over.</p><p>The application procedure was performed by the same dentist using dental equipment and
following the manufacturer's instructions. At first, the teeth were cleaned with a
toothbrush for 2-3 minutes, then, they were isolated from saliva with cotton rolls and
dried with compressed air. Subsequently, a thin coat of varnish was applied on the
buccal surface of teeth around orthodontic brackets and along the gingival margin using
a cartridge syringe fitted with a blunt needle. Excess varnish was removed after seven
minutes. Participants were instructed not to eat or drink for three hours and not to
clean their teeth until the following day. Patients were not informed which varnished
was used on each maxillary side.</p><p>A trained photographer used a digital camera (Canon Rebel) with 100 mm macro ring flash
to take intraoral photographs of the right and left sides of the patient before varnish
application (T<sub>0</sub>), 14 days after application (T<sub>14</sub>), and 56 days
after application (T<sub>56</sub>). All photographs were taken by the same photographer,
standardizing the position of the occlusal plane parallel to the floor and the premolar
region with equivalent angulation (90 degrees).</p><p>By means of Rapid Sketch<sup>(r)</sup> software v. 2.4 (Utilant, Buffalo, NY, USA), the
digital photographs were analyzed and the buccal areas (mm<sup>2</sup>) of second
premolars clinical crowns were measured using the software tools that allow the surface
of interest to be determined and calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig

by Rodrigues et al.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20 </xref>This procedure was
performed for all photographs at all study times (T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>14</sub> and

CHX varnish (EC40<sup>(r)</sup> Biodentic) on the gingival growth of orthodontic
patients. The split-mouth design is considered an adequate study design that has been
used in different clinical areas.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> For its application, more than one site must
be affected by disease in the mouth, therefore, in this study, only patients with both
left and right maxillary affected sides were chosen. In addition, the similarity between
control and treatment groups at T<sub>0</sub>shows that both groups were homogeneous at
the beginning of the study and each subject adequately worked as its own control.</p><p>Based on the properties of the available substances and the clinically proven results,
CHX, in comparison to other products, is considered the gold standard in inhibiting
plaque formation and gingival overgrowth.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
However, there are some side effects that result from its continuous use as a mouthwash
and toothpaste. Potential adverse side effects most common during CHX treatment are as
follows: temporary palate disorders, tooth staining, or unpleasant taste;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>but these disadvantages were controlled in the
present study by using CHX in the dosage form of varnish.</p><p>In this study, the proposed method allows gingival alterations to be measured by
modification of the clinical crown area of teeth. By means of computerized analysis,
which has been previously reported, a numeric area variation was provided, enabling
quantitative assessment and a more accurate statistical analysis.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Area measurement by means of computerized image analysis of
digital photographs has been studied and proven to be effective.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, photographs should be well-taken to avoid focus and
angle errors by the operator. Thus, a well-trained photographer is necessary for
standardization of photographs.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p><p>A progressive increase was observed in the clinical crown area of second premolars 14
and 56 days after application of 40% chlorhexidine varnish. These results demonstrate
the effects of CHX varnish that acts against microorganisms responsible for gingival
overgrowth.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>Moreover, this antimicrobial
agent provides an additional feature, in particular, its sustained-release and
substantivity property, which decreases the level of microorganisms in patients with

<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> which can explain the positive results
observed on patients under treatment even 56 days after (T<sub>56</sub>) CHX
application. Microorganism control must be performed as periodontal complications arise
during adolescent orthodontic therapy, and gingival inflammation is associated with the
presence of periodontal pathogens, both supragingivally and subgingivally.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p><p>Conversely, in the control group, there was no significant increase in gingival volume
during the period of two weeks (T<sub>14</sub>), probably because crown polishing was
performed before CHX application (T<sub>0</sub>). However, after 56 days
(T<sub>56</sub>), the gingival inflammatory process could be demonstrated by
statistically significant increase in gingival volume.</p><p>Since CHX varnish proved positive as adjunct during orthodontic treatment, it is
necessary to quantify application time and frequency. It is also important to determine
the ability of 40% CHX varnish to maintain reduced gingival hyperplasia by means of
long-term longitudinal studies, since a progressive reduction in gingival growth could
be observed along the 56 days of the study. Further studies are needed using larger
sample sizes, as well as researches assessing the effect of CHX varnishes in combination
with mechanical plaque control, since these are the limitations of the research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The use of 40% CHX varnish promoted a progressive increase in clinical crown area at 14
and 56 days after application. CHX varnish proved effective against gingival overgrowth
in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Further studies are necessary to set the
action time and frequency of application of the substance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn02" fn-type="other"><p>&#x000bb; Patients displayed in this article previously approved the use of their facial and
