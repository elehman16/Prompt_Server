<bold><italic>Objective: </italic></bold>To evaluate the effectiveness of topical Bevacizumab in preventing neovascularisation on high risk corneal grafts.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methodology: </italic></bold>This study was a randomized, controlled, parallel group study, carried out from February 2008 to April 2012 (51 months) at Isra Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology and Yasin eye hospital, Karachi. Eyes with high risk corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularization were included in this interventional study/randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups. Group A and Group B. After penetrating keratoplasty, group A patients received topical bevacizumab (2.5%, 25 mg/ml) which was self-administered 4 times a day for 24 week while group B patients received only sham eye drops. Group B was the control group. Corneal neovascular invasion area i.e. the fraction of area on transplanted cornea in which vessels were present was measured using mathematical software program MatLab. Data analyses was done using SPSS version 19. Frequencies of age gender and groups were measured. Neovascular invasion area and change in visual acuity was compared between the 2 groups using <italic>paired t test</italic><italic>. </italic><italic>P value of less than</italic> 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results: </italic></bold>Among the 2 groups mean Corneal neo vascular invasion area was minimum in group A (6.23%) while in group B it was (26.7%). Maximum number of patients (26) attained visual acuity of 6/36 or better in the topical bevacizumab group compared to 17 sham group.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion: </italic></bold>When topical Bevacizumab is used, it reduces the recurrence of neovascularisation and thus helps increasing the frequency of graft survival in cases of high risk corneal transplants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Corneal neovascularization</kwd><kwd>Topical</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Corneal graft failure is one of the most common causes of performing keratoplasty again.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> When vessels are present on the cornea then chances of graft rejection are very high, and it is considered as a high risk corneal graft surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> This high rate of corneal graft failure in cases of vascularized corneas is because after corneal graft these patient can still develop severe immune reaction against the graft and even immunosuppressive therapy cannot help much in the graft survival in such cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></p><p>Many investigations have been carried out to modulate this immune reaction in order to improve keratoplasty results, including prevention of further angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Many molecular factors have been identified in different studies, that can be important elements in angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> One of the factors identified related to neovascularization is Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> Many VEGF inhibitors have been identified and are used for many retinal disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> one of such VEGEF inhibitor is Bevacizumab.</p><p>Considering the effectiveness of Bevacizumab as an anti VEGF, it has been investigated as a possible treatment option for neovascularization on cornea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> One study carried out on animals, showed that, when bevacizumab was injected systemically in animals having vascularized corneas before doing keratoplasty, it resulted in improved survival of corneal graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> After these studies it can be assumed that bevacizumab when used either topically or subconunctivally might result in increasing the survival of the corneal graft after keratoplastyby inhibiting the vascularization on the grafted cornea. Considering these facts, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of bevacizubamin reducing the neovascularization thus resulting in better prognosis after high risk. We used a quantitave method of assessing the corneal neovascularization on grafted cornea after keratoplasty by measuring the invasion area of neovessels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODOLOGY</title><p>This study was an interventional/randomized, controlled, parallel group study which was carried out from February 2008 to April 2012 (51 months) at Isra Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology and Yasin eye hospital, Karachi. Patients were recruited according to inclusion criteria for the study from February 2008 to September 2011; all the patients were followed up for 6 months after the procedure. Eyes with high risk corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularization were included in this randomized clinical trial using probability purposive sampling. Sample size was not calculated but was dependent on the incident of the patients appearing in the hospital with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ethical approval was taken from the ethical committee of Isra Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology. Informed written consent was taken from every patient included in the study. Indications for PKP were: vascularized leucomas after herpetic keratitis, traumatic keratitis or chemical burn, advanced pseudophakic bullous keratopathy with superficial and deep corneal vascularization, severe infection in hereditary corneal dystrophy, and failed corneal grafts. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups. Group A and Group B. After penetrating keratoplasty, group A patients received topical bevacizumab (2.5%, 25 mg/ml) which was self-administered 4 times a day for 24 week while group B patients received only sham eye drops. Group B was the control group. Neither subjects nor investigators were masked, but those who tested visual acuity, optometrists and statistical analysers were masked as regards treatment assignment of the eyes. Before undergoing procedure baseline data was recorded in a proforma. Follow-up period was 2 to 8&#x000a0;months (mean 7.1&#x000a0;months). In order to reduce effect modifiers, during this period all the patients were exposed to similar topical and systemic medications such as systemic steroids and topical steroids according to the weight adjustments. Patients were asked to follow up every 4 weeks from the first postoperative day. On every follow up digital corneal photograph was taken along with the visual acuity. Patients not keeping up with follow ups were excluded from the study in order to exclude the possible confounding variables.</p><p>The primary outcome variable was corneal neovascular invasion area while secondary variable was change in visual acuity. In order to do the assessment of neovessels on the grafted cornea, a quantitave method is used. We first took the photograph of the corneas after keratoplasty and then we processed these photographs using different software such as Photoshop and MatLab. By using these software we identified the neovessels on the grafted corneas and measured the area covered by the neovessels on the grafted corneal. This neovascularised area is calculated as percentage of grafted cornea covered by neoveseles. Data analyses were done using SPSS version 19. Frequencies of age gender and groups were measured. Primary variable, neovascular invasion area, was compared between the 3 groups using paired t test. While secondary variable, change in visual acuity, was also compared between the groups using paired t test. P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Eighty one Patients were included in the study, of them 40 were in the group A (topical bevacizumab), 41 in Group B (sham) Out of these 81 patients, 62 (76.5%) were males while 19 (23.5%) were females.
