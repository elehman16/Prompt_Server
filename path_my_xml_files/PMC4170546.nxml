Toothpastes are recognized as the best source of fluoride, which most effectively protects both deciduous and permanent teeth from caries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Fluoride dentifrices have been accepted for their effectiveness in caries prevention and are the most cost-effective means for the control of dental caries. The frequently used concentration of fluoride in toothpaste is 1000-1100 ppm. Fluoride concentration in the whole saliva has been related to the efficiency of caries prevention. The fluoride concentration in saliva and dental caries have been reported to be inversely related.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The effectiveness of fluoride oral hygiene products can be evaluated with morphological methods. The reaction of enamel concerning surface microhardness in caries-like demineralized enamel depends upon the fluoride ion concentration and increases with increasing fluoride concentration of the applied sodium fluoride gel. Therefore, the effectiveness of fluoride oral hygiene products depends upon the fluoride ion concentration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Salivary fluoride kinetics depends upon different factors: Flow rates, age, stimulation effects, properties of fluoride-containing products, volume and application time of these products, vehicle of fluoride, and individual characteristics of saliva. The interaction between these factors affects the process of fluoride clearance from the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Recent concerns over the positive association between fluorosis and toothpaste ingestion by young children have resulted in recommendations from a number of healthcare workers to use pea-sized amount of toothpaste, thus reducing the amount of toothpaste that may potentially be ingested.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In toothpastes, ionically bound fluoride (sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, amine fluoride, and covalently bound fluoride) is used. The different forms of fluoride differ in the mechanisms by which they protect against caries. It is thought that monofluorophosphate exchanges with orthophosphate in the enamel and afterward an intracrystalline transposition of F<sup>&#x000af;</sup> and OH<sup>&#x000af;</sup> takes place, whereby fluorapatite is formed. Therefore, the caries-protective effect is limited by the number of the reactive molecules in the crystal lattice. According to another reaction channel, the monofluorophosphate molecule is hydrolyzed by phosphatases from the oral bacterial flora and saliva. The fluoride, which is released, reacts with dental hard tissue like ionic calcium compounds. Ionically bound fluoride is deposited primarily as a CaF<sub>2</sub> layer on the dental hard tissue during brushing. With time, this reservoir is used up and the fluoride concentration of the enamel and saliva increases.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The caries-preventive benefits of fluoride are generally accepted by dental researchers and practicing professionals worldwide. The formulation of a fluoride toothpaste and biological (salivary flow rate) and behavioral factors (brushing frequency, brushing time, post-brushing rinsing practices, timing of brushing, and amount of toothpaste applied) can influence the anticaries efficacy.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Fluoride dentifrices are well accepted for their effectiveness in caries prevention. Concerns over the risk of fluorosis in children due to ingestion of fluoride in toothpaste have led to the introduction of toothpaste with low fluoride concentration. Due to the risk of fluorosis, it was recommended that children use toothpastes with a fluoride concentration of 500&#x02013;550 ppm. Fluoride will likely remain the cornerstone of caries control for the foreseeable future because of its proven effectiveness and safety. However, there remains the need to determine the most effective method of fluoride utilization in children and adults who remain caries-active. No such study has been conducted in Mathura earlier.</p><p>Objectives of the present study were as follows:</p><p>

The study conducted by Duckworth and Morgan,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] has shown that the rinsing procedure, as determined by the type of solution and the amount and duration of the rinse, affects the oral fluoride retention. In the present study, toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpastes resulted in increased salivary concentrations of fluoride, which had an anticariogenic effect. The results were in accordance with the study conducted by Campus <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] wherein the fluoride concentration in saliva could be maintained to an optimal therapeutic level with the regular use of fluoridated products.</p><p>Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that reducing the fluoride concentration of the dentifrice to reduce the risk of fluorosis is appropriate for very young children. However, when the child is able to expectorate properly, benefits of higher concentration of fluoride which increases the salivary fluoride level significantly may overweigh the risk of fluorosis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maldupa</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Brinkmane</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rendeniece</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Mihailova</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence based toothpaste classification, according to certain characteristics of their chemical composition</article-title><source>Stomatologija</source><year>2012</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>12</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22617330</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>&#x0201c;Salivary Fluoride Level Concentration&#x0201d; ADA.
