A total of 2,600 people with social care needs participated in a trial of community-based telecare in three English local authority areas. In the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telecare Questionnaire Study, 550 participants were randomised to intervention and 639 to control. Participants who were offered the telecare intervention received a package of equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, additional to their standard health and social care services.

Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY gained was only 16%. Sensitivity analyses combining variations in equipment price and support cost parameters yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of &#x000a3;161,000 per QALY.</p><p><bold>Implications:</bold> while QALY gain in the intervention group was similar to that for controls, social and health services costs were higher.

Telecare has been advocated as a means to generate cost savings, and maintain or improve the quality of service for people with social care needs [<xref rid="AFU067C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, evidence on the impact of assistive technologies to support independent living, such as &#x02018;telecare&#x02019; and telehealth, is sparse; data are especially limited on cost-effectiveness.</p><p>We examined whether &#x02018;second-generation&#x02019; telecare [<xref rid="AFU067C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in addition to standard support and care that could include &#x02018;first-generation&#x02019; forms of telecare is cost-effective compared with standard support and care that could include &#x02018;first-generation&#x02019; forms of telecare, under the Whole Systems Demonstrator (WSD) programme [<xref rid="AFU067C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afu067_s2"><title>Design and methods</title><p>The study design was a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial, examining the effectiveness of telecare for individuals with social care needs, and also their carers [<xref rid="AFU067C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], when delivered in the context of routine health and social care practice [<xref rid="AFU067C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Participants were asked to report service use in the 3 months prior to each assessment. At 12-month follow-up, participants not returning questionnaires were contacted to arrange an interview (52% of questionnaires returned were completed by interview). We focus here on costs and outcomes collected for the questionnaire study at 12-month compared with baseline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online file 2</ext-link> for 4-month follow-up statistics).</p><sec id="afu067_s2a"><title>Telecare intervention and equipment</title><p>Telecare was defined in the trial as the &#x02018;remote, automatic and passive monitoring of changes in an individual's condition or lifestyle (including emergencies) in order to manage the risks of independent living&#x02019; [<xref rid="AFU067C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Telecare equipment used in the trial can be mapped to four broad functions: monitoring functional status (e.g. pendant, chair occupancy sensors), home security (bogus caller buttons, property exit sensors) and home environment (heat sensors, flood detectors), and facilitating the telecare package through &#x02018;stand-alone&#x02019; devices that do not send alerts to the monitoring centre (big button telephones, key safes) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online file 3</ext-link>).

Most unit costs (in 2009&#x02013;10 prices) were nationally applicable and taken from published sources [<xref rid="AFU067C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="AFU067C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, Table A4.1</ext-link>). Costs calculated for these 3-month periods were multiplied by 4 to estimate costs in the pre-baseline year and in the year of the intervention period for use in the cost-effectiveness analyses. We also calculated the cost of a package of telecare equipment and support (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, file 3</ext-link>). Analyses took a health and social services perspective: we included costs incurred by the National Health Service (NHS) or local authorities.

QALYs were constructed, calculating utility scores from the EQ-5D, using societal weights [<xref rid="AFU067C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and taking the &#x02018;area under the curve&#x02019;, with linear interpolation between baseline and 12-month assessment scores. Secondary outcomes were: perceived physical and mental health status, psychological well-being and state-trait anxiety (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, file 5</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="afu067_s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We examined relationships between costs and consequences of telecare by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB) of the intervention. The ICER represents the difference in mean costs between intervention and control groups (&#x00394;C) divided by the difference in mean outcome scores (&#x00394;E). The intervention is seen as cost-effective if the ICER is less than some maximum amount (&#x003bb;) that the payer is willing to pay (WTP) for a gain in outcome, a decision rule that can be expressed as &#x00394;C/&#x00394;E &#x0003c; &#x003bb;. It follows that for the intervention to be cost-effective, &#x003bb; &#x000d7; &#x00394;E &#x02212; &#x00394;C &#x0003e; 0, or put another way, that the NMB (given by &#x003bb; &#x000d7; &#x00394;E &#x02212; &#x00394;C) exceeds zero [<xref rid="AFU067C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NMB represents the pecuniary value of extra gains in outcome associated with the intervention, for a given WTP (&#x003bb;), net of the extra cost of the intervention [<xref rid="AFU067C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We explored the probability that telecare is cost-effective over a series of values of &#x003bb;, from &#x000a3;0 to &#x000a3;90,000, encompassing the range of &#x000a3;20,000 to &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY considered by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for recommending use of technologies in the NHS [<xref rid="AFU067C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Results were used to plot cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).</p><p>We fitted seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models of costs and outcomes by maximum likelihood estimation, using the user-written mysureg command [<xref rid="AFU067C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in Stata 12 [<xref rid="AFU067C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. SUR is a system of equations, allowing any correlation between the error terms of the cost and outcome equations to be captured in the estimation [<xref rid="AFU067C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Covariates used in these analyses were baseline costs, baseline utility [<xref rid="AFU067C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], site, age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) 2007 quintiles [<xref rid="AFU067C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a one-person household indicator, a count of chronic conditions [<xref rid="AFU067C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], dependency (baseline EQ5-D self-care domain score) and whether the participant had a &#x02018;personal/community alarm&#x02019; at baseline. Cluster-robust standard errors were used in estimating regression coefficients (observations were clustered by general practice). The difference between groups identified by the coefficient on the intervention variable in each equation was used to calculate the ICER and the NMB.</p></sec><sec id="afu067_s2e"><title>Missing data</title><p>Imputation of costs missing at the cost category level and of outcome data at the scale level was carried out using the MCMC multiple imputation package in SPSS v.19 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afu067/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online, file 6</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="afu067_s3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 2,600 participants in the trial (1,276 randomised to telecare and 1,324 to usual care), from 217 general practices: 1,189 participated in the questionnaire study (550 telecare and 639 usual care) [<xref rid="AFU067C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Some resource use data were not available (e.g. numbers of alerts, types of call-centre responses to participants); numbers of dedicated response visits were not available at the individual level. The proportion of trial participants opting into the questionnaire study differed somewhat between groups (48.3% in telecare and 43.1% in usual care) [<xref rid="AFU067C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and numbers in the control group were 16% greater than numbers in the intervention group, raising the possibility of post-randomisation self-selection, a particular threat to cluster-randomised trials; 40% of the control group, and 32% of the intervention group were lost to the 12-month follow-up; these differential attrition rates could have led to a bias in favour of the intervention group. However, baseline characteristics did not differ substantially between available cases at baseline and follow-up within groups. Analyses adjusted for confounders that may have influenced drop-out, and so compensated to some extent for imbalances at follow-up. It remains possible that characteristics not assessed may have created between-group differences at baseline or follow-up, or between completers and non-completers.</p><p>Practices of assessing need for telecare were not standardised, with implications for external validity. Telecare services outside the sites may not assess need for telecare in the same way as inside the sites. The very large size of the trial population meant that it would have been impractical to collect and analyse detailed (and largely qualitative) information on variations in assessment practices; by the same token it is likely that within the trial there was a range of assessment models, some of which will have existed outside the sites as well.</p><p>Drop-out from the trial into care homes or because of death prior to 12-month follow-up was not considered within these analyses. Costs of health and social care services over the period of the study were estimated by multiplying costs for the 3-month period prior to the 12-month follow-up by four, assuming that across all categories of service use, costs were relatively constant over the year. Other WSD-funded research draws on longitudinal administrative data to examine 12-month mortality, entry into long-term residential or nursing care and costs of a more restricted range of health and social services for trial participants [<xref rid="AFU067C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mortality rates in that study were similar in both groups (8.9% usual care versus 8.7% telecare), as were rates of permanent admission to care homes (3.2% usual care versus 3.1% telecare).</p><p>The assumed impacts of telecare systems require further consideration. To define the impact of telecare in general poses a challenge when the design of systems to support telecare is variable and the technology itself is evolving. The scope of the technology in this evaluation encompassed remote, automatic and passive monitoring systems that go beyond older and more basic forms of telecare focused on summoning assistance (which could form part of standard support and care). The reassurance provided by telecare systems has been said to improve quality of life for users [<xref rid="AFU067C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="AFU067C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="AFU067C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We chose to use the EQ-5D as it is a generic measure of health-related quality of life that is useful as a basis for comparing alternative technologies [<xref rid="AFU067C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and is suitable for use with older populations (cf. [<xref rid="AFU067C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="AFU067C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). The dimensions of health covered by EQ-5D (self-care, anxiety/depression, usual activities, pain/discomfort, mobility) are relevant to the expected benefits of telecare. However, while the instrument is sensitive to change in situations where changes in health are expected to be substantial [<xref rid="AFU067C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this may not be the case with telecare. EQ-5D may not be able to capture entirely the improvements brought by telecare. This is because it focuses on the individual's health and restoration of function rather than achievement of benefit through the more compensatory mechanisms provided by much of social care [<xref rid="AFU067C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (telecare could be classified as one such service). Benefits may accrue primarily to families and carers of telecare users rather than telecare users themselves (although there is little evidence on impact on quality of life, telecare may reduce carer strain [<xref rid="AFU067C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Any potential beneficial effects on carers that may have resulted from the introduction of the telecare intervention have been excluded from the current analysis. Benefits may particularly accrue to telecare users with certain characteristics. Willingness to use telecare and related assistive technologies may be influenced by concerns about threats to privacy or to identity [<xref rid="AFU067C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Higher costs may be associated with telecare users with particular characteristics; the result of closer monitoring may have prompted <italic>additional</italic> service responses for some people. We plan to explore these issues in quantitative analyses of trial data, in particular, the impact of the technology in carers; qualitative evidence supports important inter-individual differences [cf. <xref rid="AFU067C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="afu067_s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is great policy interest in the potential of telecare to improve quality of life while decreasing use and costs of health and social care support. However, we found that a package of second-generation telecare equipment and associated monitoring service and (in two sites) a dedicated response service did not constitute a cost-effective alternative to usual care, assuming a commonly accepted willingness to pay for QALYs. For the present, given the lack of robust evidence on cost-effectiveness in favour of telecare, policy-makers should avoid characterising this technology as a &#x02018;magic bullet&#x02019; [<xref rid="AFU067C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afu067_s6"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>C.H., M.K. and J.B.
