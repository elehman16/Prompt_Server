Pelvic lymphadenectomy may be performed by open surgery or laparoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The rate of intraoperative complications during and after laparoscopic and open pelvic lymph node dissection is generally low, but has potential long-term consequences such as lower extremity lymph edema, nerve injury, and chronic pain. O&#x02019;Hanian et al., for example, describe an intraoperative complication rate of 7% in a series of 30 patients with pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a series of 257 women with cervical cancer undergoing laparoscopically assisted radical trachelectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, Marchiole et al. describe 11 (4%) intraoperative complications with 5 (2%) of these attributable to lymphadenectomy, i.e. vascular and ureteral injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Xu et al. performed laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomies in 313 patients with cervical cancer, 143 of which also underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy and report 7 (2%) cases of intraoperative complications possibly related to lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Postoperative complications during and after pelvic lymphadenectomy include local abscess, bleeding, lymphocele, and chronic lymphedema of the lower extremities, which has an incidence of 1 to 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The rate of complications does not seem to differ significantly in women undergoing open or laparoscopic lymphadenectomy based on the available literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the present trial, we will focus on pelvic lymphoceles, one of the most common complications of pelvic lymphadenectomy. Simonato et al. described a rate of 19/30 (63%) of sonographically detected lymphoceles in men undergoing pelvic extraperitoneal lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this trial, 4/19 men with lymphoceles were symptomatic and required medical interventions. In women with cervical cancer, asymptomatic lymphoceles detected by ultrasound have been noted in up to 11% of women after pelvic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2% of women, clinical symptoms will require a therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Tachosil&#x000ae; is a fibrin-collagen coated patch and has been licensed in 2004 in Europe for surgical use in humans to support surgical hemostatic interventions. The efficacy and safety of Tachosil&#x000ae; has been demonstrated in liver resection, pulmonary lobectomy, and kidney tumor resection trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In men, but not in women, it has been demonstrated that the application of a collagen-fibrin patch to the lymphadenectomy surgery site may prevent a significant proportion of lymphoceles. In a randomized trial, Simonato et al. found that the pelvic application of two Tachosil&#x000ae; patches to the obturator fossa and the femoral canal was sufficient to significantly reduce the rate of sonographically detected lymphoceles within 4&#x000a0;weeks after surgery from 19/30 to 5/30 cases (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) as well as the mean drainage volume from 190 to 64&#x000a0;ml. Percutaneous puncture of a symptomatic lymphocele was necessary in 1/30 individuals in the intervention group compared to 4/30 individuals in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In women with gynecological malignancies a single center randomized controlled trial has found, that Tachosil&#x000ae; seems effective to reduce the rate of lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. 7/30 (23.3%) women in the treatment group compared to 9/28 (57.7%) women in the control group developed asymptomatic lymphoceles (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in the development of symptomatic lymphoceles or the rate of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This may be attributable to the small sample size of this study. As symptomatic lymphoceles are more relevant for the patient, it seems clinically more important to evaluate the impact of Tachosil&#x000ae; on the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy.</p><p>Symptomatic lymphoceles are defined by the CTCAE 4.03 grading system as lymphoceles grade &#x02265;2. This includes all lymphoceles needing medical intervention. Thus this definition comprises, lymphoceles with the presence of localized pelvic pain, pelvic abscess, fever, and/or leg edema in the presence of a sonographically verified pelvic lymphocele.</p><p>In summary, the data available in the literature demonstrate that pelvic lymphoceles occur in 11 to 63% of individuals undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy. Symptomatic lymphoceles seem to occur in about 32% of patients undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy. Intraoperative application of a collagen-fibrin patch may reduce the number of lymphoceles, mean drainage volume, and the necessity of medical interventions such as percutaneous puncture.</p><p>Therefore, we intend to perform a multi center randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of a collagen-fibrin patch for preventing symptomatic lymphoceles in women undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignancies, ie cervical and endometrial cancer. We hypothesize that, based on the data of Simonato et al. and Tinelli et al., the application of a collagen-fibrin patch (Tachosil&#x000ae;) will reduce the number of symptomatic pelvic lymphoceles by at least 66%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>Primary outcome variable:</p><p>2.1.1.

Within this procedure, as deemed appropriate by the surgeon, women will undergo pelvic lymphadenectomy. The procedure will be performed as follows:The peritoneum will be incised parallel to the iliac vessels. Then, the iliac vessels will be screened for the presence of bulky lymph nodes. If a lymph node debulking is performed, no patch will be applied. In women who undergo routine pelvic lymphadenectomy, lymph node tissue will be removed from the external iliac vessels, the obturator fossa, the interiliac region, and the common iliac region after identification and appropriate preparation of surgical landmarks, ie iliac vessels, femoral canal, chorda, and obturator nerve. At the end of the procedure, hemostasis will be checked. A Tachosil&#x000ae; patch of 4.8x4.8&#x000a0;cm will be attached to the obturator fossa and a Tachosil&#x000ae; patch of 4.8x4.8&#x000a0;cm will be attached to the femoral canal of each side of surgery in the intervention group (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the control group, no Tachosil&#x000ae; patch will be used. No specific drainage of the retroperitoneum will be performed. The study team members Clemens Tempfer, David Cibula, and Alexander Reinthaller, experienced in open and laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection, will perform all surgical procedures. In order to ensure adequate application of the Tachosil&#x000ae; patch by laparoscopy, all surgeons will perform at least two laparoscopic training operations during which they roll the Tachosil&#x000ae; patch around a laparoscopic instrument, move it through a 10&#x000a0;mm trocar into the abdomen, and flatten it out.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

If patients are eligible and agreed to participate, they are included in consecutive order. Patients receive an envelope according to their inclusion number in which allocation is documented. This envelope accompanies the patient into the operating room. A nurse opens the envelope not before pelvic lymphadenectomy and hemostasis have been completely finished. According to the treatment group the patient is allocated, the surgeon now has to apply either two Tachosil&#x000ae; patches in the intervention group or no Tachosil&#x000ae; in the control group. Therefore, the surgeon cannot influence the extent of the lymphadenectomy, as he is not aware of the patient&#x02019;s allocation until the end of the lymphadenectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population consists of 140 women undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical and endometrial cancer in one of the three study sites, ie the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Ruhr University Bochum, the Gynecologic Oncology Center at the Charles University in Prague, and the Medical University of Vienna fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome variables</title><p>2.8.1.

This is a clinical relevant topic as along with lymphedema, symptomatic lymphoceles are the major complication after pelvic lymphadenectomy. Recently, a study in patients with endometrial cancer described a prevalence of 23% for lymphedema after pelvic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Due to the importance of this topic a prospective trial led by the Gynecologic Oncology Group has been released (GOG 244, GOG LEG study, The Lymphedema and Gynecologic Cancer Study).</p><p>In contrast to lymphedema, which is rather a chronic problem after pelvic lymphadenectomy, lymphoceles are more of an acute complication. The prevalence of lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy provided in the literature varies quite substantially between 11-63% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Symptomatic lymphoceles seem to occur in about 32% of patients undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This variation might be caused by numerous factors: the time interval between surgery and follow-up visit for lymphoceles as most of the small lymphoceles will spontaneously regress over time, rather small study populations in the majority of trials, the extent of lymphadenectomy, the use of new energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Another interesting factor possibly influencing the rate of lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy might be the surgical approach. One study revealed a postoperative lymphocele rate of 15.4% and 1.4% in women after laparoscopic and after open pelvic lymphadenectomy, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of note, this study retrospectively compared 138 women, who underwent systematic laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy, to 123 historical control subjects, who underwent systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy via an open approach. Due to the design, this study has to be interpreted with caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study, we aim to prospectively describe the lymphocele rates following open compared to laparoscopic systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy in women with gynecological malignancy.</p><p>The value of Tachosil&#x000ae; in the prevention of lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy in women has already been studied in two clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a retrospective matched case&#x02013;control study, a cohort of 26 patients receiving Tachosil&#x000ae; after laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was compared to a historical cohort of 29 women without Tachosil&#x000ae; after laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The study described a significant difference in the prevalence of total lymphoceles (19.2% of patients in the Tachosil&#x000ae; group vs. 51.7% in the historical control group) and a non-significant difference of symptomatic lymphoceles (7.6% of patients in the Tachosil&#x000ae; group vs. 17.2% in the historical control group). Of note, this was not a prospective trial with a limited number of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The second study was a prospective randomized controlled trial comprising 58 women with endometrial cancer after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without Tachosil&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This trial observed, that Tachosil&#x000ae; seems effective to reduce the rate of lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. 7/30 (23.3%) women in the treatment group compared to 9/28 (57.7%) women in the control group developed asymptomatic lymphoceles (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in the development of symptomatic lymphoceles or the rate of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This may be attributable to the small sample size of this study.</p><p>As symptomatic lymphoceles are more relevant for the patient, it seems clinically more important to evaluate the impact of Tachosil&#x000ae; on the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles after pelvic lymphadenectomy. Therefore, we intend to perform a multi center randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of a collagen-fibrin patch for preventing symptomatic lymphoceles in women undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignancies, ie cervical and endometrial cancer. We hypothesize that based on the data of <italic>Simonato et al.</italic> and <italic>Tinelli et al.</italic>, the application of a collagen-fibrin patch (Tachosil&#x000ae;) will reduce the number of symptomatic pelvic lymphoceles by at least 66%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite being one of the major complications of lymphadenectomy, little is known about the prevention of lymphoceles. One prospective controlled trial comprising 58 women already evaluated the preventative effect of Tachosil&#x000ae; in the prevalence of lymphoceles (5). As this trial was not adequately powered to detect differences between symptomatic lymphoceles, we designed the present open, randomized, controlled trial.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p>Medical doctor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common terminology criteria for adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C</term><def><p>Celsius</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hrs</term><def><p>hours.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CG, DC, AR, and CT were crucially involved in the study design.
