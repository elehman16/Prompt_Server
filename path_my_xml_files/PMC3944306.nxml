for osteoarthritis (OA). We clinically evaluated the effects of local heat treatment and
exercise therapy for knee OA, and evaluated the articular cartilage using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping. [Subjects and Methods] Eighteen females aged 50&#x02013;69
(59.5 &#x000b1; 8.5&#x02005;years, mean &#x000b1; SD) years diagnosed with early-stage knee OA were randomly
assigned using computer-generated random numbers to either a local heat treatment group
(LH group, 9 subjects) or an exercise therapy group (EX group, 9 subjects). These groups
were subjected to a 12-week intervention experiment. MRI T2 mapping was performed for
cartilage imaging and quantitative evaluation. For clinical evaluation, the Japanese Knee
Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were performed. Both
clinical and MRI evaluations were performed at the beginning and end of the intervention
(0 week (Time 0) and 12 weeks). [Results] The total JKOM score had a significantly
decreased in the LH group at 12 weeks. However, in the EX group the total JKOM scores at
Time 0 and 12 weeks were not significantly different. The TUG time in the EX group was
significant shorter at 12 weeks, whereas it showed no significant change in the LH group
at 12 weeks, though the TUG times of 7 of the 9 patients decreased, exhibiting some
improvement. The T2 value of the LH group was significantly shorter at 12 weeks. However,
the T2 value in the EX group showed no significant change at 12 weeks. [Conclusion] After
local heat treatment using heat- and steam moisture-generating sheets for 12 weeks, we
observed improvements in clinical symptoms and walking abilities. Moreover, positive
effects on cartilage metabolism were suggested.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Thermotherapy</kwd><kwd>Cartilage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Because of the aging population, the number of patients with age-associated joint disorders
has been increasing in Japan. These disorders are a major factor in the reduction of the
activities in the daily lives of the middle-aged. In particular, the number of patients with
knee osteoarthritis (OA) has been rapidly increasing in recent years.</p><p>For progressive knee OA, surgical methods such as arthroscopic surgery, osteotomy, or total
knee arthroplasty are commonly used. Early-stage knee OA is treated mainly by oral
administration or topical application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
intra-articular administration of drugs such as hyaluronic acid, physical therapy such as
heat treatment, orthosis therapy such as use of a foot plate or knee orthosis, or exercise
therapy such as muscle strength training<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Superficial heat treatment is one of the most widely used physical therapies, and moist heat
is considered to be more effective than dry heat, because heat is transferred to deep areas
of the body, which promotes blood circulation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and
pain relief<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent in vitro studies have revealed the influences of heat
treatment on the metabolism of cartilage matrix components such as proteoglycans and
collagen<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We evaluated the effects of local heat treatment and exercise therapy for knee OA on knee
joint symptoms and qualitative clinical changes in cartilage, as well as by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping, which allowed quantitative assessment of articular
cartilage, collagen fiber arrangement, and the water content in the cartilage<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Irregularity in the collagen fiber
arrangement and an increase in the water content may develop with cartilage degeneration. T2
in cartilage is generally prolonged in the early-stage of cartilage degeneration, therefore
we evaluated the changes in T2 as a measure of quantitative changes in cartilage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study received ethical approval from Juntendo University Hospital Review Board, and
the subjects provided their written informed consent. The subjects were 22 females aged
50&#x02013;69 (59.5 &#x000b1; 5.8&#x02005;years, mean &#x000b1; SD) years diagnosed as having early-stage knee OA. The 22
subjects were randomly assigned using computer-generated random numbers to either a local
heat treatment group (LH group, 11 subjects), or an exercise therapy group (EX group, 11
subjects). These study groups were examined in a 12-week intervention experiment. Standing
antero-posterior plain X-ray images were obtained of all patients, and the severity of knee
OA was evaluated according to the Kellgren&#x02013;Laurence Classification<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects in the EX group performed 2 sets of straight leg raises, abductor training, and
adductor training (20 repetitions per set) in the morning and evening every day.</p><p>In the LH group, heat- and steam-generating sheets (Kao Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were
used to apply moist heat. These sheets generate heat and steam by reacting with oxygen in
the air, and can maintain the skin temperature at 40&#x02005;&#x000b0;C for 8&#x02005;h. The sheets were applied
continuously for 6&#x02005;h every day, except during sleep. Two sheets were applied to the patella
on the left and right sides (total heating area using 2 sheets = 96&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>), and a
thin flexible supporter was applied to prevent their movement. The application method is
illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Schema for the application of heat- and steam-generating sheets on the knee</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-281-g001"/></fig>.</p><p>For clinical evaluation, the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were
performed. The TUG test measures the time taken by a subject to rise from a chair with arm
rests, walk 3 m, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again. Following the original
method of Mathias et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, measurements
were performed twice at a comfortable walking speed, and the shorter time was used for
analysis.</p><p>For cartilage imaging, MRI T2 mapping was performed for quantitative evaluation. MRI was
performed on the side with knee pain (heat application side), and the T2 values of before
and after the intervention were compared.</p><p>For T2 mapping, coronal images passing through the center of the weight-bearing area were
obtained using a 3.0 T MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen). For T2 measurement, imaging was
performed using the multi-spin-echo method under the following conditions: TR, 1,800&#x02005;ms; TE,
10&#x02013;80&#x02005;ms; FOV, 150 &#x000d7; 150&#x02005;mm; section thickness, 3.0&#x02005;mm; matrix, 384 &#x000d7; 384, bandwidth 241
kHz. Regions of interest involving the full thickness of the cartilage were located in the
medial and lateral condyles of the femur and those of the tibia, and the mean values were
obtained. To standardize the procedure, all measurements were performed by a single
investigator.</p><p>Both clinical and MRI evaluations were performed at the beginning and the end of the
intervention (0 week (Time 0) and 12 weeks). For statistical analysis, differences between
measures taken before and after the intervention were evaluated using the paired t-test in
each group; p &#x0003c; 0.05 was regarded as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 18 patients (9 in the LH group, 9 in the EX group) participated in the entire

oxidation reaction, which is also used in the heat- and steam-generating sheets, showed an
increase in the human intracapsular temperature to 36&#x02013;37&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, which was about 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C higher
than the intracapsular temperature under the control condition without heat treatment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, superficial heat treatment
for 10&#x02005;min using paraffin was reported to increase the intracapsular temperature to at least
37&#x02005;&#x000b0;C<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significant decrease in
the JKOM score, i.e., significant improvement in OA symptoms and activities of daily living
after heat treatment in the present study, may have been partly due to promotion of blood
circulation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that decreased blood circulation in tissue is
associated with the development of pain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. An association between decreased blood
flow and knee pain has been reported<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Long-term local heat treatment using
heat- and steam-generating sheets may have improved blood flow in periarticular tissue,
resulting in pain relief in the knee in daily life. In addition, the effects of local heat
treatment include an increase in collagen fiber extensibility<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, analgesic effects due to an increase in the pain threshold<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and effects on muscle metabolism<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, local heat treatment may have exerted complex effects
on periarticular tissue, and contributed to the improvement in the symptoms of knee OA and
activities of daily living. An improvement in JKOM scores after exercise treatment has
previously been reported<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
study, the total JKOM score in the EX group was lower at 12 weeks than that at Time 0, but
the change was not significant. As a relatively small number of subjects participated in
this study, further studies are necessary to determine whether exercise treatment solely
improves the total JKOM score.</p><p>The TUG time was significantly shortened in the EX group. This may have been because
exercise, which strengthens walking-associated muscles and widens the range of joint
motions, contributed to improvements in walking abilities in this study. In the LH group,
the TUG time did not significantly change, but in 7 of the 9 patients showed decreased
times, and the improvement rate was similar to that in the EX group. In recent years,
thermal stimulation alone or in combination with mild exercise has been reported to increase
the muscle mass and strength in humans and rats<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis of the JKOM and TUG test results of the present
study, we consider there is a possibility that exercise therapy used in combination with
local heat treatment further improves exercise function because of improvement in pain
symptoms and muscle reinforcement. Further evaluation is necessary to verify this
conjecture.</p><p>Concerning the effects of heat treatment on articular cartilage, in vitro studies have
revealed that an increase in the cartilage temperature (37&#x000b0;C) promotes proteoglycan
production as a cartilage matrix component<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. This has not been studied in vivo, but
the effects of heat treatment associated with increased cartilage temperature, and the
effects on cartilage metabolism due to promotion of blood circulation in the surrounding
tissues have been considered<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
study, a significant shortening of the T2 value in the LH group, i.e., after heat treatment
using heat- and steam-generating sheets, was detected. Several possible reasons for this T2
shortening can be considered, including not only the direct effects of heat treatment on
cartilage metabolism, but also a decrease in the water content of cartilage. Water content
changes possibly result from increased weight-bearing resulting from an improved walking
ability, associated with ameliorated knee joint symptoms. Further studies are necessary to
determine whether T2 changes occur in cartilage after heat treatment, and whether such
changes represent improvement in cartilage degeneration.</p><p>In this study, the subjects were patients with early-stage OA primarily exhibiting KL I-II,
a good indication for conservative therapy. Therefore, further studies are necessary to
evaluate the clinical effects of heat treatment for patients with advanced knee OA or severe
symptoms. In addition, for patients with advanced articular cartilage degeneration or
thinning, it is possible that irreversible degeneration is present in the cartilage matrix.
Whether heat treatment affects cartilage metabolism even in such patients should be
determined by further evaluation.</p><p>In conclusion, after treatment with heat- and steam-generating sheets for 12 weeks,
improvements in clinical symptoms and walking abilities were observed. Furthermore, effects
on cartilage metabolism were suggested by the results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Moskowitz</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><name><surname>Nuki</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee
