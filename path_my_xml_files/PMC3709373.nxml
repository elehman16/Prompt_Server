It includes a combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at a standard dose; together with two antibiotics (amoxicillin 1000 mg plus either clarithromycin 500 mg or metronidazole 400 mg) all given twice daily for a period of 7-14 days. Reported eradication cure rates used to be around 95% in the early nineties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, a meta-analysis in 2007 including over 53,000 patients showed that the eradication rate after standard triple treatment is currently below 80%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Some European studies have reported even lower rates of eradication, of 60-65%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Failure of eradication appears to be related to ingestion compliance, reinfection, or drug resistance of the <italic>H. pylori</italic>. In the UAE, there was a similar observation over the past 10 years where every day practice indicated that the eradication rate is noticeably decreasing and more failures are emerging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The sequential therapy is a novel therapeutic regimen for the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> introduced in 2007 by an Italian group which consists of a 10-days treatment course of a PPI and three antibiotics given in sequence rather than all drugs given at the same time: (PPI, with amoxicillin 1000 mg given twice daily for the first 5 days) followed by (PPI, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg all given twice daily for the subsequent 5 days). This achieved a 95% eradication rate which is significantly superior to that achieved with the standard triple therapy, according to the Italian researchers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Later on, these results were confirmed by many other authors with similar success rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Probiotics are believed to have a role in eradicating and possibly preventing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection as an adjunctive treatment. Literature has shown that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill <italic>H. pylori</italic>, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent interleukin-8 release. <italic>In vivo</italic> models demonstrated that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] A meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of supplemental probiotics in eradication therapy demonstrated that the cure rates for standard agents used alone and eradication co-therapy with probiotics, were 74.8% and 83.6%, respectively. The analysis revealed that the combined treatment, had not only increased the eradication rate, but had also decreased the occurrence of adverse effects due to antibiotics, like diarrhea.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Several studies also reported that the ingestion of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus had improved the symptoms of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected gastritis. However, they did not affect eradication, and after stopping ingestion, the suppressing effect on <italic>H. pylori</italic> was lost.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Sheu, <italic>et al</italic>., reported that pre-treatment with <italic>Lactobacillius</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> containing yogurt improved the efficacy of quadruple therapy after failed triple therapy. They also demonstrated a decreased bacterial load after pretreatment with yogurt.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Another study had shown that the eradication rates for two cohorts, one treated with yogurt plus triple therapy and the other with triple therapy only, were 82.6% and 69.3%, respectively for intention to treat analysis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018) thus concluding that supplementation with yogurt containing <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> is effective for first-line eradication therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p><italic>B. infantis</italic> is a probiotic that inhabits the intestines of both infants and adults. This type of bacteria is considered beneficial because of the acids it produces. The acids produced by <italic>B. infantis</italic> may help impede the growth or colonization of harmful bacteria within the gut. It has been reported to be effective in management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and has beneficial action on the treatment of diarrhea of other causes. A multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled study demonstrated that <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> 35,624 can improve common IBS symptoms over a 4-week period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The effects of adding <italic>B. infantis</italic> when supplementing triple therapy for eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, has not been adequately studied or investigated. Yang, <italic>et al</italic>., showed that using probiotic fortified yoghurt alongside antibiotic therapy, rendered the side effects fewer, and the rate of eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> significantly higher than in those following the medication therapy only.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>This paper presents a multi-center work that was done with a view to explore if modifying medicinal <italic>H. pylori</italic> therapy, by adding the probiotic <italic>B. infantis</italic> as an adjuvant with or before treatment will satisfactorily restore the previously achieved eradication rates.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective randomized open label clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy of adding probiotics to different modifications of <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment. The probiotic used was <italic>B. infantis</italic> 2036 and the regimens of eradication adopted were the standard triple therapy and the sequential therapy. Primary end point was to evaluate cure rates, at end of treatment. Secondary end point was to assess clinical response and impact on reducing adverse events.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>As per protocol of the study, all consenting patients, of 12-80 years of age who presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and were diagnosed to have upper GI disease either clinically, or by endoscopy, were included when they had a solid evidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Upon recruitment, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was to be concluded either from the Campylobacter Like organism Urease test (CLO urease), or by histologic proof for the patients who had endoscopy or by the <sup>14</sup>C urea breath test (UBT) and/or by detecting pylori antigen in stool for those who did not have endoscopy. All patients however, should have a reference <sup>14</sup>C UBT before starting treatment regardless of the diagnostic approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Standard exclusion criteria were followed to assure that safety of treatment has been watched, and to exclude any inter-current illnesses that might have an impact on the response to medicines. These included: Pregnancy, patients known to be allergic to any of the medicines used, patients who would develop adverse reactions after starting therapy, use of other concomitant medications, chronic renal or hepatic disorders, and neoplastic disease. Patients who had received clarithromycin for any reason within the 6 months that preceded enrolment were also excluded and so was the case for patients who were treated on the basis of the office serology test for <italic>H. pylori</italic> alone.</p><p>The study extended over a period of one year and included four arms designed to cover four groups of patients treated with different regimens. The patients were either treated for the first time (na&#x000ef;ve), or had a failed a previous attempt at least 6 months before enrolment (retreat). They were randomly assigned to one of the four arms of the study in six medical centers.</p><p>Each patient should have a documented follow-up visit at 6-8 weeks after completing the treatment with a check on <italic>H. pylori</italic> cure using <sup>14</sup>C UBT. Endoscopy was repeated where indicated only (presence of new or persisting symptoms). The values obtained by the <sup>14</sup>C UBT as determined by Heliprobe II, in counts per million were viewed as a reflection of the intensity of colonization, and the change in values after treatment were taken into consideration when assessing response.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Group A</title><p>Goup A was a control of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 106) that was meant to reflect the current status of response to the standard triple therapy.

This indicated clearly that the global trend of decline in success of response to triple therapy applies to our areas as well. Na&#x000ef;ve patients who did not receive clarithromycin before had a better eradication rate (73%), than retreat patients (47.1%). Clinical improvement was minimal in this group being achieved in 28.8% of the patients treated regardless of the results of eradication. In the post-treatment it was noted that loose bowel motions and diarrhea had appeared in 9.4% and 15.1% of patients, respectively, which was believed to be an adverse event to the antibiotics used. In this work, two factors had possibly contributed to the increase in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication failure, namely the repeated retreat events with same medications which are an unfortunate common practice in the area, that patients are unjustifiably exposed to, and the increase in resistance to clarithromycin.</p><p>The long-term use of clarithromycin based treatment and the continued widespread use of long-acting macrolides in general practice, led to 10-15% of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains to acquire resistance to clarithromycin. This had consequently reduced the cure rates by 20-30% when patients are treated by a clarithromycin based regimen. Clarithromycin failure appears to be on the rise worldwide as concluded from several studies. This appeared partly to be due to the injudicious use of clarithromycin by repeated trials of eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> but, mainly due to drug resistance as well. Drug resistance is likely to be associated with the increased activity of the efflux pump of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and/or to the emergence of the 23S r-RNA point mutations of the microbe. Efflux pumps appear to play a major role so much that pharmacologic research is targeting it to achieve reversing of drug resistance in <italic>H. pylori</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Sequential therapy is a novel schedule of treatment that emerged as a possible solution to the decline in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rates. Vaira, <italic>et al</italic>., in 2007, showed in a large prospective controlled study a 90% cure rate for this new regimen of treatment versus 80% for the old standard treatment. Jafri, <italic>et al</italic>., performed a meta-analysis of several clinical trials involving sequential treatment and concluded a favorable response confirming the efficacy of this regimen. The restoration of successful eradication rates by sequential therapy is expected to reduce the need to follow-up proof of cure and to the need to re-instate repeated attempts at eradication with the reported ever-decreasing success rates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Probiotics had an <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effect on <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Animal studies had demonstrated that probiotic treatment is effective in reducing <italic>H. pylori</italic> associated gastric inflammation. Seven of 9 human studies showed an improvement of <italic>H. pylori</italic> associated gastritis and decrease in colonization after the administration of probiotics. On the other hand the addition of probiotics to the standard antibiotic treatment had improved <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rates (81% with combination treatment vs. 71%, for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment alone). Probiotics also remarkably reduced the antibiotic associated side effects (incidence of side-effects: 23% with combination therapy versus 46%, for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment alone). No study, could demonstrate the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection by using probiotics alone. Therefore, probiotics should not be considered as an alternative to the standard treatment but could definitely present a low cost, large scale alternative solution when used as an adjunctive agent to prevent or decrease <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p><italic>B. infantis</italic> is a member of the Bifidobacteria family, a strain of bacteria that is normally found in the human intestines. Because these bacteria do not normally cause infections, they can be used in probiotic supplements, which can aid in promoting intestinal health and help prevent infections. <italic>B. infantis</italic> work within the digestive system to restore intestinal balance and maintain normal digestive health. In a previous study, <italic>B. infantis</italic> was shown to be beneficial to those who suffer from symptoms of IBS like bloating, gas movement, diarrhea, constipation, urgency, and abdominal discomfort.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] However, its effect on eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> has not been adequately investigated.</p><p>According to the World Gastroenterology Organization Practice Guidelines published in May 2008, probiotics may reduce the GI side-effects of antibiotic therapy and improve patient compliance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] There is currently insufficient evidence to support the concept that a probiotic used alone, without concomitant antibiotic therapy, would be effective, but the indication from literature review suggest that certain probiotics may be helpful as an adjuvant to antibiotics in the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>The use of probiotics to modify the conventional treatment regimens is based on sound biological and physiological principles. Probiotics modulate the intestinal ecosystem by stimulating mucosal immune mechanisms and by stimulating non-immune mechanisms through antagonism with potential pathogens. These phenomena are thought to mediate most beneficial effects, including reduction of the incidence and severity of diarrhea. In addition to the therapeutic effects, probiotics reduce the common side effects of GI upset during conventional antibiotic treatment. It was demonstrated that in symptom free, <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive subjects <italic>Bacillus clausii</italic> bacteriotherapy reduced the incidence of the most common side-effects related to anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic therapy compared with placebo. Probiotics may especially, be helpful in patients with recurrent <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and a history of GI adverse effects with antibiotics.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials suggested that supplementation of anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic regimens with certain probiotics may also be effective in increasing eradication rates and may be considered helpful for patients with eradication failure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Further clinical studies will be necessary to establish better guidelines in supplementation of anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic regimens.</p><p>It is reported that <italic>B. infantis</italic> produced better epithelial tight junctions and is thus of particular importance in alleviating inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohns or ulcerative colitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Similarly, it may confer epithelial protection of gastric mucosa and prevent <italic>H. pylori</italic> from causing mucosal damage and subsequent inflammation. Furthermore, Bifidobacteria allows better opportunities for antibiotics when given together to eradicate <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Our work shows that when <italic>B. infantis</italic> was added to the standard triple therapy as a supplement the success of eradication increased significantly from 68.9% by the triple therapy alone to 83% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Priming the GI tract with a lead-in period of 2 weeks with <italic>B. infantis</italic> alone followed by triple therapy with the probiotic yielded better results than triple therapy, and achieved a statistically significant eradication rate of 90.5% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 vs. triple therapy alone). Adding <italic>B. infantis</italic>, to a sequential regimen of treatment had shown an eradication rate of 90.8% which is almost similar to group C. There was no significant difference between groups B, C, and D [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In the standard triple therapy group, eradication rates for na&#x000ef;ve patients to clarithromycin exhibited a better response than the retreat patients, (73% vs. 47.1%), respectively, implicating a possible role for clarithromycin resistance to account for this (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This phenomenon was not encountered in the <italic>B. infantis</italic> treated groups (groups B, C, and D) where no difference was noted between na&#x000ef;ve and retreat patients. This favorable finding could be attributed to a positive role for <italic>B. infantis</italic> on the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-clarithromycin resistant strains, rendering them more susceptible to treatment [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Eradication rates of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> by different regimens used</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-19-113-g006"/></fig><p>Clinical improvement was another advantage of adding <italic>B. infantis</italic> to the standard triple therapy. Improvement and clinical satisfaction was reported by 28.8%, 54%, 52.6%, and 49.3% of all patients treated with triple therapy, co-therapy, primed co-therapy, and sequential co-therapy, respectively. This observation had demonstrated a significant difference of clinical response for all modified regimens than triple therapy alone (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) regardless of the result whether the <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was eradicated or not.</p><p>Another secondary endpoint of this study is the remarkable improvement in bowel activity in those who were treated with <italic>B. infantis</italic>. The number of patients is small to establish solid statistical conclusions, however, it was apparent that patients who were treated with triple therapy alone had either loose bowels or frank diarrhea after initiating therapy seven times more than pretreatment status. This observation was encountered rarely in the <italic>B. infantis</italic> treated groups (twice for co-therapy, less than half for the primed co-therapy and less than a third for the sequential co-therapy) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>Yuan[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] reported that <italic>B. infantis</italic> helped regeneration of the colonic mucosa after a course of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-Flouro Uracil which is commonly used for colonic carcinoma with an associated suppression of underlying inflammation. This may explain the present observation that <italic>B. infantis</italic> alleviated symptoms of side effects of antibiotics used in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study was done to explore an alternative to the standard triple therapy for the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, which has witnessed a significantly remarkable decline of eradication to 68.9% than previously obtained by most researchers more than a decade ago (95%). The response to the therapeutic regimen of standard triple therapy was affected negatively by previous exposure to clarithromycin.</p><p>The probiotic <italic>B. infantis</italic> appeared to be a sound alternative to triple therapy, when added as an adjuvant: Concurrently with, or after priming the GI tract for 2 weeks or with sequential treatment. A successful eradication rate of 83%, 90.5%, and 90.8% was obtained respectively. Each was significantly better than triple therapy alone (68.9%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>It is also note-worthy that <italic>B. infantis</italic> led to better results of eradication for people who had been previously treated with clarithromycin, that is, reduced the negative effect of clarithromycin resistance. <italic>B. infantis</italic> also improved significantly the clinical symptoms and the incidence of antibiotic induced diarrhea with only few and milder incidents of diarrhea reported.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
