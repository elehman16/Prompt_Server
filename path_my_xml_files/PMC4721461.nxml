Higher levels of fitness in children may be associated with improved neurocognitive processing (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Hillman et al., 2008</xref>) as well as increased levels of PA positively influencing learning by enhancing school &#x02018;on-task&#x02019; behaviours (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Increased time spent participating in physical education (PE) within the curriculum may provide both cognitive and educational benefits across childhood and adolescence (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>). The literature is consistent in reporting that increasing the amount of time in PE within school does not adversely affect more academic subjects. Indeed, there are examples of higher levels of time spent in PE enhancing academic attainment (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eide et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Cooper, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Mahar et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, research has focussed on the possible associations between PE and executive function performance. Executive function<xref rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn">1</xref> is an umbrella term to describe higher-order processes which direct thought and action (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2013</xref>). A recent review has suggested that areas of cognition, including working memory, selective attention, and inhibition tasks, are the areas of greatest benefit for children who increase their levels of PA (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Guiney and Machado, 2013</xref>). Similarly, another review examined the effect of PA on children's cognition and found that both acute and chronic exercise may produce improvements in cognition (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Best et al., 2011</xref>). A review of studies on PA examining mental health outcomes also found a positive association with cognition in randomised studies (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Ahn and Fedewa, 2011</xref>). These positive associations were also identified in another review though there is an acknowledgement that the improvements in cognition and academic achievement are usually small or inconsistent (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Biddle and Asare, 2011</xref>).</p><p>There is a need for studies to focus on the potential longer-term impact of PE in school on children's cognition and to specifically evaluate the nature and quality of PE provision to identify how different approaches may have differing effects on cognition (e.g. training of cognitive aspects in PE, dose-related response). There is a need for a study to be conducted within a Scottish context.</p><p>This paper provides the methodological protocol that will allow a robust evaluation of effects of &#x02018;Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT)&#x02019; on children's cognition, &#x02018;Gross Motor Coordination (GMC),&#x02019; and PA habits in comparison to a traditional approach in PE within the primary school setting in Scotland. In addition to cognitive measures, the current study will evaluate GMC and PA habits in order to account for these potential variables as identified in other studies (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Green and Francis, 1988</xref>). If an alternative approach to the delivery of PE in schools can lead to improvements in children's cognition, this would have implications for improvements in academic achievement and help to inform interventions for those children who are not engaging in PE regularly in school and PA in other areas of their lives.</p><sec id="s0015"><title>BMT</title><p>BMT is a new programme concerned with the development and delivery of quality PE provision for children aged 3&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years. The programme was developed in Scotland from collaboration between formal education processes, sports performance development, and developmental neuroscience. BMT sets out to offer a novel approach to teaching PE in schools.</p><p>BMT methodology encompasses key themes throughout the PE lesson including the development of physical literacy, the enhancement of thinking skills (cognition), and the establishment of personal qualities that could be considered essential for learning (i.e. perseverance, resilience, tolerance, determination, etc.) (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Yeager and Dweck, 2012</xref>).</p><p>BMT primarily focuses on the ability for the learner to move and think in an integrated way. BMT differs from traditional PE as it directly focuses on developing the links between moving and thinking and as such recognises how this contributes to the development of cognition. Traditional PE focuses directly on the technical and tactical skills required to participate in PE, PA, and sport, and in doing so perhaps assumes that cognition will become a by-product of the experience.</p><p>BMT begins by engaging the learner by encouraging them to actively listen and focus on the tasks and instructions that are being presented by the teacher. This is achieved by offering the instructions only once and providing some misdirection thereafter. For example, if the children are being asked to jog in the gym hall, the teacher would provide a verbal instruction such as &#x02018;when I clap my hands I want you to change direction as fast as you can.&#x02019; The teacher would then shout &#x02018;Go!&#x02019; (without clapping their hands) creating misdirection. Students who are actively engaged in their learning would not change direction on the command &#x02018;Go!&#x02019; and would not get <italic>caught out</italic> by the misdirection. Engaged learners would wait for the clapping of the hands command. In traditional approaches, the teacher would often then verbalise and correct the response for learners who responded incorrectly, but in BMT methodology, the misdirection is offered 3 or 4 times until the learning environment has shaped the correct responses from all learners.<xref rid="fn0010" ref-type="fn">2</xref> This is not achieved successfully with all learners in the first lesson, but over a period of 2 or 3&#x000a0;weeks, the learners become habituated and modify their behaviours in order to remain on task throughout the lesson. In essence, they begin to take responsibility for their own learning by becoming actively engaged from the beginning of the lesson and throughout. Once this has been achieved, and in order to maintain and enhance levels of focus and concentration, the teacher will begin to layer a cognitive task onto a physical task. For example, the teacher may ask for a sequence of 9 movements using a combination of hopping, skipping, side-stepping, and jogging. The learners would then have to create their own combinations which require neurocognitive processing in order to solve, plan, decide, and design goal-oriented performance, key attributes that the literature strongly refers to when discussing executive function (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Lee, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Biddle and Asare, 2011</xref>). As the learners successfully achieve the task, the teacher would ask for them to come up with an alternative solution, thus developing cognitive flexibility and adaptive behaviours (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Etnier et al., 2006</xref>). In order to maintain the engagement of learners thereafter, BMT methodology will increase the physical demands and in doing so further develop physical literacy. When successful, the teacher will add another cognitive task onto the new physical task and repeat this process a number of times throughout the lesson. The direct layering of specific physical tasks with specific cognitive tasks is what makes BMT a unique approach to PE and allows for all levels of learners to be challenged throughout the duration of the lesson. The pace of the lesson is deliberately quick to prevent any potential for off-task behaviours and/or disengagement. If off-task behaviours or disengagement become evident, the teacher would return to the misdirection cues and capture the engagement of the learners once again before building on previously covered work.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate if there is a link between BMT and cognition and GMC, to identify if there is an association between levels of PA and cognition and to gain an understanding into the perceptions of students and teachers of BMT as an alternative approach to PE.

Six schools will be used as logistically this is the maximum number to allow data collection to be gathered within the timescale of the study. The allocation of schools to condition will be undertaken by the Quality Improvement Officer (QIO) within the local authority. There are a number of potential schools and the QIO will choose schools based on two criteria: their proximity with one another ensuring that they are close to each other, and schools where he thinks that it would be feasible to run the research. Once the schools have been identified, they will be placed within opaque-sealed envelopes and a person external to the study will choose 3 schools which will be allocated as the intervention condition leaving the other 3 as the control condition. The design of the study is a 16-week intervention with pre-, post- and 6&#x000a0;month follow-up measurements taken from the &#x02018;Cognitive Assessment System (CAS)&#x02019; (<xref rid="bb9400" ref-type="bibr">Naglieri and Das, 1997</xref>), GMC tests and the &#x02018;Physical Activity Habits Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C)&#x02019; (<xref rid="bb9300" ref-type="bibr">Kowalski et al., 2004</xref>) gathering quantitative data. These are explained in more detail later. At the end of the 16-week intervention, phase 6 focus groups will be conducted separately for students (approx. 8 students in each) in all schools. One-to-one interviews, lasting approximately 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;minutes, will be conducted with each of the class teachers. The focus groups and interviews will be analysed qualitatively.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>The local authority (LA) will be approached to grant access to involve six primary schools. Six primary schools will be identified by the &#x02018;Quality Improvement Officer (QIO)&#x02019; and if necessary substitute schools will be identified.</p><p>Having identified the six schools, letters will be sent to each of the head teachers outlining the research and seeking permission for their involvement. This will be followed-up, 1&#x000a0;week later, with a phone call and a meeting will be arranged between the main researcher, and the head teacher to explain the research in more detail. If each of the head teachers agrees to their involvement, each student will be provided with an information sheet to take home to their parents with a consent form for their parents to sign indicating that they are happy for their child(ren) to be involved in the study. The main researcher will attend a separate meeting with each P6 class outlining the nature of the research study. Students will be provided with an information sheet as the main researcher explains what the student involvement would be. Questions that arise will be answered before students are provided with assent forms to complete and sign if they wish to be involved in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><title>Study sample</title><p>With class size potentially ranging from 25 to 30 students in each, the schools identified by the QIO, may yield approximately 150&#x02013;180 students who could provide assent to be involved throughout the study.

The PASS theory provides a view of intelligence reconceptualised as cognitive processes and proposes that human cognitive function is based on these four essential activities that employ and alter an individual's base of knowledge (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 1994</xref>). According to this theory, human cognitive functioning includes four components: planning processes that provide cognitive control; utilisation of processes and knowledge, intentionality, and self-regulation to achieve a desired goal; attentional processes that provide focused, selective cognitive activity over time; and simultaneous and successive information processes that are the two forms of operating on information. Planning is a mental process by which the individual determines, selects, applies, and evaluates solutions to problems. Attention is a mental process by which the individual selectively focuses on particular stimuli while inhibiting responses to competing stimuli presented over time. Simultaneous processing is a mental process by which the individual integrates separate stimuli into a single whole or group. Successive processing is a mental process by which the individual integrates stimuli into a specific serial order that forms a chain-like progression. The CAS has two formats that could be used as measurement tools for children's cognition: the Standard Battery (involving 12 subtests, 3 for each category in PASS) and the Basic Battery (involving 8 subtests, 2 for each category of PASS). Due to the logistical limitations of conducting research within the school environment, this study will use the Basic Battery. The Planning subtests are &#x02018;Matching Numbers (MN)&#x02019; and &#x02018;Planned Codes (PCd).&#x02019; Attention subtests include &#x02018;Expressive Attention (EA)&#x02019; and &#x02018;Number Detection (ND).&#x02019; &#x02018;Non-verbal Matrices (NvM)&#x02019; and &#x02018;Verbal-Spatial Relations (VSR)&#x02019; make up the Simultaneous subtests while &#x02018;Word Series (WS)&#x02019; and &#x02018;Sentence Repetition (SR)&#x02019; make up the Successive subtests. Each subtest scaled score is set at a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. The CAS is intended to predict academic achievement in children and the full scale standard score will typically be the best overall predictor of achievement.</p><sec id="s0060"><title>Reliability and validity</title><p>Subtest reliability coefficients were calculated by the split-half method for all Simultaneous and Successive subtests using the entire standardisation sample and obtained from the administrator's manual. The average resulting reliabilities for the Basic Battery are .85 (Planning), .84 (Attention), .90 (Simultaneous), and .90 (Successive). A study into the reliability of the CAS identified reliabilities in all PASS subscales in all age groups ranged from 0.83 to 0.93 (<xref rid="bb9400" ref-type="bibr">Naglieri and Das, 1997</xref>) indicating a high level of reliability and validity in using CAS as the cognitive measurement tool within this study (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Naglieri, 1999</xref>). Subtest reliabilities are similarly high ranging from .75 to .89 across subtests with a median reliability of .82.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>GMC</title><p>Students will be asked to perform 4 GMC tasks. These 4 tasks will involve crawling on the stomach (i.e. commando crawl), creeping on hands and knees (i.e. 4-point crawling), marching with an arm swing (i.e. like a soldier), and skipping with an arm swing (i.e. without a rope). These coordinated movements are indicators of developmental milestones and are used to evaluate children's motor development with particular focus on gross motor coordination (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Goswami, 2008</xref>). Each student will have a 5&#x000a0;m distance to travel between and will be asked to perform each task twice. The assessments will be video recorded and movement patterns will be coded for the purposes of data collection using a 5-point scoring system. The scoring system will be as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><p>1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Unable to perform the task</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><p>2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Disintegrated (no consistency in the coordination of both halves and sides of the body)</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><p>3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Homologous (upper and lower body not integrated)</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><p>4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Homolateral (same sided limbs move in the same direction simultaneously)</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><p>5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Contralateral (opposite sided limbs move in the same direction simultaneously)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Individual scores from the 4 tasks will be accumulated to create an overall score which will be used for the purpose of analysis. In order to minimise the risk of bias cross-scoring with an independent researcher who is familiar with these test protocols will be conducted at pre-, post-, and follow-up testing.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Physical Activity Habits Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) (<xref rid="bb9300" ref-type="bibr">Kowalski et al., 2004</xref>)</title><p>The PAQ-C provides a general measure of physical activity from ages 8 to 20&#x000a0;years. The PAQ-C is appropriate for school-aged children (approximately 8&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years) who are currently in the school system and have a rest interval as a regular part of their school week. The PAQ-C are self-administered, 7-day recall questionnaires that comprise of an activity checklist (21 activities and space for students to add two additional unlisted activities), and questions about context of PA conducted over the last 7&#x000a0;days (including PA during morning break, lunchtimes, PE, after-school, evenings, and weekends). Generally, the PAQ-C has had relatively strong correlation coefficients with other PA measures compared to other recall measures (<xref rid="bb9100" ref-type="bibr">Kowalski et al., 1997</xref>). Validation studies indicate high reliability in the use of the PAQ-C (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Saint-Maurice et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Procedures</title><p>The PAQ-C will be conducted with the whole class, and the main researcher will read through each question and be available to answer any queries from the students.

CAS testing will be conducted on a one-to-one basis with the main researcher and will take place within a quiet space within the school. Each student will be thanked by the main researcher on completion of the testing and will be told that they will be tested again at the end of the intervention phase and at 6&#x000a0;month follow-up.</p><p>Fidelity measures will be used to ensure the reliability of data being collected using the CAS, PAQ-C, and GMC tests.

The research assistant will have specialist skills in the facilitation of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Each of the student focus groups and class teacher interviews will be audio-recorded for the purposes of transcription and analysis. Data will be coded using an iterative process and cross-coding will be done with the research assistant conducting the focus groups and interviews.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Setting</title><p>The PE lessons will be conducted within the gym facilities and outside areas at the schools.

All quantitative data will be cross-checked with 3 independent researchers each of whom specialises in the use of CAS, PAQ-C, and fundamental locomotor skills.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0130"><title>Qualitative data</title><p>Focus groups and class teacher interviews will be conducted by an independent researcher who has an expertise in this particular area of qualitative data collection. The focus groups and class teacher interviews will be recorded using audio-recording equipment and the main researcher will then provide a verbatim transcription that will then be analysed thematically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0135"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>As the study will include all students, including those with additional support needs, it is likely that the data will not be normally distributed. ANCOVA will be used to adjust for any pre-test differences to compare the post-intervention performance of the control condition with that of the intervention condition. ANCOVA will be used to compare the pre-intervention with the 6&#x000a0;month follow-up data. The relationship between levels of cognition, coordination, and PA will be modelled using a multiple regression with bootstrapping if required (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Miles and Shevlin, 2001</xref>). The focus groups and class teacher interviews will be recorded and transcribed before identifying emergent themes within the data using a grounded theory approach (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Corbin and Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol provides the details of the rationale and design of the study and details of the intervention, outcome measures, and the recruitment process. Effect sizes derived from comparison between the intervention and control conditions from the study will provide information on the effectiveness of delivering BMT as an alternative PE provision within primary schools; evaluate the relationship between levels of PA, GMC and cognition. A 6-month follow-up at the end of the intervention phase will conclude this study.</p><p>The study will address a) the need for a Scottish-based study into the links between PA, GMC, and cognition, b) how the nature of the activities provided during traditional PE and BMT impact differently on the development of cognition, c) documentation and analyses of the experiences and perceptions of PE/BMT lessons from participants within this study and d) if effects are maintained 6&#x000a0;months after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s0140"><title>Strengths</title><p>The study could identify an alternative teaching method that helps to provide quality PE provision for all primary school-aged students. The perceptions of the participants may provide interesting insights that help identify effective strategies that further encourage the government's health agenda and helps get more children within Scotland active on a daily basis. Children from control and intervention conditions will come from a range of socio-economic backgrounds and will include students with and without additional support needs. This is the first study to systematically explore the potential benefits of the BMT approach with such an inclusive cohort. The primary outcome measures used in this study are standardised test scores which have a high-rated inter-rater and test&#x02013;retest reliability. Fidelity testing will be undertaken by 3 researchers who are independent of the study in order to compare inter-rate reliability to ensure that appropriate procedures are being adhered to. The main researcher is involved in the gathering of the quantitative data but not the qualitative data and will not be involved in the delivery or evaluation of any of the PE/BMT sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><title>Limitations</title><p>Variables identified in the literature that may impact upon differences in outcome measures include age, birth weight, gestation, age of mother at delivery, mother's oily fish intake at 32&#x000a0;weeks gestation, maternal smoking in the first 3&#x000a0;months of pregnancy, weight status, pubescent stage, ethnicity, socio-economic status, (SES) and occupational social class (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2013</xref>). It has not been possible to control for all of these variables within this study. For example, students from both conditions will not be measured using body mass index (BMI) though previous studies (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Aktop, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Cooper, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eide et al., 2010</xref>) highlight the impact that this can have on the outcomes being measured. Similarly, no information was gathered about the pre-school provision of the students prior to the start of this study and again there are previous studies that have illustrated the impact that pre-school provision can have on cognition (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Diamond et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Marjanovic Umek et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>An additional limitation is the gathering of PA habits through self-reported questionnaires. Self-reported levels of PA may over report actual levels of PA, especially as the data collection will be performed as a whole class. Objective measures of PA would perhaps further enhance this study, but pragmatically is beyond the capacity of this study (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The short length of intervention phase (16&#x000a0;weeks) may also limit this study. Sufficient time between the pre- and post-test phases may not allow for any change to be identified within the three variables being measured. As this study accounts for only P6 students within one authority, it may be difficult to generalise any findings to a wider population.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The main researcher is one of three authors of the intervention; however, BMT is not a commercial venture.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><title>Author's Contributions</title><p>AD, NM, and JB led the drafting and editing of the manuscript.
