Ageing is an important current issue &#x02013; patients with chronic diseases, such as chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes, are increasing in number and living longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Till now, health care has been dominated by single-disease approaches lacking coordination and integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although, in real life, diseases often coexist in the same patient, the approach to coexistent diseases has been largely neglected. In particular, COPD and CHF frequently coexist due to common risk factors, causing a significant deterioration in these patients&#x02019; quality of life (QoL) and increasing morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The prevalence of COPD in CHF patients ranges from 20 to 32&#x000a0;%, while CHF is prevalent in more than 20&#x000a0;% of patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients with combined COPD and CHF are often frail and are characterized by a high risk of frequent exacerbations and often the need for rehospitalization, with the related burden of cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Each disease is an independent predictor of morbidity, mortality, impaired functional status, and health service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The combination of these two diseases presents many diagnostic challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Clinical symptoms and signs require careful interpretation, in conjunction with objective evidence for each condition. Both are chronic progressive diseases with a course that fluctuates, burdened by frequent exacerbations, through a vicious circle of dyspnea, decreased activity, new exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], depression, and social isolation, ultimately leading to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Muscle mass loss and skeletal muscle wasting in these patients have serious therapeutic and clinical implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Muscle atrophy contributes to muscle fatigue during exercise, obliging patients to stop exercising even if they have not yet exhausted their heart and lung capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The weight of evidence from randomized trials in these single specific diseases indicates that a multidisciplinary disease-management approach, supported by telecommunication technologies, has the best outcome in terms of prolonged survival and reduced hospital readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, in patients where these two chronic diseases coexist there is no similar evidence to date.</p><p>We previously presented, in CHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], a model for a multidisciplinary care approach using structured telephone support providing medical/nursing interventions coupled with biosignal telemonitoring. This model demonstrated a possible approach for chronic single-disease treatment after hospitalization, providing a way to prevent clinical deterioration and rehospitalizations through a comprehensive, long-term intervention with regular reinforcement of patient adherence, knowledge, and skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. No physical rehabilitation program was included in this model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>A personalized hospital discharge program appears to be the best approach for the follow-up care of patients with combined COPD/CHF. Particularly important for patients with multiple comorbidities is routine self-management support, consisting of education to help patients to recognize symptoms early, manage their medical devices, identify barriers to adherence to therapy such as adverse effects of drugs, and check that the intensity of physical therapy is appropriate. Our study aims to compare the feasibility and efficacy of an integrated, home-based, medical/nursing intervention plus a physical rehabilitation program versus conventional care in patients with combined COPD/CHF.

NTs perform a weekly intervention mainly through structured appointments (from Monday to Friday from 8:30&#x000a0;a.m. to 4:00&#x000a0;p.m.), collecting information about disease status (blood pressure and body weight measurements) and symptoms (general information). Patients were provided with a pulse oximeter (GIMA, Gessate (MI), Italy), and a portable one-lead electrocardiograph (Card Guard 2206; Card Guard Scientific Survival Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) and instructed on how to transmit the electrocardiogram (EKG) trace via a fixed or mobile telephone line to the NT. Participants in the study were also informed that additional telesupport from the NT, aside from the normal weekly NT call, could be accessed by the patients themselves in the case of urgent need or emergency. Unscheduled contacts could be made, 24&#x000a0;h/day 365&#x000a0;days/year, to the NT on duty in case of symptoms manifesting, signs of possible decompensation, or for any doubt about therapy. The EKG was transferred during each call to the telemedicine center, which stored it and sent it to the hospital unit. At the end of each telephone call, the NT could provide support to the patient, offering advice regarding diet, lifestyle, and medications, and suggesting changes in therapy within patient-adapted criteria previously defined with the cardiologist or pulmonologist supervising the program, and could fix an appointment for consultation with the specialist and schedule the next telephone appointment.

Based on this assessment, the PT could decide to increase or maintain the workload. Patients were asked to write down the physical activity performed daily in a diary and to report it during the next telephone appointment.</p><p>The PT contacted the patient by telephone once a week. During each scheduled telephone contact, the PT gathered information about the patient&#x02019;s general clinical condition (e.g., asthenia, muscle, and joint pain), physical activity performed during the week (duration of exercises and number of steps walked), and clinical parameters before and after training (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and Borg scale score). The PT verified the training level of physical activity performed and planned the rehabilitation targets for the following week (weight use, increase in number of steps, and duration of exercise). During the telephone call, the PT also gave extra reinforcement on the value of lifestyle changes and the importance of exercise. At the end of each call, the PT entered the data into a personal health electronic record.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group</title><p>On discharge from in-hospital rehabilitation, patients in the control group received the standard care program including medications and oxygen prescription, visits from the general practitioner, and in-hospital check-ups on demand.

The aim of our study was to provide patients with combined COPD/CHF (complex and frequently frail patients with a very high risk of rehospitalization) with an integrated, multidisciplinary NT- and PT-oriented program at the time of in-hospital rehabilitation discharge. This would be characterized by improved knowledge of the signs and symptoms of their disease, with interventions on self-management in the use of medications, evaluation and solution of problems related to exacerbations according to a personalized action plan (self-management), continuous education at a distance with the possible use of a specialist network for a second opinion via remote surveillance (self-guided), home visits as needed, and a guided rehabilitation maintenance program (home care).</p><p>Despite the increasing incidence of chronic diseases and, among them, the high prevalence of CHF and COPD, there are no studies in the literature dealing with a similar home-care approach supported by telemedicine in this patient population, where the coexistence of both diseases implies a far greater functional deficit and impact on QoL than in other chronic conditions. Through this program, the NT and PT, with the support of the physician, actively monitored the clinical situation and the patient&#x02019;s physical status, modifying the therapeutic approach and the workload weekly.</p><p>To minimize bias we used consecutive enrollment and central randomization. Due to the nature of the trial it was not possible to blind patients and health care personnel. We tried to standardize as much as possible the nursing and physiotherapy approach in the three hospitals involved in patient enrollment, conducting joint training of staff, organizational meetings and planning before commencing patient enrollment. The rehabilitation program adopted at home tried to reproduce as much as possible the rehabilitation carried out in the hospital, at the same time personalizing the program to the needs of patients.</p><p>The choice of the 6MWT as a primary outcome measure was motivated by the fact that this is a very sensitive test to treatments offered in both these diseases and is among the most frequently used in the literature. The test measures the distance covered when subjects are instructed to walk as quickly as they can for 6&#x000a0;min, and performance on this test has been used as a measure of cardiovascular exercise capacity, particularly in patients with congestive heart failure, and chronic lung disease. The distance covered during the 6MWT has been shown to be a sensitive measure of heart disease severity and is a useful predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>We also considered it important to monitor dyspnea and muscle fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using the Borg scale; even if this is a subjective index, it gives important information on the health status of the patient at any time of the study. We chose the PASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] as a tool to measure the level of physical activity, as our population is aged 65&#x000a0;years and older. The PASE consists of self-reported occupational, household, and leisure items over a 1-week period and can be administered by telephone, mail, or in person. The PASE scoring was derived from movement counts from an electronic physical activity monitor, activity diaries, and self-assessed activity levels in a general population of noninstitutionalized older persons. The PASE can be used to measure physical activity in surveys of older people and to assess the effectiveness of interventions.</p><p>The evaluation of QoL is an important indicator of the effect of the home program and it remains poorly investigated in telehealth. Most published trials have been powered to highlight the effectiveness in &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; endpoints such as mortality and cardiovascular or respiratory disease-related hospitalizations; consequently, information on the efficacy of such programs on surrogate outcomes, physical performance, and QoL are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Other major indexes include patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and adherence to the program carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which we included in our study.</p><p>This is a real-life study, in which the complexity, frailty, age, high risk of exacerbations, and high variability in the individual response of the patients enrolled in the home program can have important effects on the expected results.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrollment of patients started in July 2013 and ended in October 2014. Follow-up ended in April 2015.
