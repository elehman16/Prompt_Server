This idea was taken a step further with the concept of the Polypill&#x02122;. There are, however, considerable patent, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, registration, and cost implications that will need to be overcome before the Polypill&#x02122; or other single-pill combinations of CV medications become widely available. However, a medication targeting blood pressure (BP) and lipids provides much of the proposed benefits of the Polypill&#x02122;. A single-pill combination of the antihypertensive amlodipine besylate and the lipid-lowering medication atorvastatin calcium (SPAA) is currently available in many parts of the world. This review describes the rationale for this combination therapy and the clinical trials that have demonstrated that these two agents can be combined without the loss of efficacy for either agent or an increase in the incidence of adverse events. The recently completed Cluster Randomized Usual Care vs Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-term-risk (CRUCIAL trial) is discussed in detail. CRUCIAL was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, open-label, parallel design, cluster-randomized trial, which demonstrated that a proactive intervention strategy based on SPAA in addition to usual care (UC) had substantial benefits on estimated CV risk, BP, and lipids over continued UC alone. Adherence with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies outside of the controlled environment of clinical trials is very low (~30%&#x02013;40% at 12 months). Observational studies have demonstrated that improving adherence to lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications may reduce CV events. One means of improving adherence is the use of single-pill combinations. Real-world observational studies have demonstrated that patients are more adherent to SPAA than co-administered antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy, and this improved adherence translated to reduced CV events. Taken together, these findings suggest that SPAA can play an important role in helping physicians improve the management of CV risk in their patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Polypill&#x02122;</kwd><kwd>multifactorial management</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular risk</kwd><kwd>single-pill amlodipine atorvastatin</kwd><kwd>CRUCIAL study</kwd><kwd>adherence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has a multifactorial nature with CV risk factors rarely occurring in isolation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ibpc-4-055">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ibpc-4-055">3</xref> Indeed, the combination of certain risk factors such as hypertension (HTN) and dyslipidemia (DYS) can act multiplicatively or synergistically to increase the risk of CVD events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ibpc-4-055">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ibpc-4-055">6</xref> This synergistic relationship is recognized by most of the major clinical guidelines used currently to aid the management of patients with symptomatic CVD or at risk of CVD, as they recommend a strategy of treating CVD risk factors simultaneously rather than in isolation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ibpc-4-055">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ibpc-4-055">10</xref> There is an ever-increasing body of evidence describing the advantages of a combined/multifactorial approach to reducing CV risk vs the older sequential approach of treating risk factors individually.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ibpc-4-055">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ibpc-4-055">16</xref></p><p>This multifactorial approach to CV risk reduction was taken a stage further by Wald and Law in 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ibpc-4-055">13</xref> with the suggestion that a combination pill containing a statin, three different antihypertensives (each at half of the standard dose), folic acid, and aspirin could reduce CVD risk by more than 80%. In the 8 years since this paper was published, various pilot studies and Phase II trials of other single-pill combinations of antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medications, and aspirin (eg, the Polycap, which contains low doses of thiazide, atenolol, ramipril, simvastatin, and aspirin) have been completed and published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ibpc-4-055">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ibpc-4-055">19</xref> While the results of some of these studies have been promising, such as the Phase II study of the Polycap,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ibpc-4-055">17</xref> in other studies the estimated reductions in CVD risk with single-pill combinations of CV medications have not been as large as those originally estimated by Wald and Law.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ibpc-4-055">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ibpc-4-055">19</xref> Furthermore, there are significant patent, potential pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, registration, and cost implications that will need to be overcome before the Polypill&#x02122; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ibpc-4-055">20</xref> or other single-pill combinations of CV medications are approved for use by regulators and become available for general use.</p><p>A large proportion of the proposed CV benefits of the Polypill&#x02122; were achieved by targeting HTN and DYS; using the information published in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ibpc-4-055">Table 1</xref> of the original Wald and Law paper,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ibpc-4-055">13</xref> simple calculations demonstrate that the majority (90%) of the proposed 88% benefit of the Polypill&#x02122; on ischemic heart disease and 88% of the proposed 80% stroke benefit was due to the use of multiple antihypertensives at low doses and the low dose of a single lipid-lowering agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ibpc-4-055">13</xref> A single-pill combination of the antihypertensive amlodipine besylate and the lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin calcium (single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin [SPAA]), has been available in the USA since 2004 and in other parts of the world since 2005.</p><p>The remainder of this review will discuss the rationale for combining amlodipine and atorvastatin, and discusses the results of a wide array of preclinical, clinical, and real-world observational studies assessing the efficacy, safety, and utility of the SPAA combination. The Cluster Randomized Usual Care vs Caduet Investigation Assessing Long-term-risk (CRUCIAL trial) will be discussed in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ibpc-4-055">Figure 1</xref>). This trial is the most recent and longest clinical study of SPAA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ibpc-4-055">21</xref> Earlier SPAA studies have been discussed in detail in earlier reviews,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ibpc-4-055">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ibpc-4-055">24</xref> so they will not be detailed extensively in this paper. This review will instead focus on the CRUCIAL trial and the recent health economic and outcomes research studies that were not covered in the earlier reviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin</title><p>One of the driving forces for the development of the Polypill&#x02122; was the poor level of control of CV risk factors, despite the widespread availability of efficacious antihypertensive and lipid-lowering mediations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ibpc-4-055">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ibpc-4-055">27</xref> For example, The European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events III (EUROASPIRE III) survey carried out in 2006&#x02013;2007 across 22 countries in Europe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ibpc-4-055">26</xref> showed that 56% of patients with symptomatic CVD were not reaching their assigned 2007 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) blood pressure (BP) targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ibpc-4-055">9</xref> and over half of patients remained above the recommended ESC lipid targets. The poor level of control of HTN and DYS highlights the need for new strategies to manage these (and other) risk factors thereby reducing the impact of CVD. A single-pill combination of an antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication may address some of the issues thought to hinder the management of CVD, such as poor adherence to multiple treatments due to high pill burden and the reluctance of physicians to manage more than one CV risk factor simultaneously.</p><p>The agents used in a combination medication for the treatment of HTN and DYS should have proven efficacy and excellent tolerability profiles. The antihypertensive component(s) should also be free from drug&#x02013;drug interactions with other BP-lowering medications due to the frequent need for multiple antihypertensives to achieve BP goals in certain difficult-to-treat populations, such as patients with diabetes. The antihypertensive amlodipine besylate fulfills these criteria in that it has been demonstrated to reduce CV events in different patient populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ibpc-4-055">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ibpc-4-055">30</xref> and is effective when combined with other classes of antihypertensive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ibpc-4-055">31</xref> Amlodipine besylate is a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) that primarily inhibits calcium ion influx into cardiac and smooth muscle cells, resulting in peripheral arterial vasodilation and a reduction in BP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ibpc-4-055">32</xref> The lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin calcium has also been demonstrated to reduce CV events in a variety of different patient populations (including those with HTN and &#x02265;3 additional CV risk factors).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ibpc-4-055">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ibpc-4-055">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ibpc-4-055">33</xref> Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol and lipoproteins, and thereby reduces the formation of lipids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ibpc-4-055">34</xref></p><p>There are a number of important requirements for therapies used in a combination medication, regardless of the condition being treated. Firstly, the medications must have a similar dosing regimen (eg, once- or twice-daily). Secondly, there should be no negative pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between the proposed components (eg, exacerbation of adverse events [AEs] or other drug&#x02013;drug interactions). Thirdly, from a patient&#x02019;s perspective, the tablet should be of a reasonable size and the formulations should allow flexible dosing. The following section of this paper will review the evidence for whether or not the combination of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium fulfills these criteria.</p><p>Both amlodipine and atorvastatin can be administered once daily (they are effective for 24 hours) and food causes no clinically meaningful variation in the bioavailability of either agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ibpc-4-055">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> The details of the pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine and atorvastatin as individual agents have been described in detail in earlier reviews<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ibpc-4-055">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ibpc-4-055">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ibpc-4-055">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ibpc-4-055">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ibpc-4-055">38</xref> and will therefore not be discussed in detail in this paper. Two studies examining the pharmacokinetic properties of co-administered amlodipine and atorvastatin have been published. The first of these studies demonstrated that amlodipine does not affect the pharmacokinetic properties of atorvastatin, and vice versa, under fasting conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ibpc-4-055">39</xref> The second of these studies demonstrated that the bioavailability of both agents is unchanged when they are administered with food.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ibpc-4-055">40</xref> Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of amlodipine and atorvastatin are well suited and are not a barrier to combining these agents into a single pill.</p><p>Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials were undertaken to assess whether amlodipine affects the lipid-lowering capacity of atorvastatin, and conversely to evaluate whether atorvastatin affects the BP-lowering efficacy of amlodipine, or if co-administration adversely affects the tolerability of either agent. The first of these studies, the Atorvastatin and Amlodipine in Patients with Elevated Lipids and Hypertension (AVALON) trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ibpc-4-055">41</xref> conducted in 848 patients from the USA and Canada, demonstrated that amlodipine co-administration with atorvastatin did not affect the BP-lowering efficacy of amlodipine. Co-administration of amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg, however, led to a significantly greater effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and apolipoprotein B levels at week 8, compared with atorvastatin 10 mg alone. The AVALON study investigators mentioned that these observations were unexpected, and additional studies were needed to explore this further. The second of these two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, Respond,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ibpc-4-055">42</xref> was a larger trial than AVALON. Respond was conducted across a greater dose range for both amlodipine (placebo; amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg) and atorvastatin (placebo; atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg) than AVALON. In total, 1660 patients from 15 countries were enrolled. This study demonstrated that atorvastatin did not affect the BP-lowering efficacy of amlodipine and similarly amlodipine did not affect the LDL-C lowering capacity of atorvastatin. There was also no evidence of a higher incidence or exacerbation of AEs in patients receiving both medications vs either agent alone in these two studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ibpc-4-055">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ibpc-4-055">42</xref> Therefore, these studies demonstrated that there were no pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic barriers to combining amlodipine and atorvastatin into a single pill.</p><p>Indeed, there is some evidence that there might be some pharmacodynamic benefits associated with combining these agents. A wide variety of both preclinical and clinical studies has assessed the separate and combined effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin on cell systems, arterial wall compliance, and CV endpoints.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ibpc-4-055">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ibpc-4-055">45</xref> Studies conducted using human umbilical vein endothelial cells to evaluate the effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin alone and in combination on nitric oxide (NO) release demonstrated that co-administered amlodipine and atorvastatin had a synergistic effect on increasing NO concentrations. This in turn reduced nitroxidative stress. Furthermore, co-administered amlodipine and atorvastatin partially restored NO levels following LDL-C&#x02013;induced endothelial dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ibpc-4-055">44</xref> An AVALON substudy demonstrated a 19% improvement in small artery compliance (C2) with co-administered amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg in patients with HTN and DYS from baseline to week 8, which was significantly greater than with either amlodipine 5 mg or atorvastatin alone or placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ibpc-4-055">45</xref> Moreover, a potential beneficial interaction between atorvastatin and amlodipine was suggested by the results of a pre-specified 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial analysis of data from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT). Compared with placebo, the risk reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) was greater in patients receiving an atorvastatin-plus amlodipine-based regimen than in those receiving an atorvastatin-plus atenolol-based regimen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ibpc-4-055">43</xref></p><p>SPAA tablets are available in a range of amlodipine/atorvastatin doses from 2.5/10 mg to 10/80 mg. However, the doses approved vary from country to country with just 5/10 mg and 10/10 mg available in some parts of Europe. SPAA pills are not particularly large and there have been no reports of the size of the SPAA being an issue for patients. Indeed, a small pilot study indicated that patients were satisfied with SPAA treatment in relation to their previous treatment of HTN and DYS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ibpc-4-055">46</xref> This therefore suggests that the pill size is not a barrier to use and the dose strengths available enable flexible dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety considerations and contraindications</title><p>Amlodipine and atorvastatin have been used in routine clinical practice both alone and in combination for many years. Initial safety concerns surrounding the use of CCBs, which were based on the results of observational studies were not substantiated in a series of large randomized trials, which provided evidence on both the efficacy and safety of amlodipine in a broad range of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ibpc-4-055">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ibpc-4-055">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ibpc-4-055">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ibpc-4-055">47</xref> Furthermore, clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that atorvastatin is an effective and well-tolerated medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ibpc-4-055">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ibpc-4-055">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ibpc-4-055">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ibpc-4-055">49</xref> A retrospective analysis of 49 clinical trials of atorvastatin demonstrated that the overall incidence of treatment-associated AEs in patients receiving atorvastatin was similar to that in patients receiving placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ibpc-4-055">49</xref> Furthermore, many of the side effects associated with statins such as atorvastatin, tend to be dose related and often resolve when treatment is stopped or if the dose is reduced.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ibpc-4-055">22</xref> Nevertheless, the safety considerations for, and contraindications of, both amlodipine and atorvastatin need to be considered before prescribing these medications as SPAA.</p><p>In terms of contraindications, SPAA should not be used in patients with a known sensitivity to either amlodipine or atorvastatin, or in women who are, or may become, pregnant or women who are breast feeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> SPAA is also contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins. Therefore, patients should be advised to report promptly muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness to their physician. Patients with a history of renal failure, which can exacerbate the risk of muscle damage, should be closely monitored for rhabdomyolysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> Other factors that may predispose patients to myopathy are advancing age (&#x02265; 65 years) and hypothyroidism. Treatment with SPAA should be temporarily withheld or discontinued if a patient develops myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, dosing instructions should be followed carefully when SPAA is co-administered with fibric acid derivatives, niacin, cyclosporine, clarithromycin, itraconazole, or HIV protease inhibitors &#x02013; medications that can increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Statins have also been associated with abnormalities in liver function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> Therefore, it is recommended that liver function tests are undertaken before and 12 weeks after initiating therapy with, or increasing the atorvastatin component of, SPAA. If persistent elevations in liver enzymes occur, reduction in the dose of SPAA or withdrawal of SPAA is recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref></p><p>Caution is required when treating certain patient populations with SPAA. For example, elderly patients should initiate treatment at the low end of the dose range for amlodipine, and patients with hepatic impairment should have their dose titrated slowly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ibpc-4-055">36</xref> Furthermore, a potential worsening of angina and acute MI (particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease) can develop on initiating amlodipine or increasing the dose of this medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> Caution is also advised when prescribing high doses of atorvastatin in patients with a recent stroke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ibpc-4-055">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref> This advisory is based on a post hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ibpc-4-055">50</xref> Patients in this study had no history of CHD but had a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the preceding 6 months. A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80-mg group compared with placebo (2.3% vs 1.4%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group.</p><p>See the SPAA package insert for full details on the contraindications, precautions, and dosing requirements for SPAA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ibpc-4-055">37</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Treatment objectives: efficacy studies</title><sec><title>Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin studies</title><p>The AVALON<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ibpc-4-055">41</xref> and Respond<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ibpc-4-055">42</xref> studies outlined above both used co-administered amlodipine and atorvastatin rather than SPAA. A variety of both open-label and randomized controlled studies has now been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of SPAA. The first of these was the GEMINI trial, which was a 14-week, open-label trial conducted in 1220 patients from the USA, which demonstrated that SPAA was well tolerated and could help patients with HTN and DYS achieve their BP and LDL-C goals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ibpc-4-055">51</xref> The subsequent GEMINI-Australia, Asia, Latin America, Africa/Middle East (AALA) study, which was a very similar study design, confirmed the findings of GEMINI among 1649 patients residing across Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ibpc-4-055">52</xref> The findings of these two studies were confirmed in the JEWEL study program, with JEWEL 1 conducted among 1138 patients from the UK and Canada and JEWEL 2 conducted in 1107 patients from Europe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ibpc-4-055">53</xref> A further study on the use of SPAA in the USA, the Clinical Utility of Caduet in Simultaneously Achieving Blood Pressure and Lipid End Points (CAPABLE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ibpc-4-055">54</xref>), was conducted in 499 African American patients. CAPABLE examined the efficacy and safety of SPAA in a population that is rarely studied and has a high prevalence of HTN and mortality rates from CVD compared with other ethnic groups in the USA.

At baseline, LDL-C levels were similar (119.4 vs 118.0 mg/dL) in the two treatment arms. BP, however, was higher at baseline in the proactive intervention strategy than in the UC arm (systolic BP 150.3 vs 144.3 mmHg and diastolic BP 89.7 vs 86.5 mmHg, respectively). This led to a higher calculated baseline absolute Framingham 10-year CHD risk in the proactive intervention strategy compared with the UC arm (20.0% vs 18.1%). The reasons for the difference in BP between the treatment arms at baseline are uncertain. However, it is possible that they are related to the cluster randomization used in this study in which the investigators rather than the patients were randomized. The following precautions were taken to balance the treatment arms for potentially confounding factors. Firstly, patients were enrolled into the study before the investigators were randomized to avoid patient selection bias. Secondly, study investigators were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each country.

This questionnaire was originally tested during the AVALON study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ibpc-4-055">41</xref> and later modified to the ESTQ short form (ESTQ-SF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ibpc-4-055">46</xref> Using data from the JEWEL program,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ibpc-4-055">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ibpc-4-055">56</xref> SPAA treatment was shown to increase patient satisfaction vs a multiple-pill regimen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ibpc-4-055">46</xref> Due to the preliminary nature of these data, further study is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn on whether an increase in patient satisfaction with SPAA contributes to the improved adherence observed with SPAA vs multiple-pill regimens.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Much of the proposed benefits of the Polypill&#x02122; can be achieved through reducing BP and LDL-C. There is now a wealth of preclinical, clinical, and outcomes research data supporting the use of a combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin into a single-pill therapy. The recently completed CRUCIAL trial conducted in patients with HTN and three or more additional CV risk factors but no CHD demonstrated that a SPAA-based proactive intervention strategy can improve BP and LDL-C goal attainment and reduce calculated CV risk in comparison with UC alone. Taken together, these findings suggest that SPAA can play an important role in helping physicians improve the management of CV risk in their patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments/Disclosure</title><p>Editorial support was provided by Karen Burrows and Penny Gorringe of UBC Scientific Solutions and funded by Pfizer Inc.
