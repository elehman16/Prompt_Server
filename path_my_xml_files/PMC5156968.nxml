In a simple classification, ventilation modes are classified into pressure control ventilation, volume control ventilation, or both. In volume mode, regardless of the pressure and airway resistance, a certain amount of volume is delivered to the lungs which may cause damages due to pressure or pneumothorax.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In contrast, pressure mode continues ventilation support to reach the predetermined pressure and prevents injuries caused by pressure; however, in the case of inappropriate volume, lungs may reach to the predetermined pressure too quickly, and the patient suffers from hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Each of pressure or volume modes has its own advantages. Accordingly, to take advantage of the benefits of both modes, manufacturing companies have decided to design modes which have two pressure and volume control components in combination.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In pressure regulated volume control (PRVC) mode which was introduced by Siemens Company, a certain volume is given to the patient. Thus, the device guarantees this volume by regulating pressure, i.e., the device may increase the pressure to achieve the desired volume. Advantages of this mode compared to the ventilation pattern with volume control are lower maximum inspiratory pressure, flow coordination of ventilation pattern, less manipulation of the device by operator, and automatic decease of ventilator support.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The clinical outcome of patients who have been treated by this mode has not been well examined. Therefore, this study was designed to compare two PRVC and synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) modes in terms of sedation, ventilation weaning, and hemodynamic stability in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval of Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Research Project No: 3940940) and taking patients&#x02019; family informed consent, this single-blind, random, clinical trial study was conducted. The study population consisted of patients with TBI who required mechanical ventilation. Inclusion criteria included lack of history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or addiction to opioids or sedative drugs or alcoholism. Exclusion criteria consisted of patient's death or discharged 24 h before admission to ICU.</p><p>Using the formula for estimating the sample size, the sample size was determined as 43 patients in each group to compare the means which have been listed below and by considering the level of confidence of 95%, test power of 80%, standard deviation of sedation score estimated about 1.33, and least significant difference in sedation score in the studied groups considered 0.8; 50 patients were studied in each group. Randomization of patients to each group was done by random allocation software with simple randomization method.</p><p>All patients were ventilated by MEDEC ventilator (Medec Benelux NV, Belgium). The parameters of ventilator were adjusted on SIMV mode for the first group and PRVC mode for the second group. Monitoring of patients including pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram monitoring, and noninvasive systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure monitoring was checked in the two groups.</p><p>Sedation of patients in ICU was done by intravenous (IV) administration of 2 mg morphine and 2 mg midazolam, and then 2 mg/IV/PRN as morphine and midazolam, based on Richmond agitation-sedation scale of 2 or more. During ventilation, arterial blood gas was controlled and recorded at admission to ICU and then once daily or PRN in other situations. Respiratory parameters which were measured included spontaneous tidal volume (TV), respiratory rate (RR), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), and ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio). All respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were recorded at every 8 h by the anesthesia assistant from admission to ICU until 80 h and registered in the questionnaire.</p><p>Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) using the Chi-square, <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test, and ANOVA with repeated measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 106 patients with TBI who required mechanical ventilation and admitted to ICU were randomized into two groups of SIMV and PRVC modes.

In this study, we evaluated the respiratory and hemodynamic parameters in 100 patients with TBI who required mechanical ventilation. According to the results of our study, 80 h control of the most important respiratory parameters including RSBI and PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio showed that the overall level of PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio was superior with PRVC mode of ventilation compared to SIMV mode. In addition, respiratory effort and hemodynamic stability were in a better situation in PRVC mode.</p><p>Some studies have so far been conducted on the advantages of PRVC mode compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation. In the study by Schirmer-Mikalsen <italic>et al</italic>., patients with TBI ventilated by PRVC mode had less fluctuation in intracranial pressure (ICP) and PaCO<sub>2</sub> compared to pressure control mode. However, mean ICP and PaCO<sub>2</sub> were not different between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Although in an experimental work using ventilation simulations, using PRVC mode was not considered to provide appropriate TVs for severely obstructed patients;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in other situations such as postcardiac surgical patients, oxygenation index has been superior in PRVC mode of ventilation in recovery period.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Other pressure modes of mechanical ventilation may have better patient-ventilator synchrony and adequate gas exchange and less ventilator-induced lung injury.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study, monitoring hemodynamic parameters during the first 80 h after ICU admission revealed better blood pressure levels, indicating lower sympathetic stimulation in PRVC ventilation mode. On the other hand, patients under ventilation with PRVC mode had fewer RRs and better SPO<sub>2</sub> compared to other group.</p><p>One limitation of our study was that the patients were not completely followed until extubation and discharge from the ICU because of long duration of ICU stay in head trauma patients. Therefore, duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation was not evaluated and recorded. Furthermore, other respiratory parameters such as lung compliances and airway pressures can be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>According to the obtained results, using PRVC mode may be more desirable than using SIMV mode in patients with TBI due to better respiratory and hemodynamic stability.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Branson</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatburn</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Controversies in the critical care setting.
