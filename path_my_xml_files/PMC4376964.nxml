Dried blood spot testing (DBST) is a simple procedure for the detection of HCV antibodies; its impact on testing in the prison context is unknown. <bold>Methods:</bold> We carried out a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized control trial of DBST for HCV among prisoners within five male prisons and one female prison. Each prison was a separate cluster. The order in which the intervention (training in use of DBST for HCV testing and logistic support) was introduced was randomized across clusters. The outcome measure was the HCV testing rate by prison. Imputation analysis was carried out to account for missing data. Planned and actual intervention times differed in some prisons; data were thus analysed by intention to treat (ITT) and by observed step times. <bold>Results:</bold> There was insufficient evidence of an effect of the intervention on testing rate using either the ITT intervention time (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.68&#x02013;1.03; <italic>P</italic> = 0.088) or using the actual intervention time (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.71&#x02013;1.06; <italic>P</italic> = 0.153). This was confirmed by the pooled results of five imputed data sets. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> DBST as a stand-alone intervention was insufficient to increase HCV diagnosis within the UK prison setting. Factors such as staff training and allocation of staff time for regular clinics are key to improving service delivery. We demonstrate that prisons can conduct rigorous studies of new interventions, but data collection can be problematic. <bold>Trial registration:</bold> International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN number ISRCTN05628482).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The UK prison population contains a high proportion of individuals who report having injected illicit drugs (PWID),<xref rid="cku096-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref> the major risk factor for hepatitis C (HCV) in the UK.

De-duplication used a laboratory number allocated to the patient; it is possible that individuals received more than one number on repeat testing, leading to the inclusion of some repeat tests. We were not able to determine if any duplicate testing occurred within GUM testing or whether prisoners tested in the confidential GUM service were subsequently tested elsewhere within the prison health service.

The control month for Prison 1 was March 2011 where the number of venepuncture tests was missing. There was an increasing test rate from January 2012. For Prison 2, there was a noticeable decrease in the rate in the control months, and an overall decreasing trend throughout the intervention months. For Prison 3, the test rate was stationary until February 2012, followed by a sharp increase during March and June 2012 and then fell down to around 5%. For Prison 4, the HCV test rate was near zero but with a sudden increase during the last 2 months. For Prison 5, the test rate increased slightly at the beginning of the intervention and then decreased gradually and picked up during the last 2 months. Pulling all five prisons together revealed a higher HCV test rate during the intervention months. Although Prison 4 did not receive the intervention, it was included in the GLM analysis to reflect the seasonal effect on the test rate.

testing rate using either the ITT intervention time or the actual intervention time. This was confirmed by the pooled results of five imputed data sets. Despite the evidence in non-controlled community-based settings that DBS increases testing,<xref rid="cku096-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> it would appear that the intervention alone is insufficient to significantly increase diagnosis within the UK prison setting. This result is influenced by the fact that only one of five prisons was consistently offering HCV testing before the study. For the remaining four of five prisons, DBST was introduced to an environment where routine HCV testing services had yet to be established. Implementing DBST in these prisons involved significant training for staff. Therefore, the study results do not show the long-term impact of the DBST intervention, but instead provide a picture of the initial introduction of a new service. Our approach to capturing contextual factors was anecdotal rather than structured; a more in-depth process evaluation would have strengthened data interpretation.<xref rid="cku096-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p>We have demonstrated that it is feasible to carry out a RCT in the prison setting where randomization is of prisons rather than of individuals; this is to the best of our knowledge the first time this has been done within the UK prison system. The methodological approach used in this study is suitable for the evaluation of complex interventions<xref rid="cku096-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and reduces the potential confounding likely to be encountered in a non-controlled trial before and after study. Published RCTs of health-care interventions carried out within UK prisons are few.<xref rid="cku096-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35&#x02013;37</sup></xref></p><p>Stepped wedge designs are ideal for a situation like this where there has been a policy decision to implement an intervention despite a potential lack of evidence of efficacy. Alternate designs, the individually randomized and the cluster-randomized trial designs, deny half the study population access to a mandated intervention. The stepped wedge design is a pragmatic, yet rigorous, method of evaluating public health interventions as they are rolled out. This intervention is accepted by NICE and being implemented. We took the opportunity to use that roll out to rigorously evaluate, at little cost, DBST, which would not have otherwise been possible.</p><p>As all prisons are supplying both control and intervention subjects half the number of prisons (and therefore half the logistical problems) are needed to supply the same number of individuals as a cluster randomized trial under the same power conditions. The study, however, will therefore take longer than a conventional cluster RCT. This too has its advantages, especially in a situation where an intervention proves difficult to implement. The prolonged time allows a better longitudinal view on implementation, and in this case we were able to observe whether there was a drop off of intervention uptake after initial enthusiasm, or a steadily improving take up. Any shorter study, such as a cluster RCT, would have not had that opportunity.</p><p>The methodological framework imposed on the collection of data revealed both problems and weaknesses in data collection within the UK prison settings and highlighted potential contextual factors that may impact on intervention success. Further study is required to better elucidate these contextual factors and should ideally be built into the study design from the outset. Given common challenges facing the UK prison system, we assume that these findings are likely to be generalizable to other settings.</p><p>Two controlled trials in the USA have examined the impact of the timing of the offer of HIV testing on uptake within jails,<xref rid="cku096-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cku096-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> and these suggest that the timing of offer of tests and how they fit in with prison reception process may be important. A recent cost-utility analysis indicated that increasing HCV testing in prisons is cost-effective given minimal continuity of care with community and uptake of HCV treatment.<xref rid="cku096-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref></p><p>The anti-HCV positivity rate of 13.3% reported from the laboratory data management system reinforces previous evidence that prisoners are at high risk of HCV infection.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>Data on testing rates were collected from a range of sources and at times identification of samples from prison inmates was problematic; this may have introduced errors. Certain data points were missing; despite imputation this weakened the validity of the study findings. Manual cleaning of data to remove duplicates was required; in addition, to avoid double counting, we manually removed venepuncture follow-up tests that resulted from an initial positive DBST; this process may have introduced errors to the monthly testing activity counts and was not possible for a small number of DBST (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cku096-T1">table 1</xref>). We used NOMS data to provide denominator figures for prison activity; this may have introduced an unknown level of error into the estimates as we are aware that double counting is possible with this data set; however, this potential double counting will likely equally affect both control and intervention time points and therefore not bias any results. The intention of the study was to offer the test to all new arrivals; we cannot be sure the extent to which the discretion of prison health staff, and other circumstantial factors, influenced the offer of the test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DBST introduced as an intervention to five UK prisons did not significantly increase the uptake of testing. In this study we show that DBST alone is insufficient to increase testing; the intervention is complex and structural and operational barriers can reduce any intervention effect and need to be addressed as part of the intervention. Future studies of interventions to improve blood borne virus diagnosis should consider a longer control period and build in sufficient follow-up. Procedures for collecting data on prison inmates need to be planned beforehand, as procedures may vary between prisons.</p><p>We recommend that, in line with NICE guidelines, DBST is offered within prisons; however, to maximize the benefit of this new technology, this study highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to improving HCV diagnosis. To introduce the technology alone, without a wider integration of training and support for staff, without awareness raising among inmates and importantly without the capacity and stability in prison health services necessary for major service developments would appear to be insufficient to lead to improvements in case finding. We argue that the methodology piloted here is suitable for studies addressing this important question and other rigorous evaluations of public health interventions within the prison context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/eurpub/cku096/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>EURPUB</italic> online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the management and staff of the five prisons enrolled in the trial, the laboratories, informatics teams and GUM services providing data, and also thanks to Daniel Thomas and Meirion Evans for steering input at project inception.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded in its entirety by <funding-source>Public Health Wales</funding-source>.</p><p><italic>Conflicts of interest</italic>: None declared.</p><boxed-text id="cku096-BOX1" position="float"><caption><title>Key points</title></caption><p>
