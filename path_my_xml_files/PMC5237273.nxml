In this context, the European Union Committee on Public Health has declared it essential that preventative measures are taken by centres providing care for women with a multidisciplinary approach. PROGEA is a multicentre, single-blind randomized, 3-year, longitudinal clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducational programme in preventing postpartum depression in at-risk women, based on a range of clinical variables, and explore prognostic factors. This paper describes the methods and rationale behind the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We will study women receiving treatment as usual plus a psychoeducation cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based intervention and a control group receiving only treatment as usual. The sample will be recruited from an incidental sampling of pregnant women in two health regions. We will recruit 600 women in the third trimester of pregnancy who consent to take part in the study. Almost half of the women, about 280, would be expected to have some risk factors for postpartum depression. All those found to have risk factors will be evaluated, and we estimate that a quarter will be classified as at-risk of developing postpartum depression as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This subset will be randomly allocated to receive treatment as usual with or without the CBT intervention. Six sessions of CBT (1 individual and 5 group) will be offered by a psychologist.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings from this study will be used to design a definitive study that will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the CBT-based intervention in improving the mood of women in the postpartum period.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02323152">NCT02323152</ext-link>; Date: December 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prevention and Control</kwd><kwd>Depression, Postpartum</kwd><kwd>Cognitive Therapy</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Quality Of Life</kwd><kwd>Motor Activity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Education, Linguistic Policy and Culture of the Basque Country Government </institution></funding-source><award-id>2011111110</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Treatment of major depression is an objective of the European Union and in recent years the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified improving maternal mental health as a fundamental part of the Millennium Development Goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Today, peripartum depression (as defined in DSM-V) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] is attracting greater attention from clinicians and researchers, as a condition that affects not only the mother, but also the health and development of the child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; for these reasons, its prevention is particularly important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The most frequent psychopathological disorders in women during pregnancy and the puerperium are depression, stress and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Postpartum depression (PPD), in particular, is one of the most common complications in this period, affecting nearly 20% of all women after childbirth each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but many cases go undetected and there is no international consensus on the best screening method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>PPD is defined as development of a major depressive episode with onset during pregnancy or within 4&#x000a0;weeks after childbirth and in which depressive symptoms are present for at least 2&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk factors for developing PPD include biological variables such as hormonal changes that women experience during pregnancy and after delivery; these are necessary to ensure their health during this period and are part of preparing the body for both childbirth and breastfeeding, but can cause depression in a subgroup of vulnerable women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to biological factors, there are psychosocial factors, among which we should highlight a personal or family history of depression or PPD and having experienced mood depression or anxiety during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, rates of PPD of more than 70% have been found in women with previous depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other risk factors described include: personal vulnerability of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the temperament of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], poor family and social support during the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], relationship problems during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], traumatic experiences in previous pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Psychological therapy for depression has shown to be an effective treatment in depressed patients of all ages and all degrees of severity, including PPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Given the consequences of the disease, another strategy would be to administer preventive treatment with a lasting effect that could protect women against developing this type of depression. A systematic review found that 13/17 studies with successful psychological treatment targeted an at-risk population, and 4/7 trials using interpersonal therapy demonstrated success of the intervention versus a control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to identify women at risk of PPD using a protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], investigate the efficacy of a structured programme of psychoeducational therapy designed ad hoc in preventing the development of PPD in at-risk women and explore prognostic factors for this type of depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We registered this single-blind randomized clinical trial in 2014 (identifier NCT02323152). Women will be recruited in the third trimester of pregnancy from 2015 to the completion of the study. Women that agree to participate and sign the informed consent form will then be assessed through a first screening visit by their reference midwife; specifically, the midwife will record sociodemographic data and the presence of various previously described risk factors, including the personality vulnerability of the woman and her socioeconomic status.</p><p>Women with at least one risk factor will progress to the next phase of the study and will be assessed between 8 and 15&#x000a0;days after the birth of their baby, at the Araba University Hospital. Clinical data will be collected relating to the delivery. We will also evaluate the women&#x02019;s mood with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the child&#x02019;s temperament with the Merrill-Palmer-Revised Scales of Development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the current and overall physical activity of women with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] using the Spanish versions of these tools. A score between 7.5 and 12.5 on the EPDS indicates depression risk and women with scores in this range will progress to the next phase of the study. In this phase, the participants will be randomized with Random Allocation Software 1:1 to the experimental or control group (treatment as usual). Women in the experimental group will receive six (1 individual and 5 group) sessions of the psychoeducational intervention and their status will be evaluated weekly. The control group will continue to have regular appointments with the midwife and gynaecologist and will be assessed again 6&#x000a0;weeks after inclusion in the trial.</p><p>We will recruit patients from five health centres in Vitoria and two health centres in Donostia, and the study is being coordinated by the Psychiatry Research team of Araba University Hospital, which is a member of the Center for Biomedical Research Mental Health Network (CIBERSAM).

The programme has an open format. That is, each woman that is randomized to the experimental group will directly enter the group, and start receiving the intervention, regardless of the session number.

Should it be found to be effective, this programme could have an important role in preventing this type of depression, a severe mental illness, and its deleterious consequences both in women and in their family including the newborn infant.</p><p>The strengths of the study include targeting a defined sample of pregnant women at risk of depressive disorder according to the literature reviewed. The implementation of a preventive programme focused on the mental health of women during pregnancy and the postpartum period is, in itself, an important aspect of the study, as existing postpartum care programmes tend to be related to the baby and the reproductive system of the woman, as well as the treatment of health problems, but not to prevention.
