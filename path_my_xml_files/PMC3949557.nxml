Results from the pivotal Phase III Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated with Regorafenib or Placebo After Failure of Standard Therapy (CORRECT) trial showed that the addition of regorafenib to best supportive care resulted in a significant improvement in median overall survival and progression-free survival compared with placebo plus best supportive care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) following all available approved therapies. Thus, regorafenib is the first oral multikinase inhibitor indicated for mCRC; it currently has approval in the USA, EU, Japan, Canada, and Singapore for the treatment of mCRC patients who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, and, if the tumor is <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy. In this review, we highlight regorafenib&#x02019;s mechanism of action, present key efficacy data from the CORRECT trial, and discuss how to proactively manage common adverse events (eg, hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, oral mucositis, diarrhea, and fatigue) experienced by patients receiving regorafenib. Increased awareness of potential adverse events associated with regorafenib and the implementation of proactive strategies to prevent, monitor, and manage these events early in the course of treatment will be instrumental in ensuring optimal patient management and continuation of regorafenib therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CORRECT trial</kwd><kwd>adverse-event management</kwd><kwd>multikinase inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in the understanding of colon cancer biology have led to a new era in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).<xref rid="b1-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The development of biologics to specifically target variable steps in carcinogenesis and metastasis have been incorporated into first- and second-line mCRC treatment strategies, broadening the spectrum of therapies for this disease.<xref rid="b3-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Standard treatments include cytotoxic regimens with fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan used in combination or sequentially plus monoclonal antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Chemotherapy combinations with bevacizumab that specially target VEGF-A or combinations with cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor monoclonal antibody) for patients with a <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type tumor are now standard first-line treatment options.<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For second-line therapy, combinations of other cytotoxic agents and biologics, with continued use of anti-angiogenic agents, are recommended.

The recommended dose of regorafenib for future studies was determined to be 160 mg for 21 days, followed by 7 days off treatment (in repeating 28-day cycles). Additionally, this trial provided preliminary evidence of regorafenib&#x02019;s antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors. Therefore, an expansion cohort of patients with refractory mCRC was included in the extension phase of the study.<xref rid="b8-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the expansion study, regorafenib was generally well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity. For example, 70% of patients with mCRC achieved stable disease while on regorafenib and 4% had a partial response as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.<xref rid="b8-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> According to RECIST, &#x0201c;stable disease&#x0201d; is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.<xref rid="b9-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> &#x0201c;Partial response&#x0201d; is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.<xref rid="b9-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The CORRECT (Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated with Regorafenib or Placebo After Failure of Standard Therapy) trial was a Phase III randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with mCRC after disease progression during or within 3 months of completing all standard treatments.<xref rid="b10-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The early findings from the CORRECT trial show that regorafenib provided statistically significant benefits in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) meeting its prespecified stopping criteria for efficacy. Regorafenib is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and several other regulatory agencies for the treatment of mCRC.<xref rid="b12-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The most recent version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#x02019;s (NCCN) guidelines recommends regorafenib after progression on fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if the tumor is <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy.<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For example, in patients with <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant tumors, regorafenib may be used following a second progression on FOLFOX (leucovorin [folinic acid], 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan), when administered with bevacizumab.<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In patients with <italic>KRAS</italic>-wild-type tumors, regorafenib may be used following a second progression on FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, as long as bevacizumab and cetuximab were used in either first- or second-line.<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In accordance with NCCN guidelines, clinicians may also consider enrolling patients who maintain adequate performance status and end-organ function into clinical trials, including Phase I trials, after at least two progressions on standard treatments.<xref rid="b4-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The following review summarizes the clinical outcomes of the CORRECT trial and discusses the clinical use of regorafenib, including dosing, adverse effects, and the management of toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase III CORRECT study</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>CORRECT was an international, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with mCRC who had progressed during or within 3 months of previous standard-of-care therapy (ie, a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and cetuximab or panitumumab if the tumor was <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type).<xref rid="b11-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The primary endpoint was OS. The secondary endpoints included PFS, objective tumor response rate (assessed every 8 weeks), disease control rate, safety, and health-related quality-of-life analysis.

Patients were stratified by prior VEGF therapy, time from diagnosis (&#x02264;18 or &#x0003c;18 months), and geographical region. No crossover between treatment groups was allowed. The study used a 90% power to detect a 33.3% increase in median OS (the primary endpoint), assuming a 4.5-month median OS for the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] =0.75).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Efficacy results</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survival analysis</title><p>The study met its prespecified stopping criteria for efficacy at the second preplanned interim analysis of OS (after 432 events).

In contrast to OS subgroup analysis, patients with both colon and rectal cancers showed longer PFS over placebo, suggesting that regorafenib has clinical benefit in both tumor types.

This type of analysis is beneficial and worthy of further evaluation in more patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Regorafenib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade that occurred in &#x02265;10% of patients in the CORRECT study included fatigue, decreased appetite and food intake, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE, diarrhea, mucositis, weight loss, infection, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cmar-6-093">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="b12-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and hyperbilirubinemia were observed in some patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cmar-6-093">Table 2</xref>). The majority of the elevations in AST, ALT, and bilirubin were grade 1 and 2 AEs, and clinically nonsignificant.<xref rid="b11-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Notably, the discontinuation rate due to drug-related AEs was low for regorafenib-treated patients (8.2% vs 1.2% for placebo-treated patients), suggesting that many AEs can be generally managed over the treatment course.</p><p>Interestingly, most AEs occurred early in the treatment course, during cycles 1 and 2, and their incidence decreased over subsequent cycles of therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cmar-6-093">Figure 3</xref>).<xref rid="b16-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Further, the dosing of regorafenib remained relatively stable after three cycles of treatment, and there was no evidence of cumulative toxicity.<xref rid="b12-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b17-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These data suggest that the incidence of drug-related AEs decreases over time, and that proactive AE management early on may help to decrease the incidence or severity of those AEs that occur during the course of treatment, thus enabling better treatment compliance and adherence to therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>AE management</title><p>Clinical experience has shown that certain side effects associated with regorafenib, most notably HFSR, skin rash, and hypertension, are also associated with other MKIs.<xref rid="b18-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development of these toxicities are not well understood.<xref rid="b18-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It has been suggested that HFSR may be an indirect effect of the combined inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR.<xref rid="b19-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Inhibition of these receptors could potentially interfere with vascular repair mechanisms, resulting in HFSR in high-pressure areas that are exposed to subclinical trauma.<xref rid="b19-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> As for MKI-induced hypertension, it has been proposed that the increase in blood pressure may be the result of abnormalities in endothelial function due to impaired angiogenesis.<xref rid="b18-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these MKI-induced toxicities is needed, recommendations on how to proactively manage those AEs during the course of treatment can help optimize treatment compliance and adherence to therapy.</p><sec><title>HFSR</title><p>In the CORRECT trial, 47% of patients treated with regorafenib experienced HFSR compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo.<xref rid="b11-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> HFSR may develop soon after a patient starts therapy, usually within the first 2&#x02013;4 weeks of initiating treatment.<xref rid="b19-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> HFSR usually manifests on skin surfaces where there is pressure or friction and is characterized by asymmetric localized hyperkeratotic lesions surrounded by erythematous regions. The affected areas become painful scaly lesions that may blister and thicken, significantly interfering with the patient&#x02019;s everyday activities. Management of HFSR begins with prophylactic measures that were utilized in the CORRECT study protocol and are described below.<xref rid="b16-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Proactive AE management should be implemented before skin lesions develop; this approach may lessen the severity and shorten the duration of the condition.<xref rid="b16-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Prior to treatment, patients should remove any calluses on their hands and feet. A pumice stone is recommended for callus or &#x0201c;rough spot&#x0201d; removal, and, when indicated, a pedicure and/or manicure may be helpful. To help prevent callus formation during treatment, patients should avoid pressure points and items that rub, pinch, or create friction. Pressure points and tender areas should be protected with cotton gloves/socks. Patients should wear well-padded, well-fitting shoes. Foot soaks with tepid water and Epsom salts and the use of insole cushions or inserts should help protect tender areas of the feet. Hands should be protected with padded gloves when engaging in activities that might irritate or damage the skin. Non-urea-based creams should be applied liberally to soften the skin of the hands and feet, while keratolytic creams, containing urea or salicylic acid 6% can be used sparingly on affected (hyperkeratotic) areas. Alpha hydroxyl acid-based creams (5%&#x02013;8%) can be applied liberally two times a day to gently exfoliate callused skin.<xref rid="b16-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Although the prophylactic use of urea-based cream was not part of the CORRECT trial, the prophylactic topical use of urea-based cream has been shown to help prevent and/or delay the incidence of HFSR associated with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid="b21-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Additional measures to minimize the risk of HFSR include avoiding hot water when washing, showering, and bathing, and avoiding clothing that rubs or irritates the skin. While these practical measures may be used to manage grade 1 symptoms, effective management of grade 2 and grade 3 symptoms might require dose modifications or interruptions.

One open-label, international Phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib when given with modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX6) as first-line treatment in patients with mCRC.<xref rid="b35-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The study showed that regorafenib, when combined with mFOLFOX6, has an acceptable safety profile. While this study reported some efficacy for regorafenib and FOLFOX, definitive conclusions cannot be made from a single arm study. Another ongoing Phase II study is the randomized, multicenter, placebo- controlled US trial of regorafenib in combination with FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in patients with mCRC.<xref rid="b36-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This trial is designed to compare PFS between regorafenib plus FOLFIRI (Arm A) versus placebo plus FOLFIRI (Arm B) in patients with mCRC who were previosly treated with a FOLFOX regimen.</p><p>In addition, because of the high unmet need for treatment options in this patient population, a Phase IIIB, prospective, interventional, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (CONSIGN) is designed to provide regorafenib to patients diagnosed with mCRC who have failed after standard therapy and for whom no therapy alternatives exist.<xref rid="b37-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> CONSIGN provides early access in countries where regorafenib has not yet been approved, and will collect safety data for regorafenib until market access.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CORRECT is the first randomized placebo-controlled Phase III study of an oral MKI to have showed efficacy and safety in patients with heavily pretreated mCRC who progressed on prior standard-of-care treatments. All patients had received prior treatment with bevacizumab and fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Patients with <italic>KRAS</italic>-wild-type tumors had received prior treatment with cetuximab and/or panitumumab.<xref rid="b10-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The study shows that regorafenib provides survival benefits in mCRC that has progressed after all standard therapies. The safety profile of regorafenib in CORRECT indicates that it is a generally well-tolerated treatment with manageable AEs using current clinical practice and proposed risk-management guidelines. The AEs associated with regorafenib treatment are consistent with those routinely managed by oncologists. Moreover, a comprehensive health-related quality-of-life analysis showed that there were no significant differences in patient quality of life between those individuals receiving regorafenib and those receiving placebo.<xref rid="b11-cmar-6-093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Overall, the approval of regorafenib represents a new standard-of-care therapy for heavily pretreated patients who previously had little to no treatment options.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Editorial support for this manuscript was provided by Precept Medical Communications (Warren, NJ, USA).
