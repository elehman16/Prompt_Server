From 1994 to 1998, 4,604 households residing in distressed inner-city housing in five U.S. cities were randomized to three experimental groups. A
<italic>control</italic> group received no housing voucher; a
<italic>traditional voucher</italic> group received a standard &#x02018;Section 8&#x02019; housing voucher; and a
<italic>low-poverty voucher</italic> group received an experimental type of voucher usable only for housing located in a low-poverty area. Adults and children in the MTO households were surveyed in 2001 and 2011 to assess a variety of economic and mental health outcomes.</p><p>A 2003 MTO Interim Evaluation
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (4&#x02013;7 years after randomization) revealed an interesting interaction between gender and housing mobility, with respect to outcomes of delinquency and risky behavior: girls benefited, but boys did not. This finding, somewhat at odds with earlier research
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, spurred subsequent explanatory efforts
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>In 2014, Kessler
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> published an analysis of the Final Youth Evaluation (10&#x02013;15 years after randomization), reporting statistically significant and numerically substantial voucher effects on several psychiatric diagnoses in boys. Compared with controls, boys from low-poverty voucher households exhibited elevated 12-month prevalence of PTSD (6.2% vs 1.9%; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6&#x02013;7.4]) and &#x02018;conduct disorder&#x02019; (6.4% vs 2.1%; OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.7&#x02013;5.8]). One of us (DCN) has previously suggested
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> that these results are open to criticism on
<italic>construct validity</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> grounds. While working to define a protocol for empirically exploring this question, however, DCN learned that the PTSD outcome in
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> was imputed in a manner that invites scrutiny at the more basic level of
<italic>statistical conclusion validity</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><sec><title>PTSD outcome imputation by Kessler
<italic>et al.</italic>
</title><p>Although the report by Kessler
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> describes in some detail the imputation of missing
<italic>covariates</italic> in the Final Youth Evaluation, it does not indicate that its PTSD outcome was in fact imputed. This imputation initially came to attention through a footnote on page 38 of
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, and was subsequently confirmed in a (Nov 2014) communication from the original authors.</p><p>The MTO Final Youth Survey employed an abridged, computerized self-administered version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The full version of the CIDI was used in the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), where its PTSD diagnostic algorithm was found to have a "moderate" concordance (AUC, 0.79) with diagnoses obtained through clinical diagnostic interviews
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The abridgment of the MTO instrument prevented direct application of the CIDI diagnostic algorithms in the MTO, however. Instead, CIDI algorithm-derived lifetime PTSD diagnoses in the NCS Replication survey (NCS-R) were regressed on responses to those PTSD-related questions which were retained in the MTO instrument, and the resulting (logistic) regression model was used to impute PTSD diagnoses for the MTO Final Youth Survey respondents. (In addition to the retained PTSD-related questions, the &#x02018;obligatory&#x02019; variables
<italic>age, sex</italic> and
<italic>race</italic> were also included as regressors; see
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Imputation was performed by Bernoulli draws consistent with the (logit) probabilities yielded by this regression equation. Responses to questions about recency of symptoms were in turn used to compute 12-month prevalence diagnoses from these imputed lifetime diagnoses.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Table 1. </label><caption><title>Coefficients of the logistic regression model used to impute PTSD outcomes in Kessler

<bold><italic>The imputation is superfluous</italic></bold>. Viewed as a link in the chain of the analysis, the imputation itself appears superfluous. It introduces an information-destroying and noise-generating transformation of the predictive model&#x02019;s real-valued outputs&#x02014;logit probabilities on the continuous interval (&#x02013;&#x0221e;, &#x0221e;)&#x02014;to pseudorandom &#x02018;outcomes&#x02019; in the set {
<italic>no</italic>,
<italic>yes</italic>}. In order to interpret conclusions about these imputed outcomes as if they were conclusions about real PTSD, it would be necessary to defend the outputs of the predictive model as genuine probabilities. But if these were true probabilities, then they could be analyzed
<italic>directly</italic>, without interposing a noisy and information-destroying pseudorandom number generation (RNG) step.</p><p>
<bold><italic>It makes the reported CIs strictly artifactual</italic></bold>. Because a logistic regression model has no error term, the confidence intervals reported for the logistic regression of imputed PTSD on voucher treatment in Kessler
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> convey only the uncertainty arising from the RNG sampling performed to impute the PTSD outcomes. All of the substantive sources of uncertainty lurk in the specification and estimation of the imputation model, procedures that are opaque to a reader of
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>
<bold><italic>The model specification appears desultory</italic></bold>. The specification of this
<italic>outcome</italic>-imputation model gives every impression that it was regarded as purely phenomenological, and that it was specified, estimated and checked in the desultory manner customary for imputation of missing
<italic>covariates</italic>. The model shows no evidence of an attempt to include additional predictors (beyond the &#x02018;obligatory&#x02019; age/sex/race) that the MTO Final Youth Survey shared with NCS-R. No bootstrap-validation is described, nor is any other investigation of the predictive performance of the model in the NCS-R population against which it was estimated. No shrinkage was applied to correct for overfitting
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The model coefficients themselves (see
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) seem uninterpretable in causal terms, unless it can be supposed (e.g.) that being badly beaten in childhood confers protection from PTSD in nearly equal measure to the PTSD risk incurred from a sexual assault/molestation.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Generalizability of NCS-R to MTO is doubtful</italic></bold>. Even if the use of an outcomes-imputation model had been described in
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, and if its performance had been rigorously investigated and overfitting addressed, the question of
<italic>generalizability</italic> from NCS-R to MTO populations would still remain open. Most plainly, the NCS-R and MTO Youth populations barely overlap in age (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Also important may be the
<italic>qualitative</italic> differences expected between the general-population sample of NCS-R and the inner-city MTO Youth sample, with regard to their traumatic exposures and their sources of resilience relevant to PTSD.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>Age distributions of the NCS-R and MTO Youth surveys.</title><p>The PTSD imputation model used in

This situation creates a compelling rationale for reproduction and reanalysis of such research. The work presented here is, we believe, the first independent attempt to reproduce or reanalyze published results from MTO. (HUD informed us that our March 5, 2015 application for an MTO data license was the first such request received by them.)</p><p>A frequentist confidence interval should be understood as abstracting away the arbitrariness immanent in a point estimate, by situating that estimate within the context of an
<italic>ensemble</italic> of imagined &#x02018;possible replications&#x02019;. Regrettably, in much current statistical practice only the arbitrariness of a
<italic>sampling procedure</italic> typically is recognized and objectively accounted for
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Yet other forms of arbitrariness, such as
<italic>overfitting</italic> and
<italic>model selection</italic>, are equally amenable to similar &#x02018;contextualization&#x02019; by bootstrapping techniques such as we employ here. (Indeed, we have structured our reanalysis so as to accentuate this frequentist abstracting-and-contextualizing idiom; our
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> present a direct visual analogue of the
<italic>ensemble</italic>, which we hope will prove broadly accessible to social scientists. A reanalysis performed strictly for a professional statistical audience would dispense with explicit seed variation, instead simply increasing the number of multiple imputations performed from 20 to 1000; it would likewise have done away entirely with the imputation of a binary PTSD outcome, substituting a direct analysis of the PTSD probabilities.)</p><p>The confidence intervals reported in
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> account only for the sampling inherent in the MTO design. Our bootstrapping analysis further abstracts away (1) arbitrariness arising when Kessler
<italic>et al.</italic> fixed their PTSD imputation model at its maximum-likelihood estimate as if known with infinite precision; (2) the arbitrariness of what appears to have been a desultory model specification; (3) some purely technical forms of arbitrariness appearing in the form of sensitivity to RNG seed selection. While we have achieved only
<italic>partial</italic> abstraction of these forms of arbitrariness, and have not addressed
<italic>overfitting</italic>, it does appear that the original claim of &#x02018;statistical significance&#x02019; for a voucher-on-PTSD effect in MTO boys withstands the formal challenge of our reanalysis as planned. That is to say, a randomly selected confidence interval from
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> or
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> typically sits above the
<italic>OR</italic> = 1 threshold.</p><p>What is clear enough, however, is that a statistical analysis that randomly selects its &#x02018;findings&#x02019; from
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> or
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> cannot be recommended for its wholesome frequentist properties. Indeed, the evident clustering of variance within certain (combinations of) seed choices disallows any straightforward attempt to compute a single, wider confidence interval from these bootstrap samples.</p><p>The main contribution of our reanalysis may be simply to bring enough transparency to an otherwise obscure PTSD imputation procedure (1) to avert its application in further research, and (2) to encourage exploration of alternative modes of analysis of the interesting and important social-scientific and policy questions surrounding the MTO boys&#x02019; exposures&#x02014;and responses&#x02014;to violence.</p><p>The close scrutiny involved in a reanalysis of this kind inevitably brings to light aspects of the original analysis which could not have been anticipated, provoking questions not pre-specified as part of the reanalysis. We are now interested to know the statistical impact of including in the original analysis
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (and likewise in the present reanalysis) 456 uninterviewed MTO boys for whom little more than baseline covariates were available&#x02014;especially in light of the fact that the PTSD imputation
<italic>preceded</italic> the multiple imputation of missing covariates. We hope to address this question in a subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have reproduced and reanalyzed a key finding reported by Kessler

The paper is a good illustration of what can be achieved by data sharing and rigorous re-analysis.</p><p> Specifically, the issues of dealing with missing data are relevant, and especially outcomes-imputation methods. Imputation of missing outcome is anyway controversial; Von Hippel proposed a Multiple Imputation then Deletion (MID) approach, which has some appeal but was not supported by a recent study, which argued that auxiliary variables could be beneficial in this situation to impute missing Y (Sullivan, 2015). The Von Hippel and Sullivan papers need to be discussed briefly as educational efforts in the current paper, in line with the paragraph:
<bold><italic>The imputation is superfluous.</italic></bold>
</p><p> There is 2 main issues in the specific hypothesis studied related to housing vouchers: effect estimate and uncertainty in the effect.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The MTO project had a strong design, with randomization to 3 groups for evaluation of the intervention. The specific outcomes highlighted here are psychiatric diagnoses, among which PTSD; this was one of many outcomes evaluated perhaps, and not the primary outcome of this study. This brings in a multiple comparisons problem, which may be emphasized more by the current authors.</p><p> We now focus on one association that stood out among many associations that were probably evaluated. First we may wonder whether we should adjust formally for multiple testing, such as a classical Bonferroni correction for the p-value. Second, we know that the strength of the association will be overestimated, even if a true association.</p><p> The suggested boys vs girls interaction further complicates the multiple comparison issue; essentially all analyses are doubled.&#x000a0; I would like some further discussion on these broader issues of interpreting research findings (Ioannadis, 2014).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Uncertainty is usually expressed as a 95% confidence interval; the current study appropriately highlights that multiple sources of uncertainty may need to be considered, specifically in the context of multiple imputation.</p></list-item></list> Overall, this paper is an interesting contribution to statistical aspects on modern analysis. It illustrates that different researchers may use different methods and approaches. It also shows some progress in scientific methods, e.g. the use of bootstrapping is now more feasible than some years ago due to ever increasing computational power.&#x000a0; This type of reanalysis is to be applauded and stimulated to increase the credibility of scientific research findings.</p><p>I have read this submission.
