Preclinical testing has shown most are potent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. Likewise, mucosal tissue and animal models have evaluated unformulated and formulated drugs, with most candidates showing promise for human clinical testing.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> These data provide proof-of-concept that most candidate microbicide products, when tested using in vitro assays and animal models, are effective against HIV. However, with the exception of 2 trials,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> numerous formulated drugs evaluated in phase 2b/3 clinical trials failed to demonstrate efficacy and in some cases have increased HIV acquisition.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Limitations exist for all of the preclinical testing models as none can fully recapitulate product use by a participant. Consequently, new models are needed.</p><p>The ex vivo challenge assay is the next development in testing product efficacy. This assay entails participants using a study product for a period of time followed by mucosal tissue collection via biopsies that are transported to a laboratory and exposed to HIV.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Using this method, participants applied aqueous-based gels containing UC781,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> tenofovir,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> or their respective vehicle controls rectally, followed by colonic biopsy extraction and exposure of the biopsy tissue to HIV in the laboratory. For both drugs, there was a dose&#x02013;response where higher tissue drug levels correlated to reduced viral replication.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The use of the ex vivo challenge assay with female genital tract tissue has been more challenging due to the restriction on the number and frequency of mucosal sampling. Nevertheless, cervical and vaginal tissues have been assessed for HIV replication<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> and used to evaluate 3 dosage forms (aqueous gel, film, and vaginal ring [VR]) of 2 drugs (dapivirine [DPV] and maraviroc [MVC]).<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Findings from these studies have again identified dose&#x02013;responses between higher tissue drug levels and reduced viral replication.</p><p>Expanding the utility of this assay to multiple sites in a clinical trial is a priority as it will streamline testing and increase diversity of populations for pharmacogenomic considerations.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> To accomplish site expansion, capacity must be built or tissue must be cryopreserved. Because of the complexity of developing the infrastructure needed for exposing tissue to HIV, cryopreserving tissue at the clinical sites is a more feasible option. Multiple sites could participate in the clinical study; collect, cryopreserve and ship the mucosal tissue to a central laboratory for processing. Using this approach, Microbicide Trials Network (MTN)-013/International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) 026 was designed as a multisite clinical study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of VRs containing DPV/MVC, DPV only, MVC only, or no drug (placebo).<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> VRs were fitted and after 28 days the rings were removed and specimens were collected including blood plasma, cervicovaginal fluid (CVF), and cervical tissue biopsies for PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. To compare the feasibility of cryopreserving tissue, 1 site immediately used the cervical tissues (fresh) for the ex vivo challenge assay, while 2 other sites cryopreserved and shipped the cervical tissue to a central laboratory. Here, we characterize the PK/PD relationships using fresh and cryopreserved tissue to determine their utility for use in the ex vivo challenge assay.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>MTN-013/IPM 026 (NCT01363037) was a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 48 HIV-negative sexually abstinent women randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of the 4 study arms (25&#x0200a;mg DPV/100&#x0200a;mg MVC, 25&#x0200a;mg DPV only, 100&#x0200a;mg MVC only, or placebo) at 3 clinical sites (Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; and Pittsburgh, PA).<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> The sites received IRB approval prior to initiation of the protocol. This sample size was based upon the size of similar phase 1 studies of vaginal microbicide products. Study arm randomization was stratified by site to ensure balanced assignment of products at each site and was generated and maintained by the statisticians. The statisticians provided each study site with 1 set of randomization envelopes to be stored and used in the study clinic. A sufficient number of envelopes were assigned to each site so that they could enroll up to 24 participants. Clinic staff assigned these envelopes in sequential order, by envelope number, to eligible participants. Each randomization envelope included study product arm randomization assignment as well as end of study period PK/PD sampling time assignment.

The ex vivo challenge assay was developed for use in early phase clinical trials to more accurately link drug levels to protection against HIV infection. An advantage of the ex vivo challenge assay is that mucosal tissue is removed after the participant has used the product, allowing the formulated drug to interact in vivo, so that compartmental drug levels and suppression of HIV in the laboratory can be correlated postproduct use. Models that define drug levels necessary for HIV suppression can provide information on efficacy and dosing to improve product formulation. Once optimized, the ex vivo challenge assay results could inform researchers on the estimated drug levels necessary for consistent HIV suppression thus creating a biomarker for large clinical trials. Expanding to multiple clinical sites would allow individuals from diverse racial and geographic populations to participate in a clinical trial using the ex vivo challenge assay as a biomarker for clinical efficacy in these early stage studies. Currently, a lab equipped for the performance of the ex vivo challenge assay needs to be in close proximity to the participant population as fresh tissue samples are prepared for assay within 30 minutes of biopsy. To use this assay in diverse geographic regions, the tissue samples would ideally be cryopreserved immediately after collection and shipped to a central laboratory for testing. The MTN-013/IPM 026 multisite clinical trial provided the opportunity to compare fresh (Pittsburgh) and cryopreserved (Birmingham and Boston) tissue for use in the ex vivo challenge assay. More robust HIV replication was found using the fresh compared to cryopreserved tissue. Consequently, linear dose&#x02013;response relationships between drug levels and viral replication were only found when fresh tissue was used for the ex vivo challenge assay.</p><p>HIV prevention research has been primarily focused on tenofovir-based regimens with several clinical trials evaluating tenofovir gel. Tenofovir is a prodrug and needs to be metabolized intracellularly to tenofovir diphosphate to be effective as a DNA chain terminator and inhibit HIV replication. One trial evaluating tenofovir gel for rectal use utilized the ex vivo challenge assay to define PD/PK correlates.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Strong negative correlations, lower HIV cumulative p24 levels associated with higher tenofovir drug levels, were found in isolated mucosal immune cell populations and mucosal tissue, while a weak negative correlation with the luminal fluid and no correlation with blood plasma were determined.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> These data show the best correlations were derived using the PK matrix closest to the PD matrix (tissue/mucosal immune cells) and are similar to the findings presented here using fresh tissue with different antiretroviral drugs. Collectively, these data suggest the PK/PD relationships should be developed using the same matrices or those closest to each other.</p><p>DPV concentrations in fresh tissue were associated with significantly reduced cumulative p24 levels. A nonlinear dose&#x02013;response model for the relationship between fresh tissue p24 and tissue DPV drug levels was tested where DPV concentrations above 100&#x0200a;ng/mL (&#x0003e;300&#x0200a;nM) would be needed to suppress 50% or more of HIV growth found in placebo, untreated, subject biopsy tissue. The single agent and combination rings demonstrated similar in vitro DPV release and suppression of HIV. DPV levels in the cervical tissue ranged from 50 to 14,170&#x0200a;ng/mL, which equates to 152&#x0200a;nM to 430&#x0200a;&#x003bc;M, with a median DPV level of &#x0003e;1800&#x0200a;nM.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> These tissue levels are consistent with another clinical trial evaluating a similar DPV single agent VR with tissue DPV levels ranging between 140&#x0200a;nM and 14&#x0200a;&#x003bc;M.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Tissue drug transporters are not known for DPV, but drug is lost quickly after removal of the ring.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Thus, higher tissue DPV concentrations may be achieved while the VR is in use and should exceed the amount needed to block HIV infection in the majority of ring users. Indeed, it was recently shown that use of a DPV VR by more than 2600 women in a phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated a significant reduction of HIV acquisition with higher adherence demonstrating better efficacy.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Unfortunately, MVC failed to achieve measureable drug levels in the majority of fresh cervical tissues and in plasma, thus no PK/PD correlations could be made. It is currently unclear why MVC levels in these matrices were BLQ as drug was released from the ring as shown here (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and with analysis of the used VRs from the participants showing &#x0223c;5&#x0200a;mg of the 100&#x0200a;mg of MVC was released over 28 days of use.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Higher MVC levels in CVF were associated with reduced cumulative p24 in fresh tissues, similar to that achieved with DPV. Of interest, the MVC levels obtained in the CVF samples were greater for the single agent as compared to the combination ring. Indeed, tissues with detectable MVC were from the MVC only VR group. This trend was not unexpected based on the varied release rates obtained for MVC from the in vitro studies. Lack of quantifiable MVC could be partially due to active transport out of the tissue by the P-glycoprotein/MDR1 transporter which is highly expressed in the female genital tract<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> and impacted MVC accumulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> The amount of drug released from the VR may not have been sufficient to overcome this efflux.</p><p>Cryobiological techniques were first used in 1949 with the discovery of the cryoprotective properties of glycerol to preserve sperm.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Since then, cryopreservation of cells, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, are routinely performed using DMSO with a constant cooling rate, typically 1&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C/minute and storage &#x02264;&#x02212;150&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C. DMSO and glycerol decrease ice crystal formation inside the cells, reducing cell damage. However, these agents can be toxic so care is taken to minimize exposure of cells/tissue at room temperature. At Birmingham and Boston, cervical tissue was cryopreserved using a standard peripheral blood mononuclear cells cryopreservation protocol. At study end, the biopsies were sent to the central laboratory to be thawed and washed to ensure removal of the DMSO. The cryopreserved tissue did not show robust HIV replication as compared to the fresh tissue and thus PK/PD correlations with DPV or MVC could not be reliably assessed. Although tissue viability was not determined due to the limited number of biopsies collected, a previous report demonstrated good retention of cervical tissue viability and equivalence of HIV replication between fresh and &#x0201c;snap-frozen&#x0201d; tissue (frozen without a CPA).<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> This is in contrast to another study demonstrating cryopreserved colonic tissue was not reproducibly infected with HIV and showed moderate to severe histological damage despite retention of metabolic activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> The paucity and inconsistency of published studies indicate that the various potential methods for cryopreservation of mucosal tissues have not been systematically evaluated. This is important because optimal cryopreservation will likely allow for more robust and reproducible viral replication, comparable to infection of fresh tissues. Biobanks have been cryopreserving skin to help with wound healing, in particular for burn victims, for several decades. The use of DMSO is common in these applications.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Recently the inclusion of trehalose with DMSO has shown improved tissue viability and decreased wound healing time when tissues were engrafted onto recipients as compared to tissues cryopreserved with DMSO alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> Trehalose is a carbohydrate found in prokaryotes and invertebrates and is thought to stabilize proteins and membranes when the organism undergoes stress such as heat, cold, oxidation, and desiccation.<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> The use of a nonpenetrating CPA (trehalose) with a penetrating CPA (DMSO) may benefit mucosal tissue viability for use in the ex vivo challenge assay. Independent of the cryopreservation method, it is conceivable that penetration of the chosen CPA into the tissue/cells could modify the drug content by solubilizing it. As the cells are warmed, the CPA leaves and water enters the cell, which could flush the solubilized drug out of the tissue/cells, which is then washed away. This could affect the drug's impact on HIV infectivity ex vivo. The use of trehalose may off-set the osmotic changes by increasing the osmolality of the extracellular solution creating an &#x0201c;osmotic buffer,&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup> but this remains to be tested. How osmotic changes that occur during freezing and thawing affect drug concentration in tissues collected after product use is not known and more work is needed to understand this issue.</p><p>In summary, HIV challenge of fresh cervical tissue and tissue DPV levels provided the best PK/PD correlations. The further removed the PK matrix (tissue&#x0200a;&#x02248;&#x0200a;CVF&#x0200a;&#x02260;&#x0200a;plasma) was from the tissue the weaker was the DPV-associated HIV suppression. Lack of sufficient MVC in the tissue and plasma precluded testing of PK/PD dose&#x02013;response relationships in these compartments. However, a PK/PD dose&#x02013;response was found with MVC in the CVF which was consistent with DPV-mediated virus suppression in the fresh tissue for the ex vivo challenge assay. Cryopreserved tissue did not support HIV replication and thus did not allow us to define PK/PD dose&#x02013;responses. Although optimizing a cryopreservation protocol for tissue to allow for reproducible HIV replication is needed, the impact cryopreservation may have on tissue drug content needs to be defined. Expanding the clinical sites to include those that can collect, cryopreserve the tissues, and ship to a central laboratory remains elusive at this time. Although these data provide additional support for the incorporation of the ex vivo challenge assay into early clinical trials, the implementation of the ex vivo challenge assay should be in laboratories with adequate resources and in close proximity to the clinical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the participants who enrolled into MTN-013/IPM 026 for their willingness to be involved in research.
