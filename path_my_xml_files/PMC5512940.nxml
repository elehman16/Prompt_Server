Optimizing wheelchair skills can positively influence wheelchair use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and may reduce risk of accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the mobility dependence of more than 50% of older wheelchair users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although 5&#x000a0;h or less of manual wheelchair skills training effectively improves wheelchair skills capacity when administered by a healthcare professional in rehabilitation or community contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], older adults receive little to no wheelchair skills training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Results of a recent survey from a rehabilitation centre highlight this issue, as only 55% of adults (~58&#x000a0;years of age) reported receiving wheelchair skills training before discharge. The remaining 45% did not know of arrangements to receive any training after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Wheelchair skills training facilitated by health care professionals during initial rehabilitation may be inhibited by clinician-perceived barriers of limited time and resources, clinicians&#x02019; skills and knowledge of wheelchair training, competing priorities during rehabilitation stays, and readiness for wheelchair use among patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, many older adults procure wheelchairs independently in the community (e.g., directly from vendors, secondhand, or online) without clinical guidance and likely do not receive any training at all. While community-based training programs may address issues related to scheduling, readiness, and procurement of wheelchairs without the advice of a clinician, reliance solely on clinicians to implement such programs may pose additional burden and inferred healthcare costs.</p><p id="Par13">The concept of wheelchair use self-efficacy, defined as an individual&#x02019;s belief in his or her ability to overcome challenging situations when using a wheelchair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], is a powerful mediator of use and participation in older manual wheelchair users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Self-efficacy, important for adult learning, is enhanced when individuals learn from people they perceive to be similar to themselves and who are managing similar situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, implementing peers to facilitate interventions may provide an effective strategy for modeling wheelchair use. A peer-led wheelchair training program showed preliminary effectiveness for improving wheelchair use self-efficacy and wheelchair skills in adult MWC users 19&#x000a0;years of age and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Additional benefits of a peer-led program may include increased social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or improved cost-effectiveness when compared to professional-led interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, peer-led wheelchair programs may provide an avenue for fostering a needed continuum of wheelchair skills training that starts during initial rehabilitation and continues after community reintegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, before proceeding with larger effectiveness trials, it is critical to first evaluate the feasibility of peer-led wheelchair training for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Establishing feasibility will confirm key issues related to a study&#x02019;s process and resources. Additionally, findings from feasibility studies can be used to optimize the design of subsequent effectiveness trials and judge appropriateness of proceeding with larger trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Considering the need for community-based training for older adult MWC users and the importance of establishing feasibility, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a peer-led wheelchair training program called &#x0201c;Wheelchair training Self-Efficacy Enhanced for Use (WheelSeeU)&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The specific study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility according to the following indicators: (1) <italic>process issues</italic>: recruitment rate, consent rate, retention rate, and perceived benefit; (2) <italic>resource issues</italic>: participant adherence, trainer adherence, burden of data collection, and translation of study materials; (3) <italic>management issues</italic>: participant processing time, combining data in English and French, study protocol administration, and fidelity of WheelSeeU intervention; and (4) <italic>safety</italic>: safety during the intervention and data collection (modified from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par17">A full description of the methods has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par30">Recruitment took place between October 2013 and March 2016 using the following recruitment strategies: database of existing wheelchair users, clinicians, and vendors described the study to inpatients and outpatients at a local rehabilitation centre; posters and presentations given to special interest groups in the community; mail-outs to potential participants as identified by hospital records; social media (i.e., Facebook page); and word-of-mouth. The protocol for this study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards at the University of British Columbia, Institut de r&#x000e9;adaptation en d&#x000e9;ficience physique de Qu&#x000e9;bec, and Vancouver Coastal Health in Vancouver. All study participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization and concealment</title><p id="Par31">The randomization procedure was designed by an offsite statistician and consisted of stratification by site using block sizes of four or six (to allow for randomization of pairs of participants). When two participants were enrolled, the Tester completed baseline data collection and entered data into a secure database. The Site Coordinator then contacted the statistician to obtain group assignment for the pair of participants within 48&#x000a0;h. The Site Coordinator forwarded participant contact information to the appropriate group trainer (i.e., intervention or control group), who contacted both participants to schedule six training sessions. Therefore, randomization was concealed from the Tester at all time points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention and control groups</title><p id="Par32">The WheelSeeU intervention consisted of six (~weekly), 1.5-h wheelchair training sessions delivered by a peer-trainer and a support-trainer to two wheelchair users. Peer-trainers who were &#x02265;45&#x000a0;years of age, who had at least 5&#x000a0;years of experience using a wheelchair (with intermediate to advanced wheelchair skills), and support-trainers who had at least 5&#x000a0;years of clinical experience were recruited and trained in a 2-day workshop (~15&#x000a0;h) led by a study investigator (KB).</p><p id="Par33">WheelSeeU incorporated tasks known to challenge wheelchair use self-efficacy (e.g., navigating a MWC in the community, completing activities in a MWC, managing social situations in a MWC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]), but each session was individualized according to participant-defined goals. After introductions, the peer-trainer gave a brief presentation outlining expectations of WheelSeeU. The peer-trainer explained the SMART goal framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], then worked with participants at the beginning of WheelSeeU to define MWC mobility or participation-oriented goals. Goals were recorded, progression was monitored, and participants were encouraged to set new goals as their skills progressed. The peer-trainer and support-trainer worked together to break the goals into smaller task objectives (and to identify potential barriers), which helped them to form the training plan for each session. The task objectives were built into practice, as well as methods for overcoming barriers. The peer-trainer provided verbal instruction, demonstration, and feedback to participants (with help from the support-trainer when necessary). The peer-trainer debriefed the participants at the end of each session to recap goals and discussed how to integrate new skills into practice in the community and at home (i.e., provided homework). The peer-trainer took note of the participants&#x02019; homework, which formed the initial discussion for the next session. The support-trainer provided spotting during the practice of skills and intervened immediately if there was unsafe wheeling that could lead to tips or falls. The future intent of WheelSeeU is that it will be administered by a peer-trainer, with spotting provided by caregivers, family members, volunteers, or clinician assistants. However, given that this is a feasibility study of a novel intervention, it was prudent to ensure participant safety through the inclusion of a clinician support-trainer.</p><p id="Par34">Participants in the control group received six (~weekly) 1.5-h didactic sessions of information about using a wheelchair in the community (iWheel) led by a health care professional. The iWheel protocol, created specifically for this study, was designed to control for attention without providing any wheelchair skills training (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://millerresearch.osot.ubc.ca/">http://millerresearch.osot.ubc.ca</ext-link>). Each session started with an &#x0201c;icebreaker&#x0201d; activity (e.g., &#x0201c;MWC Jeopardy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Describe your dream vacation&#x0201d;), and then, information (and embedded questions) were presented on six topics: (1) accessible places in the community (e.g., How do you determine whether a place is accessible prior to going there?); (2) transportation (e.g., Describe your experiences using public transportation/ trains/ ferries/ airplanes?); (3) MWC set-up and maintenance (e.g., What regular maintenance do you do on your MWC?); (4) using computers (e.g., How do you use the internet?); (5) pain and fatigue management (e.g., What do you do to manage pain/ fatigue?); and (6) Physical activity and nutrition (e.g., What physical activities do you take part in using your MWC?). Pre-formatted questions were integrated to reduce the likelihood of spontaneous discussions about wheelchair skills among participants. A health care or research professional with at least 2&#x000a0;years of experience in rehabilitation research completed 6&#x000a0;h of iWheel training facilitated by a study investigator (KB). The iWheel trainer was instructed not to give any MWC skills training or advice on how to use a MWC in a better way.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcomes to assess feasibility</title><p id="Par35">Feasibility indicators for process, resources, management, and safety parameters were measured during study administration and at study end.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Process indicators</title><p id="Par36">

Following minor modifications to address three feasibility issues (recruitment rate, burden of data collection, and subject processing time), findings support conducting a larger clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of peer-led WheelSeeU training for older adults in the community.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Process</title><p id="Par77">Further consideration of how to best target older community-living adults who use MWCs may improve feasibility for recruiting older adults MWC users. About 6&#x000a0;months into recruiting, the eligibility criteria were slightly revised from &#x02265;55 to &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years of age to increase the potential participant pool. Revising eligibility criteria without reducing scientific rigor has been suggested as one approach for recruiting wheelchair users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the WheelSeeU study used various creative recruitment strategies at both sites to target wheelchair users, as suggested by Nary et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], recruitment posed a challenging issue. Recruitment methods in Vancouver included clinicians and vendors describing the study to inpatients and outpatients at a local rehabilitation centre, posters, and presentations to special interest groups in the community, and mail-outs to potential participants as identified by hospital records. Although we tried to reach additional participants through wheelchair vendors in the community, there was some reluctance to &#x02018;push&#x02019; a product that was not being sold by the company. All 26 participants in Qu&#x000e9;bec City were identified and recruited by a clinician through a database of wheelchair users at the Institut de r&#x000e9;adaptation en d&#x000e9;ficience physique de Qu&#x000e9;bec, which may explain why recruitment rates were higher in Qu&#x000e9;bec City compared to Vancouver. More research is needed to determine best methods for recruiting older community-living wheelchair users.</p><p id="Par78">Although a 49% consent rate is considered very high in rehabilitation research, recruitment issues identified in this study suggest that recruiting participants during initial rehabilitation may not be the best time for intermediate or advanced MWC training. In addition to clinician-perceived barriers of conducting wheelchair skills training during rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], issues of competing priorities, physical and psychological adjustments to mobility impairment, and lack of real-world experiences with using a wheelchair may influence the likelihood of new MWC users to participate. Therefore, community-based training programs like WheelSeeU may be better suited for older adults after they have had some time to experience the task demands of MWC use in the community.</p><p id="Par79">It is promising that participant retention was high at both time points (95% at T2 and 87.5% at T3) in both the experimental and control groups. All participants who completed the WheelSeeU intervention felt they benefited from the training, which has prompted the design of a qualitative study to obtain richer data about participants&#x02019; experiences and perceptions with a peer-led MWC training program. The WheelSeeU study used an active control group (iWheel) in efforts to increase participant adherence, which seemed to be well received by participants. While having an active control group may have been a less pragmatic approach in the evaluation of a novel intervention, this approach minimized threats to internal validity by controlling for researcher attention and travel to sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Resources</title><p id="Par80">The burden of data collection was higher than anticipated; however, no participants indicated issues with testing times. In fact, comments were made about enjoying the time with the tester in many cases. Participant and tester burden may be reduced through elimination of the objective WST from the protocol, which takes approximately 30&#x000a0;min to complete. Although WST-Q scores are highly correlated with objective WST scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the WST-Q may be a more valid indication of wheelchair skills capacity because participants are not penalized for technical testing errors (e.g., touching the line). Additionally, collecting only the participation component of the LLFDI may further reduce testing by 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min. Since WheelSeeU targets improved MWC mobility for the purpose of increasing participation outcomes, future trials should consider patient-reported outcomes to fully understand the impact of WheelSeeU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">It is promising that both participant and peer-trainer adherence to the intervention was high. Although all participants stated perceived benefits of WheelSeeU, the exact reasons for adherence are unknown. Qualitative interviews with participants who completed WheelSeeU may provide considerable insight about perceived facilitators and barriers influencing adherence and the important characteristics of peer-trainers (e.g., age, gender, previous experiences) that may inform the development of future studies and sustainable community-based programs. Qualitative interviews with participants in the control group may have provided useful information about the &#x0201c;attention-control&#x0201d; activity. The iWheel sessions provided participants with social activity and with resources about their community, which may have had potential perceived benefits for participants. Finally, qualitative interviews with those who accept and decline to participate in intervention research may also provide a better understanding of how to recruit MWC users for community-based programs. Findings from this study also support the feasibility of recruiting and maintaining a peer-trainer, which may positively contribute to the sustainability of community-based wheelchair training programs in the future.</p><p id="Par82">It is plausible that peer-led MWC training may be delivered to larger groups of MWC users in the community without the need for clinician presence, thus maximizing resources and potentially decreasing costs. However, prior to this, it is prudent to ensure that peer-trainers have the necessary characteristics and skill sets. This feasibility study allowed us to gain insight on some of the important characteristics of a peer-trainer (e.g., previous coaching/ peer-mentorship/teaching experience, wheelchair skills, wheelchair use confidence), thus suggesting prerequisites for future recruitment of peer-trainers. With the right peer-trainers, it is possible that clinicians or MWC training experts could be consulted as required. The feasibility nature of this study allowed us to explore the important characteristics of peer-trainers. However, due to pragmatic reasons (i.e., slow recruitment) and to maximize safety, the trainer to participant ratio was 2:2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Management</title><p id="Par83">While success on subject processing time was not achieved, the fact that participants remained interested in the study after a period of approximately 3&#x000a0;months is promising. For participants who were contacted during a rehabilitation stay, regular contact was maintained between the initial screening and enrolment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This also highlights the importance of providing wheelchair training at times that are convenient for participants and supports the necessity for wheelchair training that continues after discharge from initial rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par84">Intervention fidelity is critical to knowledge translation of evidence-based programs. With ~15&#x000a0;h of training, older MWC users and clinicians were able to administer a self-efficacy enhanced wheelchair training program. However, in some cases, the support-trainer took more of a lead role in the training than was intended. As the peer-trainer gained experience and felt more comfortable and confident in their role, they began to take to lead as intended. As stated by Green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], this reinforces the importance of peer-selection and ensuring peers receive adequate training. Although the current WheelSeeU program was co-led by a peer-trainer and a support-trainer, the future intent of WheelSeeU is to provide a peer-led program without the need for a healthcare professional. Future studies of peer-led wheelchair training should also consider ecological validity and the inability to control all protocol parameters in a real-world application of WheelSeeU. It has been suggested that tradeoffs between maintaining experimental control and fidelity of evidence-based programs maximizing fit to the new context should be considered in research among individuals with disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Safety</title><p id="Par85">Findings from this study confirm that a wheelchair training program administered by a peer and a health care professional is safe. However, as previously mentioned, the future intent of WheelSeeU is to be solely administered in the community by a peer-trainer. Recent findings from focus groups conducted during the development of a peer-led program highlight some concern for programs led solely by lay peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], but there is evidence that supports competencies of peer-trainers when adequate training is provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, community-living MWC users should be given the autonomy and choice to make decisions about how they participate in community-based programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par86">The consent rate (49%) was based on the number of individuals contacted by research investigators during the study period. This number may be underestimated, as there is no way to track the number of people who may have been contacted through snowball methods or by world-of-mouth from clinicians who were not a part of the study team.</p><p id="Par87">There may have been pragmatic issues with slow enrollment and an intervention designed for dyadic training. In order to perform the most robust randomization procedures (i.e., group allocation upon completion of baseline measures), while reducing the chances of dropout due to long wait periods between baseline testing and start of the intervention period, randomization was done in blocks of two. This means that as two participants were enrolled, they were allocated in pairs to either the intervention or the control group. Restricting training to pairs of participants was recognized as a limitation in this study. Future studies may consider one-on-one training or training in small groups.</p><p id="Par88">While assessing peer-trainer adherence was an a priori objective, we did not include support-trainer or iWheel trainer adherence as a study objective. Both the support-trainer and iWheel trainer were part of the extended research team and maintained regular contact with the study investigators, including attending bimonthly team meetings to ensure any concerns could be addressed as they arose. Details about support-trainer and iWheel trainer adherence may have provided useful information pertaining to this study and should be considered for future feasibility studies.</p><p id="Par89">Finally, details about peer-trainer training and intervention fidelity may have strengthened the results of this study. Implementation of a test at the end of the 2-day training session may help to ensure the peer-trainer and support-trainer are prepared to administer the intervention. However, study investigator (KB) has more than 10&#x000a0;years of experience in wheelchair skills training and thus should be able to attest to trainer readiness. Additionally, the WheelSeeU Administrator Rating form could have been administered more frequently to understand fully how WheelSeeU was delivered and whether it was administered as intended. Specifically, more information on how the lead roles shifted from the support-trainer to the peer-trainer would provide more insight into factors that may be taken into consideration when training the peer-trainer. It is possible that an additional day of training would have been useful for practice. It is possible that WheelSeeU sessions could be videotaped; however, it was felt that this could hinder organic discussions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">Self-efficacy enhanced peer-led wheelchair training provides a feasible option that may contribute to the development of a needed community-based wheelchair training continuum for older wheelchair users. The present study demonstrates that with the support of a clinician, it is feasible for peers to teach older MWC users about using their wheelchair. Further examination of the efficacy of community-based peer-led programs in a larger randomized controlled trial is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>iWheel</term><def><p id="Par6">Information for using a wheelchair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MWC</term><def><p id="Par7">Manual wheelchair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par8">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par9">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WheelSeeU</term><def><p id="Par10">Wheelchair training Self-Efficacy Enhanced for Use</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank our peer-trainers (Jurek Golas, Richard Peter, and Michel Garant), support-trainers (Marie-Pierre Johnson, Megan MacGillivray), and control group trainers (Emma Smith and Emilie Lacroix) for administering the study protocol.
