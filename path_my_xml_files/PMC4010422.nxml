The average power output in the TT improved significantly (7.3% and 6.4% for N and H, respectively). No differences were found in MCT1 and MCT4 protein content, before and after the training in either the N or H group.

The proposed benefits of altitude training are an increase in red blood cell mass and haemoglobin concentration, which have the potential to enhance oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) transport capacity and therefore endurance performance upon return to sea-level <xref rid="pone.0095092-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Rusko1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Wilber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. There is now considerable debate on the use of the different high-intensity hypoxic training methods as intermittent hypoxic training (IHT), which is frequent training of a higher intensity in hypoxia, or repeated sprints training in hypoxia (RSH) to improve endurance performance or repeated sprint ability in normoxia/at sea-level <xref rid="pone.0095092-Faiss2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Lundby1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Millet1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Roels2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Roels3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. A variety of individual and team sports comprise a considerable anaerobic component <xref rid="pone.0095092-Stolen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The scientific rationale supporting the use of altitude training for anaerobic performance improvement is less compelling than that for the use of altitude training for the enhancement of endurance performance. However there is some evidence that altitude training can benefit sprinting or other short-term high-intensity performance that requires a substantial anaerobic metabolic contribution <xref rid="pone.0095092-Bickham1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Faiss1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Gore1" ref-type="bibr">[9,]</xref>. However only few scientific studies have examined the effects of IHT on anaerobic performance <xref rid="pone.0095092-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>One important physiological adaptation that may occur as a result of altitude training is an improvement in the capacity to buffer the exercise-induced increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in skeletal muscle. Few studies have reported increase in buffering capacity following spring training in normoxia <xref rid="pone.0095092-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> as well with &#x0201c;living high &#x02013; training high&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0095092-Mizuno1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or &#x0201c;living high training low&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0095092-Gore1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> altitude methods. However, to date little is known about the effects of intermittent hypoxic stimulus on anaerobic performance.</p><p>The transport of lactate across the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle is mediated by proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-McCullagh1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Pilegaard2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Due to the 1&#x02236;1 ratio between the lactate transport and the H<sup>+</sup> transport, an increase in MCT1 and MCT4 could reduce the intracellular pH perturbations <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The MCT1 is expressed in the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0095092-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and facilitates the lactate influx into the muscle <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The MCT4 however, facilitates the removal of lactic acid and is mainly expressed in glycolytic fibers <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An increase in MCT1 and MCT4 protein expression is likely to decrease intracellular pH perturbations due to the coupled H<sup>+</sup> transport <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Exercise training above VO<sub>2</sub>max in normoxic conditions is known to induce increases in both MCT1 and MCT4 content <xref rid="pone.0095092-Bickham1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>However, there are limited studies investigating the effects of hypoxia on MCT expression in human skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095092-Ullah1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In one study the authors concluded that 20 consecutive nights (9&#x02013;10 h night<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of hypoxic exposure (N<sub>2</sub> enriched altitude house with simulated altitude at 2650 m, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16.3%), a &#x02018;live high-train low&#x02019; (LHTL) scenario, decreased lactate production (as measured by stable isotope methodology) during intense exercise in well-trained athletes <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, there was no effect of hypoxic exposure on MCT1 and MCT4 protein expression <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Aside from this investigation, there is little information concerning the effects of IHT on MCT expression in human skeletal muscle. The effects of IHT at high intensity on anaerobic performance in normoxia have also not been clearly established in trained athletes. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the effects of acute intermittent hypoxic training on anaerobic performance and MCT expression, in human skeletal muscle. We tested the hypothesis that IHT would not provide larger MCT expression or anaerobic performance enhancement, when compared to the same similar training in normoxia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen male cyclists voluntarily participated in the study after giving written informed consent.

Each training session included a 15 min warm-up and 15 min cool-down. The continuous training session consisted of 60 min at 60% of VO<sub>2max</sub>. The interval-training required the subjects to perform two sets of three repetitions each two min in duration and at an intensity of 100% Peak Power Output (PPO) <xref rid="pone.0095092-Roels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Two min of rest was allowed between each repetition with 6 min rest between each set. Each session was performed at the same relative intensity specific to each condition (e.g. 100% PPO and 60% of VO<sub>2max</sub> measured in normoxia or hypoxia for N or H, respectively) to ensure an equivalent training stimulus. The subjects trained on their own bicycle fixed on an electromagnetic resistant home-trainer (Elite Travel, Milan, Italy). Each session was meticulously controlled by the same researcher.</p><p>Training sessions were performed either in normoxic (P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 150 mmHg) or hypoxic (P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 100 mmHg, simulated altitude of &#x0223c;3000 m) environment for N and the H group, respectively.

The subjects performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion in normoxic conditions. An identical incremental test to exhaustion under hypoxic conditions (P<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x0223c;100 mmHg) on a separate visit to the laboratory was also performed by the H group. An all-out exercise trial (&#x0223c;2 min) was also performed under normoxic conditions by both groups to determine anaerobic performance. All the tests were randomized for both groups. A physician was in attendance at all times and was responsible for the safety of the subjects during the study. The weekly training that took place outside the experimental training was controlled.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Environmental stimulus</title><p>The hypoxic environment (equivalent to &#x0223c;3000 m) was induced by the continued delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture by a system that modifying nitrogen content and therefore decreased the inspired O<sub>2</sub> fraction (Altitrainer 200, SMTEC, Geneva, Switzerland). This device allows the production of large quantities of hypoxic gas mixture, up to 200 L<sup>.</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with an easily adjustable O<sub>2</sub> fraction over a large range and with a short response time. Air inhaled from outside the machine is controlled with a fixed quantity of nitrogen from a bottle which is then mechanically mixed prior to being stocked in a buffer tank of 30 L. The first safety check is ensured by the mixer's mechanical limit, which cannot exceed a certain nitrogen fraction (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9.7%). The user inhales the mixture contained in the tank through a Hans Rudolph two-way respiratory valve. An O<sub>2</sub> probe, a second safety check, plunged in the buffer tank, measures the PO<sub>2</sub>. This probe, with aid of a microprocessor, allows the PO<sub>2</sub> of the inhaled mixture, or the equivalent altitude to be displayed and cannot decrease less than 66 mmHg (5500 m). If necessary, the user can constantly modify the composition of the air which they breathe and thus change the simulated altitude. A breath-by-breath analyser was attached to the system in order to measure respiratory exchange.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Performance Tests</title><p>The subjects completed two different performance tests before (W0) and after (W4) the training.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>1) Incremental test to exhaustion</title><p>The subjects performed an incremental test to exhaustion to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>; ml<sup>.</sup>kg<sup>&#x02212;1.</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the peak power output (PPO; W), maximal heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>; bpm), and maximal ventilation (VE; l<sup>.</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The test began with a three min stage at an initial power output of 60 W and than the workload progressively increased by 30 W every minute until exhaustion.

The key findings of the study were that PPO at sea-level increased with training regardless of whether this was performed in hypoxia or normoxia. Furthermore, anaerobic exercise performance at sea-level increased to a similar extent after the hypoxic and normoxic training period. In addition, neither the hypoxic nor normoxic training had any effect on MCT1 and MCT4 protein content. Hence, these results indicate there are no additional effect of the hypoxic stimulus on anaerobic performance after a three-week training period.</p><p>The PPO and all-out exercise performance improved after three weeks of training.

The authors concluded that 10 days of &#x0223c;2 hours a day of IHT did not induce changes in VO<sub>2max</sub> of elite triathletes, but did enhance anaerobic power and capacity <xref rid="pone.0095092-Meeuwsen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. An enhanced H<sup>+</sup>-buffering capacity has been shown to be associated with the improvement in anaerobic/sprint performance following spring training in normobaric conditions. It has been reported in Danish national team cross-country skiers who lived at 2100 m and trained at 2700 m for 14 days, a significant 29% increase in maximal oxygen deficit, as well as a significant 6% increase in the buffering capacity of the <italic>gastrocnemius</italic> muscle <xref rid="pone.0095092-Mizuno1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, as there was no sea-level control group data in this study, it is therefore difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the findings. Others <xref rid="pone.0095092-Gore1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>found a significant 18% increase in <italic>in-vitro</italic> muscle buffer capacity (&#x003b2;m) of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> in male athletes after 23 days of living high-training low at a simulated altitude of 3000 m. These authors <xref rid="pone.0095092-Gore1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> suggested therefore that the chronic hypoxic stimulus per se increased the &#x003b2;m.</p><p>The observed increase in the aerobic and anaerobic performance without any changes in VO<sub>2max</sub> and VO<sub>2peak</sub> could also be explained by a decrease in the rates of lactate appearance (R<sub>a</sub>) and disappearance (R<sub>d</sub>). Whilst lactate kinetics during exercise were not measured during this study, others <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> have investigated the effect of 20 nights of 9&#x02013;10 h of LHTL at a simulated altitude of 2650 m, and found an decrease in whole body R<sub>a</sub> during 30 min exercise, at 85% VO<sub>2peak</sub>, in well-trained athletes. Meanwhile, these authors <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> investigated the effect of hypoxia during rest and/or sleeping in contrast with the present study where training rather than rest and/or sleeping was performed under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the buffering capacity and pH regulation did not show any changes after the 20 nights of LHTL <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, the observed increase in PPO and anaerobic exercise performance are likely due to mechanisms independent of lactate metabolism, <italic>i.e</italic>. buffer capacity and MCTs.</p><p>The present work is one of the first studies to examine change in anaerobic performance with IHT. The results show that whilst IHT can be beneficial for performance of 2 min of all-out exercise, the effect does not have any additional benefits than conventional training in normoxia. Whilst these results suggest that IHT should only be reserved for athletes aiming to improve performance in events with a considerable aerobic component, it should be considered that performance at altitude could be improved. A previous study showed that work performance in hypoxia was improved after a period of training in hypoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0095092-Roels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, there were no differences between or within both groups for citrate synthase and hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activity <xref rid="pone.0095092-Roels1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Since anaerobic performance is strongly associated to high lactate transport/oxidation, it is of interest that we did not observe any significant changes in the MCT protein expression. In other words, three weeks of IHT does not result in an up-regulation of MCT protein, and is in accordance with previous findings <xref rid="pone.0095092-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These authors did not observe an effect of hypoxic exposure, <italic>i.e</italic>. 20 nights of LHTL on MCT1 and MCT4 protein density. Similarly, other authors found no changes in MCT1 and MCT4 content in the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscles after eight weeks at natural altitude of 4100 m <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In contrast, other researchers <xref rid="pone.0095092-McClelland1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> observed that in female Wistar rats, after eight weeks in a hypobaric hypoxic environment (4300 m), a similar decrease of 47% in MCT1 and MCT4 of in the <italic>plantaris</italic> muscle. Moreover, these authors found also a tissue-specific effect of hypoxic training on the protein expression <xref rid="pone.0095092-McClelland1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, as suggested, human muscle could also experience similar fibre-type-dependent changes which in the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle - as analyzed in the present study - due to its mixed fibre-type composition, could have been overwritten <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel4" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The lack of any change in MCT1 and MCT4 expression could be due to the training intensity in the present study not of a sufficient magnitude to induce changes in MCT protein content. Indeed, some authors have suggested that the changes in MCT protein expression are related to the training intensity <xref rid="pone.0095092-Bonen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These authors suggested that MCT1 and MCT4 protein content might increase after an intense anaerobic exercise training, as has been previously observed <xref rid="pone.0095092-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and that only MCT1 protein content might increase after an aerobic training as they observed <xref rid="pone.0095092-Bonen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. After three weeks of chronic muscle stimulation of 24 h/day in red <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> muscle, MCT1 protein content was significantly increased by 78%, whereas MCT4 protein expression was not altered <xref rid="pone.0095092-Bonen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, after eight weeks of one-legged knee-extensor high-intensity exercise training in healthy male subjects, the MCT1 and MCT4 protein content had increased significantly by 76 and 32% respectively <xref rid="pone.0095092-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that after seven to eight weeks of one-legged knee-extensor exercise training at an intensity of 150% of thigh VO<sub>2max</sub>, the MCT1 protein content increased with 115% (P &#x0003c;0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed for the MCT4 protein content (+111%, P&#x0003e;0.05) <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Whilst this study demonstrates supramaximal exercise training may evoke large increases in MCT1 and MCT4 expression, some precaution should be taken when interpreting these results, as the study design involved single-leg knee-extensor exercise training which might not induce the same physiological adaptations compared to the present study where &#x0201c;whole body&#x0201d; cycling exercise training was incorporated. Even if a strong point of the present study was that the relative exercise intensity (e.g. 91&#x02013;92% of PPO &#x02013; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095092-t002">Table 2</xref>) during interval-training was similar in normoxia and in hypoxia, this intensity and the duration of the work-interval (e.g. 2-min) were likely not optimal for inducing a high lactate production. It was reported that the increase in lactate/H+ transport capacity is more likely in response to the high-intensity training than the hypoxic condition per se <xref rid="pone.0095092-Juel5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore, one may assume that the present training intensity was not enough &#x02018;glycolytic&#x02019; for inducing an increase in MCTs in any group. In addition, MCT4 was reported more sensitive than MCT1 to hypoxia since after chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure <xref rid="pone.0095092-Py1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or extreme hypoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0095092-Ullah1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, only MCT4 protein or mRNA levels increased. In the present study, the low hypoxic dose (combination of a total exposure &#x0003c;20 h and a moderate normobaric hypoxia level; e.g. simulated altitude of 3000 m) explains probably why neither MCT4 nor MCT1 were increased.</p><p>In conclusion, three weeks of intermittent hypoxic training increased incremental exercise performance at sea-level. At the same time, anaerobic performance was enhanced without altering the expression of MCT1 and MCT4 protein content. However, no additional benefits of training in hypoxia were observed when compared to similar high-intensity training in normoxia. Therefore, IHT at intensity at or close to PPO as a technique to further improve anaerobic performance at sea-level is questionable.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Impact and Perspective</title><p>Scientists, coaches and athletes should have a better understanding of the role that hypoxia plays in training for anaerobic exercise or indeed training for such intermittent high intensity performance. No additional adaptations or anaerobic performance enhancement should be expected above that which athletes can accomplish at sea-level.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0095092-Bell1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
