The study was conducted in Finland in 2009&#x02013;2012. Male drivers with waist circumference &#x0003e;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;cm were randomized to a lifestyle counseling (LIFE, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55) and a reference (REF, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;58) group. During 12&#x000a0;months, LIFE participated in 6 face-to-face and 7 telephone counseling sessions on diet and PA. Dietary patterns were assessed using an index combining food diary and counselor interview, and PA with the number of daily steps using a pedometer. Monthly lifestyle goals, perceived facilitators and barriers, and adverse effects of PA in the LIFE participants were monitored using counselors' log books. Forty-seven (85%) LIFE participants completed the 12-month program. After 12&#x000a0;months, the mean dietary index score improved by 12% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24), and the number of daily steps increased by 1811 steps (median; p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22). The most frequent dietary goals dealt with meal frequency, plate model, and intake of vegetables, fruits, and berries. The most common PA mode was walking. Typical facilitators to reach monthly lifestyle goals were support from family and friends and ailment prevention; typical barriers were working schedules and ailments. Adverse effects, most commonly musculoskeletal pain, occurred among 83% of the LIFE participants. Positive changes in lifestyle habits were observed during counseling. Monthly lifestyle counseling combining face-to-face and phone contacts seemed appropriate to long-distance drivers. Barriers for reaching lifestyle changes, and adverse effects of PA were common and need to be addressed when planning counseling.</p><p><bold>Trial registration</bold>: Clinical Trials NCT00893646</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Our study is one of the few lifestyle counseling RCTs in truck and bus drivers.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Dietary habits improved during 12-month program.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Habitual walking and daily step count increased during 12-month program.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Improved dietary habits were associated with weight reduction.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Perceived barriers related to working schedules and ailments were common.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>BMI, body mass index</kwd><kwd>LIFE, lifestyle counseling group</kwd><kwd>PA, physical activity</kwd><kwd>REF, reference group (control)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Automobile driving</kwd><kwd>Male, life style</kwd><kwd>Counseling</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors are common health concerns in professional truck and bus drivers (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Sieber et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Apostolopoulos et al., 2013</xref>). Factors related to work environment and personal behavior affect drivers' lifestyle, which often consists of long sitting periods at work, unhealthy dietary patterns, and low leisure-time physical activity (PA) (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Birdsey et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Tse et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">van der Beek, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Varela-Mato et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).

A more detailed description of the study design has been reported (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Puhkala et al., 2015</xref>). The main inclusion criteria were being a male truck or bus driver in long-distance service, waist circumference &#x02265;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;cm, and being physically inactive (less than twice weekly, moderate-intensity leisure PA for 30&#x000a0;min). Drivers were mainly recruited by fliers in service stations, workplaces, and through labor unions.</p><p>After recruitment for 18&#x000a0;months, 113 eligible drivers were randomized to lifestyle counseling (LIFE, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55) and reference (REF, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;58) groups (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). LIFE participated monthly in counseling for 12&#x000a0;months aiming at a 10% body-weight-reduction. Waiting-list REF participants were instructed to follow their former lifestyle during the 12-month period. Assessments for all participants took place at baseline and 12&#x000a0;months, including questionnaires, biochemical blood samples, and body weight measurement.</p><p>The study was reviewed by Pirkanmaa University Hospital District Ethics (Ref. number R09025). The participants completed a written informed consent. The research was conducted in accordance with the <xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Declaration of Helsinki (2000)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Counseling program in LIFE</title><p>Three trained counselors conducted the program. Topics included diet and PA. The program consisted of 13 individual sessions: 6 face-to-face sessions (baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12) with 7 telephone sessions in between. Face-to-face sessions were planned to last for 60&#x000a0;min, telephone sessions for 30&#x000a0;min. All sessions took place during participants' leisure or work breaks. The counselors traveled to meet participants for face-to-face sessions.</p><p>We used the Health Action Process Approach (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lippke et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>) as the theory base for developing the program and content of the counseling. The first three sessions focused on intention building, the fourth through twelfth sessions on putting the intentions into action via planning, and the thirteenth session on maintaining the recommended actions. During each counseling session, the participant and the counselor together established dietary and PA goals for the following month. The content of the sessions is described in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The counselors used a participant-specific notebook to follow the intended procedures and topics of the counseling sessions. The following items were assessed monthly and recorded in the notebook: weight and waist circumference; setting and reaching the dietary and PA goals; perceived facilitators and barriers to lifestyle changes; and adverse effects of PA. The participants were provided with printed material on lifestyle habits. The participants had log books to assess lifestyle habits, to plan monthly goals, and to monitor daily accomplishment of the goals.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Lifestyle</title><sec id="s0030"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Dietary patterns</title><p>The LIFE participants completed a 3-day food diary on two working days and one non-working day at baseline and 12&#x000a0;months. They were instructed to report what they ate and drank, as well as timing, amount, and brand names. Based on the food diary and a subsequent interview, the counselors graded 14 dietary items to form a healthy diet index during baseline and 12-month counseling sessions. The items were meal frequency; plate model use; vegetables, fruit, and berries; grain products; milk and milk products; meat and meat products; fish; bread spread; cooking fat; salad dressing; fast food; sweets; energy-containing drinks; and alcohol. The grading criteria (scale 1&#x02013;3, number 3 being the best) were based on the Finnish Nutrition Recommendations (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">National Nutrition Council, 2005</xref>). Both the amount and quality of each item were taken into account in grading. The dietary index score was the sum of the grades for the 14 items (score range 14&#x02013;42).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3.2</label><title>Physical activity</title><p>The LIFE participants used log books to record daily steps during the 12-month program. The information on mean daily step count at baseline and 12&#x000a0;months were used in the analyses. Weekly minutes of walking and daily hours of sitting were asked of LIFE and REF participants at baseline and 12&#x000a0;months, using a questionnaire based on the short version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Craig et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">The IPAQ group, 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.4</label><title>Dietary and PA goals</title><p>Dietary goals were based on Finnish nutrition recommendations by the <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">National Nutrition Council (2005)</xref>. The main goals were to decrease energy intake by balancing meal frequency and increasing the intake of vegetables, fruits, and berries. The plate model was used for meals: half of the plate consists of vegetables; one fourth of potatoes, rice, or pasta; and one fourth of meat, fish, or legumes. The other goals were to use vegetable oils and spreads, consume low fat milk and meat products, and reduce the use of low-fiber, rapidly-absorbed carbohydrates (e.g. refined grain-products, sweets, and sugary drinks).</p><p>Increasing habitual walking was the major PA goal. The emphasis was on taking walks in leisure time and during work breaks. A pedometer (Omron Walking Style II, HJ-113-E, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan) was used for setting daily step goals and monitoring their achievement. The ultimate goal at 12&#x000a0;months was to add 4000 steps on five self-selected days of the week. As 4000 steps corresponds to approximately 30&#x000a0;min of brisk walking, the additional steps equate to a total of 150&#x000a0;min a week, meeting the aerobic exercise recommendation of the 2008 United States PA guidelines (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>). At the first counseling session, the participants were instructed to wear the pedometer on five ordinary working and two non-working days and to calculate the mean number of daily steps. The ultimate step goal was approached progressively with smaller goals of adding increments of 2000 steps to an increasing number of days each week (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Such an approach has been shown to be achievable in worksite interventions (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aittasalo et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Tudor-Locke et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.5</label><title>Factors related to accomplishment of lifestyle goals</title><p>Monthly dietary and PA goals, as well as perceived facilitators and barriers to achieve the goals were assessed as total number of times (mentions) the goal was established, and number of times (mentions) the facilitator or barrier was reported by the LIFE participants during 12&#x000a0;months. The first facilitator and barrier mentioned in each session were included in the analyses.</p><p>Adverse effects due to PA, or those which prevented participants from performing PA were listed in the counselors' notebooks. They were discussed with the participant during each session. The adverse effects included muscle pain; back pain; hip, knee, or ankle pain; chest pain; cardiac arrhythmia; dyspnea; fatigue; sprains or distorsions; and falls or other accidents leading to symptoms. Adverse effects were reported both by the total number of mentions and by the number of days adverse effects kept participants from reaching PA goals.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive data are presented as frequencies and percentages, means or medians and standard deviations (SD), or percentiles (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>, i.e. interquartile range).

Differences in changes between LIFE and REF in weekly duration of habitual walking and daily sitting were analyzed with linear logistic regression adjusted by baseline values and age. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze associations between changes in dietary items, step count, and body weight (non-parametric data); and Pearson correlation analysis between changes in dietary index and body weight (parametric data). All results were considered to be statistically significant if p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 or if 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not cross point zero.

At baseline, the median number of daily steps was 6286 (Q<sub>1</sub>; Q<sub>3</sub> 5332; 7376). At 12&#x000a0;months, the participants took 1811 (median, Q<sub>1</sub>; Q<sub>3</sub> &#x02212;&#x000a0;832; 3564) daily steps more than at baseline (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). The goal of adding 4000 steps daily on five days a week was reached by three of the 22 participants. Eleven participants managed to increase 2000 steps daily on five days. No association with changes in steps and body weight was observed at 12&#x000a0;months (Spearman correlation; r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.21, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35).</p><p>At baseline, the mean duration of self-reported habitual walking was 82 (SD 99) minutes a week (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;89). At 12&#x000a0;months, the duration had increased 60 (SD 160) minutes in LIFE and 9 (SD 81) minutes in REF, resulting in a between-group difference in change of 62&#x000a0;min (95% CI 9 to 115) in favor of LIFE (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In a subgroup of LIFE that completed the pedometer-based monitoring (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22), mean self-reported walking increased a little more (70, SD 139&#x000a0;min).</p><p>At baseline, the mean duration of sitting was 10.0 (SD 3.1) hours on a working day and 5.2 (SD 2.3) hours on a non-working day (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;89). After 12&#x000a0;months, the duration of sitting did not change on a working day. During a non-working day, the mean duration of sitting decreased 0.6&#x000a0;h in LIFE and increased 0.8&#x000a0;h in REF, leading to a net decrease of 1.3&#x000a0;h (95% CI &#x02212;&#x000a0;2.3 to &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.4) in favor of LIFE. Reduction of sitting was not one of the major goals of counseling but was often discussed during the counseling sessions. Sedentary time on non-working days may have decreased as participants increased habitual walking.</p><p>Even though the number of steps and minutes of habitual walking increased and hours of sitting during a non-working day decreased at the group level, most of the LIFE participants did not achieve the step goal. Therefore, our LIFE participants' dietary improvements may have contributed more to the achieved weight loss than their moderate increases in PA. PA may not be as effective as dietary modification to affect energy balance and decrease overweight (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Schwingshackl et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Perceived barriers to increase PA, such as working schedules, ailments, adverse effects of PA, and lack of company, were common, and may have hampered adoption of walking and other PA. In <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">French et al.'s RCT (2010)</xref>, no changes in PA were observed among motor freight workers. In general, men tend to choose increasing PA for losing weight over changing dietary habits (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kiefer et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2014</xref>). However, male professional drivers seem to differ from other male populations: drivers find it difficult to increase PA, most likely due to environmental barriers (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Reed, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>3.3</label><title>Goal setting</title><p>The two most frequently mentioned dietary goals dealt with meal frequency (195 mentions) and plate model use (134). Meal frequency goals included balancing frequency of main meals and avoiding snacking. Other frequently mentioned goals dealt with the intake of vegetables, fruits, and berries (65); milk and milk products (24); candies and pastries (10); and alcohol (10). These goals were in line with the ultimate dietary counseling goals. Repeated mention of these goals also reflected participants' challenges in improving certain habits.</p><p>The most popular PA mode was walking (208 mentions). Biking was the second most popular (33), followed by gym exercises, swimming, jogging, cross-country skiing, and ball games. Many participants preferred leisure-time housekeeping and repair jobs instead of structured exercises.</p><sec id="s0085"><label>3.3.1</label><title>Facilitators and barriers</title><p>The most mentioned factors that facilitated reaching dietary goals were good quality roadside resting places (8 mentions), support from family and friends (7), and their own preferences (7). The most common barriers were working schedules (15), their own attitudes and habits (13), and family habits (6). The most common facilitators for reaching PA goals were ailment prevention (10 mentions), good opportunities to perform PA (5), improved perceived alertness and well-being (4), spending time with family and friends (3), and social support from family and friends (3). The most common barriers were working schedules (29), ailments and old injuries (21), bad weather conditions or darkness (6), lack of company (3), and fatigue (3).</p><p>Facilitators and barriers for reaching dietary and PA goals were very similar to previous findings on professional drivers. Perceived facilitators to healthy lifestyle have been support from family and friends, PA support from management, and health reasons (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Hedberg et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Most studies on long-distance drivers suggest that factors related to working schedules and timetable pressures are major environmental barriers (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Hedberg et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McDonough et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Reed, 2011</xref>). In many countries, hours-of-service rules are set for professional heavy vehicle drivers; but because of tight competition, unrealistic schedules often cause rule violations (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">McCartt et al., 2008</xref>). Other barriers are poor availability of healthy food; poor or lack of exercise environment; and attitudes and preferences of family, friends, and colleagues (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jack et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McDonough et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Nagler et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Reed, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). These barriers need to be addressed when providing lifestyle counseling to professional drivers. Roadside resting places should enable healthier food choices and possibilities for PA.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Adverse effects of PA</title><p>Thirty-nine (83%) LIFE participants reported one or more adverse effects of PA during the 12-month program. Overall, they reported 50 adverse effects, of which 42 (84%) during the first six months. Most adverse effects were minor. The two most common ones were hip, knee, or ankle pain (17 mentions), and muscle pain (17), mostly due to shin splints. Falls and other such accidents (either during leisure time or at work) leading to injuries such as sprains and distorsions, were reported 12 times. Thirty participants reported that adverse effects interfered with the achievement of step goals on 37 days (median).</p><p>Frequent adverse effects imply that musculoskeletal problems are common in overweight men not used to regular exercise, and who begin to increase PA. PA-related adverse effects during lifestyle interventions among professional drivers have not been reported earlier; only injuries related to physically demanding work tasks have been reported (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>3.4</label><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>The study has several strengths. It was the first RCT aimed at decreasing overweight in professional drivers through individual lifestyle counseling. We succeeded at changing dietary patterns and increasing PA in male drivers, resulting in weight loss and improved cardiometabolic risk factors (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Puhkala et al., 2015</xref>). Participants' preferences, abilities, and experiences were discussed and taken into account when establishing and revising the monthly goals.</p><p>Some limitations must also be stated. Dietary patterns and daily steps were not monitored in REF during the 12-month intervention. Data on dietary patterns in LIFE were obtained from counselors' subjective assessments based on participants' food diary and subsequent interview. Misreporting eating is common (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, some of the lifestyle habits &#x02013; for example, PA opportunities &#x02013; were related to work schedules, which we could not control. Daily step counts were monitored by fewer than half of the LIFE group, probably only those participants who were interested in PA. These findings in dietary and PA patterns need to be replicated in a larger sample in a randomized design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Positive changes in dietary patterns and PA were found in overweight professional drivers during 12-month counseling program, and dietary changes were associated with weight reduction. The monthly counseling program using both face-to-face and telephone contacts seemed appropriate to long-distance drivers. The drivers mentioned support from family and friends, and prevention of ailments as the most frequent facilitators for reaching dietary and PA goals. Frequently mentioned barriers, such as working schedules and ailments, as well as adverse effects of PA hampered adoption of the goals. Such barriers need to be addressed when planning counseling.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Transparency document</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><p>Transparency document</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.pdf"><alt-text>Image 1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aittasalo</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rinne</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pasanen</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kukkonen-Harjula</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vasankari</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Promoting walking among office employees &#x02014; evaluation of a randomized controlled intervention with pedometers and e-mail messages</article-title><source>BMC Public Health</source><volume>12</volume><year>2012</year><comment>(403-2458-12-403)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apostolopoulos</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sonmez</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Shattell</surname><given-names>M.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonzales</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fehrenbacher</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Health survey of U.S. long-haul truck drivers: work environment, physical health, and healthcare access</article-title><source>Work</source><volume>46</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>113</fpage><lpage>123</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23324711</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bellisle</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Meals and snacking, diet quality and energy balance</article-title><source>Physiol.
