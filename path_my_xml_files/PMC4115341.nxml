Despite the beneficial effects of aspirin as an acetylated salicylate in reduction of inflammatory responses, it has shown several unfavorable effects on coagulation pathways and may lead to gasterointestinal ulcers especially in high doses besides. However, nonacetylated salicylates such as Na salicylate and salsalate that tend to reduce mild inflammatory processes exist naturally in endothelial system of diabetic patients and can decrease the speed of diabetes process, with no unfavorable effect on platelets and coagulation pathways.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>This study intended to evaluate the effect of salsalate on metabolic syndrome parameters as well as endothelial function of prediabetic patients in an interventional setting.

Patients enrolled in the study included prediabetic patients comprising of those with the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed impaired fasting glucose patients who had received no prior medications and those who did not need standard diabetes medications at the time of study and agreed to participate after being aware of risks and benefits of using salsalate. The subjects were required to have the following criteria for being eligible to enter the study: Between 20 and 60 years of age, FBS (fasting blood sugar) between 110 and 125 mg/dL (mentioned as impaired fasting glucose according to WHO criteria[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) or BS (blood sugar) in OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) between 140 and 199 mg/dL (mentioned as impaired glucose tolerance according to WHO criteria) and BS &#x02265; 250 mg/dL. Eligible participants had been also received life style modification recommendations previously and showed failure to response within several months. They were all previously recommended to exercise regularly, lose 5% to 7% of body weight, and limit the intake of (at least) sugar and highly processed carbohydrates.</p><p>According to studies in some cases for prediabetic patients with severe risk factors, prescribing medication may be appropriate especially in those for whom lifestyle therapy is not sustainable and who are at high-risk for developing type-2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As mentioned earlier such cases were not eligible to enter the survey.

After these 3 months, all patients were recalled and an entire examination was done, blood samples for biochemistry measurements were drawn, and forearm FMD was performed, too. For testing the hypothesis that daily intake of salsalate would improve endothelial function of diabetic patients we used FMD as a functional marker in our study, details of which is followed.

An expert ultrasonographer blinded to intervention and placebo groups performed all FMDs. Patients rested 10 min prior to initiation. Then baseline brachial artery diameter was determined by locating probe on 4-5 cm above the antecubital fossa of the nondominant arm. A pneumatic tourniquet of a sphygmomanometer was inflated on the most proximal portion of the forearm to a pressure of 300 mmHg for 5 min. The cuff was then released and second scan was taken 30 s before and 90 s after cuff deflation. Artery diameters were determined with ultrasonic calipers from the leading edge of the anterior wall to the leading edge of posterior wall of the brachial artery at the end of diastolic period. Changes in diameter were computed as percentage based on the baseline diameter. FMD was not measured during the menstrual phase in female patients. All FMDs were performed at the same time of the day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in FMD, biochemistry, and BMI parameters between intervention and placebo groups were analyzed with independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-test and differences within the groups (before and after treatment) were determined by paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off of 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Likewise, triglyceride and HDL concentration levels were improved but the changes were not significant enough.</p><p>In our study, except for FBS, none of the biochemical measured parameters showed dramatic changes.</p><p>Similarly, FMD, used as a functional assay for evaluating the function of endothelium, had significant improvement among the salsalate treated patients. To the best of our knowledge, there was no previous study which aimed to examine this parameter in salsalate intervention. This functional endothelial dysfunction improvement may be due to anti-inflammatory effects of salsalate or some other probable mechanisms such as lowering the blood glucose concentration.</p><p>Several studies[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have shown that treatment with high-dose salicylate inhibits activity of the transcription factor NF-KB, which regulates the production of multiple inflammatory mediators.</p><p>Also the WBC count decreased significantly in salsalate treated group of patients while their counterparts experienced no dramatic change in WBC count. Some previous surveys have also shown this decline[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and have reported it as a rare side effect of this drug.</p><p>The mechanisms through which the glucose-lowering effects of salicylates are inserted include inhibition of cellular kinases,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] upregulation of the heat shock response,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and raising circulating insulin concentrations.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] So, salsalate may lower glucose concentration in various ways and thus, the idea that salsalate decreases the glucose concentration by solely increasing the insulin concentration is not acceptable.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Salsalate has been used for decades in treatment of arthralgia, without any serious safety concerns specifically for patients with diabetes. The privilege of using salsalate is the fact that it is an acidic PH insoluble prodrug which transits the stomach in suspension and causes less gastric irritation.</p><p>In contrast with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, salsalate and other nonacetylated salicylates are atypical NSAIDs main targets of which are not the cyclooxygenases. This is understood by the minimal effects of salsalate on circulating prostaglandin or rennin levels.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] So its effects on gastrointestinal bleedings may be lower, nonetheless in our study we excluded the patients with peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding history.</p><p>Despite some complains of patients about weight gaining and edema, there were no significant changes in BMI of patients after using salsalate and this result was verified by some previous studies as well. Our study showed that salsalate is well tolerated in patients with type-2 diabetes and improves FBS levels of patients but confirmation of long-term safety of the drug requires further investigations especially considering leukopenia as its probable side effect. Likewise several improvements in other biochemical parameters were seen in this study but the changes were not significant, a fact which may be the result of limited number of patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to investigate salsalate efficacy and its long term effects and safety on diabetic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Isfahan University of Medical Sciences for the financial support of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> The authors would like to acknowledge Isfahan University of Medical Sciences for the financial support of this studyl</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>PZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The metabolic syndrome: Prevalence in worldwide populations</article-title><source>Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am</source><year>2004</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>351</fpage><lpage>75</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15158523</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Stehouwer</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Emeis</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>GT</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The central roles of obesity-associated dyslipidaemia, endothelial activation and cytokines in the metabolic syndrome &#x02014;
