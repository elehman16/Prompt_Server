A previous study has reported that the major cause of graft loss is antibody-mediated rejection which was shown to be associated with impaired adherence to immunosuppressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Non-adherence is not only medically significant, being responsible for acute rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and graft loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but also has wide socioeconomic implications resulting from increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for additional hospitalization, acute rejection treatment, and re-dialysis. Given the multifaceted risk associated with immunosuppression non-adherence in KTRs, aggressive intervention by healthcare professionals to ensure adherence is imperative.</p><p id="Par16">Conventional ways of assessing drug adherence include blood drug level measurement, pill counts, patient interview/use of questionnaires, and electronic monitoring. Blood drug concentration provides direct evidence, but is rarely useful due to inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is also risk of errors due to the white-coat compliance where drug adherence improves abruptly for the 5&#x000a0;days immediately preceding a physician visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pill count is even less reliable, barely providing information on dosing time compliance. While easy to implement, patient interview/questionnaires also pose reliability issues. Electronic monitoring has been regarded as the standard assessment of adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It keeps records of the date/time when patients open the pill box, and the computer-connected data is downloadable and analyzable. Though the simple date/time data does not really ensure whether medication is actually taken, electronic monitoring is still considered the most reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Henriksson et al. have conducted a study where the date/time record of immunosuppression administration in KTRs was transmitted via web-based reporting tools. Subjects were randomized to the electronic adherence monitoring system or the control system. The prospective study with 1-year follow-up has demonstrated a greater adherence with a lower rejection rate in the electronic monitoring group than in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a more recent randomized clinical trial, Reese et al. have investigated KTRs who had been given pill bottles to demonstrate that the greatest adherence was achieved in those who received provider notification together with customized reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The present clinical trial aims to investigate efficacy and stability of continuous adherence management in KTRs by means of an information and communication technology (ICT)-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par18">Assuming unintended forgetfulness of KTRs to take immunosuppressants oftentimes, the study seeks to identify how continuous adherence management with the ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system affects drug adherence and how improved adherence is associated with therapeutic drug concentrations as well as immunological and clinical outcomes. It also aims to determine patient satisfaction with the ICT-based centralized monitoring system as well as its stability and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">This study has a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. One hundred fourteen&#x000a0;KTRs who fill out the Informed Consent Form are registered and randomized 1:1 into the ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57) or the ambulatory follow-up group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57). The planned follow-up duration is 6&#x000a0;months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group is given a smart pill box equipped with a personal identification system. Fingerprint registration is required in advance, so that it would be used for authentication before each use of the smart pill box later. The adherence-related information obtained from the pill box is saved, monitored, and sent out via a home monitoring system. Of the home monitoring system data, those necessary for the clinical trial are extracted and incorporated into the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) system. All data is consolidated and managed within the comprehensive clinical trial management system (CTMS). In the ICT-based, centralized clinical trial monitoring group, feedback is sent to both patients and medical staff in the form of texts and pill box alarms if there is a dosage/dosing time error or a missed dose.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ICT-based study design. <italic>ICT</italic> information and communication technology, <italic>R</italic> randomization, <italic>S</italic> screening, <italic>W</italic> week</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2221_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par20">Both groups are to make six office visits after randomization at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24&#x000a0;weeks. Each visit requires measurement of blood drug level, creatinine level, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Serum BK virus is assessed at 12&#x000a0;weeks, and panel reactive antibody (PRA) at 24&#x000a0;weeks. Both groups keep a drug administration diary that specifies date, whether a dose is taken or not, dosing time, and dosage. At each visit, subjects go over the diary with investigators and fill out a questionnaire using the Modified Morisky Adherence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group completes a patient Satisfaction Questionnaire developed by the ICT Clinical Trial Support Center at 4 and 24&#x000a0;weeks.

In case of a missed immunosuppressant dose, the first violation generates a feedback within 1&#x000a0;h at the break of the&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3-h range from the fixed dosing time. Up to two additional texts are sent at an interval of 30&#x000a0;min if the dose is still not taken after the feedback. For any discrepancy between the dosage taken and the dosage prescribed, a feedback is sent within 1&#x000a0;h from the moment of recognition. Similarly, if a dose is taken outside of the allowed&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3-h dosing time range, a feedback is sent within 1&#x000a0;h of recognition. To minimize reminder fatigue, we limited additional alarms after the first feedback to two times. Any additional alarms after the two reminders will be sent to the patient&#x02019;s family. Medication use information of KTRs is sent to the home monitoring system and the eCRF system in real time to allow the medical staff to check on the patients&#x02019; medication use, dosing time, and dosage. Through the eCRF system, medical staff can gain insights into all patients&#x02019; daily history of medication use, and all patients&#x02019; or a single patient&#x02019;s monthly history of medication use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par80">Participants in the control group will also record their daily medication use, undergo an adherence evaluation at every visit, undergo clinical laboratory and immunological tests, and have their blood levels of immunosuppressants measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Questionnaires</title><p id="Par81">Participants in both groups will complete the Modified Morisky Adherence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the Belief about Medicine Questionnaire&#x02014;general (BMQ-G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The trough levels of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid, creatinine level, and eGFR are measured at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up. PRA is assessed at baseline and 24&#x000a0;weeks, and serum BK virus at 12&#x000a0;weeks. For clinical outcome evaluation, biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) and graft loss developing during the follow-up are monitored. The patient Satisfaction Questionnaire is filled out at 4 and 24&#x000a0;weeks in the ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group in order to assess how well the patients are satisfied with the system-enabled adherence management. The malfunction rate of the ICT-based centralized monitoring system is checked as well as any discrepancy between the smart pill box record and the patient-kept drug administration diary. Information about patients&#x02019; medication use sent to the ICT-based monitoring system is compared with the daily records of medication use written by the patients (type of medications used, number of pills ingested, and time of ingestion) to assess how closely they match.

A systemic and scientific approach aimed at radically improving drug adherence is imperative. An electronic monitoring device has a proven clinical utility in checking and managing drug compliance. Its routine use in clinical practice, however, is unlikely due to the need for it to be linked to additional electronic equipments. There is no available clinical study conducted in Korea on the use of such an electronic monitoring device to manage adherence to immunosuppressants in KTRs. This study is the first of its kind in Korea to investigate how continuous use of the ICT-based centralized monitoring system could improve medication adherence in KTRs and how the improvement is associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, the study seeks to assess the stability and cost-effectiveness of the ICT-based centralized monitoring system. It is well poised to make significant contributions down the road to maximizing graft performance and clinical outcome in KTRs.</p><p id="Par103">Studies have reported on technology-based intervention for improving medication adherence among KTRs. In a recent study involving 120 KTRs, the patients were randomly subjected to adherence monitoring with customized reminders (including alarms, texts, phone calls, and/or e-mails), monitoring with customized reminders plus provider notifications (every 2&#x000a0;weeks, providers received notification if adherence decreased to 90% during that period), or wireless pill bottle use alone (control) to assess tacrolimus adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The provider notification plus customized reminders group showed better medication adherence than all the other groups. Zanetti-Yabur et al. compared 21 KTRs who were using a mobile phone application to improve medication adherence with 53 control patients. Although they did not find any significant differences in medication adherence between the two groups, patients who used a mobile phone application showed higher adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. McGillicuddy et al. reported significant improvements in medication adherence after comparing a smartphone-based mobile health intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) with a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The use of pill boxes has been clinically shown to lower blood pressure and increase adherence to antiretroviral therapy not only in KTRs but also in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par104">Backed by rapid expansion in IT infrastructure, spread of the use of personal smart devices, and progress in u-Health technology, interest in the ICT-based clinical trial has been on the rise, and there indeed have been attempts at providing an ICT-based healthcare service. Around the globe, the incorporation of ICT into the clinical trial industry is in its infancy regarding developmental stage, and with little standardized system at present, there exists much room for further pioneering and development. This study is significant as it would pave the way for establishing the ICT-based centralized monitoring system necessary for effective management of drug compliance. Solid groundwork laid by this study might have broad implications for all other patient populations &#x02013; recipients of other organ transplant, chronic suffers of hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, patients with HIV infection, and tuberculosis patients, for example &#x02013; for whom adherence to medication is undoubtedly critical in the course of treatment.</p><p id="Par105">Despite the significance of its results, our study has the following limitations. First, we assumed that the reason for patients not taking their medications is unintended forgetfulness, and we investigated whether we could enhance adherence by providing the patients with reminder alarms from the ICT-based centralized monitoring system. However, this system does not use a camera to pictorially record the patients at the moment of medication ingestion; therefore, it cannot improve intentional non-adherence. To overcome this limitation, we will consistently educate our patients on the importance of medication adherence to reduce intentional medication non-adherence. In addition, we will use the BMQ-G to understand the reasons for patient non-adherence and find solutions to this problem. Second, even if patients ingest the correct amount of medications at the right time, there can be differences in drug level, or the secondary outcome, among the patients, owing to intra- and inter-patient variabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is rather difficult to use drug levels as the secondary outcome and they must be carefully interpreted.</p><p id="Par106">To fully establish, expand, maintain, and effectively run an ICT-based centralized monitoring system for improving immunosuppressant adherence in KTRs in real-world health systems, it is necessary to use a standard framework such as the RE-AIM framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].
