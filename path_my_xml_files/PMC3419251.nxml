<italic>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</italic> nasal carriage rates range from about 20 to 50%, depending on the population and the definitions used <xref rid="pone.0043065-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043065-Kluytmans1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Infections with <italic>S. aureus</italic> can develop after disruption of the skin barrier, for example after an incision has been made during surgery. It has been shown that in surgical patients, nosocomial <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections are mainly caused by their own <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain (endogenous infection) <xref rid="pone.0043065-Kluytmans2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043065-VonEiff1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal carriage is now considered to be a well-defined risk factor for subsequent infection in various groups of patients, especially those on dialysis; with cirrhosis of the liver; undergoing surgery; and with intravascular devices or in intensive care <xref rid="pone.0043065-Kluytmans1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043065-Mangram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This raised the hypothesis that eradication of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from the nose would result in fewer <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in these groups of patients. Many studies have evaluated this effect in the past decades. Until 2010, only a few studies were double-blind randomised-controlled trials (RCT) <xref rid="pone.0043065-Wertheim2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043065-Boelaert1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043065-PrezFontan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In these studies various patient populations were treated intranasally with mupirocin, an antibiotic nasal ointment. None of these studies found a significantly reduced number of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections compared to placebo treatment. However, in most of these studies, both <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal carriers and non-carriers were treated. Perl et al were the first to perform a subgroup analysis on carriers only and showed that 4.0 percent of mupirocin treated patients with nasal carriage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> suffered from nosocomial <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, compared to 7.7 percent of those who received placebo (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). Subsequently, all data pertaining to carriers in the above mentioned RCTs were combined in a systematic review, which showed that carriers who were treated with mupirocin before surgery had 44% less chance of developing a nosocomial <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections than patients receiving placebo <xref rid="pone.0043065-VanRijen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Based on these findings a multi-centre double-blind randomised-controlled trial (M-RCT) was performed in which only <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal carriers were included <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This study showed that patients treated with mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate medicated soap (MUP-CHX) had a significantly lower risk of health-care related <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections than patients receiving placebo (3.4% vs. 7.7%, RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23&#x02013;0.75).</p><p>The objective of the present study was to compare hospital costs of patients treated with MUP-CHX (screen-and-treat strategy) to those of patients treated with placebo (comparable to a non-screen-and-treat strategy), in patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery.</p><fig id="pone-0043065-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043065.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Calculation of total costs incurred by the hospital for an individual patient in a particular department.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0043065.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In the M-RCT, performed in three university hospitals and two teaching hospitals, patients who were admitted to departments of surgery and internal medicine were screened for <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal carriage <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

For the second admission, costs for nursing days, costs made during surgery, costs for laboratory and radiological tests, and functional assessments were found to be significantly lower in the treatment arm.

It must be noted that for cardiothoracic surgery, nine of twenty patients with highest costs suffered from a deep <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, i.e. eight cases of mediastinitis after CABG with/without valve replacement, and one case of pericarditis after pericardiectomy. Thus, almost half of the patients incurring the highest costs suffered from a deep <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. This explains why prevention of these infections by application of MUP-CHX results in a significant cost reduction. In orthopaedic surgery, two deep-seated infections developed, one after total knee replacement and one after total hip revision. Costs of these two patients were found in of the group of 25 patients with highest costs.</p><p>To put these results into perspective this screen-and-treat strategy for <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal carriers undergoing cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery would save the Amphia hospital approximately &#x020ac; 1,500,000 per year.</p><p>The <italic>S. aureus</italic> screen-and-treat strategy was already shown to result in a higher quality of patient care by reducing the number of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Lower costs and safer patient care were also found in the subgroups of patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery or orthopaedic surgery. Other authors already estimated that introduction of a screen-and-treat strategy would result in lower hospital costs <xref rid="pone.0043065-Wassenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043065-Courville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For example, the study by Wassenberg et al was based on the actual hospital costs for patients with deep-seated prosthetic joint and cardiac surgery infections in combination with the evidence-based assumptions that non-carriers have six times less chance of acquisition of such infections than <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers <xref rid="pone.0043065-Perl1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and that the relative risk of deep-seated <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections after MUP-CHX treatment was 0.21 compared to placebo <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The strength of the present study is it is the first to calculate the real hospital costs based on the data files of the P&#x00026;C department. The analyses of this study were performed in an investigator-blinded fashion and patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or treatment arms <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The results of the present study are useful for hospitals that are planning to implement the screen-and-treat strategy but which need more evidence to convince their financial management. Some hospitals prefer to implement the treat-all strategy instead of the screen-and-treat strategy, mainly for two reasons. They argue that first, treating all patients is cheaper than screening all patients and subsequently treating nasal <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers <xref rid="pone.0043065-PrezFontan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043065-Wassenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and second, this procedure is more convenient for the HCWs. Both a screen-and-treat and a treat-all strategy have been proven cheaper for the hospital than no screening or treatment at all. Of course, this treat-all strategy is cheaper than the screen-and-treat strategy, because the costs of the screening test, which is more expensive than the costs for mupirocin ointment and antibacterial soap, can be omitted. Wassenberg showed that treating all patients without screening would result in a saving of &#x020ac;7339 per life year gained, as compared to &#x020ac;3330 if only identified carriers were treated <xref rid="pone.0043065-Wassenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The low price and safety of mupirocin will easily lead to non-prudent use of this important antimicrobial agent. However, this treat-all strategy is associated with a high rate of unnecessary and thus unethical treatments that increase the likelihood of the development of resistance <xref rid="pone.0043065-Cookson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Mupirocin resistance will obviously lead to failure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> decolonisation strategies. Cautious use of mupirocin is likely to maintain the mupirocin resistance at a low level, thus preserving its efficacy. The aim of the prophylactic treatment is not to eradicate <italic>S. aureus</italic> forever but to result in short-term <italic>S. aureus</italic> eradication of approximately a month to prevent postoperative <italic>S. aureus</italic> wound infections. It was shown that combined low-level mupirocin and genotypic chlorhexidine resistance significantly increases the risk of persistent methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) carriage after decolonisation therapy <xref rid="pone.0043065-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although the MRSA rates in the Netherlands are still low <xref rid="pone.0043065-Bode2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, it is useful to monitor for mupirocin and chlorhexidine resistance in hospitals using a screen-and-treat strategy for <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriage. In our hospital, MUP-CHX has been used for over 15 years in cardiothoracic surgery and, to date, mupirocin resistance after treatment has not been found (unpublished data).</p><p>In order to resolve practical issues, patients planned for elective cardiothoracic or orthopaedic surgery should be screened preoperatively in the outpatients department, and for those found to be a carrier, a prescription should be sent to the community pharmacy by the physician, so that patients can start treatment at home prior to admission. This treatment can be continued and finished in the hospital. For patients admitted without prior screening, rapid testing using molecular tools is an option, available 24 hours a day for optimal patient care.</p><p>The results of this study clearly show a financial benefit associated with the screen-and-treat strategy in elective cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery. Based on the nasal <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriage rate of 20% we found in the study, per thousand surgical patients approximately &#x020ac;400,000 could be saved. Worldwide millions of surgical procedures are performed each year, so huge numbers of patients would benefit from this strategy and this would be accompanied by large savings. The US Centers for Disease Control have now included this strategy in their top recommendations for safer health care (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/prevent/top-cdc-recs-prevent-hai.html">http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/prevent/top-cdc-recs-prevent-hai.html</ext-link>). For other surgical procedures or non-surgical hospitalisations, debate is still open on the economical impact of such a strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043065.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Infection data of cardiothoracic and orthopaedic patients treated with MUP-CHX or placebo.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0043065.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank A van Belkum, HA Verbrugh and HFL Wertheim from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, D Bogaers from the Laboratory of Microbiology and Infection Control, Amphia Hospital, Breda, R Roosendaal and CMJE Vandenbroucke-Grauls from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University medical centre, Amsterdam, A Box, A Troelstra from the Department of Medical Microbiology and I van der Tweel from the Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, A Voss from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital and the Centre for Orthopaedic Surgery, Sint-Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, all in the Netherlands and the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Hanoi, Vietnam (HFL Wertheim) for their participation in the multicentre trial and E Cuijpers from the Planning and Control Department of the Amphia Hospital, Breda for the assistance in the calculation of the costs.
