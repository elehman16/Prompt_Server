The study was done in accordance with published guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref> and is reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines.</p><p>Patients were eligible for enrolment if they had a clinical diagnosis of thalassemia, chronic hepatitis C or increment of ALT and AST in serum, but excluded if they were pregnant, or had immunocompromised patients (such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection), renal failure, serological evidence of active hepatitis B virus infection, clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, neutropenia &#x0003c; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> /l and thrombocytopenia &#x0003c; 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> /l. The main objective was to explore if addition of ribavirin to interferon alpha-2b to treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in thalassemic patients would improve SVR compared with interferon alpha-2b treatment alone. Thirty seven patients were defined as eligible patients. Written informed consent was recorded from subjects who agreed to participate. One patient refused consent. Thirty six patients were randomly assigned to two groups using a computer-generated number list. First group (n = 18) received interferon alpha-2b (three million units three times a week) plus ribavirin (patients with genotype 3 received 800 mg daily, patients with genotype1 and nontypable received 1000 mg daily if their body weight was &#x0003c; 75 kg and 1200 mg daily for patients who were &#x0003e; 75 kg). And second group (n = 18) received interferon alpha-2b (three million units three times a week). A liver biopsy was performed before the start of treatment. And were graded and staged according to the Knodell scoring (HAI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref> Treatment duration was 24 weeks for patients with genotype 3 and 48 weeks for genotype 1 and nontypable patients.</p><p>The primary end-point was HCV RNA, which was measured at the end of treatment and 6 months after finishing therapy. AST and ALT measured as secondary end-points at the end of treatment. Patients visited the clinic once a week at the first month and then once a month to assess clinical status. Patients who had negative HCV RNA after treatment were followed-up for at least 6 months after completion of their course of treatment to assess SVR result. Patients, health-care professionals and project analyst were unaware of the treatment assigned. To achieve this, patients in mono-therapy group received placebo daily instead of ribavirin.</p><p>Due to the sample size, non-parametric data analysis was performed. Data are presented as means &#x000b1; 1SD or median (IQR) as appropriate. All analyses were done with the use of SPSS software (version 17). Outcomes were compared between the groups using Chi square test and Fisher Exact test. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare responses between the treatment strategies. P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>Between August 2007, and August 2009, 36 patients were randomly assigned: 18 were assigned to receive combination therapy and 18 to receive interferon alpha-2b alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> shows the trial profile.
