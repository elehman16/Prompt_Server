Serious games (using gaming technology for serious purposes) have emerged as a method of studying physician decision making.

We used the decision context of trauma triage in the Emergency Department of non-trauma centers, given widely accepted guidelines that recommend the transfer of severely injured patients to trauma centers. We designed cases with the premise that the representativeness heuristic influences triage (i.e. physicians make transfer decisions based on archetypes of severely injured patients rather than guidelines). We randomized a convenience sample of emergency medicine physicians to a control or cognitive load arm, and compared performance (disposition decisions, number of orders entered, time spent per case). We hypothesized that cognitive load would increase the use of heuristics, increasing the transfer of representative cases and decreasing the transfer of non-representative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We recruited 209 physicians, of whom 168 (79%) began and 142 (68%) completed the task. Physicians transferred 31% of severely injured patients during the game, consistent with rates of transfer for severely injured patients in practice. They entered the same average number of orders in both arms (control (C): 10.9 [SD 4.8] vs. cognitive load (CL):10.7 [SD 5.6], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.74), despite spending less time per case in the control arm (C: 9.7 [SD 7.1] vs. CL: 11.7 [SD 6.7] minutes, p&#x0003c;0.01). Physicians were equally likely to transfer representative cases in the two arms (C: 45% vs. CL: 34%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20), but were more likely to transfer non-representative cases in the control arm (C: 38% vs. CL: 26%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that physicians made decisions consistent with actual practice, that we could manipulate cognitive load, and that load increased the use of heuristics, as predicted by cognitive theory.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences 1K23 GM101292-02 (DM).

The relative weight exerted by these two systems depends on the characteristics of the task (time-pressure, cognitive load) and the person making the judgment (expertise, motivation). <xref rid="pone.0105445-Gillard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Understanding the roles of these different processes is vital for improving decision making.</p><p>People have imperfect introspective access to their own judgment, and so cannot accurately explain why they do things. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Nisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> As a result, researchers must draw inferences about cognitive processes by examining decisions made under systematically varying conditions. Existing methods have known limitations. For example, paper vignettes with static descriptions have unclear external validity; direct observation rarely allows manipulation of task conditions; live simulation requires costly investments in infrastructure and data collection. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Peabody1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105445-Dhami1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> We offer a new tool for studying those processes, serious games, which use gaming technology to create realistic versions of clinical problems. Serious games can, in principle, retain clinical validity by simulating representative task environments, while allowing the experimental manipulation of task conditions that can reveal cognitive processes <xref rid="pone.0105445-Zyda1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. After the initial investment in their creation, they can be implemented relatively inexpensively. However, little is known about their validity in this context. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Graafland1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> The present study fills some of that gap.</p><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the construct validity of a serious game for studying physician decision making, by measuring a) the game's external validity; b) our ability to manipulate one task condition, cognitive load; and c) participants' responses to those manipulation, in terms of their consistency with predictions based on cognitive theory, specifically predicting increased reliance on heuristics under greater cognitive load.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We used the decision context of trauma triage in the Emergency Department of non-trauma centers, and recruited a convenience sample of physicians at a national meeting of the American College of Emergency Physicians in the fall of 2013.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Conceptual Model</title><p>Trauma triage exemplifies decisions made under time pressure and uncertainty, where physicians' abilities to identify rare events have important implications for patient outcomes. Moreover, it is a context where practice patterns often deviate from guidelines, despite intensive quality improvement interventions by major professional stakeholders. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Committee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105445-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> The American College of Surgeons provides widely-known guidelines for identifying severely injured patients who should receive care at trauma centers. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Committee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> However, among patients with severe injuries who present initially to non-trauma centers, only one-third are transferred to a higher level of care. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Nisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>
</p><p>The specific hypotheses that we pursued arose from the conjunction of clinical experience, retrospective data analyses, and decision science research. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105445-Kahneman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> We developed a conceptual model of physician triage decisions as the product of judgment (information processing and probability estimation) and choice (selection between available alternatives). <xref rid="pone.0105445-Sanfey1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> In other words, physicians have to judge the severity of the injury, and then choose how to manage it. Judgment arises from the interaction between system one (fast, heuristic) processes and system two (slow, analytic) processes. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Kahneman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> As things speed up, people rely more heavily on heuristics (or cognitive shortcuts) that are often useful, but can lead them astray. As things slow down, they are better able to synthesize the complex, uncertain elements of more difficult decisions (assuming that they have the training to do so). <xref rid="pone.0105445-Gillard1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Shah2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> Choice reflects variables such as physician attitudes towards the guidelines, outcome expectancy, institutional norms, regional resource constraints, and patient preferences. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Newgard1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>
</p><p>We wanted to understand the influence of system one processes on trauma triage decision making. Our prediction for the expression of heuristic thinking was based on our clinical experience. For example, we had observed that patients with gunshot wounds were far more likely to be transferred to a trauma center than patients who had fallen, for any given injury severity score. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> That pattern is consistent with reliance on the <italic>representativeness heuristic</italic>, whereby the likelihood of an outcome depends on how well the case fits (or represents) the process involved. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Kahneman2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> Thus, physicians relying on the heuristic would interpret actual cases in terms of an archetype of what happens when people are shot or fall, then use that match as their default diagnosis. They would require stronger evidence, and time to think, to conclude otherwise. To the extent that transfer decisions reflect the use of heuristics, increased cognitive load should increase adherence with clinical practice guidelines where heuristics match the guidelines (representative cases) and physicians reach the right decision more quickly, despite less thorough examination. It should decrease adherence where heuristics do not match the guidelines (non-representative cases) and physicians lack the time to double check their thinking.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Case Development</title><p>In previous work, we developed and validated 30 static paper-based trauma case vignettes. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan4" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> We selected 12 cases (6 with severe injuries and 6 with minor injuries) and developed them into branching vignettes.

</p><p>Our serious game simulates the environment of an Emergency Department (ED) at a non-trauma center. We collaborated with a gaming company (Breakaway Ltd; Hunt Valley, MD) to transfer the paper vignettes into a 2-D serious game. Participants had to evaluate and manage ten cases over 42 minutes, simulating a busy eight-hour ED shift. New patients arrived at pre-specified (but unpredictable) intervals, so that physicians had to manage multiple patients concurrently. Each case included a 2-D rendering of the patient, a chief complaint, vital signs which updated every 30 seconds, a history, and a written description of the physical exam.[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105445-g001">Figure 1A</xref>] In the absence of clinical intervention by the physician &#x0201c;player,&#x0201d; severely injured patients and critically ill distractor patients decompensated and died over the course of the game.</p><fig id="pone-0105445-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0105445.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Screen shots of serious game.</title><p>A) Each case included a 2-D rendering of the patient, a chief complaint, vital signs, a history, and a written description of the physical exam.

Other orders generated additional information, presented as reports added to the patients' charts. The cases ended when physicians either made a disposition decision (admit, discharge, transfer) or the patient died.</p><p>We included several design elements to enhance the verisimilitude of the experience. For example, in addition to their clinical responsibilities, players also had to respond to audio-visual distractors, including nursing requests for help with disruptive patients, interruptions by families asking for information, and paging alerts from administrators.[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105445-g001">Figure 1C</xref>] We returned new information in a time-delayed fashion, corresponding to that in actual practice (but scaled to simulation time). For example, the results of a chest x-ray returned after two minutes, while the results of a CT scan required a five-minute wait. A clock at the top of the screen helped players to track the passage of time. We did specify that physicians could not make a disposition decision for hemodynamically unstable patients (e.g. systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90), in order to prevent physicians from deflecting responsibility for potentially challenging cases.

The pattern of decisions made during the game appears consistent with actual practice patterns. The experimental manipulation of task conditions had the desired effect on cognitive load. The experimental manipulation changed decision making in ways consistent with predictions based on cognitive theory.</p><p>Existing conceptual models of physician decision making have ignored the influence of heuristics &#x02013; in large part because of the lack of empirical evidence. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Cabana1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> However, heuristics may play an important role in decision making, and do not respond to the same types of quality improvement interventions as other determinants. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Klayman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> Better tools for evaluating physician decision making are essential for improving the quality of performance. Here we provide proof-of-concept that serious games have the potential to serve as an important method of studying physician decision making. First, they elicit decisions consistent with actual practice. In the decision context of the ED of a non-trauma center, we found that physicians would transfer patients and obtain CT scans at the same rate as they would in real-life. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Mohan3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Flanagan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>
</p><p>Second, serious games offer the opportunity to examine decisions under systematically varying conditions. For example, we found that we could successfully manipulate cognitive load. Limits exist for human attentional and cognitive abilities. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> Numerous studies have demonstrated that as overall workload increases, people develop more disorganized task routines, with impaired capacity to deal with new demands. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Chui1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105445-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> We found several indicators that performance deteriorated in the experimental arm: time spent per case increased; transfer of severely injured patients (i.e. compliance with clinical practice guidelines) decreased. Additionally, during our exploration of determinants of transfer patterns, we found that errors occurred specifically for the &#x02018;easy&#x02019; cases. In practice, physicians typically transfer younger and hemodynamically unstable patients to trauma centers. In the experimental arm of the study, the rate of transfer for these patients dropped. At first, this observation might appear paradoxical. However, the relationship between cognitive load and inattentional blindness (a failure to observe salient cues when distracted by competing demands on attention) is well-described. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-Drew1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> We hypothesize that treatment of young and unstable patients in the experimental arm reflects the presence of inattentional blindness, which in turn reinforces our conclusion that they experienced greater cognitive load.</p><p>Finally, by allowing the observation of decision making under different task conditions, serious games permit insight into the cognitive processes that inform judgment. We found that transfer rates of patients with severe injuries differed between arms in the study, but only for those with non-representative patterns of injuries. Based on our conceptual model of physician decision making, a number of possible explanations exist for failures to adhere to clinical practice guidelines. Physicians may choose not to follow the guidelines, either because they do not agree with them or because some external constraint (e.g. patient preferences, institutional norms) precludes adherence. If true, then cognitive load should have no influence on decision making. Alternatively, physicians may choose to follow the guidelines but find the task more difficult under conditions of cognitive load. If true, transfer patterns should vary between arms of the study: either improving under cognitive load as physicians consciously decide to respond to the challenge by sending more patients to referral centers or by worsening as physicians develop more disorganized work routines. Regardless, differences in performance should occur consistently for all cases. A third possibility is that physicians rely on their heuristics to triage patients, which do not correspond exactly with the clinical practice guidelines. If true, transfer patterns should vary between arms of the study, but only for specific types of cases (i.e. physicians will fail to transfer cases where discordance exists between their intuitive judgments about the severity of the injury and recommendations for best practice). Our observation is therefore most consistent with the increased use of the representativeness heuristic to triage patients under conditions of stress.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Given the small number of cases, we are unable to comment on individual physicians' cognitive process, but relied on aggregate evidence. Additionally, we included a much higher proportion of severely injured patients than occurs in practice, so as to have a task of tolerable length with enough severely injured patients to evaluate our hypotheses. The effect of base rates on decision making is hard to predict. <xref rid="pone.0105445-Birnbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105445-BarHillel1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> However, the similarity of triage rates to actual practice patterns suggests that the inflated base rate in our study did not significantly modify decision making regarding individual cases. We also have limited information about the game play experience of participants, which might have affected performance. Randomization produced two groups with similar characteristics in all measured attributes (age, experience, practice environment), suggesting that the arms were similar in this respect as well. Finally, 23% of the half of participants who provided feedback about the experience, complained about the game's verisimilitude. However, we found similar practice patterns on the game as compared with real-life, suggesting concerns about verisimilitude did not affect the external validity of the instrument. These complaints were also equally common in the two arms, hence should not have biased our results.</p><p>Improving the quality of physician performance is a high priority for multiple health care stakeholders. As a new source of insight into these processes, we offer a serious game that appears able to replicate the task environment, allowing us to manipulate cognitive load, and reveal the possible role of heuristic thinking on trauma triage decision making. Our results suggest that serious game technology has potential as a method of evaluating physician decision making and warrants further evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0105445.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>Sample of feedback provided by participants after completing the game.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0105445.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank many University of Pittsburgh faculty and staff for their contributions: Jason Sperry, Francis Guyette, Jon Rittenburger, Michele Dorfsman, and Raquel Forsythe for their help reviewing the case vignettes; Christina Steele for her help recruiting physician subjects.
