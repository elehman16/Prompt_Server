In vitro studies examining the respiratory tissue-binding properties of corticosteroids showed FF to have the largest cellular accumulation and slowest rate of efflux compared with other clinically used inhaled corticosteroids, consistent with greater tissue retention. The enhanced affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor binding of FF, coupled with its extended tissue association, may be expected to lead to greater and more prolonged anti-inflammatory effects and should provide relevant once-daily efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the rate and extent of systemic absorption of FF from the lung following inhaled administration of FF from three exploratory dry powder formulations (via DISKHALER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) compared with inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) [via DISKHALER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] using deconvolution analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This open-label, part-randomized, six-way crossover study evaluated three early development dry powder inhaled formulations of FF administered as single doses via DISKHALER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

The bioavailability of both inhaled FF and FP represents absorption from the lung as the oral bioavailability from the swallowed portion of the inhaled dose is negligible (&#x0003c;1.5&#x000a0;%). To investigate the absorption kinetics from the lung, the inhaled concentration&#x02013;time data were subjected to deconvolution analysis using derived pharmacokinetic parameters from fitting of the intravenous concentration&#x02013;time data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub>) for inhaled FF was considerably longer (range 17&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) than the t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> estimated for intravenous FF (14&#x000a0;h), whereas t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> for FP was similar whether inhaled or given intravenously (11 and 14&#x000a0;h, respectively). This would suggest that FF is exhibiting absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics following inhaled FF dosing and that the apparent t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> is an estimate of absorption rate. The lung mean absorption time for FF was approximately 7&#x000a0;h irrespective of formulation, which was considerably longer than FP (2.1&#x000a0;h). The time for 90&#x000a0;% absorption from the lung was significantly longer for FF (20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;h) than for FP (8&#x000a0;h), indicating a significantly longer lung retention time for FF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In comparison with inhaled FP, inhaled FF (independent of formulation) demonstrated prolonged absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation, indicating a longer lung retention time and suggesting the potential for maintained efficacy with once-daily administration.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluticasone furoate (FF) is a novel inhaled corticosteroid that is active at 24&#x000a0;h and under development for once-daily administration in combination with the long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist vilanterol (GW642444) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.</p><p>In vitro studies examining the respiratory tissue binding properties of inhaled corticosteroids showed FF to have the largest cellular accumulation and slowest rate of efflux compared with other clinically used inhaled corticosteroids, consistent with greater tissue retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The enhanced affinity of glucocorticoid receptor binding of FF, coupled with its extended tissue association, may be expected to lead to greater and more prolonged anti-inflammatory effects and could result in once-daily efficacy. For drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids, which exert their pharmacological activity on cells and tissues of the airway walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a longer pulmonary residence time enhances their anti-inflammatory effectiveness. The residence time will be increased for drugs that are absorbed more slowly into the pulmonary circulation after deposition in the airways.</p><p>This study was conducted in healthy subjects to investigate the inhaled and intravenous pharmacokinetics of FF compared with those of fluticasone propionate (FP). The pharmacokinetics of three different exploratory dry powder formulations dosed via DISKHALER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were also compared.

Twenty-three of the 24 enrolled subjects successfully completed all doses as planned. One subject withdrew after one treatment period for personal reasons unrelated to study medications (this was his first study and he could not tolerate the repeated cannulation and venesection procedures). There were no serious adverse events reported and no clinically significant changes in biochemical, haematological or urinary parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was conducted in healthy male subjects to investigate the inhaled and intravenous pharmacokinetics of FF, compared with those of FP. Use of analytical deconvolution techniques allowed the rate and duration of the input (absorption) of FF and FP into the systemic circulation after inhalation to be assessed over the entire absorption period. The results showed that the estimate of apparent t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> following single-dose, inhaled administration of FF was notably longer than that seen following intravenous dosing, whereas for FP the t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> values were similar following the two routes. This suggests that FF is exhibiting absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics and that the apparent t<sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> is an estimate of absorption rate following inhaled administration. MAT for FF was, on average, 6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h and independent of formulation. This was considerably longer than that for FP which was, on average, 2.1&#x000a0;h. As oral absorption for both FF and FP is in the region of &#x0003c;1.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the majority of exposure from inhaled dosing, as with FP, would appear to be from the lung. The t<sub>&#x000bd;abs</sub> and T90 from the lung were similar for all FF treatments and significantly longer than those for FP. These parameters would suggest that, independent of formulation, a significant amount of FF remains in the lung for up to 24&#x000a0;h post-dose (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and would also translate to the final formulation and device. This greater residence of FF in the lung may result in a longer duration of action than with FP (t<sub>&#x000bd;abs</sub> of 10.1&#x02013;12.1&#x000a0;h compared with 4.8&#x000a0;h). Deconvolution analyses have previously been reported for FP and the results for FP in this study are consistent with those previous results. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p><p>Systemic exposure results for each of the different FF treatments were notably different, with values for absolute bioavailability being, on average, 6.3, 13.3 and 18.4&#x000a0;% for formulations 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In vitro performance data generated showed only minimal differences in the respirable fraction and, hence, differences in lung dose provided only partial explanation for the differences in bioavailability. It is evident that there are other factors such as lung deposition and the distribution of particle mass material that may also contribute to these differences.</p><p>The intravenous pharmacokinetics of FF were very similar to those for FP. Volume of distribution at steady state for FF and FP (geometric mean 704 and 577&#x000a0;L, respectively) was greater than that quoted for total body water (42&#x000a0;L) for a 70&#x000a0;kg man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], indicating extensive distribution into tissues and total plasma clearance for FF and FP (average 71.8 and 63.9&#x000a0;L/h, respectively) approached liver blood flow (87&#x000a0;L/h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The absolute bioavailability for FP was, on average, 9.0&#x000a0;% and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of inhaled and intravenous FP in this study are consistent with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Inhaled FF (independent of formulation), in comparison with inhaled FP, demonstrated prolonged absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation, indicating a longer lung retention time and suggesting the potential for maintained efficacy with once-daily administration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Bioanalytical support for the fluticasone furoate and fluticasone propionate analyses was provided by York Bioanalytical Solutions, UK.
