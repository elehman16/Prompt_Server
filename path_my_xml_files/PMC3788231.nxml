Mainly, there are two kinds of EEG indices available in anesthesia, one uses cortical EEG such as bispectral index (BIS), and another uses subcortical EEG response to stimuli, in which only the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) index (AAI) is available. The BIS and AAI measure different aspects of brain activity. BIS measures hypnotic component of anesthesia, while AAI shows the information of both analgesia and hypnosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Recently, a new index has been developed, a composite AAI (cAAI), which uses both cortical EEG and AEP. In the cAAI, active measurement is based on the AEP, and passive measurement during deep anesthesia is based on spontaneous EEG. In case of low AEP signal quality, cAAI is calculated from the spontaneous EEG activity. This prevents mis-interpreting low cAAI values.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The cAAI is considered to be a measure of total balance between analgesia and hypnosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Therefore, cAAI might be better than BIS and AAI as a monitor of anesthetic depth. The present study compared the performance of cAAI, BIS, and AAI in propofol-fentanyl anesthesia with an epidural block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Ethical approval for this randomized controlled non-blind study (No. 1573) was provided by the Institutional Ethical Committee. After informed consent from patients, 45 patients for abdominal surgery aged 30-65 years were equally allocated to one of the three groups (AAI, cAAI, or BIS group) randomly by an envelope method. Those who had neurological disorders, hearing disturbance, liver or renal disease, mental impairment, alcohol abuse, or taking any drugs affecting cerebral function such as hypnotics, antidepressants, etc., before surgery were excluded.</p><p>As a premedication, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg was intramuscularly administered 30 min before entering the operation room as a routine practice. An epidural catheter was inserted in an appropriate interspinal space. Besides usual noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, and percutaneous oxygen saturation; AAI (AEP version 1.4, Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), cAAI (AEP version 1.6, Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), or BIS (A-2000, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) was monitored (15 patients each). Anesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and fentanyl 4-5 &#x003bc;g/kg; and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.15 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion, fentanyl, and intermittent epidural administration of 1.5% mepivacaine 4-6 mL. When hemodynamics were stable during surgery, propofol infusion rate was fixed at 4 mg/kg/h for 10 min, then increased to 6 mg/kg/h and kept for 10 min. During this period, epidural mepivacaine was not administered. The AAI, cAAI, and BIS as well as blood pressure and heart rate were compared before induction, just before and after intubation, 10 min after fixed propofol infusion rate at 4 and 6 mg/kg/h, and just after extubation.</p><p>Power analysis was performed to detect power of 0.95 for the indices analyzed by repeatedly measuring analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the G Power&#x02122; (ver. 3.03, University Mannheim, Germany), and showed that a total of 36 patients were necessary. Therefore, 15 patients in each group were enrolled considering some patients with protocol failure. Statistical analysis was performed with factorial ANOVA and chi-square test for demographic data; and factorial and repeated measures ANOVA for blood pressure, heart rate, and electroencephalographic indices. A <italic>P</italic>-value less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic data were not different among the three groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased by anesthesia induction, returned to the baseline (before surgery) after intubation, decreased at propofol 4 and 6 mg/kg/h, and increased after extubation. However, no significant differences were observed among the three groups (data is not shown).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-29-333-g001"/></table-wrap><p>All three indices decreased significantly before intubation.

The AAI had the smallest inter-individual variation, and only the AAI increased by intubation and was significantly different between different propofol infusion rates. The cAAI had the largest inter-individual variation without any difference between different propofol infusion rates.</p><p>To compare different indices, it is better to measure all in the same patient simultaneously. However, it is impossible to measure cAAI and AAI simultaneously in the same patient, and we already showed that the click sound of the AEP affects the BIS,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] therefore we used only one monitor in one patient. All indices are simple numbers, therefore, it might not have introduced any bias. In addition, it would be better to include only one type of surgery with the same site of epidural catheter insertion to avoid the effects of surgical stimuli and epidural anesthesia. We included two types of surgery and different epidural catheter insertion sites. However, there were no differences among the groups in the type of surgery, site of epidural catheter insertion, blood pressure, and heart rate. Therefore, three groups were comparable.</p><p>We kept propofol infusion rate for 10 min before measurements. We could not find any studies describing how long it takes to stabilize anesthetic condition if we change the infusion rate. However, in 10 min all indices became constant, which suggested that three indices might be comparable.</p><p>The cAAI greater than 50-60 indicated fully awake or under minimal sedation, 40-50 or 60 were suggestive of moderate sedation, 30-40 were associated with moderate to deep sedation, and less than 30 showed deep sedation like general anesthesia in the studies by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and by Lu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>However, present study showed that cAAI was between 20 and 80 when patients were fully anesthetized with propofol and fentanyl. Our study was performed during surgery in general anesthesia with an epidural block, while the study by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] was in sedation during endoscopy and that by Lu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] was in sedation and an epidural block in intensive care unit. Epidural lidocaine produced a reduction of cAAI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Therefore, cAAI in the study by Lu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and ours should be lower than that in the study by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] at similar hypnotic level. However, the cAAI in our study showed higher values than the other two studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The reason of this discrepancy was not known. In our previous study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] manufacturer's recommended range of general anesthesia fitted better with the AAI than with the BIS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The present study showed both BIS and AAI fitted well, but cAAI did not fit at all.</p><p>The AEP measures output of the central nervous system to a controlled input. AEP provides information about the function of the brainstem and subcortical and cortical components, showing the overall anesthetic state.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Because BIS measures cortical function, it is only able to monitor hypnotic state and is a poor indicator of the sensitiveness to pain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Therefore, the AAI and not the BIS increased by intubation in the present study as in our previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The cAAI uses AEP as a base measurement and add cortical EEG in deep hypnosis, which seems better than the AAI or BIS. The cAAI had a better correlation with calculated propofol effect site concentration than AAI in the previous study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] However, our present study showed that the AAI and neither cAAI nor BIS was significantly different between different propofol infusion rates.</p><p>During induction of anesthesia by propofol-remifentanil, BIS performed better than cAAI, but cAAI was statistically a better discriminator of the consciousness during the wake-up test and emergence, although these differences did not appear to be clinically meaningful.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Rehberg <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] reported that lightening of anesthesia before recovery could be noticed earlier with BIS than cAAI, although consciousness was detected with a significantly higher pK values by cAAI. These results suggest that in light hypnosis, cAAI is better than BIS probably due to the factor of AEP. The AAI followed rapid changes from awake to sleep,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and showed no overlap between awake and asleep values.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The variability of cAAI was higher than the BIS in comparison with the difference between median index values during anesthesia and the threshold recommended by the manufacturer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The cAAI was higher and had larger inter-individual variation than AAI and BIS during propofol-fentanyl anesthesia, especially in deep anesthesia in the present study. Hadzidiakos <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] showed that the EEG components of cAAI may obscure slight changes in consciousness at light sedation level. Therefore, adding cortical EEG might obscure the fine changes of AAI.</p><p>In conclusion, in propofol-fentanyl anesthesia with an epidural block, AAI might be better to discriminate anesthetic depth than cAAI and the BIS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
