However, the instrumentation, irrigation solutions, and the formed debris due to instrumentation containing necrotic tissue, micro-organisms, pulpal fragments, and dentin particles may be extruded from the RCS into the periapical region, resulting in post-operative inflammation and treatment failure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The extrusion of debris using different protocols for instrumentation and irrigation has been reported.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The amount of debris extruded differs according to the preparation techniques because of the various available designs of the file systems and irrigation devices.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] All the instrumentation techniques used for biomechanical preparation result in apical extrusion of debris, even after the root canal preparation is maintained short of the apical terminus.</p><p>Most nickel-titanium (NiTi) instrument systems work in a crown-down manner with push-pull rotation filing movements. Various advances in instrument design and the use of different operational principles can successfully influence the amount of debris extrusion.</p><p>An evolved generation in NiTi instrumentation files is marked by the introduction of single files systems for shaping and cleaning. The WaveOne (WO; Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) single reciprocating file system simulates a reversed balanced force and a linear motion. The Self-Adjusting File (SAF; ReDent-Nova, Ra&#x02019;anana, Israel) is also a single file system, which is a hollow compressible design. The SAF is used with vibrating movement accompanied by continuous irrigation with any desired solution.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The most recent generation of shaping files ProTaper NEXT (PTN; Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK) presents uniqueness with the center of mass and the center of rotation offset design. These files produce a mechanical wave of motion that travels along the active length of the file. This unique design is advantageous in minimizing the engagement between the file and dentin, may also enhance removal of debris out of a canal and improves flexibility of the files.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Less apical extrusion associated with SAF and higher extrusion with WO have been reported in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, no report has compared apical debris extrusion of debris by WO, SAF, and PTN files; hence, the present study was designed to compare the apically extruded debris when the root canals were instrumented with these files. The null hypothesis was that the three different files (WO, SAF, and PTN) that used different kinematic motions (reciprocating, vibratory, and rotary) would have no effect on the apically extruding debris during instrumentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty extracted human mandibular premolars with single canals confirmed radiographically (buccal and proximal) were collected from random collection. The soft-tissue remnants and calculi on the external root surface were removed using ultrasonics. The buccal cusp edge of each tooth was flattened aiding as a reference point, and coronal access was prepared using an access cavity kit (Endo Z Access Kit, Dentsply Tulsa). The canal patency was achieved and controlled with a size 15 K-file. The working length (WL) of each canal was determined as 1 mm short of the length of a size 15 K-file that was visible at the major diameter of the apical foramen. The teeth were then randomly divided into three experimental groups for different instrumentation techniques. The present study used the experimental model described by Myers and Montgomery[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for assessing the debris extruded periapically.</p><p>An analytical balance (Single Pan K-15, K Roy Instruments Pvt. Ltd., Varanasi, India) with an accuracy of 10<sup>-4</sup> g was used to measure the initial weights of the tubes. Three consecutive weights were obtained for each tube, and the mean was calculated. Each tooth was inserted up to the cemento-enamel junction, and a 27-G needle was placed alongside the stopper for use as a drainage cannula and to balance the air pressure inside and outside the tubes. Then, each stopper with the tooth and the needle was attached to its Eppendorf tube, and the tubes were fitted into vials. The same operator trained to use all the file systems efficiently carried out the instrumentation. The Eppendorf tube was covered with a silver foil to blind the operator from seeing the apex during instrumentation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Instrumentation</title><p>The glide path for all the 60 samples was created till a # 20 K-file for all the groups and a new instrument/file (WO, SAF, and PTN) was used for every sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Group 1 WaveOne (WO)</title><p>Twenty teeth were instrumented by single reciprocating file WO (primary) instrument, used in a pecking motion. The root canal orifice was flared using Sx file from the universal ProTaper (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK). A pre-programmed reciprocating endomotor (X-Smart Plus, DentsplyMaillefer) possessing the program for WO (small, primary, and large) files instrumentation was used. The flutes of the instrument were cleaned after three pecks. On meeting obstruction, the file was removed, the canal was irrigated, recapitulated, and the file was re-introduced into the canal again. The instrumentation was done till the WO (primary) file reached the apex.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Group 2 The Self-Adjusting File (SAF)</title><p>Twenty teeth were prepared with the SAF system. A prior glide path established accommodated the 1.5 mm SAF. The SAF file was operated by using in-and-out manual motion for 4 minutes in the canal, with continuous irrigation by using bi-distilled (0.4-mm amplitude and 5,000 vibrations per minute), using VATEA peristaltic pump (ReDent-Nova) at a rate of 4 mL/min. A total of 3 mL bi-distilled water was then used for 3 minutes as a final rinse.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Group 3 ProTaper NEXT (PTN)</title><p>Twenty teeth were instrumented by PTN instruments, used according to the manufacturer's instructions using a gentle in-and-out motion with a torque-controlled endodontic motor (X-Smart Plus, Dentsply Maillefer) at 300 rpm and a torque of 2.6 Ncm. The root canal orifice was flared using Sx file from the universal ProTaper (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK). This was followed by the use of X1 and X2 files. On meeting obstruction the file was removed, the canal was irrigated, recapitulated, and the file was re-introduced into the canal again. The instrumentation was continued till the X1 and X2 both reached the working length.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Irrigation for the rotary/reciprocating files</title><p>After each instrument (rotary) or after three pecks (reciprocating) 2 mL of bi-distilled water was used as irrigant. The irrigation needle (NaviTip 31ga; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT) was placed as deep as possible into the canal but not deeper as the predetermined WL minus 1 mm. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) gel was used as a lubricant throughout the instrumentation procedures for all the groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Debris collection</title><p>Following instrumentation, the teeth were removed from the tube and the debris adhering to the root surface was collected by washing off the apical area of the tooth with 1 ml of distilled water into the centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was stored in an incubator at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 days, to allow the moisture to evaporate, before weighing the dry debris, using an electronic balance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Theraw pooled data of the weights were statistically analyzed using D&#x02019;Agostino-Pearson test for normal distribution and test for homogeneity.

The reciprocating file WO resulted in maximum debris extrusion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas the vibratory file SAF resulted in least debris extrusion in the three groups tested (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Thus, the null hypothesis was rejected. Previous studies have reported less debris extrusion associated with SAF and more with rotary (Protaper) and reciprocating files;[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] however to the best of authors&#x02019; knowledge the apical extrusion of debris resulting from the recently evolved ProTaper NEXT rotary file is rarely reported.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present study used method of Myers and Montgomery;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to simulate clinical conditions, only the buccal cusp edge of each tooth was flattened aiding as a reference point and the shaping procedures were conducted without de-coronation. Distilled water was used as an irrigation solution to avoid any possible crystallization of sodium hypochlorite. The amount of periapically extruded debris being extremely low, the contact of moist or greasy fingertips alters the weight of the extruded debris. Another important issue is the absence of a physical backpressure provided by periapical tissues, an imminent shortcoming of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Also, the residual pulp tissue, condition of the pulp, and normal or pathological periapical tissues may act as barriers and inhibit the apical extrusion <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Some suggestions to simulate the periodontal ligament have been made, by the use of floral foam,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but they lead to absorption of the irrigant as well as the debris.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The present study compared three different instrumentation protocols, a reciprocating file (WO), a vibratory file (SAF), and a rotary file (PTN), a comparison yet to be reported in literature. The results obtained from the current study may be explained by differences in the instrument design and movement kinematics between the WO, SAF, and PTN systems.</p><p>The WO file was associated with the maximum debris extrusion apically in the present study, which is accordance with other studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The WO files are characterized by a modified triangular cross-section, which results in decreased cutting efficacy and smaller chip space resulting in auguring the formed debris after instrumentation, periapically.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The WO files also exhibit a larger taper of 0.08 at the apical 3 mm, which can be attributed for excessive debris formation apically, and extrusion periapically.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>SAF a single-file system, devoid of a central metal core and any cutting edge or flutes, instead has an abrasive surface.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The SAF is operated with a transline in-and-out vibratory motion and associated continuous simultaneous irrigation. This continuous flow of irrigant does not build up any pressure in the canal as the metal meshwork allows the free escape of irrigant. In the narrowest apical part of a canal prepared up to a # 20 K-file, the SAF is effective, leaving more than 38% of the canal cross-section free for backflow of fluid and dentinal debris.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] deMeloRibeiro <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] stated that in the apical third, the SAF system created cleaner inner canal walls when compared to rotary system.</p><p>The PTN is a novel rotary file system and very rare reports on apical extrusion of debris resulting from its instrumentation. Capar <italic>et al</italic>., reported less debris extrusion associated with PTN files when it was compared to the universal ProTaper file systems.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The PTN possess a unique design, an offset center of mass and rotation. This design provides more cross-sectional space for enhanced cutting, loading and successfully allowing the debris to travel out of a canal (coronally), compared to a file with a centered mass and axis of rotation. It may also decrease the chances for the file packing the debris laterally, aiding in reducing the chances of blockage of the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This can be the main advantage of the file and may lead to least debris extrusion; hence, it was used as one of the instrumentation techniques for the present study. The samples in the group instrumented by PTN resulted in less extrusion of the debris when compared to the WO group.</p><p>With rotary and reciprocal systems a predictable and circularly standardized apical preparation can be expected but incase of the SAF group, the apical enlargement depends upon the apical anatomy of the samples. In the present study, SAF group resulted in less extrusion of debris when compared to the other two groups tested. In a study by Dietrich <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] comparing reciprocal movement to the SAF, reciprocal instrumentation resulted in more debris in the apical part of the root canal than the SAF or a rotary system. The amount of debris formed in the apical third may also cause its extrusion periapically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present <italic>ex vivo</italic> study, the extrusion of debris associated with three different files possessing different designs that used different kinematic motions was assessed. Within its limitations, it can be concluded that the three file systems used for instrumentation resulted in extrusion of debris even though the working length was maintained 1mm short of the apex. The SAF that used a vibratory motion with continuous irrigation resulted in significantly less debris extrusion when compared to PTN and WO files systems. The results of the current study are favorable to the SAF system, but further studies clinically evaluating the incidence of post-instrumentation pain with these instrumentation systems can provide a better understanding of these file systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>&#x0201c;Dr Zvi Metzger serves as Scientific Consultant to ReDent-Nova Co., manufacturer of the SAF System.
