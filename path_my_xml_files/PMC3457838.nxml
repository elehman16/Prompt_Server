Good quality evidence has been summarised into guideline recommendations to show that peri-operative fasting times could be considerably shorter than patients currently experience. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies for the implementation of recommendations about peri-operative fasting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pragmatic cluster randomised trial underpinned by the PARIHS framework was conducted during 2006 to 2009 with a national sample of UK hospitals using time series with mixed methods process evaluation and cost analysis. Hospitals were randomised to one of three interventions: standard dissemination (SD) of a guideline package, SD plus a web-based resource championed by an opinion leader, and SD plus plan-do-study-act (PDSA). The primary outcome was duration of fluid fast prior to induction of anaesthesia. Secondary outcomes included duration of food fast, patients&#x02019; experiences, and stakeholders&#x02019; experiences of implementation, including influences. ANOVA was used to test differences over time and interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Nineteen acute NHS hospitals participated. Across timepoints, 3,505 duration of fasting observations were recorded. No significant effect of the interventions was observed for either fluid or food fasting times. The effect size was 0.33 for the web-based intervention compared to SD alone for the change in fluid fasting and was 0.12 for PDSA compared to SD alone. The process evaluation showed different types of impact, including changes to practices, policies, and attitudes. A rich picture of the implementation challenges emerged, including inter-professional tensions and a lack of clarity for decision-making authority and responsibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This was a large, complex study and one of the first national randomised controlled trials conducted within acute care in implementation research. The evidence base for fasting practice was accepted by those participating in this study and the messages from it simple; however, implementation and practical challenges influenced the interventions&#x02019; impact. A set of conditions for implementation emerges from the findings of this study, which are presented as theoretically transferable propositions that have international relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN18046709 - Peri-operative Implementation Study Evaluation (POISE).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Implementation research is concerned with bridging the gap between evidence and practice through &#x02018;the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of clinical research findings and other evidence-based practice into routine practice, and hence improve the quality&#x02026;of healthcare&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].

Schouten <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] also found that quality improvement collaborative approaches showed moderate positive results in some controlled studies. Additionally, it is suggested by Grimshaw <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that passive dissemination of guidelines should not be discounted because it offers a cheaper, feasible approach that may show effectiveness. They found that multi-faceted interventions were not necessarily more effective than single interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Finally, the authors of all these reviews point out that very rarely are the cost consequences of implementation and quality improvement considered within study designs. A further critique of the evidence base is that there has been a lack of attention to implementation processes and theory within trials, which means that it is often difficult to determine why interventions may have worked (or not).</p><p>There is a growing and persuasive body of evidence that serves to highlight that the implementation of evidence into practice may be influenced by many factors, including those that could be considered organisational or contextual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This highlights that implementation strategy development and the evaluation of implementation efforts need to capture contextual dimensions and pay attention to a broad range of influences.</p><sec><title>Fasting practice</title><p>Millions of people are admitted for elective surgery each year. In preparation for anaesthesia, fasting regimes are imposed in order to minimise the risk of regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Traditional fasting rules determine that patients are nil by mouth from midnight for a morning theatre list or have a light breakfast for an afternoon list. However, there is good quality robust research synthesised into national guidelines that recommend it is safe for healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery to have water and clear fluids up to two hours before the induction of anaesthesia and food up to six hours prior to induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Despite a robust evidence base to guide practice, surveys show that prolonged fasting is common across the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A UK survey of departments of anaesthesia revealed that 93 (62%) followed a fasting from midnight policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], whilst fluid intake until four, three, and two hours prior to surgery was reported as &#x02018;acceptable&#x02019; under current guidelines at 40, 31, and 71 departments respectively. Prolonged fasting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, nausea, and a reduced nutritional intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and discomfort for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>No research was found reporting attempts to improve fasting times.

However, it is not clear which strategies might be more or less effective in different contexts, with different clinical topics and professional groups.

Given the apparent high reported mean and consistent claims of long fasting times, it appeared that we could be sure the mean fluid fasting time would substantially exceed the target of two hours prior to introduction of the guidelines. A national survey indicated traditional guidelines still prevailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. If the additional effort of implementation beyond simply providing the guidelines is to be worthwhile, there needs to be a substantially greater reduction in fasting time and there was certainly scope for large impact. After the study had been designed, a report of fasting times for women having scheduled caesareans was published and reported a mean fluid fast of 11&#x02009;hours (SD 3&#x02009;hours) and a mean food fast of 13&#x02009;hours (SD 2&#x02009;hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Breuer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] also found mean fluid fast times of 10&#x02009;hours and mean food fast times of 15&#x02009;hours. Given that current practice appeared to be so far away from the guideline recommendations, it seemed reasonable to expect the more intensive interventions would have a substantial impact on fasting time and would not otherwise be clinically worthwhile, hence a large effect size was used in the sample size calculation.</p><p>The project successfully recruited 19 Trusts. Trusts represented the four UK countries of England (15 Trusts), Scotland (2 Trusts), Wales (1 Trust) and Northern Ireland (1 Trust) and are referred to as Trust A, B, C <italic>et al</italic>. At each fasting time data collection point, a target of collecting fasting times from 40 patients was set.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Each participating Trust was given an ID number. The randomisation schedule was computer-generated centrally and prepared by a statistician who was independent of the project team. Allocation was thus concealed and could not be foreseen in advance of, or during enrolment. Trusts were allocated to one of three implementation interventions, which resulted in six in two arms and seven in the other. Trusts were informed of their allocation by a project researcher as near as possible to the intervention period.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Blinding of local investigators, research fellows or trust staff to interventions was not possible because the intervention required their active participation.

Analysis was conducted at the cluster level; for each Trust, mean fasting times were calculated at each assessment timepoint. At each timepoint, the differences in mean fasting times between the three intervention groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). A repeated measure ANOVA across the timepoint means for all trusts, within each intervention group, was conducted. The trend coefficient was not significantly different to zero: there was no evidence of trend over time pre-or post-intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] therefore data were combined across timepoints (1 to 4 and 5 to 8) and simple pre- and post-interventions comparisons were conducted using t-tests. The significance level used for all tests was 5%. The effect size was calculated for each of the web-based and PDSA interventions compared to SD for change in fluid fasting time between pre- and post-intervention. Confidence intervals for the effect size are based on a non-central t distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Patient experience questionnaires were analysed in SPSS using descriptive statistics, chi squared tests were used to compare characteristics pre- and post-intervention.</p><p>Learning organization survey data were entered into Excel and a random sample of 10% of the data entry was quality checked before being exported into SPSS version 14. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Qualitative data</title><p>Audio-recorded individual and focus group interviews were transcribed in full. Data were analysed within data set and managed in N*DIST 5 (pre-intervention) and NVIVO 7 (post-intervention). A combined inductive and deductive thematic analysis process was used whereby a sub-set of transcripts within a data set (<italic>e.g.,</italic> patient interviews pre-intervention) were analysed inductively by JC and CH and then an analysis framework developed with JRM, which was then applied to the remainder of the data in that set.</p><p>The theoretical framework guided the integration of findings across data sets.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants and data collected</title><p>All 188 acute trusts in the four countries were invited to participate. Trust chief executives, medical and nursing directors (Binleys database) were sent a letter of invitation. A total of 19 Trusts were recruited and remained in the trial. We have no reason to believe that the characteristics of participating Trusts were different from any other NHS Trusts. However, given their willingness to participate, we have to assume they have an interest and therefore motivation to want to do something about their fasting times, which may have made them atypical of other non-participating trusts. Data were collected between November 2006 and February 2009 at a time where the NHS was undergoing major reform under a previous administration (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> for data collected). Anecdotal feedback from some sites that made further enquiries, but who then did not participate, would suggest that engaging in an additional initiative at a time of change was not feasible for them. Seven trusts were allocated to SD, six to SD plus web-based resource championed by an opinion leader, and six to SD plus PDSA. One PDSA trust did not implement the intervention due to staff sickness.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Summary of data collected across timepoints and intervention groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center"><bold>Pre-Intervention (2007 to 2008)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Post-Intervention (2008 to 2009)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Total</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Food fast duration information<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,435<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,777<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3,212<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fluid fast duration information<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,440<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,761<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3,201<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient experience questionnaires<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,069<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,215<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2,284<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Local investigator audit<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">54<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">54<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Interviews with key contacts<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">16<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Interviews with facilitators and opinion leaders<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">21<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Interviews with participants who were both key contacts and facilitators or opinion leaders<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Interview with patients about their experiences<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">35<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">35<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">70<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Completed Learning Organisation Surveys (LOS)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">758<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">318<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1,076<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Focus Group participants (in five groups)</td><td align="center">&#x000a0;</td><td align="center">32</td><td align="center">32</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Not all trusts were able to collect data for all eight timepoints.

One might assume this would be the most cost-effective intervention if the three approaches were shown to have equal effectiveness. Whilst the study did not detect a significant difference, it was not designed to demonstrate equivalence, and therefore it is not possible to say that SD is the most cost-effective approach.

Interview data suggests that most nursing and anaesthetists interviewed thought the evidence underpinning the recommendations was good and the guideline credible, for example:</p><p>"&#x02018;&#x02026;I am quite happy about the evidence base &#x02026; this guideline is not negotiable&#x02026; you can&#x02019;t say &#x02018;well I don&#x02019;t like this bit of it&#x02019;&#x02026;it&#x02019;s based on best evidence.&#x02019; (Trust G, Key Contact and Change Agent [nurse])"</p><p>Issues were raised about the interpretation of some of the recommendations, such as what clear fluids meant, and the amount of water patients could drink.</p><p>Anaesthetists&#x02019; reaction to the evidence base tended towards conservative behaviour, which seemed to be based on prior experience where lists had worked well using traditional fasting rules, for example:</p><p>"&#x02018;&#x02026; Why the extra aggro if there&#x02019;s a sudden change in the list&#x02026;I&#x02019;ve been doing it x years and I&#x02019;ve never had a cancellation because of that.. I personally&#x02026; modify the rules. If somebody turns up having had a jug of water and it&#x02019;s only one hour and 45&#x02009;minutes I&#x02019;ll go ahead and anaesthetise them. Other guys will say&#x02026;let&#x02019;s cancel, postpone.&#x02019; (Trust L, Anaesthetist Key Contact and Change Agent)"</p></sec><sec><title>Context</title><p>Contextual factors were important influences on individual&#x02019;s and trust&#x02019;s capability to change practises in line with guideline recommendations, not least that it is challenging to change service delivery in a constantly changing environment. Three main findings are outlined here.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter-professional issues</title><p>Inter-professional relationships were a significant emergent theme across all data. This incorporated different professional approaches, leadership, power and hierarchical structures, and professional cultures. Although we did not set out to specifically explore professional culture data, findings show that fasting practice was influenced by how the disciplines functioned together, sometimes bringing them into conflict because they had different objectives, ways of working and power bases.</p><p>"&#x02018;&#x02026; The fasting guidelines are&#x02026; embedded in so many different cultures that &#x02013; so many different aspects of the organisation that they really are quite difficult to change.&#x02019; (Trust R Anaesthetist PDSA Facilitator)"</p><p>There was a professional struggle over fasting practice within Trusts. For example, one anaesthetist key contact (Trust J) sent out emails to medical staff promoting shorter fast times. Some of their colleagues replied &#x02018;this is my theatre.&#x02019; Often, such behaviour resulted in nurses being caught in the middle of variances in practice between anaesthetists.</p></sec><sec><title>Communication</title><p>Linked to inter-professional working, the nature and quality of communication between individuals, teams, and departments significantly impacted on fasting practice. In some trusts, communication between theatres and wards about delays was considered good. In others it was poor and seen as an area for improvement particularly with respect to revising and individualising fasting times.</p><p>"&#x02018;&#x02026;We&#x02019;ve had a phone call from theatre to say this patient&#x02019;s been cancelled and you can feed and water them. Half an hour later we&#x02019;ve had a phone call saying has she or he been fed and watered, she can go down so there&#x02019;s been a big miscommunication or been told completely wrong....&#x02019; (Trust A Nurse, Focus group-SD)"</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation context</title><p>The response rates to the Learning Organization Survey were low (18% pre-intervention and 7.4% post-intervention) and therefore findings interpreted with caution. General features to emerge included that the organisations in this study were perceived to be highly structured, rule-based organisations. Over 50% of responders did not feel innovative ideas were rewarded, and fewer than 60% of the responders believed they are required to upgrade and increase their knowledge. Less than 50% of responders did not feel an integral part of their Trust.</p></sec><sec><title>Facilitation</title><p>Opinion leaders and PDSA facilitators within two intervention arms had the potential to take on facilitation roles (&#x02018;making things easier&#x02019;). In reality, the enactment of these roles varied and linked to activities rather than the model of facilitation/change agency of the intervention. As such, fidelity to interventions was variable and as a research team did not intervene in the intervention phase.

Overall, there was no significant change to fluid and food fasting times pre- and post-intervention and no significant differences between the effectiveness of the three implementations. There were some significant decreases in fluid fast times within trusts, but in two trusts there was a significant increase in either fluid or fast times. These data present a complex, but realistic picture of implementation within acute care settings where multiple people, teams, and departments are involved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was a large and complex evaluation of implementation interventions within acute care, the findings of which are relevant to the international community. Evidence use can impact in different ways. The gap between changing behaviour or practice, and how a change in practice or behaviour then translates into a change in (patient) outcomes is notoriously challenging to achieve. Within this study, whilst we did not observe significant positive changes to the primary outcome of duration of fluid fasting, other types of impact were achieved, which can be mapped along the continuum of research use that includes changes to awareness, knowledge and understanding, attitudes, perceptions, ideas, and practice and policy changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For example, trusts&#x02019; involvement in the project had raised awareness of the issue of fasting locally. Data also show that some participants believed that attitudes and ideas towards local fasting practice had shifted and that the project had &#x02018;kick-started&#x02019; ideas. In some trusts, new policies and procedures were developed and there were changes to fasting practice. However, these impacts were not enough to result in changes to fasting outcomes over the time period studied. Methodologically, if we accept that evidence can have different types of impact, this raises questions about how these should/could be captured within implementation projects. There have been calls for ensuring that process evaluations are embedded within trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and this study demonstrates why theory-led evaluation is important. Using theory facilitates a better understanding of impacts and outcomes, including and understanding of what, why, and how [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]</p><p>Process data show that the most influential mediators of practice change were inter-professional issues/tensions and communication, and a lack of clarity for the authority and responsibility for local fasting decisions (<italic>e.g.,</italic> when operating lists changed). These issues were evident irrespective of the allocation to intervention. Theoretically, the PDSA intervention had the potential to diagnose and ameliorate these issues, however within this study facilitator activities undertaken were more project related (<italic>e.g.,</italic> arranging education meetings) than process orientated (<italic>e.g.,</italic> teambuilding) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Future change strategies in this area of practice would benefit from a focus on effective team working. More generally, there is still much to learn about what &#x02018;good enough&#x02019; facilitation is, and what might work in different situations.</p><p>Theoretically, we had anticipated that more active interventions might have a greater impact than a passive strategy alone. Our findings suggest the effect size of the more active interventions compared to SD alone is small, thus supporting previous assertions that passive and simple interventions, may be as effective as active, and multi-faceted ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, process data provide some more explanation. Closer analysis of the trust that made the greatest change to fasting times, for example, shows they were disappointed to have been allocated to SD, there was an existing commitment by the hospital to reduce fasting times, there was targeted and active dissemination of the guideline to relevant parts of the organisation, a number of key stakeholders took a leadership role in championing the issue, and the key contact led on multiple implementation related activities. These findings are supported by published studies showing that strategic buy-in, leadership, and active strategies may all be essential ingredients for successful implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>As researchers, our ability to &#x02018;control&#x02019; intervention and implementation activities in this study was limited. Theoretically, the interventions were standardised in that all were &#x02018;packaged&#x02019; and appropriate training provided. However, in reality, there was variability in the starting points of trusts (<italic>e.g.,</italic> some had no fasting policy), and therefore a difference in how different components of the interventions were implemented. For example, all PDSA intervention trusts had a start-up meeting, but not all continued to meet regularly throughout the intervention period as planned in the intervention package because of difficulties securing time away from practice. Therefore, within this study there are important questions about intervention fidelity and whether relevant staff and departments had insufficient exposure to the implementation interventions. However, there are questions to ask about if, and how, you could control activities in studies that are undertaken in the reality of complex and unpredictable clinical environments where researchers are working at arm&#x02019;s length with local clinical/research communities. Hawe <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] suggest we pay attention to the function and process of the intervention, rather than the standardisation of the intervention components themselves. Identifying the essential functions of an intervention, for example, facilitation, and examining the evidence for a fit with the theory of facilitation would provide an alternative perspective on standardisation and fidelity.</p><p>Within this study, some theoretical integrity was achieved by applying a theoretical framework that guided implementation intervention development, evaluation activities and for providing explanation. As outlined earlier, the underlying &#x02018;theory&#x02019; of PARIHS is that SI = f(E,C,F). If we test the proposition with the findings of this study, the component that does not stand up to scrutiny is evidence. Fasting practice has a robust research evidence base, which was generally accepted by those participating in this study. Previous research has indicated that where there is strong research evidence, about which there is clinical consensus it is more likely to be used in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this study, the mediating effect of context (particularly the effect that teams and professional groups had on operating list management) was stronger, and facilitative activities used in this study did not overcome these.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The interrupted time series did not have all data at all timepoints for all trusts, mainly due to the delays in getting research governance approval from participating Trusts. However, because there were no significant time trends pre-or post-intervention, and thus all four pre-and all four post-timepoints were combined, the impact of this missing data was minimised.</p><p>The primary outcome was duration of fluid fast prior to induction of anaesthesia. This together with food fast time was collected by the local investigator asking patients when they last drank and ate, supported by data in patients&#x02019; notes. It is possible the times recorded were not always recalled or recorded completely accurately.</p><p>The intervention period was six months, which limited the amount of activity that was possible before post-intervention outcome data was collected. The four post-intervention timepoints did not show any trends over time, suggesting that a longer intervention period may not have led to improved fasting times. However, evidence is lacking about how long an intervention period is needed to make changes to practice and service delivery, particularly ones that sustain.</p><p>The size of this study&#x02014;19 Trusts split over three intervention groups&#x02014;may be seen as a limitation. The study was designed to be adequately powered to detect an effect size that was large because the evidence available at the time of designing the trial suggests fluid fasting times are far too long and would need to reduce substantially more for the intensive intervention than by SD if the effort required was to have an impact on fluid fasting time that was beneficial to patients.</p><p>As a cluster trial, to have a substantial impact on the power of the study would require additional Trusts, not simply more observations within the existing Trusts. However, to recruit and maintain Trusts in a study of this type is complex, costly, and very time-onsuming. The evidence from surveys suggests that fluid fasting times have not substantially decreased since the guidelines were published and disseminated in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; thus, our assumption that fluid fasting time needs to substantially reduce is still supported by other studies. Whilst it is important in designing studies to be realistic about the effect size that can be achieved, we also need to strive to detect effects of clinical worth not simply those that are statistically significant. The more intensive interventions considered in this study would need to show a substantial reduction in fluid fasting time beyond that of SD to be of noticeable benefit to patients.</p><p>Intervention fidelity was difficult to ensure and evaluate. We were aware that different teams implemented their intervention in different ways, and we attempted to capture this through the process evaluation. For example, some PDSA groups appeared to follow the process closely, others were less engaged and followed it in a more <italic>ad hoc</italic> manner. Thus, the intervention &#x02018;dose&#x02019; is likely to be different between the groups. As a pragmatic RCT, tailoring of interventions is a recognised component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and viewed as making the intervention more feasible to implement in the real world.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is one of the first national RCTs with an embedded process evaluation conducted within acute care in the field of implementation research. Evaluating implementation in the context of fasting practice provided a useful vehicle with which to expose some of the general issues and challenges faced when implementing evidence into practice. The issues uncovered in this study have important international implications because they have helped to further articulate the complex processes embedded in implementation as well as its evaluation.</p><p>There are a set of conditions and antecedents for implementation that emerge from the findings of this study, which we have developed into a number of propositions:</p><p>1. Implementation is more likely to be successful in cases where the topic/issue is a strategic and organisational priority. If the issue is not a priority, the active engagement of individuals and departments is mediated by for example, a lack of dedicated human and financial resource, and resultant implementation will be patchy.</p><p>2. A historical lack of clear leadership, structure, and process for local guideline dissemination and implementation, in which staff are unclear about their responsibilities, will negatively impact on an organisation&#x02019;s ability to routinely use guideline recommendations.</p><p>3. Robust and believable evidence is not always sufficient to change decision making and practice, therefore implementation interventions and efforts need to extend beyond individual decision making (at least for certain clinical topics) and take account of the systemic interconnections between individuals, teams and organisations.</p><p>4. In areas where there is more effective teamwork with clear communication, practice change will be easier to achieve.</p><p>5. New improvement and implementation projects have a higher chance of success if they are embedded into existing programmes and structures.</p><p>6. Change agent effectiveness is a function of the protected space and dedicated time to fulfil the role, <italic>i.e.,</italic> it has to be part of the &#x02018;day job.&#x02019;</p><p>7. Change agents will be more effective if they have people management skills, work collaboratively, handle difficult situations and people with diplomacy, understand where people &#x02018;are coming from,&#x02019; develop and motivate a team, including effective and considerate delegation of work, using team members skills well. This is a skilled role at which some excel, and some find more challenging.</p><p>8. Evaluations of implementation interventions that capture different types of impacts over the course of the study/programme are more likely to provide a realistic picture of knowledge use, and intended and unintended consequences. Clearly, how one proceeds to evaluate these impacts will be dependent on the definition of knowledge and use.</p><p>9. Complex interventions such as implementation interventions need to be deconstructed to gain a greater understanding of the linkages between the active components/mechanisms of action and the impact on both process and summative outcomes.</p><p>It is likely that these propositions will be theoretically transferable to other implementation studies, particularly when considered alongside the growing empirical and theoretical evidence base about the successful ingredients for successful implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JRM conceived the study, and led the design of the study with KS, IB, and NC.
