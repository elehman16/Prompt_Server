impact that pharmacists can have on a range of outcomes. Even dating back to the 1990s, studies have
shown that community pharmacist-led services comprising patient education and blood pressure
monitoring (including the use home blood pressure readings obtained from monitors that wirelessly
transmit information to the pharmacy) can improve patient knowledge about hypertension,
significantly decrease mean blood pressure, improve blood pressure control in those not at treatment
targets, and rationalise the use of antihypertensive medication.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A Cochrane review also reports the positive outcomes from
pharmacist-led care, with the majority of controlled trials associated with improved blood pressure
control.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Even those studies that have focused on patient
self-management (e.g., self-monitoring of BP) have shown that additional support from health
professionals may enhance the BP lowering effect of any intervention.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Pharmacy practice has, of course, evolved in recent times, comprising more specialised
roles and an expanded scope of practice. This has been highlighted by the RxACTION trial (i.e., the
Rural Alberta Clinical Trial in Optimizing Hypertension).<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
which evaluated the impact of enhanced pharmacist care on the management of patients with
hypertension; this enhanced care involved pharmacists taking a more active role and independently
prescribing antihypertensive medication. The study showed that the enhanced care resulted in
significantly larger reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with patients twice
as likely to reach their recommended blood-pressure targets, compared to usual care. Although this
type of expanded care is not yet legislated in Australia, pilot studies have also demonstrated the
potential for pharmacist prescribing in hypertension management, suggesting that credentialed
pharmacists are able to make appropriate therapeutic decisions.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In delivering such interventions, it is important to recognise that the management of hypertension is relatively complex, comprising screening and monitoring of blood pressure, addressing adherence barriers, and reviewing pharmacotherapy.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is these aspects of hypertension management that Australian community pharmacists need to currently focus on, in preparation for future expanded care services.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, the aim of this paper is to report on the lessons learned from a pilot study of a pharmacist-led intervention (hypertension management service) in Australian primary care. Specifically, the objectives of this paper are to: 1) describe the key outcomes following delivery of the intervention; 2) report pharmacists&#x02019; feedback regarding service implementation and any methodological challenges; and 3) discuss the challenges encountered using a program evaluation framework.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study Design - Pilot study of a pharmacist-led intervention</title><p>A pharmacist-led intervention was evaluated in a 3-group prospective, controlled study commencing at the beginning of 2013, and concluding in mid-2014: initially, Group A (Control) and Group B (Intervention) were implemented, followed later by Group C (Short Intervention; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p><p>BP = blood pressure; QoL = Quality of Life; MMAS = Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; GP = General Practitioner.

This group was introduced later to the study, after the recruitment of patients to Groups A and B had concluded, and was based on the initial experience of Group B pharmacists. Group C represented a variation to the study protocol to maximise patient recruitment and to model the approaches used commonly in clinical practice and in previous hypertension studies.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However recruitment was not aligned to guideline recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Setting and Participants</title><p>Community pharmacists and their patients (customers) were recruited to the study.</p><p>The main study (Groups A and B) was conducted within pharmacies located in two Sydney metropolitan regions that were comparable in terms of socioeconomic characteristics and disease burden (Northern Sydney and Sutherland Medicare Locals, NSW, Australia). Pharmacists were therefore recruited based on their location in these regions and were cluster-randomised to Group A or B to minimise contamination between intervention and control patients.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Group C was a convenience sample of pharmacists within both Sydney metropolitan and regional sites (Illawarra: n=2, Southern Highlands: n=1) who had not previously offered hypertension services. They were recruited using the snowball technique i.e., the researchers approached one pharmacist who was known to them from participation in previous research studies, and that pharmacist then approached other pharmacists who they thought might be interested in the study.</p><p>Pharmacists within each Medicare Local region were initially contacted by telephone (by Project Officer) to gauge their interest in participating.

As each patient presented to the pharmacy for refill prescriptions, the pharmacist invited them to have their blood pressure (BP) measured and to participate in the study (if eligible). The pharmacists performed an initial screen for poorly controlled hypertension by measuring the patients BP in the pharmacy; for confirmation, all patients in Groups A and B underwent repeated BP measurements (1-week apart) prior to study enrolment, per guideline recommendations.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In Group C, the same intervention was delivered but there was only 1 BP screening step (i.e., baseline BP was not re-checked after 1-week) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The researchers provided each pharmacy with document templates to help efficiently communicate important information to the GPs. This collaboration between the pharmacist and the GP in managing the patient&#x02019;s hypertension was based on the principles of shared care, ensuring that the care provided was: patient-centred; effectively communicated and coordinated; supported by both the GP and the pharmacist; and delivered according to best practice guidelines.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Process and outcome measures</title><p>Purpose-designed data collection forms were provided to pharmacists to document service provision
and relevant outcome measures. Process measures included the number of pharmacists and patients
recruited to the study. Pharmacists&#x02019; interventions (adherence interventions and therapeutic
recommendations) were initially categorised by the pharmacists themselves (using the flowchart of
adherence program, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) during the documentation process;
the nature of these interventions was verified by the Project Officer and one of the researchers,
in-line with the categories used by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The key clinical outcome measures were: BP control (change in systolic BP) and

These interviews were facilitated by members of the research team who were experienced in qualitative interview techniques, and who were not in direct contact with the pharmacists during the service implementation. A semi-structured interview guide, modelled on that used by the researchers in previous studies and guided by the study objectives, was used to guide the questioning and discussion. Pharmacists&#x02019; responses were digitally (audio) recorded to allow for verbatim transcription. The transcripts were first analysed by an independent contracted researcher (not associated with the present study) using manual inductive coding to generate themes.<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Subsequently, the research team reviewed the transcripts to check the reliability of the analysis and ensure consensus was attained regarding the themes (theme verification).</p><p>A program evaluation framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), adapted from Bauman and Nutbeam<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, was then used to map the components of the study and challenges encountered during implementation of the intervention. This organised framework describes a process for evaluating intervention programs in healthcare, and maps out key steps including: an assessment of the current problem, consultation with stakeholders and the community, measurement and monitoring of intervention components, assessment of short-term impact, and assessment of the longer term outcomes. This type of logic model allows researchers to identify any barriers to the implementation and/or long-term sustainability of any intervention.

Some pharmacists printed study leaflets/posters and set-up information tables to help promote the service and recruit more patients. Those who struggled to recruit patients cited the following reasons during the feedback:</p><p>&#x0201c;It&#x02019;s difficult to actually get someone to sign on the dotted line and it&#x02019;s not necessarily because they were unwilling; I had people that were willing but didn&#x02019;t meet the criteria. The criteria was pretty tough&#x0201d;</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;a lot of people simply didn&#x02019;t come back for the second one regardless of phoning them or were just not willing to&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;I took their blood pressure and it was really high &#x02026;. they don&#x02019;t want to answer a questionnaire or they don&#x02019;t want to come back in three months.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;. patients were not prepared to commit to an ongoing process as required for the study&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>In Groups A and B, pharmacists reported that, in a number of cases, the patient&#x02019;s BP improved from the initial screening assessment to the baseline Week 1 Visit (re-check of BP), which excluded them from further participation. Group C, the shorter intervention (without BP re-check after the initial screening) added later, avoided this issue. Pharmacists speculated on possible reasons for their observations:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Each time I&#x02019;ve tested their blood pressure since [screening] it&#x02019;s been fine. Some of them have had changes in medications and they&#x02019;ve increased or they&#x02019;ve added another medication in like a calcium blocker. A lot of them it was just about compliance at the beginning&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;With each one of them, compliance must have been an issue because each person came back apart from two of them, completely controlled the next week&#x0201d;.</p></disp-quote><p>A couple of pharmacists commented on how time-pressures had made it difficult to recruit since they were &#x02018;not [always] the person - face-to-face - that [the patients] spoke to&#x02019; during that visit to the pharmacy, where other pharmacists and/or assistants may have been the primary contacts. This highlights the need for pharmacists to be able to commit sufficient time and effort to the chronic disease management program.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Overview of the challenges in intervention implementation</title><p>Synthesis of the study outcomes, participant feedback, and investigators&#x02019; reflections at the conclusion of the study, identified some key issues impacting on the actual implementation phase and program outcomes within the program evaluation framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Activities and actions in the &#x02018;pre-planning&#x02019; and &#x02018;planning&#x02019; phases of the evaluation framework were identified as needing particular attention. First, the pharmacists&#x02019; restricted scope of practice, and an absence of well established relationships between some pharmacists and GPs, limited their ability to facilitate specific therapeutic interventions. Second, neither the pharmacists nor the investigators had conceptualised the initial screening step of the study (the initial BP checking step to identify poor BP control, prior to patient enrolment) as an intervention in its own right, and had underestimated the responsiveness of BP to changes in patient behaviour. Subsequently, pharmacists&#x02019; ability to recruit patients was affected (in following best practice guidelines for confirming uncontrolled BP), impacting on the overall sample size and power to identify significant differences in outcome measures between groups. Indeed, Group C was implemented within a modified study protocol to address this issue and maximize patient recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Overall, this study has piloted a complex pharmacy-based intervention to help optimise hypertension management in those with poor BP control, and has additionally highlighted some methodological challenges. In terms of key outcomes, changes were observed in Group C (i.e., shorter intervention), specifically a reduction in BP at the 3-month visit, a significant improvement in medication adherence scores, and a trend to improvement in quality of life scores. In comparison, there were no significant changes in outcomes in Group B (full intervention), and no differences compared to Group A (usual care). Although the latter observations were perhaps disappointing, other studies exploring pharmacist-led interventions in chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes) have also shown no significant differences in outcomes between control and intervention groups.<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Possible explanations for these observations include the critical difference between study groups, i.e., the initial BP screening step prior to service delivery. Group B required an initial BP &#x02018;screening&#x02019; step, followed by a re-check of the BP 1-week later, consistent with guidelines.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In contrast, Group C, patients were directly recruited after the initial BP assessment. The absence of this re-check step may explain key study observations. Pharmacists in Groups A and B expressed difficulties in recruiting patients; patients who were initially assessed as having elevated BP were 1-week later often re-assessed as being within normal range, precluding their enrolment. While this, at face value, is simply an expression of the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, several pharmacists identified that the initial BP check prompted many patients into action (e.g., resuming their prescribed medications and/or consulting with GPs).</p><p>Second, the impact of the initial BP measurement step on patients&#x02019; behaviours was also suggested by differences in mean BP readings between the study groups at baseline; the mean BPs reported at the re-check steps were slightly lower than initial readings, even in patients who were ultimately recruited to Group B. In Group C, the baseline BP readings were significantly higher than either Group A or B. While this may represent regression to the mean, our contextual information (pharmacists&#x02019; observations) suggests that the initial BP measurement step itself played a greater role than just procedural confirmation of hypertension prior to study enrolment, acting as an important intervention itself. Indeed, such so-called screening has been shown to effect behaviour change.<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>Third, the changes in outcomes observed in Group C may have been due to the absence of the BP re-check step, thereby preventing patients from initiating behaviour changes prior to study enrolment. The net effect of this was higher mean BPs at baseline (and greater potential for demonstrating reduction in BP), and an increased opportunity to record patient-centred interventions as part of pharmacist recommendations (e.g., behaviour changes in relation to medication adherence, lifestyle measures) in Group C. The findings support this, given that adherence-based interventions were more common in Group C than in Group B. This highlights the potential impact of screening processes on prompting behaviour change in patients, at least in the short-term.</p><p>These observations highlight the methodological challenges in evaluating interventions for hypertension management. Good clinical practice mandates that a diagnosis of hypertension is confirmed through repeated BP testing at designated intervals<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; in applying these screening procedures, the diagnostic process may become a component of the intervention itself, thereby confounding study findings. At the first level the screening may have such a profound effect on potential participants that recruitment into studies becomes more difficult; secondarily, the impact of the screening and the components of the purpose-designed intervention may become conflated. In this study two intervention study groups were included to differentiate the potential impact of the screening step on process measures and patient outcomes, addressing this very issue.</p><p>Additional methodological considerations relate to the &#x02018;planning&#x02019; around study implementation, and more carefully exploring the local context. The current restrictions on Australian pharmacists&#x02019; scope of practice, suboptimal selection of geographical regions (i.e., with regard to access to health services), and lack of strong interprofessional relationships between some pharmacists and GPs, have limited the potential benefits afforded by this service model, compared to findings from other studies.<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> These challenges aside, other potential study limitations must be acknowledged. This study was conducted in specific regions within Australia and may not be generalisable to other settings. The difficulties in recruiting patients may have under-powered the study to detect significant changes in patient outcomes, and any changes observed in BP (Group C) may have been due to natural variations (regression to the mean), rather than the intervention. Furthermore, this study did not evaluate the characteristics of the participating pharmacists or pharmacies, and how these may have influenced any of the outcomes. A future larger scale study could address these limitations to provide more robust evidence for the impact of such an intervention.</p><p>Overall, the within-group comparisons for the two interventions groups in this study have hinted at the potential benefits of a pharmacist-led hypertension management service beyond the initial measurement of BP and immediate improvement in adherence, including optimisation of therapy through therapeutic adjustment and persistence of adherence, to support GPs and patients alike. Although the methodological challenges and sample size limitations preclude a robust analysis of the key study outcomes (particularly in terms of between-group comparisons), the results from this pilot study show that pharmacists have engaged in processes that can help monitor appropriate clinical parameters and identify appropriate strategies to optimise hypertension management in a step-wise approach, including generating recommendations for adjustment of therapeutic regimens that are acceptable to GPs. Previous studies have demonstrated the impact that pharmacists can have in improving hypertension management within community pharmacies<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> or home-based monitoring services<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, as well as in improving the quality of prescribing.<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Furthermore, this study specifically highlights what the critical components of such a service are, and how these can also present methodological challenges in the evaluation of services in this context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A collaborative, pharmacist-led hypertension management service can help monitor BP, improve medication adherence, and optimise therapy in a step-wise approach. This study highlights the contribution of BP screening to effecting behaviour change in patients, particularly through adherence to medication. However, this can also present methodological challenges in the development and evaluation of services in this context, both in terms of recruiting patients as well as in assessing patient outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance and support of Pradnya Naik Panvelkar (Project Officer) in the conduct of this study.
