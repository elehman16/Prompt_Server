However, with the marked rise in the smoking rates in women since the 1960&#x02032;s, there has been a sharp increase in the burden of COPD among women throughout much of the Western world. Today, in the United States (US), there are 7 million more women than men with COPD and 10,000 more women than men die from COPD each year. Currently, the mortality rate is nearly 10 fold higher in women than in men (3.7%/year in females and 0.4%/year in males) (<xref rid="bb9400" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Despite this, ironically, the current management strategies for COPD (in both men and women) are largely based on therapeutic clinical trials that have recruited mostly male patients. In most therapeutic trials (even contemporary ones), female patients make up only 20%&#x02013;25% of the total cohort (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Calverley et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Magnussen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are some compelling biological reasons why there may be significant sex-related differences in the therapeutic responsiveness of inhaled drugs in COPD. Firstly, there are emerging data that indicate for the same severity of COPD, as measured by lung function, female patients have less emphysema and more small airways disease (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Dransfield et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Cazzola et al., 2011</xref>). Secondly, female patients with COPD demonstrate greater levels of bronchial reactivity to non-specific stimuli such as methacholine compared with male patients for the same degree of airflow limitation (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Tashkin et al., 1992</xref>). Thirdly, women may have heightened xenobiotic metabolism of chemicals including those related to cigarette smoke and medications, as well different gene or protein expression (compared to men) of known drug targets and transporters which may modify the effectiveness of therapeutic drugs (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Benowitz et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Statista, n.d</xref>). Despite these considerations, it is not known whether there is any significant sexual dimorphism in the way in which men and women respond to commonly inhaled drugs in COPD (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Statista, n.d</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">FirstWord Pharma, 2013</xref>). The principal aim of the present study was to determine whether there are any sex-related differences in bronchodilation related to the use of inhaled ipratropium, one of the most commonly prescribed muscarinic receptor antagonist in the world, in patients with COPD (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Statista, n.d</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">FirstWord Pharma, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Data Source</title><p>To address the primary aim of the current study, we used data from the Lung Health Study (LHS). The details of LHS have been reported previously (<xref rid="bb9900" ref-type="bibr">Anthonisen et al., 1994</xref>). Briefly, LHS was originally designed to determine the effects of ipratropium and smoking cessation programs on the rate of decline in lung function over 5&#x000a0;years. At the time of recruitment all subjects were active smokers between the ages of 35 and 60&#x000a0;years (with a mean age of 48&#x000a0;years) who had smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day within the 30&#x000a0;days prior to initial screening and who demonstrated mild to moderate COPD on spirometry defined by forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 55% to 90% of predicted, in the presence of FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.70 after bronchodilation (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> of the cohort was 75% predicted and the mean FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC was 63% post-bronchodilator).</p><p>After enrollment, these patients were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 1) usual care (UC), who received no intervention, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1964; 2) an intense anti-smoking (special) intervention and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals) n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1961 (SIA); or 3) an intense anti-smoking (special) intervention and an inhaled placebo, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1962 (SIP). Subjects were excluded if they had serious co-morbidities that could have interfered with follow-up or impacted lung function (e.g. overt heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or malignancy other than skin cancer). Ten centres participated in the original study and together they recruited 5887 patients (of whom 37% were females). Those who were in the SIP or SIA groups received a program that consisted of: 1) a strong recommendation by attending physician for smoking cessation in an one-to-one encounter; 2) a group program led by a health educator that met 12 times over 10&#x000a0;weeks, which taught behaviour modification techniques; and 3) a nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine gum (Nicorette Gum, Marion Merrell Dow Inc), which was provided at no cost to patients. Those who successfully quit smoking were enrolled in a maintenance program to prevent relapses.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Spirometry and Follow-up</title><p>At the baseline visit, a detailed history of respiratory symptoms and smoking status was obtained. These included years of smoking, number of pack-years of smoking, current number of cigarettes smoked per day and the age of initiation. Additionally, all subjects underwent spirometry, which was performed according to the standards of the American Thoracic Society. Bronchodilator response was measured after 2 inhalations of isoproterenol (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g total dose).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients who were assigned to ipratropium or inhaled placebo were instructed on the use of metered dose inhalers by a physician and were asked to use 2 puffs (36&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) of the inhaler 3 times a day. All subjects were brought back 4&#x000a0;months following randomization to encourage inhaler compliance and to determine smoking status. Smoking status was ascertained by detailed self-report that included the number of cigarettes smoked per day and exposure to any other forms of nicotine and objectively validated by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide (at every visit) and salivary cotinine (at annual visits) using well-validated immunoassays. The cutoff of exhaled carbon monoxide was 10&#x000a0;parts per million (ppm) to denote active smoking and that for salivary cotinine was 20&#x000a0;ng/ml. All subjects who exceeded any of these thresholds were classified as smokers. These objective measures of smoking status were blinded to patients. Non-smoking was defined at each annual visit by abstinence from all smoked tobacco products, validated by salivary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide. Sustained quitters were defined as non-smoking at all annual visits from year 1 through year 5. Continuous smokers were defined as smokers at all annual visits and intermittent quitters were defined as those who were nonsmokers in at least one annual follow-up visit (<xref rid="bb9900" ref-type="bibr">Anthonisen et al., 1994</xref>). At annual visits, in addition to the above, spirometry was performed before and after 2 puffs of isoproterenol. Compliance with inhalers was assessed by self-report and by weighing the canister. Follow-up was successful in 90% of patients over these 5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Gene expression for M2 and M3 Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes in Lungs</title><p>One important factor that may determine responsiveness to inhaled therapeutic drugs is the receptor expression for the ligand in lung tissue. As the LHS did not obtain lung tissue, we used data from the Lung Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) study (<xref rid="bb9700" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2012</xref>) to determine whether there was a sex-related difference in the gene expression for M3 (CHRM3) and M2 (CHRM2) muscarinic receptor in lungs of individuals, who underwent lung resection surgery. The M3 receptor is the primary muscarinic receptor subtype that induces bronchial smooth muscle contraction; whereas presynaptic M2's are autoreceptors that prevent the release of acetylcholine from preganglionic and parasympathetic nerve fibres and thus negatively regulate the M3 receptor pathway (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Karakiulakis and Roth, 2012</xref>). Post-synaptic M2 receptors, which are also expressed in airway smooth muscle cells, attenuate adenylyl cyclase activity and thus promote smooth muscle relaxation (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Montuschi and Ciabattoni, 2015</xref>). Since ipratropium is a non-selective anti-muscarinic agent, we used the ratio of M3/M2 (CHRM3/CHRM2) receptor gene expression in lungs to estimate the potential responsiveness to ipratropium. The details of the eQTL study have been previously published (<xref rid="bb9700" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, gene expression profiles were obtained, using a custom Affymetrix array, which contained 51,627 non-control probesets, on 1111 lung tissue samples from individuals, who underwent lung resection surgery for a variety of different clinical indications, at 3 centres (Laval University, University of British Columbia [UBC] and University of Groningen). After quality control, the data were filtered and normalized. Samples that did not pass quality control were discarded. The final dataset contained 964 samples (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;441 females; 46% of cohort). On the Affymetrix array, the CHRM3 and CHRM2 genes were represented by 100154030_TGI_at and 100310990_TGI_at probesets, respectively. The lung tissue expression data are available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo" id="ir0005">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>) through accession number GSE23546.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>To compare the baseline characteristics between male and female subjects, we used Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and chi-squared test for discrete variables. Because ipratropium induces acute bronchodilation but does not modify the long-term decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cheyne et al., 2015</xref>) to evaluate the possible differential effects of ipratropium in female versus male subjects, we restricted our analysis to subjects in the SIA group of LHS who came back for spirometry at 4&#x000a0;month post-randomization. We chose the 4&#x000a0;month time point because compliance with ipratropium was greatest at this follow-up (compared with all the subsequent follow-up) with a rapid decay in compliance by 1&#x000a0;year post-randomization (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cheyne et al., 2015</xref>). We compared the mean changes in post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to 4&#x000a0;months between men and women using a two sample <italic>t</italic>-test. A multiple variable linear model was then used to evaluate the effects of sex on the change of % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> at 4&#x000a0;months from baseline values in subjects who were in the SIA group. In this model we adjusted the results for age, body mass index (BMI), smoking intensity (as defined by exhaled carbon monoxide) and pack-years of smoking and also included a sex-BMI interaction and sex-pack-years interaction terms. To determine the impact that sex had on FEV<sub>1</sub> changes over 5&#x000a0;years, we used linear models which were adjusted for smoking status at each annual visit. For the lung eQTL dataset, we compared baseline characteristics between females and males using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for discrete variables.</p><p>The difference in the ratio of M3/M2 receptor gene expression between females and males was conducted for each sub-cohort (Laval, UBC, Groningen) separately, using linear models adjusting for age and smoking status. The results were then combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis assuming a fixed effect model.

Using data from the Lung Health Study (LHS), which was made up of nearly 40% female subjects, we found that on average women experienced a larger bronchodilatory benefit of ipratropium compared with male subjects. Significantly, these effects were modified by BMI such that females in the lowest BMI categories experienced the largest benefits. At 4&#x000a0;months of therapy, 44% of the female subjects demonstrated a significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> (defined by an increase of 140&#x000a0;ml or more in their FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline) from ipratropium; whereas only 37% of the male patients met this threshold.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the evolving concept that for the same cigarette exposure, female COPD patients have a greater burden of airway disease than male patients and that this risk may be modified by body mass index and presence of comorbidities (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Dransfield et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Cazzola et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cazzola et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, in patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery, female lungs demonstrated greater wall thickening in small airways (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mm in size) than male COPD lungs (<xref rid="bb9300" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2007</xref>). These changes appear to occur early in the disease process, as using optical coherence tomography, we showed previously that female smokers have thicker airway walls than male smokers even when their FEV<sub>1</sub> was within the normal range (<xref rid="bb9100" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2016</xref>).These human findings have been supported by data in murine models of COPD where exposure to 6&#x000a0;months of cigarette smoke resulted in significantly greater airway disease in female compared with male mice (but no significant differences in the extent of emphysema) (<xref rid="bb9100" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for sexual dimorphism of COPD are largely unknown. In animals, removal of ovaries in female mice completely abolished the sex-related differences in the airway disease induced by cigarette smoke, suggesting that female sex hormones may be involved in the process. However, it should be noted that there are translational limitations to animal studies in COPD, which have been previously highlighted (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Churg et al., 2011</xref>).Thus, these data should be interpreted cautiously. Notwithstanding, in LHS and other studies (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Langdeau et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Tantisira et al., 2008</xref>), it has been shown that female smokers have increased airway responsiveness compared with male smokers, which may be related to their reduced airway geometry or increased small airway inflammation (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb9200" ref-type="bibr">Sheel et al., 2009</xref>) and female COPD patients are more likely to have asthma overlap (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Sin et al., 2016</xref>), which may increase airway responsiveness to bronchodilators (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Montuschi et al., 2014</xref>). Supporting these data, animal experiments have shown that female mice compared with male mice demonstrate greater levels of bronchial responsiveness and airflow limitation related to viral infections in the respiratory tract (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Larcombe et al., 2011</xref>). In female mice, bronchial reactivity increases with age; whereas in male mice, age plays no role (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">McKenzie et al., 2010</xref>). Whether these sex-related differences in airway reactivity explain differential responses to bronchodilators in COPD is not known.</p><p>Ipratropium bromide induces bronchodilation by reducing cholinergic tone in the airway smooth muscles by competitively binding to the muscarinic (M) acetylcholine receptors in the airways (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Gross, 1988</xref>). Although ipratropium is a non-selective anti-muscarinic agent, its effect in the lungs is mediated largely through the M3 receptor, which upon activation causes smooth muscle contraction (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Montuschi et al., 2013</xref>). The M2 receptor, on the other hand, auto-regulates acetylcholine (ACh) signaling by inhibiting ACh release by preganglionic and parasympathetic neural tissue (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alagha et al., 2014</xref>), though in the post-synaptic neural tissue, its stimulation may promote airway smooth muscle relaxation (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Montuschi and Ciabattoni, 2015</xref>). In lung tissues, we observed a modest upregulation of M3 receptor and most importantly a significant increase in M3 gene expression relative to M2 receptor expression in the lungs of female compared with male subjects, raising the possibility that there may be sexual dimorphism in the expression of these receptors in the airways that may modulate therapeutic responses to ipratropium. Additional studies will be required to validate these early observations.</p><p>We also observed a significant interaction between sex and BMI such that in females the bronchodilatory effects of ipratropium were inversely associated with BMI; whereas in males, BMI did not appear to modify this effect. Although there is a scarcity of studies that have evaluated the potential modifying effects of BMI on bronchodilatory responses in COPD, in asthma, obesity has been shown to reduce acute bronchodilator responses to short-acting beta-2 agonists (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">McGarry et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular basis of these observations remains elusive and further studies will be required to fully understand the complex relationship between sex and body mass in COPD.</p><p>There were limitations to the study. Firstly, ipratropium is a non-selective anti-muscarinic agent and is a relatively weak bronchodilator. This, the findings may not be generalizable to the newer more selective M3 inhibitors such as tiotropium, which are commonly used in the community and are generally more efficacious than ipratropium (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cheyne et al., 2015</xref>). Using the UPLIFT (Understanding the Potential Long-term Impact of Tiotropium) data, Tashkin et al. data showed that there were no significant differences in the responses to tiotropium, a more selective M3 inhibitor, between men and women with respect to FEV<sub>1</sub> decline over 4&#x000a0;years (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Tashkin et al., 2010</xref>). However, this study may have lacked sufficient power to adequately address this issue because only 25% of the cohort were female patients and 40% of patients (and more females than males, 45% versus 40%) discontinued the study prematurely. Secondly, although we observed significant sex-related differences in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 4&#x000a0;months and at 1 and 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up, these differences were largely lost beyond this time point. One likely explanation for this observation is the reduction in compliance with ipratropium over the 5&#x000a0;years of follow-up. Whereas the mean use of ipratropium was 4.4 puffs per day at 4&#x000a0;months of follow-up, by year 1, it was 3.67 puffs per day and by year 5, it was &#x0003c;&#x000a0;3 puffs per day (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kanner et al., 1994</xref>). The progressive reduction in compliance to the medication likely attenuated the sex-related differences in FEV<sub>1</sub> related to ipratropium over time. Thirdly, while FEV<sub>1</sub> is an important endpoint for assessment of therapeutic efficacy of bronchodilators, there are other patient-centered outcomes such as exacerbation that are also relevant in their therapeutic assessment. LHS was powered on FEV<sub>1</sub> decline and as such robust data on exacerbations or health status were not available. Furthermore, LHS did not perform computed tomographic (CT) scanning and as such the effects of COPD phenotypes (emphysema versus small airways disease) on therapeutic responsiveness could not be assessed. Fourthly, LHS recruited individuals with mild to moderate COPD. Thus, the findings of this study may not be applicable to patients with severe or very severe COPD. It should also be noted that LHS was conducted in the 1990&#x02032;s when smoking rates were significantly higher and COPD management was significantly different than the current standards. We also noted in this study that females on average smoked fewer cigarettes than male patients. Since cigarette smoking induces a persistent inflammatory response in the lung that leads to tissue injury and dysfunction, the sex-related differences in therapeutic responses to ipratropium may in part be related to differences in smoking behaviour between men and women (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Malerba and Montuschi, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the lung samples were obtained from patients who underwent lung resection surgery, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Because the two studies (LHS and the Lung eQTL studies) were conducted in different subjects with different clinical characteristics, their results are not directly comparable.</p><p>The burden of COPD is rapidly growing in the female population. The findings of the present study indicate that female COPD patients may be more responsive to bronchodilators (in terms of FEV<sub>1</sub>) and this effect is modified by body mass index. In an era of precision medicine, there is compelling and pressing need for future therapeutic trials to include sufficient numbers of female patients to ensure generalizability of findings to both men and women and to enable sex and gender based assessment of therapeutic responsiveness to novel therapies in COPD.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Funding Sources</title><p>This study was funded by the Institute of Gender and Health (the <funding-source id="gts0005">Canadian Institutes of Health Research</funding-source>).
