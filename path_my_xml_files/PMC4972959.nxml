Pharmacologic prophylaxis is currently the standard of care based on high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials. However, limited evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices. The Pneumatic compREssion for preventing VENous Thromboembolism (PREVENT trial) aims to determine whether the adjunct use of IPC with pharmacologic prophylaxis compared to pharmacologic prophylaxis alone in critically ill patients reduces the risk of VTE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The PREVENT trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, which will recruit 2000 critically ill patients from over 20 hospitals in three countries. The primary outcome is the incidence of proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 28&#x000a0;days after randomization. Radiologists interpreting the scans are blinded to intervention allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are unblinded. The trial has 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a 3&#x000a0;% absolute risk reduction in proximal DVT from 7 to 4&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The first patient was enrolled in July 2014. As of May 2015, a total of 650 patients have been enrolled from 13 centers in Saudi Arabia, Canada and Australia. The first interim analysis is anticipated in July 2016.

Supported by high-quality evidence, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended for critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The evidence regarding the effectiveness of mechanical prophylaxis including an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPC) and graduated compression stockings (GCS) for thromboprophylaxis is less clear. A systematic review by Limpus et al. included two randomized controlled trials that compared IPC to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in critically ill trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and found no statistically significant difference in DVT rates between IPC and LMWH (risk ratio 2.37, 95&#x000a0;% 0.57&#x02013;9.90) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As such, clinical practice guidelines recommend that IPC be reserved for patients with contraindications to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a cohort study using a propensity score-adjusted analysis, we found that incident VTE was lower with the use of IPC (versus no IPC) but not GCS (versus no GCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This association of lower VTE with IPC was consistent regardless of the use and type of prophylactic heparin (unfractionated or LMWH), the type of admission (trauma or non-trauma, surgical or non-surgical). These findings suggest that IPC may provide thromboprophylaxis if used as an alternative to unfractionated heparin (UFH) or LMWH, and also when used as an adjunct to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The largest trial to date on the effectiveness of IPC is the CLOTS 3 (Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke) trial, which randomized 2876 stroke patients in 94 UK centers to IPC versus no IPC; the indication of pharmacologic prophylaxis was left to the appreciation of the treating team. The primary outcome was proximal vein DVT on screening ultrasound or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed on imaging, within 30&#x000a0;days of randomization. The primary outcome occurred in 8.5&#x000a0;% of patients allocated to IPC and in 12.1&#x000a0;% of patients allocated to no IPC; with an absolute risk reduction of 3.6&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.4&#x02013;5.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Of note, fewer than 25&#x000a0;% of patients in CLOTS 3 received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Nevertheless, the protective effect of IPC was observed whether pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis was or was not given. Regarding GCS, two trials (CLOTS 1 and CLOTS 2) documented a lack of effectiveness of GCS in thromboprophylaxis in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The thromboprophylactic effect of IPC is thought to be related to enhancing venous blood flow in the lower extremities, increase in endogenous fibrinolysis, stimulation of vascular endothelial cells and a reduction in venous caliber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a study on normal volunteers the use of IPC was associated with increased endogenous fibrinolysis; tissue factor pathway inhibitor and plasminogen activator activity both increased after applying pneumatic compression for 2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The IPC may have several hemodynamic effects; as it has been shown to augment venous return, increase central venous pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and increase cardiac output in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While the clinical implications of the hemodynamic effects of IPC remain unknown, one manufacturer (Tyco) lists cardiogenic pulmonary edema as a contraindication for IPC. Cutaneous complications are a concern with IPC; in CLOTS 3, lower extremity skin lesions were reported in 3&#x000a0;% of IPC patients versus 1&#x000a0;% of control patients (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The lack of clear evidence for IPC and GCS has been reflected in the wide variation in the use of these devices in surveys from Canada, France, Australia and Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and more importantly, in the current practice guidelines. The American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines for non-surgical patients recommend against the use of GCS, and suggest IPC as an alternative to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis if the patient has a contraindication; but make no recommendation about its adjunct use to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, The American College of Chest Physicians&#x02019; (ACCP) 2012 guidelines recommend the use of GCS or IPC, although preference is given to IPC as an alternative but not as an adjunct to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in non-surgical critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the PREVENT trial is to assess the superiority of adjunct use of IPC to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis compared to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone on the incidence of proximal DVT in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To study the effect of adjunct use of IPC on the incidence of pulmonary embolism and of distal lower extremity DVT</p></list-item><list-item><p>To study the effect of the adjunct use of IPC on intensive care unit (ICU), hospital and 90-day mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>To study the effect of adjunct use of IPC on hemodynamic status in terms of the need for vasopressor therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p>To study the effect of adjunct use of IPC on patients with heart failure in terms of ventilator-free days</p></list-item><list-item><p>To study the effect of adjunct use of IPC on VTE in the following subgroups: trauma, patients with central venous catheters in the femoral veins, stroke, postoperative patients, heart failure and shock</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine whether there are differences in the effect of IPC based on whether UFH or LMWH is used</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine whether there are differences in the thromboprophylactic effect between sequential and non-sequential IPCs</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine whether there are differences in below-knee and above-knee sleeves</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine whether IPC applied to the lower extremities reduces non-lower extremity thrombosis</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine if there is dose-effect relationship of the IPC duration and incident DVT risk</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine whether IPC increases the risk of skin ulcers or lower extremity ischemia and affects mobilization practice</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Tertiary objective</title><p>To test whether there are differences among different LMWHs (enoxaparin, dalteparin and others) in VTE prophylaxis compared to UFH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design overview</title><p>The PREVENT trial is an international multicenter trial approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) in which eligible patients will be randomized to IPC or no IPC.

Certified ultrasonographers will perform routine twice weekly bilateral proximal lower extremity venous ultrasound, and if DVT is clinically suspected. The first ultrasound is performed within 48&#x000a0;h of enrollment. Prevalent DVT is defined as DVT documented within the first three calendar days of enrollment, and is considered to reflect a baseline characteristic and less likely be related to the study intervention. Patients with prevalent DVT will be included in the main analysis but a prevalent thrombosis is not considered a primary outcome.</p><p>We focus on proximal DVTs because they are much more reliably detected by ultrasound and are generally regarded as clinically more important. We will use the methodology used in the PROTECT trial to screen for proximal lower extremity DVTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The venous system will be examined at 1-cm intervals, documenting compressibility at the following six sites: common femoral, proximal superficial femoral, mid superficial femoral, distal superficial femoral, popliteal veins and trifurcation. DVT in any of these six sites qualifies as the primary outcome.</p><p>We will follow the same definitions used for VTE/DVT in the PROTECT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We define DVT if there is a partially or completely incompressible venous segment. Venous wall thickening is not considered diagnostic of DVT. If a venous segment is not well visualized and is never well visualized on subsequent ultrasounds, the test is considered indeterminate; such events will be recorded but are not considered trial outcomes. Ultrasonographers may scan the distal leg veins at their discretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Distal DVT will be documented as a secondary endpoint.</p><p>DVTs are considered chronic if a test prior to enrollment reveals evidence of thrombus in the same or contiguous venous segment. DVTs and other VTE events are labeled as incident if they occur more than 3 calender days after randomization. We define a thrombus as catheter-related if a catheter had been in situ in the same or a contiguous venous segment within 3 calender days of the diagnosis. This definition is consistent with the definition used in the PROTECT protocol.</p><p>If clinicians suspect any VTE event, they will perform tests as clinically indicated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>All incident DVTs including distal DVTs</p></list-item><list-item><p>All DVTs including incident and prevalent DVTs</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pulmonary embolism: we will follow the same definition used in the PROTECT trial.

However, in this study no surveillance ultrasounds were performed. The PROTECT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] documented a baseline risk for proximal DVT of 5.8&#x000a0;% in patients receiving unfractionated heparin and 5.1&#x000a0;% in patients receiving dalteparin. In addition, the PROTECT trial had a prevalent DVT rate at initial screening of 3.5&#x000a0;%. In the CLOTS 3 trial, the risk of DVT without IPC was 12.1&#x000a0;% and with IPC 8.5&#x000a0;%. We anticipate a higher baseline DVT rate than PROTECT because of the wider inclusion criteria and the inclusion of trauma patients; and lower than CLOTS 3 in which no pharmacologic prophylaxis was used routinely. Therefore, we anticipate a baseline risk of 7&#x000a0;% and absolute risk reduction of 3&#x000a0;%. Thus, a sample size of 1000 subjects in each group (accounting for a 5&#x000a0;% prevalent DVT rate and 5&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up) will have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect an absolute risk reduction of 3&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We will compare incident proximal lower extremity DVT between groups using the chi-square test.

This will be achieved through meetings (in-person or by conference calls) at least quarter-yearly. The study Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide independent input regarding the safety and/or efficacy of the intervention. Upon completion, the results of the trial are planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Authorship will follow the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that compares adjunct IPC and pharmacologic prophylaxis versus pharmacologic prophylaxis alone in critically ill patients. To enhance the external validity of our findings, patients will be enrolled from more than 20 hospitals internationally. Central randomization with concealed allocation, blinded radiologist interpretations and adherence to the intention-to-treat principle will limit potential sources of bias. In addition, trial interventions and outcome monitoring will ensure that &#x0201c;loss to follow-up&#x0201d; for the primary outcome is minimal or absent.</p><p>The issue of the safety of critically ill patients is a prime concern in this randomized trial. Several measures have been taken to minimize, observe and document any potential safety concerns (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p>The main limitation to our study is the inability to blind patients, their caregivers and the ultrasonographer/technician performing ultrasound with regard to allocation due to the nature of the intervention. We gave careful consideration to applying sham IPC in the control group. After discussion and deliberation, we decided not to include a sham IPC in the control group due to the potential harm of placing a cuff on the legs without inflation.</p><p>We used twice-weekly surveillance ultrasound to assess the primary outcome, rather than relying on DVT clinically suspected by clinicians, because the latter tends to underestimate the true incidence of DVT. We used a pragmatic time window of 48&#x000a0;h to perform the first (baseline ultrasound), and we considered the DVTs identified on this ultrasound as prevalent DVTs. Because we are interested in examining whether IPC reduces the incidence of DVT, our primary endpoint is DVTs that occur in patients who have a normal initial ultrasound but develop DVT as documented on subsequent exams; i.e., after the third calendar day (incident DVT).</p><p>Our primary endpoint is proximal DVT by surveillance ultrasound. We will not screen for distal DVTs because of the debated clinical relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and because the diagnosis by Doppler ultrasound is technically challenging and results may be inconsistent as reported by the CLOTS 3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, we will document distal DVT if diagnosed by ultrasound obtained by the treating team.</p><p>We will also capture data on other outcomes relevant to IPC use including lower extremity ischemia, pressure ulcers and mobility. We will follow patients for development of safety concerns (lower extremity ischemia and pressure ulcers) as CLOTS 3 documented lower extremity skin lesions in 3&#x000a0;% of patients allocated to IPC and in 1&#x000a0;% of those allocated no IPC (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We will document the incidence of lower extremity ischemia, although there is no evidence that IPC causes ischemia. Additionally, based on clinical concerns that IPC use may negatively impact mobilization, we will evaluate whether IPC application reduces the chances of patients being mobilized.</p><p>We followed a pragmatic approach in selecting IPC devices and sleeve lengths, permitting treating teams at participating centers to use their own devices (sequential on non-sequential) and to select the sleeves (knee-length versus thigh-length) because at present there is no evidence for superiority of any of these choices over others.</p><p>The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of IPC in critically ill adults. In addition, the PREVENT trial will likely contribute to future clinical practice guidelines and patient safety initiatives by providing evidence that will inform practice regarding the best thromboprophylaxis for critically ill adult patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was enrolled in July 2014.
