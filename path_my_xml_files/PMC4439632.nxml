Along with esthetic restorative procedures periodontal plastic surgery makes a major contribution to create a perfect smile. The color match, esthetic appearance and healing of the donor area with primary intention and consequent reduction in postoperative morbidity makes sub-epithelial connective tissue graft one of the most preferred procedures in recession coverage.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Most of the dental treatment historically has been performed with the unaided eye without the use of visual magnification. In recent times, the introduction of the surgical microscope has greatly improved the outcome of dental procedures and the use of microsurgery for periodontal plastic procedures seem to be a natural progression. Along with improved visual acuity periodontal microsurgery also lays emphasis on passive wound closure with the use of microsurgical instruments and sutures. Precise incision and reduced trauma to the tissues results inaccurate approximation and less inflammation and pain[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and consequently improved wound healing environment.</p><p>Over the years, various modifications to the original technique have been developed and this is evident in the smooth hand movements accomplished with increased precision and reduced physiologic tremor. The present study was performed to clinically compare and examine the two different techniques of sub-epithelial connective tissue graft for root recession coverage, that is, graft placement done microsurgically and macrosurgically. Although both the techniques used in this study were effective in predictable root coverage, microsurgical methodology provided a more predictive outcome owing to better vascularization.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted according to guidelines of Helsinki declaration of 1975 revised in 2000.</p><p>A total of 7 subjects (6 males and 1 female) with 30 bilateral sites of Miller Class I and Class II gingival recession participated in the study. The study was carried from December 2011, the recruitment of the first patient, to August 2013, the final evaluation of the last patient. The patients were healthy adults selected from the outpatient Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology at D. A. V. Centenary Dental College and Hospital, Yamunanagar, Haryana. This included three sites per group in 2 patients, 2 sites per group in 4 patients and 1 site per group in 1 patient, that is, a total of 15 sites per group. A complete clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed. Complete medical and dental histories were obtained. Patients selected were 18-67 years old having bilateral isolated or multiple Miller's Class I or Class II gingival recession &#x02265;2 mm when measured from cementoenamel junction (CEJ) on anterior teeth or premolars and malalignment score of up to 4.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Teeth selected were vital with no bleeding on probing, clinical indication and/or patient request for recession coverage and sites with an identifiable CEJ. Patients with systemic disease/condition, drugs that could have affected the periodontium and/or affected the outcome of the periodontal surgical procedure, surgically treated areas within the last 2 years, allergies to drugs used during the procedure utilized for the study and roots with restoration were excluded from the study. Patients unable to achieve the optimum level of oral hygiene and current smokers and to use any form of tobacco were also excluded from the study.</p><p>At the start of the surgical appointment, bilateral defects were randomly assigned by coin toss to the test group (microsurgical group) and control group (macrosurgical method).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The sites in the study consisted of:</p><p>

Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, India.</p><p>At the first appointment, all the patients were instructed about the etiology of gingival recession, the natural history of periodontal disease and oral hygiene instructions. The patient allotment was done as explained by the flowchart [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Diagrammatic representation of the study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-203-g001"/></fig><p>Clinical parameters evaluated were plaque index (PI)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with the amount of plaque present, Gingival index (GI)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as explained by Loe and Silness, vertical recession (VR): Defined as the distance from CEJ to the free gingival margin at the mid buccal level, probing depth the distance from the free gingival margin to the base of the pocket, clinical attachment level (CAL) was the distance from CEJ to the base of the pocket, width of attached gingiva (WAG) was the difference between the CEJ-mucogingival junction and the CEJ-pocket depth, papilla height (PH)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was measured from the apex of the papilla parallel to the long axis of the involved tooth to the most apical point of the CEJ (APCEJ), papilla width (PW)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was measured along the line connecting the most APCEJ of the involved tooth to the APCEJ of the adjacent mesial and distal teeth. The average value of mesial and distal measurements was calculated and recorded. Both pailla height and width were measured using a divider and a scale. Malalignment index (MI),[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] a comprehensive and objective index, wherein the correlation of proclination and rotation (mesial/distal) of the mandibular/maxillary anterior teeth with the success of root coverage procedures and esthetic appearance.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] They assessed the esthetic results of the treatment upon three parameters that is, scar appearance marginal profile, papillae appearance whereas no consideration was given to the amount of recession coverage achieved.

More sites in Group B showed complete and &#x0003e;65% root coverage because of the use of finer suture that led to better approximation of the flap. The results of the study indicated that improved blood supply during early wound healing may be essential and improve the percentage of root coverage as explained by Burkhardt and Lang.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Six months postoperative photograph for the macrosurgical group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-203-g011"/></fig><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Six months postoperative photograph for the microsurgical group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-203-g012"/></fig><p>The improvement in CAL was statistically significant from baseline to 3 months and baseline to 6 months in both groups, although not much change was observed between 3 month and 6-month period. This implies that the attachment gets established at 3 months, and there is no further improvement thereafter. It has been histologically established that the attachment of the graft to the root surface is mediated by a combination of the epithelial down growth and connective tissue attachment.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Harris[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported the formation of a long junctional epithelium or a short junctional epithelium with a long connective tissue attachment that did not appear to insert into the cementum, as no regeneration of bone or cementum was observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Graph 2</xref>].</p><fig id="F13" position="float"><label>Graph 2</label><caption><p>The comparison of various parameters at different time intervals</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-203-g013"/></fig><p>The correlation between VR and CAL substantiated the CAL gain with a reduction in VR for both the groups.

However, the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>High magnification and proper instrumentation, although allowing greater precision during surgical procedures, cannot by themselves eliminate all possible causes of failure related to mucogingival treatment. The failures may simply be related to the patient's lack of compliance postsurgically or other unpredictable events, irrespective of the use of the microscope. Although both the techniques used in this study were effective in predictable root coverage, in certain situations, one technique may offer the advantage over another technique. The microsurgical procedure requires expertise as far as ergonomics is concerned and the pros and cons should be carefully evaluated to select the best technique. The histological evaluation of the periodontal healing by microsurgical and macrosurgical technique should be undertaken to understand the flap to root attachment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sedon</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>Breault</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name><name><surname>Covington</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The subepithelial connective tissue graft: Part I.
