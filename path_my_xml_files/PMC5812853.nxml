Neuromuscular control problems can challenge the ability to exercise safely. Walking or running with body weight support facilitates the rehabilitation process by reducing ground reaction forces (GRF) while maintaining similar neuromuscular function and kinematic timing patterns. Recent reports<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> indicate that patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's Disease can improve performance on the 10 m walk, 6-minute walk, Sit to Stand, and Timed Up and Go tests after only 5 consecutive days of aerobic training on the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill (AlterG Inc, Freemont, CA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alterg.com" id="intref0010">www.alterg.com</ext-link>) and the GlideTrak&#x02122; body weight support system (GlideTrak&#x02122;, Ashland, OR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glidetrak.com" id="intref0015">www.glidetrak.com</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0015">Running with body weight support is also beneficial to athletes in that it may reduce the risk of overuse injury and speed recovery from an injury and return to preinjury training levels while reducing risk of reoccurring injuries.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> One of the challenges during the rehabilitation of an injury in runners is incorporating a training stimulus sufficient to maintain or at least minimize losses of cardiorespiratory fitness.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although running with body weight support is beneficial in the rehabilitation of a running injury, the metabolic demands of running decrease linearly with increasing body weight support.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, running with body weight support may not be sufficient to maintain cardiovascular training benefits during a lengthy rehabilitation process. Research using the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill suggest that the metabolic demands of normal-weight walking<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and jogging<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> can be maintained when exercising with body weight support, albeit at higher speeds. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) has also been shown to be similar when performing a maximal graded exercise test while running at a normal body weight and up to a 15% reduction<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and 20% reduction<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> in body weight. The HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship has been shown to be unaltered when walking and running at normal body weight, 75% body weight, and 50% body weight, suggesting that modifications to training programs based on target HR are not required when training with body weight support.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0020">The similarity of the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to normal weight running and running with body weight support likely depends, in part, on the amount and manner in which body weight support is provided. Many of the previous studies have made use of the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill which allows body weight support to be adjusted by increasing air pressure in a canopy surrounding the lower body. The GlideTrak&#x02122; body weight support system provides 0-100% body weight support by sitting on a saddle suspended by an adjustable harness from a frame placed over an existing treadmill. Pilot research in our lab showed that compared to normal-weight treadmill running (TMR), exercising with body weight support using the GlideTrak&#x02122; (GTR) resulted in a 60% and 75% reduction in GRF during treadmill walking and treadmill running, respectively. Normal-weight walking and running on a treadmill resulted in GRF equivalent to 1.3 and 2.4 times body weight, while GTR resulted in GRF equivalent to 0.55 and 0.60 times body weight, respectively. Recent research indicates that patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's Disease were able to train safely on the GlideTrak at intensities corresponding to 60%-80% of an age-appropriate maximal heart rate (HR).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As reports of the HR and VO<sub>2</sub> responses to GTR are limited, the purposes of this study were to (a) compare maximal HR and VO<sub>2</sub> values achieved during a maximal graded exercise test performed using GTR and TMR, and (b) compare the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship of GTR to that of TMR in apparently healthy young adults.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0025">Twenty participants (11 male; 9 female), 18 to 26 years of age, with an average height, body mass, and BMI of 1.73&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3 m, 73.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15 kg, and 24.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively, voluntarily participated in this study. Participants were free of injuries and not taking any medications that would alter their cardiovascular or metabolic responses to exercise or reduce their exercise tolerance. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects prior to the collection of data. After being informed of study procedures, risks, and benefits of their participation in the study and completing a pre-participation questionnaire, each participant provided written informed consent. Participants were familiarized with treadmill walking and jogging and use of the GlideTrak&#x02122;. The GlideTrak&#x02122; makes use of two harnesses: an adjustable harness that supports the saddle on which the participant sits, and an optional shoulder harness that can be used to reduce or eliminate the fear or risk of falling while seated on the saddle. Participants were familiarized with GTR until they performed GTR without the support of the shoulder harness and with unrestricted arm and leg movements. During the familiarization trial, participants were also familiarized with the 6&#x02013;20 rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale and its anchors.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Procedures</title><p id="p0030">Participants reported to the exercise physiology lab on two other occasions separated by at least 48 hours. Participants were instructed to refrain from ingesting food, alcohol, and caffeine within the 4 hours prior to testing, and avoid strenuous exercise for at least 12 hours prior to testing. On one visit, participants performed a normal-weight submaximal exercise test followed by a maximal exercise test on a treadmill. On the other visit, participants performed a submaximal exercise test followed by a maximal exercise test with body weight support using the GlideTrak&#x02122;. During all exercise tests, participants were fitted with a mouthpiece and a nose clip to facilitate the measurement of VO<sub>2</sub> using a Parvo-Medics TrueOne 2400 metabolic measurement system (Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT). Prior to testing, the oxygen and carbon dioxide analyzers were calibrated using medical grade gases of known concentrations and the flow meter was calibrated using a 3.0 L syringe. The metabolic measurement system was configured to display 15-second averaged data. Heart rate (HR) was continually monitored using a radiotelemetry HR monitor (Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY) and participants reported an RPE value during each stage of the exercise test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Submaximal exercise tests</title><p id="p0035">The purpose of the submaximal exercise test was to collect HR and VO<sub>2</sub> data over a wide range of intensities to allow the comparison of the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship between GTR and TMR. The endpoint for each submaximal exercise test was either a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.0 or 90% of the participant's age-predicted (220-age) maximal HR. The submaximal exercise test protocol proceeded through the following stages: (a) walking at a brisk walking pace between 5.6&#x02013;7.2&#x000a0;km h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 3 minutes, (b) jogging at a self-selected jogging speed between 8&#x02013;11.2&#x000a0;km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at level grade for 3 minutes, and (c) maintaining the self-selected jogging speed but increasing the grade by 2% every 3 minutes until the participant reached either one of the two endpoints.</p><p id="p0040">For the GTR submaximal exercise test, the GlideTrak&#x02122; frame was positioned over the treadmill so that the participant could exercise on the treadmill while seated on the saddle. The adjustable harness was used to position the saddle so there was a 40&#x000b0; knee angle with the feet flat on the belt of the treadmill when the treadmill was at level grade. This was done to normalize the knee joint angle and body weight support provided by the seat for all participants. The 40&#x000b0; knee angle was chosen because it closely mimics the normal angle of the knee while running.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Preliminary pilot experimentation revealed that when participants ran at a self-selected pace, they were able to reach the maximal grade capacity of the treadmill without reaching the endpoints of the submaximal exercise test. Thus, the submaximal exercise test protocol was modified to include both an increase in treadmill speed (1.6&#x000a0;km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a 2% increase in treadmill grade in the third and subsequent stages until the participant reached either one of the two endpoints. As treadmill grade was increased, the position of the saddle was adjusted to maintain participant comfort and a 40&#x000b0; knee angle, thus maintaining a consistent body position throughout the exercise test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Maximal Exercise Tests</title><p id="p0045">After completing the submaximal exercise test, the participant rested at least 15 minutes and then performed a maximal exercise test using the same mode of exercise (i.e., TMR or GTR). The rest period was considered adequate since the submaximal exercise test progressed from light-to moderate-intensity exercise and lasted only 12&#x02013;24 minutes. The submaximal exercise tests were also considered part of the warm-up for the maximal exercise test.</p><p id="p0050">The TMR maximal exercise test followed the protocol typically used in our Exercise Physiology Lab that allows participants to complete a maximal exercise test within 10&#x02013;15 minutes.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> After walking at a self-selected brisk pace for 1 minute, the speed of the treadmill was increased to the self-selected jogging speed (8&#x02013;11.2&#x000a0;km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) used during the submaximal exercise test. Participants were then asked if they wanted to increase or decrease the treadmill speed. The treadmill speed remained constant during the remaining stages of the exercise test. After the third minute of level grade jogging, the treadmill grade was increased 2% every minute thereafter. The protocol for the GTR maximal exercise test was modified to include a 2% increase in grade and a 1.6&#x000a0;km&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase in speed after the third minute and every minute thereafter. As with the submaximal exercise test, the position of the saddle was adjusted to maintain a consistent 40&#x000b0; knee angle. Each maximal exercise test was terminated when the participant was unable to continue despite verbal encouragement. After terminating the test, participants walked at a self-selected speed at level grade for any desired amount of time.</p><p id="p0055">Maximal HR and maximal or peak VO<sub>2</sub> were defined as the highest 15-second average HR and VO<sub>2</sub> values during the final minutes of the exercise test. The participant's effort was considered maximal if physical signs representative of exhaustion were obvious and at least two of the following four criteria were met: (a) maximal RER was greater than or equal to 1.10, (b) maximal HR was no less than 15 bpm below age-predicted maximal HR, (c) an RPE of 19 or 20 was self-reported at the time the test was terminated, and (d) there was a plateau of VO<sub>2</sub> during the final minute(s) of the exercise test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0060">All data were analyzed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). One-way ANOVAs were conducted to determine differences in maximal VO<sub>2,</sub> HR, RER, and RPE responses between the two exercise modes (TMR and GTR). All tests were Bonferroni-corrected to maintain a critical alpha value of 0.05 when multiple tests were performed.</p><p id="p0065">The comparison of the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship between TMR and GTR was of particular interest in this study. The appropriate way to evaluate this data was to express HR and VO<sub>2</sub> in bpm and mL&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively and in relative terms (percent of maximal HR and percent of maximal or peak VO<sub>2</sub>). The 20 participants in this study completed the submaximal exercise test within 4 to 8 stages. Thus, each participant contributed 4 to 8 data points for each test so that the analysis of submaximal data for GTR was represented by 116 data points and the submaximal data for TMR was represented by 129 data points. Because slopes and intercepts were used in the data analysis, it was appropriate to center the data so that intercepts were calculated within the range of data observed rather than when the independent variable was zero. When analyzing the VO<sub>2</sub> response as a function of HR, the HR data were centered at a HR of 140 bpm. When analyzing the VO<sub>2</sub> response (% VO<sub>2</sub>max) as a function of HR (% HRmax), the HR data were centered at 75% of HRmax. Because each participant had multiple measures, linear mixed models (Proc Mixed in SAS) were used for the analysis of the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationships so within-subject covariances were appropriately accounted for. Because we centered the data, tests on intercepts were conducted at the center of the independent variable values and thus are appropriate even when the slopes are not parallel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p id="p0070">During the TMR maximal exercise test, 5 participants met&#x000a0;all four criteria for achieving a maximal effort, 10 met the HR, RER and RPE criteria, and 5 met the HR and RPE criteria.

The results of this and previous research suggest that there may be a threshold of body weight support at which VO<sub>2</sub>max values cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p0095">Results from the submaximal exercise tests in this study indicate a difference in the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship between TMR and GTR. At a HR of 140 bpm, GTR elicited a VO<sub>2</sub> that was 4.0 mL&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lower than during TMR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). At the VO<sub>2</sub> corresponding to a HR of 140 bpm during TRM, the participants in this study had HRs that were on the average 16 bpm higher during GTR. Differences in the maximal VO<sub>2</sub> responses and the absolute HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship observed in this study between normal weight running and running with body weight support are likely explained by the differences in the movement patterns, quantity of muscle mass activated during exercise, body position, and upper and lower body movement patterns.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The differences in the HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship due to mode of exercise were abated when HR and VO<sub>2</sub> were expressed as a percent of mode-specific maximal values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). This suggests that the intensity of GTR exercise would ideally be expressed relative to the mode-specific VO<sub>2</sub>max. Our results are contrary to the findings of previous studies indicating that the HR and VO<sub>2</sub> responses to unweighted exercise are similar to those of normal-weight treadmill walking and running.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Differences between the results of this study and previous studies are likely due to the method of providing body weight support.</p><p id="p0100">Of particular interest in this study was whether a person can perform GTR at an intensity equivalent to TMR. The American College of Sports Medicine defines moderate intensity exercise as 64&#x02013;76% HRmax or 46&#x02013;63% VO<sub>2</sub>max, and vigorous intensity exercise as 77&#x02013;95% HRmax or 64&#x02013;90% VO<sub>2</sub>max.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> During the submaximal exercise tests, all 20 participants reached vigorous intensities of exercise during TMR. During submaximal GTR, only 8 (40%) participants achieved vigorous intensity exercise even though the end point for the submaximal exercise test was an RER&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.0. Although 18 of the 20 participants could exercise on the GlideTrak&#x02122; at moderate intensities of exercise appropriate for maintaining or increasing cardiorespiratory fitness, some individuals may not be able to achieve the same high intensities as have been reported when running with body weight support on the AlterG anti-gravity treadmill.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The results of this study concur with those of recent quality assurance studies<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> reporting that a group of 11 senior men and women (mean age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;69.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.8 yr) were able to exercise at a target HR of 60% to 80% of their age predicted (220-age) maximal HR.</p><p id="p0105">This study is not without limitations. It is foreseeable that sitting on a saddle during GlideTrak&#x02122; walking and jogging would be an appropriate way to provide body weight support to overcome mobility issues and while rehabilitating injuries or neuromotor issues in obese, geriatric, or other patients. Nevertheless, this study does not address the benefits of GlideTrak&#x02122; walking and jogging in these populations. Two previous studies report the efficacy of the GlideTrak&#x02122; body weight support system in exercise interventions for Parkinson's Disease.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As a preliminary study, our purpose was to compare the submaximal and maximal HR and VO<sub>2</sub> responses between TMR and GTR. This could best be accomplished using healthy participants without movement limitations. Although we intentionally adjusted the harnesses of the GlideTrak&#x02122; to maintain a knee flexion angle that mimics the normal knee angle while running, a biomechanical analysis of GTR may reveal a better saddle position. Even though participants in this study included moderately fit, physically active males and females, use of endurance trained athletes as participants may shed further light on the efficacy of GTR as a viable mode of high-speed training with body weight support. Future studies may also evaluate the benefits of GlideTrak&#x02122; walking and jogging as a mode of exercise for the rehabilitation of those who have mobility issues, pain during locomotion, and lower extremity injuries.</p><p id="p0110">Based on the results of this study, we conclude that compared to normal-weight TMR, GTR resulted in lower maximal HR and VO<sub>2</sub> values and a HR-VO<sub>2</sub> relationship that would require exercising at higher speeds or grades to achieve the same metabolic (VO<sub>2</sub>) challenge. At intensities of exercise represented by RER values less than 1.0, most participants were unable to achieve vigorous intensities of exercise as defined by the ACSM VO<sub>2</sub> criteria. Other benefits of GlideTrak&#x02122; walking and running in various applications require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interest statement</title><p id="p0115">The
