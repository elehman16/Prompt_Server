The current standard of care is limited to symptomatic relief and no current approved therapy promotes disc regeneration. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are easily accessible and well characterized. These MSCs are multipotent and exhibit great tissue regenerative potential including bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue regeneration. The use of this cell-based biologic for treating protruding disc herniation and/or intervertebral disc degeneration is a promising therapeutic strategy, due to their known regenerative, immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Five patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease received an intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (15.1&#x02013;51.6 million cells) as part of a previous study. These patients were re-consented to participate in this study in order to assess long-term safety and feasibility of intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years post mesenchymal stem cell infusion. The follow-up study consisted of a physical examination, a low back MRI, and a quality of life questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients&#x02019; lower back MRI showed absence of neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region. Based on the physical examination and the quality of life questionnaire, no adverse events were reported due to the procedure or to the stem cell treatment 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years post autologous, hypoxic cultured mesenchymal stem cell infusion. All patients self-reported overall improvement, as well as improvement in strength, post stem cell treatment, and four out of five patients reported improvement in mobility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This early human clinical data suggests the safety and feasibility of the clinical use of hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of lower back pain due to degenerative disc disorders and support further studies utilizing hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived stem cells. The overall improvements reported are encouraging, but a larger double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study with significant number of patients and implementation of validated endpoint measurements are next steps in order to demonstrate efficacy of this cell-based biologic.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Regenerative medicine</kwd><kwd>Cell therapy</kwd><kwd>Degenerative disc disease</kwd><kwd>Autologous</kwd><kwd>Hypoxic</kwd><kwd>Mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>Bone marrow</kwd><kwd>Intra-discal injection</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Feasibility</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic low back pain affects approximately 632 million people worldwide and has an enormous social impact on patients and a significant economic impact on healthcare budgets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United States alone, the annual cost is estimated to be as high as 500 billion dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The exact causes of disc degeneration are complex and involve genetic risks, smoking, obesity, aging and mechanical trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The intervertebral disc is an immune-privileged avascular organ composed of fibrocartilaginous tissues that connect the vertebral bodies and provide stability, while allowing motion between the vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The centrally located nucleus pulposus is a hypoxic, hydrophilic proteoglycan-rich gelatinous core, surrounded by a lamellated collagenous ring, the annulus fibrosus and bony end-plates that separate the discs from the vertebrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a normal disc, there is a balance between the anabolic and catabolic capacity of the disc cells, but excessive stress can alter this balance and compromise extracellular matrix degradation and synthesis thereby initiating a degenerative cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A loss in the cellular component function induces alterations in both the cartilaginous and proteoglycan matrix of the disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Subsequently, alterations of the proteoglycan component ultimately leads to dehydration of the nucleus pulposus, which impacts the ability of the disc to effectively distribute and recover from mechanical loading. The degenerated disc may eventually weaken to develop a protrusion towards the spine that puts pressure on the nerve roots or parts of the spinal canal, causing back pain and possibly weakness and numbness.</p><p>The standard of care for treating disc degeneration involves conservative non-surgical approaches or surgical interventions that target symptomatic relief and musculoskeletal stabilization. Currently, there is no clinical therapy targeting the reversal of disc degeneration or that addresses intervertebral disc cell homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The regenerative medicine field using cell-based therapies and biologics has advanced significantly over the past decade with numerous clinical trials aiming at providing treatments for neurodegenerative, orthopedic and cardiovascular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stem cells that have extensive proliferative capacity and multi-lineage potential. They arise from progenitor cell reservoirs and have been isolated from various tissues, including bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. MSCs isolated from various tissues share common characteristics, including the ability to: (1) form fibroblastic like colonies; (2) proliferate extensively; (3) be directionally differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes; and (4) express several common cell surface markers. In addition, they possess immunomodulatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and have the ability to secrete a variety of cell mediators that aid in cellular repair and homeostasis.</p><p>The ideal treatment for degenerative disc disease (DDD) would be to conserve the physiologic function of intervertebral discs and reverse the degenerative cascade. The potential for stem cell-based therapy to treat disc degeneration is to repopulate the disc with viable cells capable of producing extracellular matrix, restoring damaged tissue and enhance tissue regeneration by the secretion of growth factors to modulate the inflammatory response.</p><p>In this short report, we studied the long-term safety and feasibility (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) of intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of chronic lumbar radiculopathy.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rational for hypoxic cell therapy</title><p>The intervertebral disc is the largest avascular tissue in the human body, with oxygen gradients ranging between 1 and 5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Nutrients such as glucose and oxygen diffuse from the capillaries across the cartilaginous endplate and through the dense disc matrix to the cells. During disc degeneration, structural changes and vascular depletion reduce oxygen diffusion thus oxygen concentration lowers, resulting in further extracellular matrix degradation, ultimately causing a vicious cycle of disc degeneration.</p><p>Several studies suggested that hypoxic pre-conditioning has beneficial biological effects that can impact the therapeutic activity of MSCs in the disc. Hypoxic culture has been demonstrated to upregulate chondrocyte specific genes such as aggrecan, collagen type II and Sox-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], upregulate the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), increasing the anti-apoptotic capabilities of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which increases migration and homing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, MSCs cultured from older patients under hypoxia demonstrated enhanced self-renewal and proliferation capacity compared to cultures under normoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hypoxic culturing of MSCs produces many desirable biological effects that may impact the therapeutic activity of the MSCs post-transplant into the limited nutrient, low oxygen tension microenvironment of the degenerative disc.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study overview</title><p>The five patients described in this study where diagnosed with lumbar degenerative disc disease associated with protruding discs.

In June 2009, a pre-stem cell treatment MRI, used as a baseline, showed a posterior disc height of 8.1&#x000a0;mm and the presence of a posterior protrusion of 4.1&#x000a0;mm with annular fissure and compression of the left S1 nerve root (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d left). After being explained the experimental nature of the proposed procedure, informed consent was obtained. In September 2009, this patient received an intra-discal injection of 15.1 million autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs.

No complications occurred during the procedure and no adverse events were reported directly following the procedure. In March 2014, the patient returned for a follow-up examination consisting of a physical examination, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lower back MRI. MRI images post-MSC injection showed no neoplasms or abnormalities surrounding the treated region.

The standard of care including physiotherapy and corticosteroid epidural injections allows for pain management, at least initially, but does not frequently lead to prolonged pain relief and functional improvement. The degenerative cascade associated with DDD often leads over time to the aggravation of the symptoms at the affected disc level, but also to the deterioration of the adjacent intervertebral discs. After exhausting non-invasive options, patients face the prospect of surgery and, in particular, lumbar spinal fusion that does not guarantee complete pain alleviation and can present with significant complications and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies have gained tremendous interest in the past decades in multiple clinical applications and could represent a non-surgical biologic approach to improve pain and function in the millions of patients suffering from chronic low back pain associated with degenerative disc disease. Bone marrow-derived MSCs are of particular interest since they are easily accessible, they have been extensively studied, and they can be isolated following validated, standard operating procedures.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of an intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured&#x000a0;bone marrow-derived MSCs in five patients with chronic lower back pain. The five patients received between 15.1 and 51.6 million MSCs. These patients consented to a follow up exam 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years post-MSC infusion consisting of a physical examination, completion of a quality of life questionnaire, and a lower back MRI. Data collected comprehensively showed that no adverse events, related to MSC infusion, occurred at the time of injection or up to 6&#x000a0;years post-injection, demonstrating long-term safety.</p><p>It is interesting to note that four out of five patients showed an improvement (reduction) of the protrusion size. Additionally all patients displayed maintenance or only mild worsening in disc height after long term follow up. Importantly, based on the quality of life questionnaires, the majority of patients reported an overall improvement, as well as an improvement in strength and mobility. Although this represents a small sample group, there appears to be a correlation between the total number of hypoxic cultured MSCs injected and the overall improvement reported by patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>Autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs represent a potential attractive avenue for the regenerative treatment of patients with DDD. Preliminary safety data from the present study suggest that autologous, bone marrow-derived, hypoxic cultured MSCs are suitable for intra-discal injection of degenerated discs. Although these observations are encouraging, based on the small patient sample size and the uncontrolled nature of the study, a larger double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical study with significant number of patients and implementation of validated endpoint measurements such as the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scale and the functional rating index (FRI) test are next steps in order to demonstrate efficacy of this cell-based biologic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intra-discal injection of autologous, hypoxic cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs demonstrated safety and feasibility in five patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease. This data further support the clinical use of such MSCs for the treatment of lower back pain in larger clinical studies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DDD</term><def><p>degenerative disc disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC(s)</term><def><p>mesenchymal stem cell(s)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FRI</term><def><p>functional rating index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NP</term><def><p>nucleus pulposus</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CE analyzed and compiled the data and wrote the manuscript.
