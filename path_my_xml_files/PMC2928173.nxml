The recognised treatment alternatives are arthroplasty and internal fixation. The principal criticism of internal fixation is the high rate of non-union; up to 30% of patients will have a failure of the fixation leading to revision surgery. We believe that improved fracture healing may lead to a decreased rate of failure of fixation. We therefore propose to investigate strategies to both accelerate fracture healing and improve fixation that may significantly improve outcomes after internal fixation of intracapsular femoral fractures. We aim to test the clinical effectiveness of the osteoinductive agent platelet rich plasma and conduct a pilot study of a novel fixed-angle fixation system.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>We have planned a three arm, single centre, standard-of-care controlled, double blinded, pragmatic, randomised clinical trial. The trial will include a standard two-way comparison between platelet-rich plasma and standard-of-care fixation versus standard-of-care fixation alone. In addition there will be a subsidiary pilot arm testing a fixed-angle screw and plate fixation system.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49197425</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Epidemiology</title><p>Proximal femoral fractures are one of the greatest challenges facing the medical community. In 1990, a global incidence of 1.31 million was reported and was associated with 740,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Proximal femoral fractures constitute a heavy socioeconomic burden worldwide. The cost of this clinical problem is estimated at 1.75 million disability adjusted life years lost, 1.4% of the total healthcare burden in established market economies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Existing knowledge</title><p>Proximal femoral fractures can be subdivided into intra and extracapsular fractures. Approximately half of all proximal femoral fractures are intracapsular. These fractures are at risk of healing complications as the blood supply to the femoral head may be compromised by the fracture. There are two operative strategies in the management of intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur: internal fixation and hip arthroplasty.</p><p>Arthroplasty surgery eliminates the risk of fixation failure as the femoral head is replaced. However, it is a major operation with very significant complications of its own including infection, dislocation and periprosthetic fracture. The most common form of arthroplasty in this group of patients is hemiarthroplasty, where the head of the femur is replaced but the acetabulum is left intact, but this procedure is associated with an approximately 20% risk of late acetabular wear leading to arthritic changes and the potential need for further surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Internal fixation has the key advantage of preserving the patients' own bone and cartilage. It is also a quicker operation requiring a much smaller wound. The principal complication of internal fixation is non-union which is related to the tenuous blood supply to the femoral head. However, the rate of non-union and fixation failure has been reported at up to 33%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] leading to re-operation in 90% of these patients. Consequently, the best treatment of these fractures remains controversial. A recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] has confirmed that the evidence suggests that there is no clinical benefit of one treatment over the other.</p><p>In order for any fracture to heal successfully there must be both a good biological environment and adequate fracture fixation. When a fracture heals there is a balance between the time required to achieve union and the time over which the fixation maintains fracture position. Therefore, the failure of a fracture to heal may be due to an inadequate biological environment (leading to a long healing time) or an inadequate fixation system (leading to a short period of effective fixation). Interventions to improve fracture healing are targeted at one of these two broad areas. In patients with intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur interventions to improve fracture healing may reduce the rate of fixation failure and therefore the requirement for major arthroplasty surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim of the trial</title><p>The aim of this trial is to investigate the clinical effectiveness of novel surgical interventions to improve clinical outcomes following fracture of the proximal femur. Currently, there are two new techniques available which have shown promising early results for the treatment of acute fractures: firstly, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) which is an autologous source of growth factors derived from a patient's whole blood; secondly, novel fixed-angle screw and plate systems which are available following developments in the field of fragility fracture fixation. Early results of both these interventions are promising but there is no Level I clinical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We propose to test the hypotheses that: PRP leads to a reduced incidence of failure of fixation in patients with intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur.</p><p>We propose to explore the size of any treatment effect due to a novel fixed-angle screw and plate system in the treatment of patients with intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur.</p></sec><sec><title>The need for a trial</title><p>A review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] from The Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews 2007 states:</p><p>"Fractures of the thigh bone (femur) near the hip joint (termed intracapsular) may be treated by fixing the fracture (with screws or pins), or alternatively replacing the top of the femur at the hip joint (femoral head) with an artificial hip joint (arthroplasty). This review found that each treatment has its own specific complications. Realigning the bones and fixing the fracture (reduction and internal fixation) is a shorter operation with less blood loss, but is more likely to need a second operation (36% versus 11%). The reason for this is mainly from a failure of the bone to heal in those cases treated with fixation. Internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip."</p><p>A search of the national and international clinical trials databases has revealed that there is only one other trial that is being carried out in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This is a commercial trial assessing the use of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) only. A commercial trial in Leeds, UK investigating the effect of BMP in proximal femoral fractures has recently been abandoned. Otherwise there is no high quality clinical research in this field.</p></sec><sec><title>Good Clinical Practice</title><p>The trial will be carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in accordance with the following protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>CONSORT recommendations</title><p>The trial will be reported in line with the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design</title><sec><title>Design summary</title><p>This trial will be a three arm single centre, standard-of-care controlled, double blinded, pragmatic, randomised clinical trial.</p><p>The study will include a standard two-way comparison between PRP and standard-of-care fixation versus standard-of-care fixation alone.

Although the figures varied by surgeon, all agreed that an absolute reduction of 15% in fixation failure would be clinically important. The overall rate of fixation failure of all intracapsular fractures of the femur is reported to be 20-35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

A recruitment target of 200 participants provides a good margin for unanticipated recruitment problems and loss to follow-up.</p><p>In the absence of an agreed method to determine the sample size for a pilot study a group of expert orthopaedic surgeons were consulted. All agreed that a sample of 25 participants in the fixed-angle screw and plate group would be sufficient to provide adequate pilot data.</p><p>From a recent audit carried out in our department we know that approximately 450 fractures of the proximal femur are treated operatively per year at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.

The randomisation will be weighted such that at the end of the trial there will be 25 participants in the fixed-angle screw and plate group and 100 participants in each of the remaining groups. Randomisation will be stratified by displacement of the fracture. Fractures will be defined as undisplaced (Garden grade I or II) or displaced (Garden grade III or IV); Garden's classification of intracapsular fractures is well recognised and universal and it has been validated to distinguish between grades I and II compared with III and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The surgery will be performed by any of the 16 Consultant Surgeons, two Associate Specialists and 14 Trainees at the University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire. The large number of surgeons and the wide skill mix should eliminate the 'surgeon effect' such that stratification by surgeon is not required.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation concealment</title><p>The allocation sequence will be generated using secure, online randomisation via a distant computer generated system administered by The University of York.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation implementation</title><p>Participants will be enrolled by the trial research associates, co-ordinated by Mr Xavier Griffin.

The operating surgeon will not be blinded to the allocation. All outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors. The primary outcome measure will be determined by the clinical decision of the responsible consultant orthopaedic surgeon who is independent from the trial. The responsible consultant surgeon will not be the operating surgeon in order to maintain the blind. The EQ-5D is a patient reported measure. Patients will be kept blinded until the completion of the trial when the blind is broken. Radiographic outcomes will be assessed by an independent consultant radiologist who is blinded to the treatment allocation. There will be no formal analysis of the success of the blinding.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial treatments</title><p>All participants will have a closed reduction of their fracture.

Internal fixation of the fracture will be achieved through a standard lateral approach with perioperative antibiotic cover in accordance with hospital protocol. Post-operative care will include early active mobilisation managed by a standard physiotherapy rehabilitation regime. All participants will have routine prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

Treatments will be considered to differ significantly if p-values are &#x0003c;0.05 (5% level). Similarly, chi-squared tests will be used to assess the significance of observed differences for the secondary proportional outcome measures. If the numbers in the contingency tables are small (cells with values below 10) then Fisher's exact test will be used in preference to the chi-squared test. In addition to the main analysis, that will report treatment group effects for the primary outcome measure, a subsidiary analysis will use a multiple linear regression model to investigate the relationship between each patient's EQ-5D Score at 12 months and the treatment arm, age, gender, dementia and fracture displacement for each patient. Estimates, and 95% confidence intervals, from the regression model, and unadjusted results from t-tests will be reported and inferences made on the significance of the treatment effect.
