The optometrists provided their usual low vision evaluation and patient training in the clinic. Up to $350 was provided to each subject toward the purchase of low vision devices as recommended by the low vision optometrist.</p><p>Subjects were randomized using a random numbers table and fixed scheme with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Assignment to each treatment group was stratified by severity of vision loss. The BA + OT-LVR treatment arm received services by an OT to address depression and functional limitations from vision loss. This intervention involved six in-home 1-hour sessions over a period of 8 weeks with one of five study OTs. The behavioral activation component of the intervention emphasized links between action, mood, and mastery and promoted self-efficacy and social connection. The low vision rehabilitation component of the intervention followed an occupational therapy plan of care based on the evaluation results and patient goals. The occupational therapists had regular communication with the treating optometrists to update them on subjects' progress with their goals. The supportive therapy group received services from social workers or counselors who provided emotional support. These services involved six in-home 1-hour sessions with one of three study social workers/counselors over a period of 8 weeks. Supportive therapy, which emphasized personal expression about vision loss and disability, was designed to control for nonspecific effects of attention. Aside from the initial LVR services received from the optometrist, no additional in-home LVR services were provided to the subjects in the ST group.</p><p>Relevant to the present study, self-reported functional ability was measured using the AI at baseline and 4 months after treatment.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b24" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b25" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Also included were measures of depression using the PHQ-9.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Vision impairment measures consisted of distance and near visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity, and size and locations of central scotomas.

The activity inventory consists of 50 goal-level activities (e.g., manage personal finances, prepare daily meals) and an item bank of 460 tasks (e.g., specific cognitive and motor activities such as read bills, write checks, measure ingredients, and pour liquids), nested under the 50 goals.

If the goal was rated not important, the interviewer moved on to the next goal. If the goal was rated at least slightly important, the interviewer asked the subject to rate the difficulty of performing the goal activity without depending on another person (not difficult, slightly difficult, moderately difficult, very difficult, or impossible). If the goal was rated not difficult, the interviewer moved on to the next goal. If the goal was rated at least slightly difficult, the subject was asked to rate the difficulty of the tasks nested under that goal (using the same rating categories used for the goal, or the subject could respond that the task is not applicable to the way they perform the goal activity).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The research nurse then verified depression eligibility by administering the PHQ-9, a self-report questionnaire designed to provide information on specific disorders using the criteria from the DSM, at the baseline assessment.

Previous studies have shown that two independent visual function factors underlie visual ability measures estimated from difficulty ratings of activities, one related to visual acuity and the other related to loss of peripheral vision and/or scotomas.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Visual ability estimated from goal difficulty ratings fall close to the principal axis in the two-factor space (i.e., loading approximately equally on the two factors). Person measures estimated from different combinations of tasks fall in the same two-factor space, but plot at different positions depending on the ratio of overall dependence on the acuity-related factor to overall dependence on the scotoma-related factor of the sample of tasks. Because rehabilitation is expected to increase functional reserve (i.e., difference between the person's visual ability [person measure] and the visual ability required to perform the activity described by the item [item measure]), AI item measures and response category thresholds were anchored to baseline values estimated previously from the responses of 3200 low vision patients.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Anchoring item measures and response category thresholds forces all changes in functional reserve, whether increases in the person's ability (e.g., from refractive error correction) or person-specific decreases in the required ability for an item (e.g., from the use of a low vision aid), to manifest as changes in the estimated person measures.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Items that were rated as &#x0201c;not difficult&#x0201d; at baseline were filtered out for both baseline and follow-up person measure estimates, since there is no room for improvement and they would not be included as rehabilitation goals in the patient's plan of care.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We report 1-tail <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing within group differences pre- and posttreatment and between group differences, BA + OT-LVR versus ST.

These results lead us to conclude that functional outcomes are better when occupational therapy is added to standard optometric low vision services than when an equivalent amount of attention only is added. The significant improvements in visual ability we saw in the ST group can be interpreted as concurring with previous studies that concluded that conventional low vision services alone are effective at improving visual function.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b13" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b16" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b17" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b18" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, those results also could be interpreted as indicative of a response-biasing effect of supportive therapy.</p><p>The results of the current study attest specifically to the efficacy of in-home low vision services by an occupational therapist in patients with comorbid depressive symptoms. The added effects of occupational therapy were greater for patients with less severe visual impairments (&#x02265;20/70) than they were for patients with more severe visual impairments (&#x0003c;20/70). This result was unexpected because, as shown in the LOVIT study,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> patients with better visual function at baseline have less room to improve.</p><p>We observed that for both the BA + OT-LVR and ST treatment groups, visual ability measures estimated for AI goal difficulty ratings improved by similar large amounts even though the ST group received no LVR beyond the initial optometric low vision services. With the extensive personal attention given to both groups by the therapists, we must consider the possibility that there could be changes in response bias secondary to improvements in mood resulting from attention alone, which could then be responsible for most of the observed effects. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation of a greater reduction in depression severity for patients in both groups who had significant improvements in functional ability, based on MCID, than for patients who did not have significant improvements. In other words, the severity of depression, rather than or in addition to an actual change in ability, may influence patient's judgments about the difficulty of performing activities, especially when rating the very broadly described AI goals.</p><p>Similar effects of MCID were seen when looking at the reading level, meaning there were greater improvements in depression severity for those with significant improvement in reading ability compared to those without significant improvement in reading ability. At the group level, significant improvements in reading ability were seen for BA + OT-LVR patients with VA &#x02265;20/70, but, there were no significant improvements for BA + OT-LVR subjects with VA &#x0003c;20/70. These results suggest that after the initial services provided by the optometrist, there was no additional benefit from in-home OT-LVR for those subjects with poorer vision.</p><p>The study design selected for a specific demographic of patients who were considered &#x0201c;at-risk&#x0201d; for developing clinically significant depression. The groups BA + OT-LVR and ST exhibited equal reductions in depression severity after intervention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-f01">Fig.</xref>). Although the magnitude of improvement in functional ability did not correlate with the magnitude of reduction in depression severity, the magnitude of reduction in depression severity was significantly greater for patients who had a minimum clinically important difference (MCID of 1) in functional ability at the goal level after intervention. However, we cannot draw conclusions about cause and effect from these observations&#x02014;elevations of mood from the personal attention both groups received from repeated visits by an OT or social worker/counselor over an 8-week period could cause changes in response bias (i.e.<italic>,</italic> making all activities seem easier), or improvements in functional ability from the optometric low vision services provided to both groups before additional in-home psychotherapy could cause elevations in mood (e.g.<italic>,</italic> secondary to reductions in stress). Alternatively, it can be hypothesized that improved visual function contributed to the decline in depression severity. The VITAL study was not designed to test these alternative hypotheses.</p><p>Because both groups received optometric care by a low vision optometrist before randomization, which included initial device evaluation and training, any functional impact from the optometric care given before the home visits would be expected to contribute to both groups' treatment effects. Based on the overall treatment effects seen in the attention control ST group when measured at the task level, it appears that the optometric services and provision of visual assistive equipment without additional OT services only significantly improved functional ability in inside-the-home tasks.</p><p>The most likely scenario is that both effects are occurring: the optometric services plus low vision devices may be responsible for improvements in ability and the attention from the therapists may bias the patients' use of the rating scale. When compared to the broad goal level assessments, task descriptions are much more specific with possibly less room for interpretation and response bias.</p><p>Because the subjects in the VITAL study were selected to represent low vision patients at high risk for developing severe depression, the effect of depression severity on measures of functional ability may be particularly strong. Besides improvements for both groups in functional ability estimated from difficulty ratings of daily activities, both groups also showed significant improvements in depression severity estimated from PHQ-9 scores. Recent studies showed that depressed mood, estimated from Rasch analysis of responses to the geriatric depression scale, was a strong predictor in low vision patients of baseline functional ability measured with the AI,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> but was not associated with changes in functional ability measured after low vision rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-3-1514-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Given these corroborating observations, the results of the present study have to make us concerned about possible confounding effects of depression severity on the measurement per se of functional ability.</p><p>The limitation of the analysis presented here is that the VITAL study was not designed to distinguish the separate contributions to functional ability outcome measures of optometric low vision services, low vision rehabilitation services (plus BA) provided in the patient's home, and the confounding effects of depression severity. A study specifically designed to determine the independent effects of each of these factors on the functional outcomes of low vision rehabilitation is required to properly evaluate the effectiveness of low vision rehabilitation services.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Seattle, Washington, United States, May 2016.</p><p>Supported by NEI Grant U01 EY018819 and Multiple District 22 Lions Vision Research Foundation Fellowship Grant.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>A.D.
