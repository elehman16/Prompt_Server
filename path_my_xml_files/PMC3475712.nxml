Energy (EI) and water intake was recorded. Fat-free mass and water loss were measured with deuterium dilution and elimination, respectively. The energy expenditure was calculated using the intake/balance method and energy availability as (EI/estimated basal metabolic rate). PA was monitored using an accelerometer. Physical performance was measured and questionnaires of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), hunger and mood state were recorded before, during and after TC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ebar had a higher EI and energy availability than the controls. However, decreases in body mass and fat mass were similar in both groups representing an energy deficit. No differences were observed between the groups in PA, water balance, URTI symptoms and changes in physical performance and fat-free mass. Ebar felt less hunger after TC than the controls and they had improved positive mood state during the latter part of TC while controls did not. Water deficit associated to higher PA. Furthermore, URTI symptoms and negative mood state associated negatively with energy availability and PA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>An easy-to-use protein-rich energy bars did not prevent energy deficit nor influence PA during an 8-day TC. The high content of protein in the bars might have induced satiation decreasing energy intake from field rations.

However, previous military studies have shown an energy deficit during a strenuous field training course <xref rid="pone.0047771-Kyrolinen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Nindl1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, which induces loss of body mass and fat-free mass. In many military studies energy restriction is caused by a purpose as an additional stressor <xref rid="pone.0047771-Nindl1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047771-Alemany1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but also underconsumption is a common problem <xref rid="pone.0047771-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-DeLany1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Hoyt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Even though unfamiliar stressful situations might decrease energy intake <xref rid="pone.0047771-Popper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, environmental factors has an important role in determining food intake and choice <xref rid="pone.0047771-deGraaf1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and food acceptability has been found to have an impact on food intake in the field <xref rid="pone.0047771-deGraaf1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, multiple stressors of sleep and caloric deprivation with physical and psychological stress have deteriorated effect on mood state <xref rid="pone.0047771-Lieberman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Energy intake (EI) itself has been found to have an influence on voluntary physical activity, increasing with high-energy intake <xref rid="pone.0047771-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Montain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, energy balance is an important factor in sustaining training load and maintaining high performance during strenuous military training <xref rid="pone.0047771-Tanskanen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047771-Fortes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Demanding training is risk factor for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) among athletes <xref rid="pone.0047771-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and soldiers <xref rid="pone.0047771-Castell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and energy deficit has been hypothesized to be one reason for URTI <xref rid="pone.0047771-Venkatraman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, however, scientific evidence is lacking. In a study by Costa et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> consumption of a high carbohydrate diet throughout a strenuous training period had a favorable effect on markers of immune activity and, thereby, reduced susceptibility to URTI. Similarly in another study by Flakoll et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Flakoll1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, post exercise protein supplementation resulted in reduced bacterial/viral infections during military basic training period. In both of these studies, the supplementation group also received higher energy intake. Therefore, it cannot be concluded whether this phenomenon occurs due to increased protein or carbohydrate intake or just a result of increased energy intake. On the other hand, high-protein diets have been found to attenuate a decrease in fat-free mass (FFM) during negative energy balance induced by a decrease in energy intake among obese individuals <xref rid="pone.0047771-WesterterpPlantenga1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and also among athletes <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, high-protein intake has not been found to attenuate a decrease in FFM when energy deficit is induced by high energy expenditure <xref rid="pone.0047771-Pikosky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>There are few published energy supplements studies during military field training in purpose to assure energy balance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Montain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Fortes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047771-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, however, none of this have used protein-rich supplement. Thus the aim of this study was to determine the effects of an additional easy-to-use protein-rich energy bar supplement of 4.1 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on energy balance, physical activity, body composition, physical performance and subjective experiences of hunger, URTI, mood state and overall well-being during the 8-day military training course (TC) in a cold environment. In the present study, the aim was not to cause energy restriction and neither force the conscripts to eat the all provided food. Instead of that the aim was to observe the effect of military training in terms of self-selected diet. An additional purpose was to define whether an ad libitum fluid intake is sufficient during winter training. We hypothesized that energy supplement of 4.1 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> may increase the total energy intake, improve ability to maintain physical training load and sustain FFM during TC. Furthermore, we hypothesized that an energy supplement will sustain physical performance, enhance mood state and overall well-being and decrease symptoms of URTI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All participants were fully informed of the experimental protocol and gave their written consent to participate in the study.

During the study, the participants completed 8-days field training, which consisted of a variety of military-relevant tasks and skills training, sustained aerobic exercise from skiing and patrolling activities. During TC, participants carried combat gear weighing 60&#x02013;70 kg including their clothes and food rations. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (N &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12) and an energy supplement group (Ebar, N &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14) of which the latter received an additional energy supplement of 4.1 MJ&#x02022;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during the 8-day TC. Water intake was ad-libitum. However, participants were not permitted to use any other extra nutritional supplements throughout the study. Physical performance was studied before [six days before (-6d PRE); one day before (PRE)], during (MID) and after [one day after, POST; three days after (+3d POST)] TC. The measurements included a 3 km combat loaded field running, vertical jump, anaerobic power and handgrip strength. The participants have already done intensive military training for six months and were familiar with the stressors during TC. In addition, they were familiarized with the performance tests, and the jump and hand-grip strength tests were performed twice before (-6 PRE and PRE) the training course for minimizing the changes due to learning. In addition, mood state, body composition and physical activity were studied together with energy and water intake recordings.

Despite a higher energy supply, energy intake was insufficient in the Ebar group similarly to the control group. The participants in both groups consumed, however, only 57&#x000b1;13% of the provided energy during TC. The difference of this study to the previously published energy supplements studies during short-term military field training <xref rid="pone.0047771-Montain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Fortes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047771-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> is the use of protein-rich supplement. However, like the previous studies, also in this study the use of supplements increased energy intake, although it could not prevent from energy deficit. Even energy availability was higher in the present Ebar group, it did not increase physical activity compared to the controls. Furthermore, an increase in aerobic physical performance after TC was observed in both groups. The reason that the additional 4.1 MJ&#x02022;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> could not maintain energy balance might be that Ebar also had higher energy expenditure, although the difference between the groups was not significant. Energy expenditure was calculated by a method of intake/balance, which also takes into account the increased thermic effect of food of a higher protein intake and the carried combat gear of from 60 to 70 kg. Energy expenditure of physical activity was also increased by overall stress of TC <xref rid="pone.0047771-Bahr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, increased somatic and URTI symptoms and negative mood state already before TC was related to lower energy availability during the training, which may indicate the lack of motivation for eating. In addition, increased somatic symptoms in the middle of TC were related to lower energy availability. Although Lieberman et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Lieberman2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> have found no effect of short 2-day caloric deprivation on mood state in laboratory environment, the result of insufficient energy intake despite sufficient provided food is in line with other military training studies. In a study of an 11-day cold-weather field exercise, the mean energy intake was 13.1 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (3132 kcal&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), which was lower than rations offered from 17.6 to 21.8 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (4200 to 5200 kcal&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0047771-Hoyt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. During the 28 day military training in hilly terrain, the average intake of participants with a ready-to-eat meal was 12.4 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (2960 kcal&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) but they did not consume all of the 15.1 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (3600 kcal&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) that they had <xref rid="pone.0047771-DeLany1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the participants with lightweight rations consumed nearly all and the average intake of them during the training was 8.1 MJ&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (1930 kcal&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Both of these groups lost weight (4.3 kg vs. 1.1 kg, respectively) <xref rid="pone.0047771-DeLany1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Popper et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Popper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> found that eating less than usual is more obvious on the first day of the first combat situation, while the amount of eating increased on the second combat situation, but it was still less than usual. The three most likely reasons for this behavior in respective situations has been reported to be lack of time to prepare and eat food as well as not being hungry <xref rid="pone.0047771-Popper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The inadequate energy intake in this study could be also a consequence of their previous experiences that an 8-day energy deficit could be tolerated because participants knew they would have a rest period after TC.</p><p>In the present study, association between physical activity and energy availability was not observed. This is in line with other studies among soldiers, where all subjects were expected to have a substantial energy deficit <xref rid="pone.0047771-Alemany1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-DeLany1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> but not with studies where energy deficit was an option or self-selected <xref rid="pone.0047771-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Tanskanen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similarly in a study by Mettler et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, athletes were able to maintain their training volume and intensity during the 2-week period, despite an energy restriction of 60% of habitual energy intake and reduced well-being. Although enough energy was provided in this study the participants did not utilize it, which resulted in an energy deficit. Thus, the influence of energy intake on physical activity is not known exactly. However, in our study the more was negative mood state and URTI symptoms in the middle of TC, the less was physical activity indicating the role of motivation to perform tasks and be active. Even though the tasks were ordered to do as a group, often soldiers help each others in various tasks. In addition, by helping other group members in their duties, soldiers have possibility to make several behavioral choices, consciously or not, which may clearly affect their energy expenditure in spite of the same whole-day tasks assigned to them. This is supported by a wide variation in total physical activity time from 3&#x02236;50 to 7&#x02236;45 h:min per day.</p><p>While the energy expenditure is extremely high, 1.8 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> intake of protein has been recommended <xref rid="pone.0047771-Pikosky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the present study, protein intake among Ebar was 2.1 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. An easy-to-use protein-rich energy bar was thought to increase energy intake and thus decrease loss of FFM during strenuous TC. Ebar had a higher energy intake and energy availability compared to the controls. However, there were no differences between the groups in changes in FFM, energy deficit and physical activity, even Ebar had a trend for an increase in FFM, rather than a decrease. Among firefighters, eat-on-move snacks increased not only energy intake but also physical activity during a 2-d experimental period compared to ready-to-eat meal days <xref rid="pone.0047771-Montain1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Friedl et al. <xref rid="pone.0047771-Friedl1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> have also shown the positive effects of using food supplementation during US Ranger training; 400 kcal&#x02022;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> higher energy intake attenuated decrease FMM in energy deficit state in the presence of sleep deprivation, psychological stress and high physical activity. Previously, a protein intake of 1.8 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> has been found to be ineffective in preventing a decline in FFM during the energy deficit of 4.2 MJ caused by increased energy expenditure <xref rid="pone.0047771-Pikosky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In the present study, protein intake was sufficient to attenuate the decline in FFM during the exhaustive training, even though the energy deficit was 40%. This is in line with a study of recreational athletes who trained an average of 6 hours per week. Their protein intake was sufficient (&#x0223c;2.3 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) to maintain the lean body mass during the 40% energy restriction compared to the control group (&#x0223c;1.0 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) protein intake <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Increased protein intake has been found to produce satiation <xref rid="pone.0047771-Weigle1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, increase energy expenditure by thermic effect of food, and decreased ad libitum energy intake <xref rid="pone.0047771-Weigle1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> among obese, which are favorable phenomena during weight loss and maintenance. However, these phenomena could be unfavorable during a situation where exercise-induced energy expenditure is high and high-energy intake is recommended. In the present study, high-protein bars might have induced satiation in the Ebar group, leading to their inadequate energy intake from field rations, despite energy being sufficiently provided. This interpretation is supported by the question of hunger. Namely, the Ebar group felt themselves less hungry after TC than the controls. On the other hand, even while energy intake matched energy expenditure, an increased protein intake of 3.0 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> has been shown to have a beneficial role during recovery after exercise by attenuating impairments in endurance performance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Witard1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The likely mediator of this potentially beneficial effect of protein feeding is perturbations in psychological symptoms of stress <xref rid="pone.0047771-Witard1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. On the contrary, during weight loss among recreational athletes, no differences were observed between the low and high protein intake groups in satiety and total mood disturbance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In the present study, even though there were no differences in physical performance between the Ebar and control groups, the questionnaire data revealed that Ebar group felt their physical performance and positive mood state better than the controls.</p><p>It would be assumed that the high activity level over 5 hours per day with only 4 hours rest would have induced decrements in physical performance. An improvement in the 3 km running time in both groups could be partly due to weight loss <xref rid="pone.0047771-Fogelholm1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, but that was not the case. Possible adaptation to the testing procedure and an enhanced level of motivation and effort on the last day of the study <xref rid="pone.0047771-Nindl2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> cannot be ruled out and may explain partly an increase in the 3 km running time. Improvement has also been observed in a study of Hodgon et al <xref rid="pone.0047771-Hodgdon1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> after nine-day field training in cold winter weather: the time of the snowshoe course improved without any change in the anaerobic power test. During TC, participants carried combat gear weighing 60&#x02013;70 kg, but the load carried in the 3 km test was much lighter, a 20 kg backpack. The subjects felt that this lighter load was much easier to carry during the 3 km test and they felt that they were &#x0201c;flying&#x0201d; during the running. Improved 3 km performance might also be a consensus of 8-day load carrying training, which decreased the energy cost of load-carrying <xref rid="pone.0047771-Knapik1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, the present findings confirm that lower body anaerobic power and vertical jump do not appear to be adversely affected by prolonged back load carriage <xref rid="pone.0047771-Knapik1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The results also confirm the previous findings among athletes and military persons that the short-term (&#x0003c;10 days) consequences of underfeeding have a limited impact on muscle strength and aerobic and anaerobic endurance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Zachwieja1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047771-Rognum1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In contrast, also decreased lower body anaerobic power has been found after short period (72 h) of sustained operations <xref rid="pone.0047771-Nindl2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and after eight-day military field training <xref rid="pone.0047771-Welsh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In these studies, the time from a completion of the training course to the beginning of post testing was less than three hours. In the present study, the post test was performed 1 day after the training course, which may explain the difference between the results of anaerobic performance. Also loss of body mass was related to improvement in anaerobic power <xref rid="pone.0047771-Viitasalo1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. However, it has to take into account that longer period of underfeeding should definitely induced decrements in physical performance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Nindl1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Contrary, hand-grip strength decreased in the middle of the training course in both groups and returned to the baseline levels one day after. Thus hand-grip strength might indicate an acute overall physiological and mental fatigue, even though it has not been found as a sensitive indicator of muscle mass loss and energy deficit <xref rid="pone.0047771-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>Also the present results are in line with finding that low (&#x0223c;1.0 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or high (&#x0223c;2.3 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) protein intake has no influence on changes in performance tests after hypoenergetic weight loss <xref rid="pone.0047771-Mettler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A daily carbohydrate intake of 5&#x02013;6 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was lower than recommended for endurance athletes <xref rid="pone.0047771-Hawley1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, but it was still enough to maintain anaerobic performance and even improve aerobic performance. For energy restricted strength and power athletes, above the 3.0 g&#x02022;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbohydrate intake has been recommended to maintain anaerobic performance <xref rid="pone.0047771-Zachwieja1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, improvement in 3 km running time could be a consequence of recently published evidence that after low carbohydrate intake during training period aerobic performance is improved after carbohydrate loading before the test <xref rid="pone.0047771-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In this study participants were able to rest 1 day after the training course before post test and load their energy stores.</p><p>The recommendation for fluid intake during military training in cold weather is 2 liters per day <xref rid="pone.0047771-Rintamki1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In both groups of the present study, ad libitum fluid intake was 2.2&#x000b1;0.5 L per day without water deficit. This confirms that the recommendations of 2 L per day is enough at group level, but is not enough for the most active participants while the activity was related to higher water deficit <xref rid="pone.0047771-Westerterp2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Even the variation in fluid intake (from 0.9 L&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 2.8 L&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and water balance (from &#x02212;1.7 L&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 0.8 L&#x000b7;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was wide, water balance did not correlate with physical performance after the training course nor with change in FFM. In this study water balance was calculated by the differences between estimated water intake and water loss measured by deuterium elimination method. While 73% of the fat-free mass is water (Westerterp et al. 1995a), it could assume that the change in body mass loss is trough water deficit. However, in this study changes in TBW and FFM were nonsignificant and water deficit did not exist. Thus, there was no body mass loss through a water deficit.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the present study, an easy-to-use energy bar supplement of 4 MJ&#x02022;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> did not prevent energy deficit or influence on PA during an 8-day strenuous military TC. A satiation effect of the high content of protein in the bars might have induced a decreased energy intake from field ration, since the Ebar group felt themselves less hungry after TC than the controls. However, negative mood state and URTI symptoms affected energy intake already before the training course. Thus mood state and health status are important factors in preventing undereating. In addition, during strenuous TC, PA seems to be primarily affected by factors other than energy supplementation such as mood state. The outcome and also a limitation of this study was the tremendous undereating. For evaluation the effects of increased energy intake on PA and performance, we should have had a third group which was forced to eat all provided food. Secondly to avoid biases, the subjects should be absolutely unaware of the group at they were included during the whole intervention period. In future studies, a special attention should be paid for the taste and variability of the food as well to maintain positive mood state in order to enhance energy intake during prolonged training.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the conscripts who participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0047771-Hirsch1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
