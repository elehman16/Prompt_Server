With no data available on potential treatment effects, we undertook a blinded analysis of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) effects versus placebo on EMT markers in previously obtained endobronchial biopsies in COPD patients, as a &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Assessment of the effects of inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP; 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily for 6 months) versus placebo in 34 COPD patients (23 on fluticasone propionate and eleven on placebo).

This is especially true of data from endobronchial biopsies done in nonoperative volunteer patients, which contrasts with copious such studies on asthma.<xref rid="b2-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>We have recently reported novel characteristics of airway remodeling in active smokers. These changes are especially marked in those with established COPD. The subepithelial reticular basement membrane (Rbm) was variably thickened but also markedly fragmented with clefts or elongated spaces within it,<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which is quite different from that in asthma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-9-533">Figure 1</xref>), where the Rbm is homogeneously thickened and hyaline in appearance.<xref rid="b9-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These elongated clefts in the Rbm in COPD are usually not empty, but frequently contain cells.<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These cells positively express the mesenchymal markers S100A4 and vimentin, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and do not penetrate inflammatory or other immune cells.<xref rid="b4-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These changes are &#x0201c;classic&#x0201d; hallmarks of the process termed epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT),<xref rid="b10-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> defined as the transition of epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype with the potential to digest and migrate through the Rbm to the subepithelial lamina propria.<xref rid="b10-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The epithelium in COPD is also highly activated, with upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In general, these changes were most marked in currently smoking COPD subjects compared with ex-smoking COPD and physiologically normal smokers.

Type III EMT is recognized as producing a highly dangerous pro-cancerous stroma immediately under the epithelium. Of course, we recognize that smoking, and especially COPD is closely related to lung cancer development,<xref rid="b14-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and such promalignant stroma has been described as being important in the development of other common epithelial malignancies.<xref rid="b15-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> ICS have become standard treatment in severe COPD, on the basis of positive empirical results from large studies, demonstrating short-term improvement in lung function and longer term benefits in terms of quality of life, exacerbation rates, long-term physiological decline, and possibly mortality.<xref rid="b16-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Importantly, there are also reports about the effects of ICS on inflammatory stromal airway changes in COPD;<xref rid="b17-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> there is also epidemiological and circumstantial evidence of a protective effect of ICS use against lung cancer development in the highly vulnerable COPD population.<xref rid="b18-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>To our knowledge, there have been no longitudinal trials published about the effects of ICS on EMT or other airway structural changes in COPD.

This was a prospective analysis under blinded conditions that utilized tissue available from a previous study mainly directed at documenting changes in airway inflammatory cells,<xref rid="b17-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> although it was always a stated intention to address airway remodeling at an appropriate time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Using retrospectively obtained tissue, this study still constituted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-9-533">Figure 2</xref>), but was intended as a pilot investigation given the paucity of data on the likely effects of ICS on the parameters of interest. A pilot study does not require a formal sample size calculation but is a precursor exercise to test whether the components of subsequent larger studies can work well together. Pilot studies provide valuable information such as that on patient recruitment and retention, the practicability of performing investigations, and an estimate of effect sizes, where no other information exists. The pilot study data may be analyzed as an &#x0201c;external pilot&#x0201d;, and it is understood that results from hypothesis testing should be treated as preliminary, with robust but pragmatic statistical management, and therefore, cautious interpretation.<xref rid="b21-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The details of the study design (full protocol available from the authors) and data on inflammatory cell profiles have been published previously.<xref rid="b17-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>The demographics of the study groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-9-533">Table 1</xref>.

All subjects gave written, informed consent prior to participation.

Further, randomization was originally done on a 2:1 basis of active to placebo treatment because at the time it was considered that the most useful data would be obtained in the active (ICS) limb, and this too limited our statistical power in the between-group comparisons. The control tissue was available from clinically and physiologically normal, age-matched non-smoker individuals who had volunteered for research bronchoscopy over a number of years, and their endobronchial biopsies had been stored and then processed in the same way as for the longitudinal intervention subjects.<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Exclusion criteria include: 1) subjects with a history suggestive of asthma, which includes symptoms in childhood, related atopic disorders, eczema or hay fever, substantial day-to-day variability or prominent nocturnal symptoms, or a history of wheeze rather than progressive breathlessness, and any who had previously used ICS (oral or inhaled); 2) no major comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes, angina, or cardiac failure, nor other coexisting respiratory disorders including pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, or bronchiectasis, and subjects were not on medication; and 3) subjects who were unable to give written informed consent. Inclusion criteria include: 1) current-smokers with COPD aged 40&#x02013;70 years with a smoking history equal to or more than 15 pack-years; subsequently obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid had to be free of culturable bacteria; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 40%&#x02013;80% predicted, with forced expiratory ratio (FER; ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity [FVC]) &#x02264;70% post-bronchodilator with definite scalloping out of the descending limb of the flow&#x02013;volume loop on spirometry.

In each case, a non-immune immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 negative control (Dako; X0931 clone DAK-GO1) was performed to eliminate false positive staining and a positive tissue control (surgically resected lung tissue) was also used.

All slides were coded and randomized by an independent person and then counted by a single experienced observer (SSS) blinded to the subject and diagnosis, with quality assurance on randomly selected slides provided by a clinical and academic pathologist (Professor Hans Konrad Muller; International Academy of Pathology and Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, Sydney, Australia).<xref rid="b3-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Quantification of indices was performed before and after treatments to compare the effects of interventions. Cellular staining changes in the basal epithelium and Rbm were documented. Cell numbers positive for S100A4 and MMP-9 and the number of vessels within the Rbm were normalized for purposes of comparisons relative to the total length of basement membrane assessed. EGFR was measured as a percentage of epithelium stained for EGFR over the total basement membrane length. Although the full picture of fragmentation of the Rbm includes linear &#x0201c;clefts&#x0201d; or elongated spaces/cracks in the Rbm, as fragments of Rbm commonly &#x0201c;hang off &#x0201d; and with similar pieces completely separated from the remainder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-9-533">Figure 1</xref>), we have used Rbm linear splitting (ie, cleft formation) as a quantitative measure for the observation. Thus, the total length of splits was summed and normalized as a percentage of the length of Rbm.

In keeping with the principles of such a pilot study, our analyses were predominantly exploratory by definition, with no formal sample size calculable. Recommendations for good practice are that where possible, approximately 20&#x02013;30 patients at baseline should be evaluated, as in the present study, to investigate the distribution of outcomes of key study parameters.<xref rid="b21-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A limited set of hypotheses were tested, complementing descriptive data.

The effects of the interventions were assessed using Wilcoxon related-samples tests to compare the indices for each of the biomarkers before and after treatment within treatment groups and also as changes within the groups (active versus [vs] placebo). The differences between the indices for the placebo and ICS treatment groups after intervention and differences from normal controls were compared using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. These statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (v15.0 for Windows; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) with a two-tailed <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05 considered statistically significant.

We prospectively specified a three-stage, fixed-sequence statistical testing procedure and adjusted &#x0201c;alpha&#x0201d; (power) for multiplicity accordingly.<xref rid="b24-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Firstly, we would specify EGFR expression in the epithelium as the primary &#x0201c;driving&#x0201d; outcome measure and test the null hypothesis of no difference using alpha =0.05. If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected there would be a rationale for no further testing. However, given the mechanistic uncertainty between EGFR upregulation and EMT, we have nominated a coprimary hypothesis related to the main descriptive structural hallmark of EMT, namely the aggregate lengths of splitting in the Rbm that could therefore also be tested using alpha =0.05. If appropriate, ie, if the null hypothesis is rejected, in the third stage of testing we would treat the remaining outcomes, (basal cell S100A4, Rbm cell S100A4, and MMP-9 expression) as a cluster of related end points with an overall and shared alpha, so that individual hypotheses would be tested using an alpha of 0.0167; subsequently, larger and/or more consistent changes would be required.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Studying markers of EMT in airway biopsies proved practicable in a randomized trial setting.

We have hypothesized that large airway EMT, which we have found is also associated with Rbm hypervascularity, may be important in both fibrosis and cancer pathogenesis and progression, as this is typical of what has been described as procancerous for epithelial tumors elsewhere.<xref rid="b5-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b15-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we have provided consistent but still provisional evidence that ICS over 6 months suppresses such EMT-related changes. We feel that the study was successful, at the very least, as a &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; study.</p><p>Our pilot trial indicated that intervention studies using bronchoscopic airway material for studying EMT in COPD are practicable, and we were able to provide reliable data regarding baseline levels and reproducibility of markers of EMT, as well as changes associated with ICS treatment, albeit in a pilot setting. For developing power calculations and sample size, we have now defined our primary end points as Rbm fragmentation (a classic structural hallmark of EMT) and epithelial activation, and the other downstream EMT biomarkers of MMP-9 cell expression, in addition to S100A4 cell expression in the basal epithelium and Rbm, as secondary end points. The results of this analysis would suggest that if powering a study for these primary end points, then rather modest numbers are required. If S100A4 expression in the basal epithelium was treated as an independent variable, it would provide the most sensitive outcome, and perhaps a primary end point of combining S100A4 staining in both basal epithelial cells and Rbm together would be worth considering in numerically limited intervention studies.</p><p>The present study supports the concept that the epithelium in smokers/COPD is activated with high levels of EGFR expression. We nominated this as a primary outcome in the power calculations because it may well be that activation of the epithelium is a primary mechanistic event in inducing EMT and could also be important in cancer induction.<xref rid="b29-copd-9-533" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This pilot trial showed a reduction in EGFR expression in the airway epithelium in the active ICS arm compared to placebo, and again, it was essentially normalized.

We did not have sufficient numbers of samples to adequately address the question of whether current smoking status influences the effects of ICS on EMT markers; however, there was no obvious difference between these two groups in any of the biomarker changes on active treatment.</p><p>Given that this study was treated as a pilot for &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d; and investigative power-determination purposes, with assumed insufficient numbers of participants to be a definitive study, we have avoided some statistical finesse, such as allowing for multiple comparisons, or treating primary versus secondary end points differently.
