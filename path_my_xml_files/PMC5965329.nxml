More
than in any other injury, the inflammation and catabolism associated with
severe burns can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies resulting in impaired
immune function and increased risk of developing infection, organ
dysfunction and death. Consequently, over the last few decades numerous
trials have evaluated the impact of different nutritional strategies in
severe burn injury. Glutamine is of particular interest, as it appears vital
for a number of key stress-response pathways in serious illness. The purpose

time and are at high risk of developing infections and dying. Proper nutrition
and certain nutrients may improve survival in these patients and shorten their
stay in the burn unit. Glutamine is a building block of protein that is normally
made in the body and is found in different foods we eat. It is of great interest
because it has several beneficial effects on the body during serious illness,
such as with burn injury. In this study, we will look at the effect of glutamine
supplementation on survival and time spent in hospital. A total of 80 burn units
around the world will enrol 2700 patients with 2nd or 3rd degree burns over 4
years. Patients will receive either glutamine powder or a placebo through a
feeding tube or mixed with food, from admission to the burn unit, until a week
after the burn wound has healed. The main outcome for this study is survival at
6 months. Other outcomes include the time taken to be discharged from hospital
alive and duration of stay in the burn unit. This study will be the first large
international multicentre trial examining the effects of glutamine in burn
patients. Glutamine may lead to better survival and less complications in burn
patients, who have a devastating and disabling burn injury. If the trial is
positive, the results will be used to inform how nutrition should be given to
such patients worldwide.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Burn injury</kwd><kwd>nutrition support</kwd><kwd>glutamine</kwd><kwd>randomized trials</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section4-2059513117745241"><title>Introduction</title><p>Worldwide, burn injuries represent a significant public health problem and are ranked
the fourth most common injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Burn injury strikes largely young to middle-aged working people, resulting in

The incidence of hospital visits caused by burn injuries was 220 per 100,000

sepsis.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
In severe burns and other critical illnesses, the relationship between nutrient
deficiencies, altered immune status and acquired infection has been recognised for
many years. More than in any other injury, the inflammation and catabolism
associated with severe burns can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies, thereby
predisposing patients to impaired immune function and increased risk of developing
infectious complications, organ dysfunction and death. Consequently, over the last
few decades numerous trials have evaluated the impact of different
nutrition/nutrient strategies in critically ill patients and in particular, severely
burn-injured patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
Glutamine is of particular interest in this regard as it appears vital for a number
of key stress-response pathways in serious illness.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Observational studies have shown that glutamine levels decrease acutely
during critical illness<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and that low levels of glutamine are associated with immune dysfunction<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In a single-centre pilot trial
of enteral glutamine, the enteral glutamine supplementation showed a threefold
reduction in positive blood cultures and a dramatic reduction in mortality in severe
burn patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Six other randomized trials of glutamine supplementation in burns patients
have been conducted, and when summarised, they are suggestive of a significant
reduction in mortality and hospital length of stay.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> With this limited evidence, many practitioners are prescribing enteral
glutamine to burn-injured patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, as explained below, randomized controlled trials in other critically
ill patient populations have suggested that glutamine administration may be harmful
and increase mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Given this conflicting evidence, burn practitioners are either
harming or saving lives with glutamine use. It is imperative that we determine the
efficacy and safety of glutamine now!</p><p>The purpose of the current manuscript is to provide the rationale for and
methodological details of a large, multicentre clinical trial of supplemental
enteral glutamine in 2700 severe burn-injury patients. We hypothesise that the
inexpensive therapeutic strategy tested in this randomized controlled trial will
lead to lower morbidity and mortality and reduced healthcare costs in an otherwise
very devastating and disabling injury worldwide. This trial will be the largest
trial of burn-injured patients ever conducted.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2059513117745241"><title>Background rationale and systematic review of the literature</title><p>The amino acid glutamine plays a central role in nitrogen transport within the body,
is a fuel for rapidly dividing cells (particularly lymphocytes and enterocytes), is
a precursor to glutathione and nucleotides, and has many other essential metabolic functions.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A summary of potential mechanisms of benefit for glutamine in burn injury is
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2059513117745241">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Under normal
physiological conditions, glutamine is synthesised in sufficient amounts by the
skeletal muscle and therefore is considered non-essential. It had been hypothesised
that glutamine may become a conditionally essential amino acid in patients with
catabolic disease as studies indicate glutamine levels fall following major
surgery,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> critical illness<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and burn injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Lower levels of glutamine have been associated with immune dysfunction<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1-2059513117745241" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mechanisms of glutamine&#x02019;s potential benefit after thermal burn injury.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2059513117745241-fig1"/></fig><p>Following burn injury, recent experimental data show that glutamine supplementation

survival associated with glutamine supplementation in models of sepsis and

shown that glutamine can reduce long-term lung injury from burn-related smoke inhalation<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and can reduce cardiac injury and improve cardiac function following severe
burn injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In addition, randomized clinical trials have shown that glutamine
administration improves insulin sensitivity and protein metabolism in critically ill

glutamine supplementation, when combined with post-intensive care unit (ICU)
physiotherapy and adequate protein delivery, has recently been shown to improve
6-min walk test times vs. physiotherapy alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> These findings suggest that glutamine may help to preserve muscle mass and
long-term physical function in burn patients.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have conducted several systematic reviews and
meta-analyses of existing studies of glutamine supplementation in critically ill
patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="bibr36-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr37-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> When the
results from all randomized trials providing intravenous glutamine to all critically

reviewed shows plausible mechanistic hypotheses and potential clinically significant
benefits, thus clearly justify moving forward with this large randomized controlled
trial. Taken together, there is a signal from these trials for enteral glutamine and
specifically, in the burn population, glutamine supplementation may result in
improved clinical outcomes. However, this signal requires confirmation in a large,
high-quality, multicentre trial because of the potential for harm.</p><sec id="section6-2059513117745241"><title>The REDOXS study: the first signal of harm</title><p>As summarised above, there is no signal to date of glutamine causing harm in
burn-injured patients. However, some of our team have recently published the
results of the REDOXS trial that suggested glutamine may be harmful in patients
with multi-organ failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In a blinded 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial trial involving 40 ICUs in Canada, the
United States and Europe, we randomized 1223 critically ill, mechanically
ventilated adult patients with multi-organ failure to glutamine supplementation
or no glutamine and antioxidants or no antioxidants. High doses were used for
glutamine: 0.35 g/kg/day of glutamine intravenously based on ideal body weight,
provided as 0.50 g/kg/day of the dipeptide alanyl-glutamine (Dipeptiven&#x000ae;,
Fresenius Kabi) and an additional 30 g/day delivered enterally, provided as
alanyl-glutamine and glycine-glutamine dipeptides or respective placebo. In
addition, patients were randomized to receive 500 &#x000b5;g of selenium intravenously
(selenase&#x000ae;, biosyn), and the following vitamins and minerals administered
enterally: selenium 300 &#x000b5;g, zinc 20 mg, beta carotene 10 mg, vitamin E 500 mg
and vitamin C 1500 mg, or placebo. In contrast to our hypotheses and
expectations, we demonstrated increased harm associated with glutamine
supplementation. In addition, in a second manuscript, we conducted several post
hoc subgroup analyses to identify any potentially important subgroup effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> It appears that harm from both glutamine and AOX supplementation were
limited to patients with renal dysfunction upon study enrolment. This harmful
effect seemingly was partially ameliorated by the presence of dialysis.</p></sec><sec id="section7-2059513117745241"><title>The Metaplus study: another signal of harm</title><p>More recently, another trial of glutamine supplementation suggests increased
mortality (Metaplus study<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>). Van Zanten et al. recently completed a randomized trial of 300 patients
comparing an enteral feeding product enriched with glutamine, omega-3 fatty
acids and antioxidants compared to a high protein enteral diet. No statistically
significant differences were observed in infections (primary endpoint) or other
endpoints except that patients that received the enriched diet had increased
higher six-month mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57, 95% CI =
1.03&#x02013;2.39; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), In addition, in a pre-specified sub-group
analysis, six-month mortality was higher in medical patients receiving the
glutamine supplemented formula compared to controls (53.7% vs. 34.5%,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.044).</p></sec><sec id="section8-2059513117745241"><title>Differences between REDOXS and Metaplus trials and the RE-ENERGIZE
trial</title><p>It is key to stress that burn-injured patients are quite different metabolically,
and from a protein/amino acid loss standpoint, vs. the REDOXS and Metaplus study
patients. The REDOXS trial enrolled only mechanically ventilated patients with
critical illness admitted to the ICU with two or more organ failures related to
their acute illness. Major burn patients were excluded from the REDOXS trial
because it was considered at the time to be unethical to withhold glutamine in
this patient population. This led to a population that was 80% medical ICU
patients in REDOXS, while the Metaplus study only showed harm in medical ICU
patients and not in surgical patients. In addition, in the REDOXS trial, 35% of
the group presented in renal failure and nearly 95% of patients were on
vasopressors at enrolment. The average age of the patient was ~ 63 years. This
is quite different from the proposed RE-ENERGIZE trial where burns patients will
be, for the most part, young and healthy before admission. The average age of
patients in the pilot study so far is 48 years. The dose of glutamine used in
the REDOXS trial was the highest dose ever given in a major clinical trial and
was provided both enterally and parenterally. The RE-ENERGIZE trial gives 0.5
g/kg/d of L-GLN enterally (only) in the glutamine treatment arm. Enterally
administered glutamine has a much lower systemic uptake than parenteral
glutamine as the majority of the glutamine (~ 80%) is metabolised by the GI
tract and the liver before reaching the systemic circulation. This is quite
different from the systemic effects of intravenous glutamine.</p><p>Another key difference between REDOXS and RE-ENERGIZE is the baseline plasma
glutamine levels. In a sub-study of 68 patients in the REDOXS trial with plasma
glutamine measurements, only 31% of patients presented with low baseline
glutamine levels (normal values 420&#x02013;700 &#x000b5;mol/L). In fact, we observed
supra-normal levels (&#x0003e; 930 &#x000b5;mol/L) of plasma glutamine at baseline in 15% of
patients, a phenomenon only recently described and also shown to be associated
with increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> We have not seen high plasma levels in burn-injury patients.
Historically, burn patients have significant glutamine deficiency early in their
stay due to massive glutamine loss via the burn wound and severe
catabolism.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the context of our RE-ENERGIZE pilot study, we drew
blood on 18 randomly selected patients to measure baseline plasma glutamine
levels. The average level was below the lower range of normal at 408 &#x000b1; 146
umol/L (normal values 420&#x02013;700 &#x000b5;mol/L), indicating severe glutamine deficiency in
our pilot burn patients, which was quite different from the REDOXS trial where
very little baseline deficiency was observed. In our pilot trial of severe burn
injury, the highest baseline glutamine level was 723 umol/L (within normal
range).</p><p>In summary, recent studies provide us with the first signal that glutamine may be
harmful in some patient populations. This signal is only apparent in large
scale, multicentre trials and in non-burn populations who have normal to high
levels of serum glutamine. Juxtaposed next to the systematic review of enteral
glutamine in burns, which suggested reduced mortality and infections and shorter
LOS, there is considerable uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of
glutamine in this burn patient population. While there is no signal of harm to
date in the burn population, the signal of benefit comes from six small,
single-centre RCTs evaluating a total of 225 burn patients but only three trials
reporting any deaths in either group. All of these trials had less than 50
patients each and were grossly underpowered to rule out harm. When statistically
aggregated, these few trials do suggest a very large and implausible treatment
effect. We consider this estimate of treatment effect unstable and possibly
biased. Given the uncertain effect of glutamine in burn patients, including both
a potential for benefit and harm, we need to conduct a large scale, multicentre
trial of glutamine in burns to resolve the uncertainty about the overall
effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-2059513117745241"><title>The proposed methods</title><p>We propose a large, international, multicentre, double-blind, pragmatic, randomized
controlled trial of 2700 patients with severe burns randomly allocated to receive
enteral glutamine or placebo. We aim to recruit patients from burn or ICUs from
across North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Given the large sample size
across numerous participating units, we have adopted a pragmatic philosophy in
developing and executing this trial protocol. Consistent with this philosophy, we
have made efforts to standardise nutrition practices across all site but make no
effort to standard other key aspects of burn care across these multiple burn
units.</p><sec id="section10-2059513117745241"><title>What are the planned trial interventions?</title><p>Patients will be allocated to two groups:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-2059513117745241"><list-item><p>the glutamine group: patients will receive glutamine through their
feeding tube, every 4 h or three times a day if taking things by mouth,
for a total of 0.5 g/kg/day for patients with a body mass index (BMI)
&#x0003c; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients with a BMI &#x02a7e; 35 will receive 0.5
g/kg/day based on an obesity-adjusted body weight. The glutamine powder
will be supplied in pre-packaged aliquots and will be delivered to the
ICU in blinded sachets and will be mixed in water or other liquids at
the bedside by the patient&#x02019;s nurse;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the control group: patients will receive an iso-calorically delivered
amount of maltodextrin (control) mixed with water or other liquids.
Maltodextrin is a source of carbohydrate commonly found in standard
enteral nutrition and has no metabolic effects other than serving as a
trivial source of additional energy. Moreover, maltodextrin appearance
makes it indistinguishable from glutamine, allowing for a double-blind
design. The enteral route of glutamine administration seems preferable
because our result on mortality was obtained in the pilot study using
this mode of administration.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Glutamine or control supplement will be given within 2 h of
randomisation (where possible) through enteral route (feeding tube or
orally). Administration of the glutamine may be interrupted by surgical
procedures. A missed administration will be compensated for by a double
dose at the next dosing or a make-up dose during a later part of the
day. Glutamine will not be counted in the protein intake of the
patients, so the dietitian can remain blinded and prescribe protein as
per usual standards of care. The justifications for not giving an
isonitrogenous placebo is based on the fact that patients from both
groups will receive an adequate amount of proteins through standard
nutritional care and non-essential amino acids used in such a placebo
may have active metabolic and cellular effects.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section11-2059513117745241"><title>What are the proposed arrangements for allocating participants to trial
groups?</title><p>Informed consent will be obtained within 72 h following admission to the local
ICU or burn unit from the patient or substitute decision-maker in accordance
with local ethics committee regulations. Once consent is obtained and necessary
baseline data collected, the study coordinator will log on to the web-based
randomisation system at the Clinical Evaluation Research Unit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ceru.ca/">http://www.ceru.ca/</ext-link>) at Kingston General Hospital. The system
will confirm eligibility before allowing randomisation. The system will then
provide the study coordinator with a patient study number and will send the
local pharmacist notification of randomisation and treatment assignment.
Allocation will be random and concealed and will be blinded to everyone except
the pharmacist at each site who will be responsible for preparing study samples
and delivering them to the ICU in a blinded fashion in accordance with the
documented study operating procedures. The randomisation system will use a
computer-generated randomisation schedule allocating patients 1:1 to either
glutamine or matching placebo by the method of permuted blocks of random
undisclosed size within strata. Randomisation will be stratified by site to
ensure balance of treatment assignments within each site. Given the large
pragmatic nature of the trial, we will not stratify by additional factors such
as burn severity. Because of the large sample size, such additional
stratification variables will not be helpful in balancing out the two groups,
adds statistical complexity to the analysis, and add operational challenges to
the conduct of the trial as all the stratification variables need to be clearly
and accurately defined before randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="section12-2059513117745241"><title>What are the proposed methods for protecting against other sources of
bias?</title><p>All research and clinical personnel at the study site with the exception of the
site pharmacist will be blinded to treatment allocations. Given the nature of
our study intervention, it is important that we standardise the practice of
nutrition therapy in participating units. As per standard of care in these burn
units, these patients will be fed enterally and for those fed into the stomach,
they will have routine evaluation of gastric residual volume during feeding. To
improve compliance, national nutrition guidelines, pre-printed orders and
bedside algorithms are provided. Also, the use of enteral solutions that contain
glutamine is restricted in all enrolled participants. Although other aspects of
burn care will not be standardised, we will capture key process of care issues
in our data collection strategies.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2059513117745241"><title>What are the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria?</title><p>Inclusion criteria consist of: deep second- and/or third-degree burns requiring

Patients who develop renal failure during study treatment will be evaluated
daily to determine if the study medication should continue. If dialysis is

resolves.</p></sec><sec id="section14-2059513117745241"><title>What is the proposed duration of treatment period?</title><p>Since our initial single-centre pilot trial, we have been supplementing with
glutamine until all burn wounds are excised and covered. The rationale for this
choice is based on the observed effects of glutamine on infection in published
studies on burn patients. Since severe infectious episodes could occur
throughout the healing period we choose to give glutamine as long as the risk
for infection is present. Without objective and standardised methods to measure
wound-healing time, we choose to operationalise this concept by administering
the study intervention to the patients until seven days after the last grafting
operation or until discharge from the acute care unit or three months from
admission, whichever comes first.</p></sec><sec id="section15-2059513117745241"><title>What is the proposed duration of follow-up?</title><p>Patient clinical status will be monitored daily during the acute care unit stay.
Once discharged from the burn unit or ICU, patients will no longer be followed
daily but hospital outcomes, as explained below, will be abstracted from the
chart. Since glutamine may have long-term positive effects,<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and the resolution of the burn itself, in terms of recovery from injury,
may take months, we will follow patients for up to six months documenting
survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Diagram of study duration

endpoint as the primary outcome because of the following reasons: (1) mortality
rates are still significant, particularly in low-income countries; (2) if we
postulate that enteral glutamine may be harmful based on the results of recent
trials, we must be adequately powered to detect such a treatment effect; and (3)
it is a more objective endpoint than infection or length of stay (which are also
influenced by non-clinical factors). We justify an outcome assessment at six
months, as opposed to shorter time points, because a significant proportion of
patients will stay more than 90 days in hospital and glutamine has been shown to
have effects on six-month mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p>The secondary outcome is time to discharge alive (TTDA) from hospital. TTDA is an
important secondary outcome that is a composite of mortality and length of stay.
This composite is similar to &#x02018;ventilator- free days&#x02019;, which is a widely accepted
and commonly used outcome in intensive care research.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> As per the stated
hypotheses of the trial, we expect glutamine to reduce infection, reduce
mortality and shorten length of stay. Infections may both negatively impact
length of stay and mortality, but this will be captured in a TTDA endpoint.
Tertiary outcomes include HRQOL and, in particular, the physical function domain
of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, activities of daily living (ADL) and
instrumental ADL, incidence of acquired bacteraemia due to Gram-negative
organisms, hospital mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay
and hospital stay. We will also record frequency of operative procedures for
burn care and other major cost drivers as outlined in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2059513117745241">Appendix 1</xref> to support our economic
evaluation.</p><p>All hospital outcomes (i.e. mortality, length of care and the incidence of
bacteraemia) will be collected until discharge to home or alternative level of
care (i.e. rehabilitation facility) or three months from burn unit admission,
whatever comes first. To better understand the impact of the study treatment on
longer-term survival, function and QOL, we will follow surviving study patients
for six months. At six months after randomisation, a trained research
coordinator at each site will contact patients discharged from hospital to
assess survival status, whether they have resumed normal activities and
administer the SF-36 over the phone.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> To assess whether they have resumed activities, we will ask about if

will be seen post discharge by the multidisciplinary burn team. We will further
minimise LTFU by obtaining contact information for family members, in addition
to the patient, at time of consent. Finally, if we cannot reach patient nor
family, we will use hospital records and existing registries to ascertain
patient status.</p></sec><sec id="section17-2059513117745241"><title>What is the proposed sample size and what is the justification for the
assumptions underlying the power calculation?</title><p>Data support our belief that the mortality rate in the placebo arm will be at
least 15%. This is a conservative estimate as the control group mortality rate
in the meta-analysis of enteral glutamine trials in burn injury is 25% (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-2059513117745241">Appendix 2</xref>). Furthermore,
considering all patients with a burn injury &#x0003e; 20% TBSA in the American Burn
Association registry, (similar to our inclusion criteria), the mortality rate is
approximately 27%. We will conservatively assume a control arm mortality rate of
15% to allow for the likelihood that our mortality rate is lower than previously
reported in similar patients. We consider a 25% relative risk (RR) reduction
from 15% to 11.25% to be minimally clinically important. The results of the
meta-analysis of existing glutamine trials in burn injury (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-2059513117745241">Appendix 2</xref>) suggest that an even larger
treatment effect is plausible. Smaller differences may be clinical important but
may be impractical to detect and may not be large enough to shift existing
practice patterns. In order to achieve 80% power to detect such a difference at
two-sided alpha = 0.05 using a Chi-squared test (or two independent proportion
z-test), we would need 1273 patients per arm. We will enrol a total of 2700
patients to conservatively allow for 5% LTFU.</p><p>A significant mortality effect would trump the secondary outcome of TTDA.
However, based on a simulation study, we estimated that if there was no
mortality difference between arms, the proposed sample size would achieve 80%
power to detect a difference in TTDA if the daily hazard rate of discharge among
survivors was multiplied by 1.16 for EN glutamine patients.</p></sec><sec id="section18-2059513117745241"><title>What is the proposed type of analyses?</title><p>The primary analysis of six-month mortality will be compared between arms using
the z-test for two independent proportions. This is equivalent to the
Chi-squared test for symmetric two-sided tests, but will allow us to implement
one-sided interim analyses to test for increased mortality in the glutamine arm.
A secondary analysis will employ the generalised mixed effects model with a
random site effect. This will provide a within site interpretation of effect,
will allow us to explore between site heterogeneity and will meet regulatory
guidance suggesting that site be incorporated in a sensitivity analysis if it is
not used for the primary analysis.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><xref rid="bibr48-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr49-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>The secondary outcome of this study is time to live discharge from hospital.
Patients who die before hospital discharge will be treated as never being
discharged from hospital by censoring them at day 181 (after last follow-up).
The primary analysis will use the log-rank test. Since the log-rank test is rank
based, the actual time value we assign to decedents is unimportant; they are
simply considered worse (higher rank) than any patients discharged by six
months. We expect minimal LTFU before hospital discharge, but if LTFU does occur
due to hospital transfer or other reasons, patients will be censored at the last
time known to be in the hospital. A secondary analysis will use a shared frailty
model to incorporate site as a random effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The methods used for the primary (excluding the interim analyses) and
secondary outcome will be applied to the binary and time-to-event tertiary
outcomes, respectively. In accordance with the intent-to-treat principle, the
analysis will include all patients in the arm to which they were randomized
regardless of study compliance. Based on our substantial prior experience with
this population we expect minimal missing data. However, details of missing data
will be provided and we will perform a sensitivity analysis using a graphical
pattern mixture tipping point approach demonstrating the treatment effect over
the possible range of missing outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2059513117745241" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section19-2059513117745241"><title>What is the frequency of analysis?</title><p>Although glutamine is recommended by current guidelines and used in about half of

patients and is used in about half of all burn patients. Although equipoise
currently exists, glutamine safety concerns have recently arisen in slightly
different patient populations. Therefore, we would like to perform an early
assessment of increased mortality in the glutamine arm. But given the concerns
from other studies, stopping the study early for glutamine benefit may leave
lingering uncertainties regarding the safety and efficacy of glutamine in this
population. Hence, we propose two one-sided interim analyses to test for
increased six-month mortality in the glutamine arm once 600 and 1350 patients
are evaluable. True equipoise currently exists, so a study demonstrating
increased harm due to glutamine will have as much impact on practice as a study
showing a glutamine benefit. Therefore, we have avoided a futility analysis that
would not establish if glutamine actually increases mortality. On the other
hand, traditional O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming type boundaries require an unacceptably large
increase in mortality to stop the study at the interim analyses. We have chosen
a compromise that would stop for increased mortality in the glutamine arm if a
nominal <italic>P</italic> value of 0.01 is reached at the first or second
interim analysis. At the first interim analysis, this threshold would be met if
the observed six-month mortality rates in the glutamine and control arm were
22.4% and 15.0%, respectively, or 16.4% and 10.0%, respectively. At the second
interim analysis, the stopping rule would be met if the observed mortality rates
in the glutamine and control arms were 19.8% and 15.0%, respectively, or 14.1%
and 10.0%, respectively. In order to maintain the type I error for increased
glutamine mortality at 0.025, the final analysis will be performed at a nominal
0.011. The test for glutamine benefit will be performed at completion of the
trial at the traditional 0.025. This proposed approach will maintain an overall
two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 without affecting the power to detect a
glutamine benefit. The slight reduction in power to detect control arm benefit
was considered necessary in order to allow for early stopping if unacceptable
increase in mortality are observed in the glutamine arm. This approach allows an
early assessment of glutamine harm, but will provide a definitive and convincing
study conclusion regardless of the direction of benefit.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2059513117745241">Tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2059513117745241"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2059513117745241"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2059513117745241"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2059513117745241"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2059513117745241"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2059513117745241"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2059513117745241">8</xref> show the power and true type I error

outcome. Our secondary outcome, TTDA within 180 days, is a composite of
survival and hospital length of stay. It treats decedents as if they
remain in hospital forever, by censoring these patients after the
180-day follow-up period. The TTDA will be compared between groups by
the log-rank test which is most efficient under the proportional hazards
assumption but does not require proportional hazards to be valid. The
data from our pilot study (n = 106) was used to estimate the daily
hazard rates of mortality and live discharge while in hospital over the
180-day follow-up period. As suggested by the data, we assumed a
piecewise exponential model with hazard rates of death and discharge
changing weekly for the first two months and then monthly for the
remaining four months. It was confirmed that on average the simulated
control arm had virtually the same TTDA survival distribution as our
pilot data. The experimental arm was then generated by multiplying the
daily control hazards of death and live discharge by fixed HRs across
all study days. The simulation conservatively allowed for a daily hazard
or being LTFU of 0.001 which would accumulate to about 16% if patients
were event-free for the entire 180 days, but resulted in about 5% of
patients being censored before death or live discharge. The estimates
were all based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations.</p></sec><sec id="section24-2059513117745241"><title>Results</title><p>The simulation results are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2059513117745241">Table 9</xref> below. The first two
columns are the parameters set for the simulations, while the remaining
columns are estimated from the simulations. We only present simulations
with no difference in mortality because a significant difference in
mortality would demote time to discharge alive to a secondary
descriptive role. Nevertheless, power would increase if mortality
trended in the same direction as time to discharge among survivors, and
power would decrease in the unlikely scenario that treatment has
opposite effects on mortality and survivor hospital length of stay. For
the &#x02018;True Effect on Time to Hospital Discharge among Survivors&#x02019;, a HR
&#x0003c; 1 indicates longer time in hospital (slower rate of discharge)
while a HR &#x0003e; 1 indicates a shorter hospital stay (faster rate of
discharge). It may be seen that we have adequate power (77%) if the
glutamine arm increased the daily rate of hospital discharge among
survivors by 15% (HR = 1.15) which would decrease the median TTDA by
three days (from 32 days to 29 days). Conversely, we would achieve 87%
power if glutamine reduced the rate of hospital discharge among
survivors by 15% (HR = 0.85) resulting in a six-day increase in median
TTDA from 32 to 38 days.</p><table-wrap id="table9-2059513117745241" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Table 9.</label><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2059513117745241-table9"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">A RandomizEd trial of
