These infections together with schistosomiasis represent more than 40% of the disease burden caused by all tropical diseases, excluding malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the intermittent deworming programmes conducted by the public and private sectors to control intestinal parasitic infections, the prevalence of STH infections is still very high in many developing countries including Malaysia, particularly among rural and Aboriginal children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This situation is not uncommon in developing countries with newly emerging economies where neglected tropical diseases like STH infections are rife in communities that do not receive effective control programmes and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Mass deworming has proved to be an effective public health intervention that reduces worm burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In poor communities with high STH endemicity, treated children are frequently reinfected as a result of their continuous exposure to parasites and the prevalence and intensity of infections could be as high as the pre-treatment situation after a period of six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, there is a need for the development of more cost-effective measures that reduce the disease burden as well as the rates of reinfection. Few previous studies have investigated the effects of trace elements and vitamins on the parasitic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that the delivery of vitamin A capsules and anthelmintic tablets should be simultaneous as worm infections and vitamin A deficiency (VAD) have the same geographical distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in different forms such as retinol and provitamin A carotenoids. It is an essential nutrient for cell proliferation, immune system function and vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is also an important nutrient for the gene expression and excretion of growth hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, vitamin A derivatives play a major role in the development of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Besides that, it helps maintain the integrity of skin and mucus membranes that act as a barrier to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown beneficial effects for vitamin A supplementation on tissue inflammation and innate and adaptive immunity in humans by downregulating inflammatory responses, enhancing immunoglobulin production, promoting the differentiation of T and B cells and modulating cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, very little is known about the effects of vitamin A supplements on STH infections.</p><p>The question posed by the present study was whether vitamin A supplementation would alter parasitosis and protect children from acquiring infections of high intensities. We assumed the following possible scenarios a) restoration of normal vitamin A levels could result in low parasitic reinfection rates throughout the overall improvements in health status of the supplemented children, b) low prevalence with low intensity due to decreased parasite establishment and survival as a result of improvement in the host immune response by vitamin A supplementations, and c) a novel mechanism has been recently reported that an increase in the rate of epithelial cell turnover in the intestine acts like an &#x0201c;epithelial escalator&#x0201d; to expel intestinal parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This was found to be under immune control by the cytokine interleukin-13. Vitamin A may have a dual effect here: as a key element in the functioning of the immune system and as an essential nutrient for epithelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Within this context, this study was carried out to investigate whether vitamin A supplementation can protect Malaysian Aboriginal schoolchildren from acquiring or developing STH infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and subjects</title><p>This study was undertaken in Pos Betau, Pahang, Malaysia.

The school had an enrolment of 502 pupils in grades one to six. There were 405 pupils in the target age range of 7&#x02013;12 years. Of these, 69 were absent at the time of enrolment, 29 refused to participate, and 15 were excluded because they had infections with fever at the time of enrolment. Finally, 292 eligible children received anthelmintics and 250 of them agreed to participate in the intervention part of this study. Data on the socioeconomic status of subjects were also collected using a standard questionnaire. The children were followed up for a period of 6&#x000a0;months as previous studies among Aboriginal children in rural Malaysia revealed that the re-infection rate of STH was high and by 6&#x000a0;months after complete deworming the prevalence and intensity of infections were similar to pre-treatment levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

After baseline screening for the eligibility, examination for STH infections, participants received anthelmintics and were re-examined to ensure complete deworming, 250 children were assigned randomly, using a free on-line randomization programme from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>, into two groups (125 children per group) to receive vitamin A supplements or placebo. The trial was blinded in several ways. For example, the vitamin supplement and placebo capsules were identical in appearance. At the school, neither the person administering the supplements, nor the child receiving the capsule, was aware of the intervention. Faecal samples were coded and the person who processed and examined the specimens were not aware which treatment group any sample corresponded to.</p><p>Albendazole tablets (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) were used in this study as the anthelmintic treatment and the regime used was a 3-day course of 400&#x000a0;mg/daily. Each white chewable tablet contains 400&#x000a0;mg albendazole as the active ingredient. Tablets were provided in white, well sealed plastic bottles containing 100 tablets each. Each child chewed the tablet before swallowing it with some water, while being observed by a researcher, medical officer, and a teacher (Direct Observed Therapy). The efficacy of the treatment was assessed after 12&#x02013;14 days and children who were still infected were treated again with a single dose of albendazole 400&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin A supplements and placebos were provided by Tablets (India) Ltd (Chennai, India) and were gelatinous and reddish opaque capsules containing 200,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin A in 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L peanut oil with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin E as a preservative or identical capsules containing the 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L peanut oil with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g vitamin E only. The capsules were provided in identical, dark brown and well sealed glass bottles containing 50 capsules each. The content of vitamin A in supplement capsules was confirmed and the capsules were encoded (A and B), the code was kept confidential by personnel who were not involved in the study, when the study ended the code was broken. Each child received the capsule of the relevant group under a direct observed therapy. The dose was followed by two pieces of freshly fried banana (locally known as Pisang Goreng), which is rich in oil that provides a perfect medium for vitamin A absorption and ensures maximum utilization of the capsule&#x02019;s contents. In addition, these fried bananas are a favourite snack in Malaysia and were readily accepted by the recruited children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University of Malaya Medical Centre, University of Malaya, Malaysia. Due to the high rate of illiteracy among these communities, the committee approved the verbal consent procedures instead of the signed informed consent. During the visits to the school and the villages, community meetings were held with the headmaster of the school, the heads of the villages, the parents and their school-age children before the commencement of the study in order to give a clear explanation of the objectives of the study. By marking in the lists of students&#x02019; names, informed verbal consents were obtained from the participants and their parents and the final lists were witnessed by the headmaster and the heads of the villages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Parasitology</title><p>Fresh faecal samples were collected at baseline, after deworming and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months after the interventions.

In order to avoid bias and violation of power of the study due to missing data after randomization, intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze the effects of interventions on STH reinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The main impact of STH infections is their association with malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), which may have effects at the community level with regard to work and productivity in adults and growth, learning and school performance in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As recommended by the WHO, vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets are distributed together by control programmes in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, very little is known about the effects of vitamin A supplements on STH infections. We investigated the effects of vitamin A supplementations (mega-dose; 200,000&#x000a0;IU) on the STH reinfection.</p><p>The findings of this study showed that the reinfection rate of STH after three months was high and almost similar in both groups where almost half of the children were reinfected with at least one species of STH. The same situation continued with the findings at 6&#x000a0;months where almost 80% of the children were reinfected. The findings showed that the reinfection rates of STH were similar among the children in both groups suggesting that there was no protective effect for vitamin A supplementations against STH reinfection in these children. This could be due to the very high reinfection rates and the suggested explanation was that continuous exposure to the infective stages of STH was the major determinant of risk of helminth reinfection while nutritional factors were believed to modulate rather than eliminate susceptibility to reinfection. Previous studies revealed an alarmingly high prevalence of STH infections among Aboriginal schoolchildren in rural Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, there were no significant differences in the intensities of STH reinfection between the two groups at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. Findings after 3&#x000a0;months showed that the mean epg of <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>Trichuris</italic> and hookworm were significantly different from the baseline findings. This could be due to biological determinants rather than the effects of the supplements as the placebo group also showed the same differences. Besides endemicity, the deposition of eggs for each female worm per day varies according to the type of worm. It is known that the adult <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> female worm produces approximately 250,000 eggs per day. A much lower number, 3,000-25,000, is produced by the <italic>T. trichiura</italic> female while the hookworm female produces between 3,000-6,000 in the case of <italic>Necator americanus</italic> and 10,000-30,000 by <italic>Ancylostoma duodenalis</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The egg output of these worms was found to be related to the stage of maturity, age of the worm and number of worms in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This present study showed that the total mean epg of <italic>Ascaris</italic> reinfection after six months was very close to the pre-treatment mean epg (14,113 compared to 17,978) and this figure was higher than in <italic>Trichuris</italic> and hookworm. The higher reinfection rate by six months and higher egg deposition of <italic>Ascaris</italic> could be the possible reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Two-thirds of these children had mixed infections (co-infections), which may affect the bioavailability of vitamin A throughout the period of study. However, the prevalence of co-infections was similar in both groups as a result of the randomization process. Moreover, the reinfection rates of individual helminth species and co-infections among children were found to be similar in both groups at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months assessments, when adjusted to the co-infection status at baseline.</p><p>Comparing these findings with other reports elsewhere, a previous study assessed the benefit of a high-dose of vitamin A supplementation on reinfections with <italic>Ascaris</italic> after deworming among 328 indigenous pre-school children in Panama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although their study provides evidence that combined vitamin A supplementation and deworming reduces <italic>Ascaris</italic> reinfections in children, the lack of a control group to compare the effects of the supplements limits the interpretation of the results. Moreover, the higher prevalence of mixed infections coupled with the higher intensities of infections reported in our cohort may contribute to the non-significant effects of the supplement. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effect of vitamin A and zinc supplementation on <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> infections showed that the infections were reduced significantly among children who received combined vitamin A and zinc compared with those who received either vitamin A or zinc alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This study was conducted among children aged below two years and the prevalence of <italic>Ascaris</italic> (28.0%) was low compared to our study. Moreover, a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of new parasitic infections, especially with <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, among Brazilian children who received 100,000- 200,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin A at enrollment, 4 and 8&#x000a0;months, and followed for 36&#x000a0;months when compared to those who received placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The effects of different micronutrient supplementations on the intestinal parasitic reinfections were investigated. Previous studies found no significant effect for zinc supplementation on the intestinal parasitic reinfections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A positive impact for iron supplementations on helminths reinfection rates was also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Adults supplemented with 60&#x000a0;mg elemental iron twice-weekly for 12&#x000a0;months had significantly lower reinfection rates of <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> compared to adults given placebos. However, iron supplementation had no effect on reinfection intensities in adults. Besides its important role in the functioning of the immune system, iron supplements may result in unfavourable conditions in the host gut that stimulate the parasites expulsion. Oral iron supplementations are given at least 3&#x000a0;days a week and have enough time to produce such unfavourable conditions but this is unlikely with a mega-dose of vitamin A supplementation that is distributed only once every 6&#x000a0;months. While our results showed that vitamin A supplementation does not have an added benefit on STH infections, regular deworming and vitamin A supplementation may have positive impacts on STH infections and VAD, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The prevalence and reinfection rates of STH were found to be very high among Aboriginal children in rural Malaysia, undermining the efforts of deworming programmes. Vitamin A supplementation showed no positive impact on STH reinfection rates and intensities and this could be due to the high endemicity of these helminths in this community. Orang Asli children are living in the same conditions and have the same epidemiological characteristics for the STH infections, malnutrition and vitamin A status. Therefore, these findings can be generalized to other Orang Asli children in other states. These findings speak for implementing innovative and integrated measures to control STH infections. Long-term interventions to reduce poverty will help significantly in reducing this continuing problem and there is no doubt that reducing intestinal parasitic infection would have a positive impact on the health, nutrition and education of these children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>HMA was involved in all phases of the study, including study design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation, and write-up of the manuscript.
