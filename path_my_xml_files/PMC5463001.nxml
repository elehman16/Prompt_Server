This study was conducted between March 2010 and October 2013 in the Retinal Department of Farabi Eye Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Review Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and all individuals provided us with written informed consent prior to participation.</p><p>Patients were clinically diagnosed by the presence of an active white and bright focal retinal lesion with blurred margins with or without dark retinochoroidal scars. Confirmation was obtained by serum IgG and IgM antibody against <italic>T. gondii</italic> in all patients. The inclusion criteria were age between 16 and 75 years and lesions that matched the modified criteria formulated by Holland and associates; [1] a lesion within 3000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m from the foveal center (zone 1) or [2] a lesion &#x0003e;2 disc diameters in size with 3&#x02013;4 (+) vitreous inflammation within the region beyond the borders of zone 1 (zones 2 and 3).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>The exclusion criteria were the presence of other ocular diseases including other causes of uveitis, glaucoma, any retinal lesion, and systemic conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, pregnancy, and any history of hypersensitivity to azithromycin and Sulfonamides, immunosuppression especially HIV or consumption of immunosuppressive drugs, history of any previous adverse drug reaction, corticosteroid treatment within 1 month prior to visit, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) less than 20/400 (1.3 logMAR) on the Snellen chart in either eye.</p><p>A total of 36 patients were clinically diagnosed with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, 5 patients used steroid drugs due to systemic diseases so they received the classic treatment, and 4 patients were lost to follow-up. Finally, using block randomization, 27 patients completed the study. Fourteen patients were treated with oral azithromycin, and 13 patients were treated with oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The first group received 500&#x000a0;mg as a loading dose for one day followed by azithromycin 250&#x000a0;mg daily. In the second group, treatment included trimethoprim (160&#x000a0;mg)/sulfamethoxazole (800&#x000a0;mg) twice daily. Both groups were assigned to treatment for 6&#x02013;12 weeks. Both groups received oral prednisone 1&#x000a0;mg/kg daily from the third day, and the dose was tapered over 2 weeks based on vitritis control.</p><p>A masked ophthalmologist examined patients on day 1 and then after 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. The patients were observed for at least 9 months after treatment completion. On each visit, BCVA was measured with a Snellen chart (converted to the logMAR) for all patients, and anterior vitreous inflammation was estimated according to the system devised by Kimura et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> which is the base of SUN group for uveitis classification. Fundus examination was done using a slit-lamp with a 90-diopter lens and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Goldmann applanation tonometry was also performed. Fundus photographs, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and infrared reflectance (IR) imaging were taken on day one and then after 4 and 12 weeks of therapy (Retinal Angiography system, HRA2; Heidelberg Engineering, Dossenheim, Germany). Computer-assisted measurement of the initial and final lesion size was done in square millimeter on fundus photography, IR, and FAF using the Digimizer (version 4.2.2) image analysis software (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). This digital analyzer also measured the ratio of the lesion area to disc area in each patient's FAF. A change in the lesion size was calculated from these measurements. If the active lesion was adjacent to the old scar, the lesion size was generally considered as one lesion, while in 6 patients in which the active lesion was far from the old scar, the active lesion and old scar were calculated separately.</p><p>By definition, successful treatment was achieved when the lesion border became sharp with or without pigmentation or scar formation and when the absent or trace of inflammatory activity in the anterior chamber and the vitreous was also noted. A change in treatment to intravitreal clindamycin was considered for patients who still had active retinal lesions, dense vitreous inflammation, or both despite treatment for 4 complete weeks.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The percentage of patients with successful treatment outcome in each group and lesion size reduction were considered as primary outcome measures. The BCVA, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation status, number and size of satellite lesions before and after treatment, any correlation between the lesion size and satellite lesion, and adverse drug reactions were secondary outcome measures. Each patient was asked about compliance with the treatment regimen and any adverse event in every follow-up session. Bilirubin level in each follow-up was also measured. In this study, the accuracy of fundus photography, FAF, and IR in the detection of satellite lesions was also compared.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data normality was confirmed using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test.

Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was also used to compare BCVA and lesion size before and after treatment. This test also was used to compare the accuracy of fundus photography, FAF, and IR in detection of satellite lesions before and after treatment in each group, to evaluate the reduction in the number of satellite lesions in each group, and to investigate any correlation between the number of satellite lesions and the lesion size before treatment. <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-seven patients including 14 patients in the azithromycin and 13 patients in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group were evaluated.

A combination of host, parasitic, and environmental factors affect the severity of ocular toxoplasmosis, making it difficult to clearly identify the characteristics of the ideal drug for ocular toxoplasmosis.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The effectiveness of different treatment regimens for ocular toxoplasmosis is difficult to evaluate because ocular toxoplasmosis varies widely in clinical presentation, location of the lesions, and severity of inflammation. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is probably most effective against toxoplasmosis and therefore recommended as the standard treatment for sight-threatening ocular toxoplasmosis. However, a combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is reported to be a good alternative to standard therapy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Our study revealed no significant difference between treatment with azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for ocular toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis in terms of vision improvement, vitreous inflammation, duration of treatment, sharpness of lesions, reduction of the lesion size, and satellite lesions.</p><p>In accordance with Bosch-Driessen et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> we determined the dose of azithromycin based on two in&#x000a0;vitro studies showing that the concentration of azithromycin in the brain tissue of patients with brain tumors reached a level of 3.64&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.81&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g 48&#x000a0;hrs after the administration of 500&#x000a0;mg azithromycin.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This value is between the IC 50 and IC 90 (50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations, respectively) for parasite growth in the presence of pyrimethamine. However, this concentration of azithromycin clearly reached the IC 50 for parasite growth when used alone in the same study<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and also can pass blood retinal barrier.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>In our study, the response to treatment measured by a change in BCVA revealed a non-significant difference between the treatment groups with a 0.24 logMAR improvement in the azithromycin group and a 0.30 logMAR improvement in patients receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In our study, 25.9% of the patients had BCVA higher than 0.4 logMAR after treatment. In a study by Soheilian et&#x000a0;al, the patients in the classic therapy group improved by 0.56 logMAR and patients receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole improved by 0.52 logMAR.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In a study by Bosch-Driessen et&#x000a0;al, an improvement of at least 0.5 logMAR in visual acuity was noted in 21% of the patients receiving azithromycin and 28% of the patients receiving sulfadiazine.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>Neither the duration of the inflammatory activity of the retinochoroidal lesions or vitritis nor the change in the size of retinal lesions on FAF during treatment showed a significant difference between the azithromycin and the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole groups that could be explained by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) death due to inflammation, which is not reversible with treatment. The mean reduction in the size of retinal lesions on FAF was 24% in the azithromycin group and 35.5% in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group. In a similar prospective study by Soheilian et&#x000a0;al, the mean reduction in the size of retinal lesions was 61% in the classic therapy group and 59% in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In a study by Bosch-Driessen et&#x000a0;al, the mean reduction in the size of retinal lesions was 41% in both groups of treatment with classic therapy group and azithromycin plus pyrimethamine group.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Less reduction in the size of the lesions on FAF in our study was probably due to summation of the size of the previous scar with the new lesion in 19 (70.45%) patients in whom the new lesions were on or just close to the old scar, so it was not possible to measure the lesion size separately.</p><p>We also found an analogous effect in terms of vitreous inflammatory response in both treatment groups. Twelve weeks after the treatment, the signs of vitreous inflammation resolved in 50% of the patients receiving azithromycin therapy and 76.9% of the patients on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In a prospective study by Soheilian et&#x000a0;al, at the end of 6 weeks therapy, the resolution of vitreous inflammation was observed in 56.7% of the patients on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Bosch-Driessen et&#x000a0;al reported the resolution of vitreous inflammation in 71% of their patients who were treated with classic therapy and 70% of their patients in the azithromycin plus pyrimethamine therapy group.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The higher clearance of vitreous inflammation in this study may be due to the effect of combination therapy with azithromycin plus pyrimethamine.</p><p>In our study, a previous retinal scar was noted in 19 (70.4%) out of 27 patients. Rothova et&#x000a0;al and Bosch-Driessen reported that 69% and 60% of their patients had previous retinal scars, respectively.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This finding is different from the results of the study by Soheilian et&#x000a0;al in which 50.8% of the patients did not have any old scars.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Our serologic investigation showed that only 29.6% of our patients had positive IgM titers.</p><p>The analysis of the photographs disclosed that sharpening of retinal lesions occurred within 4 weeks.</p><p>Our study revealed that FAF showed significantly more retinal toxoplasmosis satellite lesions in comparison with IR and fundus photography. By using FAF some very small satellite lesions were discovered which could not be determined in routine fundus photography. This finding shows that RPE dysfunction in FAF may occur before morphologic changes on fundus photography. Moreover, it revealed that there was no significant difference between either treatment groups in decreasing satellite lesions within treatment.</p><p>We noticed no previously described severe side effects. We found no significant difference in severe adverse drug reactions between treatment groups; the side effects were limited to bilirubin elevation to 14&#x000a0;mg/dl in 1 case (7.6%) in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy group and fixed drug eruption in 3 patients (23%). In a study by Rothova et&#x000a0;al, the rate of adverse drug reactions in patients receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was only 4%.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Another study by Bosch-Driessen et&#x000a0;al showed adverse drug reactions in 33% of the patients receiving pyrimethamine and azithromycin.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The different rate of adverse drug reactions in this study may be due to using pyrimethamine. Konstantinos Balaskas et&#x000a0;al reported that no patients receiving azithromycin developed adverse drug reactions while one patient developed a skin rash 45 days after starting treatment with sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine. All patients who received sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine reported weak treatment tolerance, with symptoms being malaise, dizziness, headaches, and gastrointestinal disorders.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Soheilian et&#x000a0;al found that adverse drug reactions were limited to 1 case (3.4%) in the classic therapy group and 1 patient (3.3%) receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>Our study had several limitations. The small sample size of our study was the most important limitation. Small differences between the two groups may not be detected by this sample size. Therefore, it should be kept in mind that this study was rather a pilot investigation, and larger clinical trials are warranted to confirm the results. In addition, the single-blind design of our study was potentially a source of bias, although the routine examiner was masked to treatment regimes. Also, we did not have a control group of patients treated with standard regimen of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.</p><p>In summary, the positive response of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis to azithromycin was shown by visual improvement, lesion size, sharpening of margins of the lesions, and reduction of satellite lesions. Although there was no significant difference in time to respond to treatment between the 2 treatment groups, the difference may be clinically important. On the basis of our findings, treatment with azithromycin could be an appropriate alternative to treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and therefore, it might be an acceptable choice instead of standard treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for ocular toxoplasmosis if confirmed with further large scale studies. Treatment with azithromycin is, however, better tolerated and has fewer side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref
