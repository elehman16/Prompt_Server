This trial investigates the use of motivational mobile phone text messages (SMS) to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) over six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>CAMPS was a single-site randomized two-arm parallel design trial in Yaound&#x000e9;, Cameroon. We enrolled and randomized HIV-positive adults on ART, aged 21 years and above to receive a weekly standardized motivational text message versus usual care alone. The primary outcome was adherence measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS), number of doses missed (in the week preceding the interview) and pharmacy refill data. Outcomes were measured at 3 and 6 months. Service providers and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Between November and December 2010, 200 participants were randomized, with 101 in the intervention group and 99 in the control group. At 6 months, overall retention was 81.5%. We found no significant effect on adherence by VAS&#x0003e;95% (risk ratio [RR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89, 1.29; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.542; reported missed doses (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87, 1.16; p&#x0003e;0.999) or number of pharmacy refills (mean difference [MD] 0.1, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.43; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.617. One participant in the intervention arm reported a possible disclosure of status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Standardized motivational mobile phone text messages did not significantly improve adherence to ART in this study.

One technology that is widely used in resource-limited settings is the mobile telephone, as they are more reliable and less cumbersome than landlines <xref rid="pone.0046909-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Even though private ownership and use of mobile phones is not as widespread as in other more developed countries <xref rid="pone.0046909-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, Africa has shown great uptake of mobile phone technology <xref rid="pone.0046909-LesterR1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For example, between 2000 and 2005 mobile phone subscriptions in Cameroon increased by 270% per annum <xref rid="pone.0046909-Keutchankeu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In 2008, 37% of the adult population owned a mobile phone <xref rid="pone.0046909-Gillwald1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Given the aforementioned trend in mobile phone subscriptions it is reasonable to infer that a large majority of the adult population now own and use mobile phones. However, ownership is higher in urban areas <xref rid="pone.0046909-Keutchankeu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The potential for text messages to improve health outcomes in resource limited settings is still being explored. In South Africa, SMS text messages have been used to improve HIV health care service delivery by improving communication between patients and health personnel, and also as an appointment reminder <xref rid="pone.0046909-MukundBahadur1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Two clinical trials in Kenya have evaluated the benefits of using mobile phone text message reminders to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The WelTel trial reported improvements in adherence and viral load <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, a second reported an improvement in adherence and a reduction in treatment interruptions <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A recent Cochrane systematic review summarized the evidence described in these two Kenyan trials <xref rid="pone.0046909-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The WHO recommends more research on adherence to long-term therapies because poor adherence leads to poor health and increased health costs <xref rid="pone.0046909-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the evidence on mobile phone text messaging to improve adherence to ART in developing countries is limited to one country (Kenya).</p><p>Given the importance of understanding the effectiveness of interventions to improve retention and adherence among people living with HIV in Africa, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the utility of weekly motivational SMS texts on improving adherence and other important outcomes among a representative sample of HIV-positive adults in Cameroon.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of our trial was to test the effectiveness of sending weekly motivational text messages via mobile phone versus no text messaging to improve adherence, measured using a VAS, the number of missed doses and pharmacy refills among HIV positive patients over a 6-month period at the Accredited Treatment Centre (ACT) of the Yaound&#x000e9; Central Hospital (YCH). This is a busy urban treatment centre in Yaound&#x000e9;, the capital city of Cameroon.</p><p>Our secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects on weight, body mass index (BMI), opportunistic infections (OI), CD4-positive-T-lymphocyte count, viral load, quality of life (QOL) measured using the SF-12 QOL assessment form <xref rid="pone.0046909-SF1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, all-cause mortality, retention in care, adverse events and patient satisfaction. Subgroups of interest included age group, gender, level of education and treatment regimen.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We report here a brief overview of the methods. Details can be obtained from the published protocol <xref rid="pone.0046909-Mbuagbaw1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Using a parallel group design, eligible and consenting patients were randomized to intervention and control arms with a 1&#x02236;1 allocation ratio.

The adult prevalence of HIV in Cameroon was 5.3% in 2009 <xref rid="pone.0046909-UNICEF1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The YCH is a referral hospital with a capacity of 381 beds, and staffed by 95 doctors and 270 nurses <xref rid="pone.0046909-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The ATC registers approximately 40 new cases per week and caters to approximately 6500 regular clients. It is the largest HIV/AIDS management clinic in Cameroon and enabled rapid recruitment.</p><p>We included subjects who were aged above 21 years; owned a mobile phone; who could read text messages; and who had been on ART for at least one month. Only those who provided informed consent, orally and in writing were allowed to participate.</p><p>We excluded individuals who had been on ART for less than one month at the time of enrollment, and were aged less than 21 years. Participants who had used ART for at least one month were chosen so that we could obtain a baseline adherence rate which we used to evaluate the success of randomization along with the other baseline covariates.</p><p>Participants were enrolled from the waiting rooms of the YCH ATC from the 22 November to the 22 December, 2010. The purpose of the trial was explained to consenting participants and baseline data were collected. Immediately after enrolment, trial codes and phone numbers were sequentially linked to predetermined allocation codes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the Cameroon National Ethics Committee (authorization number 172/CNE/SE/2010). All participants included in the study provided both verbal and written consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>We sent a short text message to each participant in the intervention (SMS) group, once a week, in either French or English, based on the participant's language preference. Messages were developed based on data collected from focus group discussions <xref rid="pone.0046909-Mbuagbaw2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and the health belief model of behavior change <xref rid="pone.0046909-Maimen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The content of the message was motivational, with a reminder component. The message also contained a phone number that they could call back if they needed help. The content was varied and contemporary (e.g. messages would contain season's greetings) so as to retain participants' attention throughout the study period and to explore the various aspects of behavior change. An example of a message would be, &#x0201c;You are important to your family. Please remember to take your medication. You can call us at this number: +237 xxxx xxxx.&#x0201d; The messages made no mention of HIV. We used a series of 11 messages that were changed every week. The program secretary used a list of phone numbers disclosed after randomization. One message was sent every week on Wednesdays at 9:00 am and the &#x0201c;delivery report&#x0201d; function of the mobile phone was used to determine if the message was actually received and opened. Text messaging was an add-on to usual care that includes regular ART counseling and home visits determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In the control (no SMS) group, participants received only usual care. They did not receive any text messages, but they were interviewed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Data on satisfaction was collected only for the intervention arm, as it would have been inappropriate to ask people who did not receive text messages if they were satisfied with the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Our primary outcome was adherence, measured using three methods: a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); Self Report (SR); and Pharmacy Refill Data (PRD). Our Secondary outcomes were clinical: weight, body mass index (BMI), opportunistic infections (OI); QOL: Measured using the SF-12 QOL assessment form <xref rid="pone.0046909-SF1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; all cause mortality and retention in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>Our study was designed to detect a 20% increase in adherence in the intervention arm. Sample size was calculated using WINPEPI (PEPI- for-windows) version 9.5 software <xref rid="pone.0046909-Abramson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Details of the assumptions used to arrive at a sample of 198, taking into account an attrition rate of 20% are reported in the protocol <xref rid="pone.0046909-Mbuagbaw1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In brief, the study had 80% power to detect a statistically significant relative risk (alpha set at &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) using a two-tailed chi-squared test and assuming 60% and 80% adherence rates in the control and intervention groups respectively. Based on other studies using SMS to improve adherence <xref rid="pone.0046909-Strandbygaard1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and reported adherence rates in Cameroon <xref rid="pone.0046909-Kouanfack1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, it was estimated that at least a 20% increase in adherence was necessary to achieve adherence rates above 95%.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomization, allocation concealment and implementation</title><p>Using a parallel group design, eligible and consenting patients were randomized to intervention and control arms with a 1&#x02236;1 allocation ratio. A computer generated randomization list was established using random block sizes of 2, 4 and 6, by the Father Sean O'Sullivan Research Centre Biostatistics Unit at St Joseph's Healthcare/McMaster University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thecem.net/sjhsrn.php">http://www.thecem.net/sjhsrn.php</ext-link>) in Canada. The allocation codes were then sequentially affixed to the phone numbers of consecutively recruited participants by trained research staff at the YCH ATC. This sequence was sent to the research centre by email, and concealed in a password-protected computer until interventions were assigned.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Blinding</title><p>Trained interviewers &#x02013; blinded to group allocation &#x02013; collected data using a pre-tested data collection form containing socio-demographic data, clinical information and adherence rates at baseline, 3 and 6 months. From the point of enrollment, patients were identified only by their phone numbers and their sequential trial numbers. The interviewers transmitted the phone numbers of the enrollees to the research staff. The research staff responsible for allocation had access to the allocation codes and the phone numbers of participants. The program secretary responsible for sending the text messages received the allocations (SMS or No SMS) and corresponding phone numbers weekly. The data analyst was also blinded to group allocation. Only the participants were aware of their allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We adopted the intention-to-treat principle to analyze all outcomes, meaning that data from participants was analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized irrespective of whether they actually received the intervention. We also used multiple imputation techniques to handle missing data <xref rid="pone.0046909-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Variables for which there was too much missing data to perform imputation were excluded from the analysis but are reported (CD4-T-lymphocyte cell count and viral load). All outcome variables had some degree of missing data ranging from 0 to 35%. Multiple imputation was used to create a new data set which was the average of five data sets of imputed values. This final data set was used for all analyses. We used the t-test to compare groups on continuous outcomes and the chi-squared test for binary outcomes. All statistical tests were performed using two-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance. The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for testing of secondary outcomes. For group comparisons, the results are expressed as mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes, corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and associated p-values. Adjusted analyses using baseline covariates (age, gender, educational level, duration on ART, HIV staging, BMI and the presence of an OI) were performed using standard binary logistic regression techniques to investigate the residual impact of these characteristics on the primary outcome. We included the interaction term for the intervention variable and the following covariates: age group, gender, level of education and regimen. These covariates are reported to affect adherence rates to ART <xref rid="pone.0046909-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by examining the residuals for model assumptions and the Hosmer and Lemeshow test of goodness-of-fit. The p-values for the interaction terms are reported. All analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 16.0 for Windows and WINPEPI <xref rid="pone.0046909-Abramson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Recruitment, baseline data and participant flow</title><p>Between November and December 2010, 228 patients were approached for enrollment. Twenty declined to participate and 8 did not meet the eligibility criteria. Two hundred participants were randomized to either the SMS intervention arm (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;101) or the control arm (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;99). One participant in the intervention arm withdrew due to loss of privacy. Initial retention in the trial for both arms at 6 months was 42% (participants who came for scheduled clinic visits), but increased to 82% (after a phone call inviting them to come for a final interview). Participants were followed up from December 2010 to May 2011, when the intervention was stopped. During this period, we received 99 phone calls and 55 text messages (154 responses) from 48 participants in the intervention arm.

This trial was unique in that it was the first to report the effect of an SMS intervention on ART adherence among treatment experienced patients in Africa. Two recent trials in Kenya demonstrated improved ART adherence among patients initiating ART, but used different intervention protocols <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Our study had some important limitations. Firstly, our primary measures of adherence (by interviews) might have resulted in overestimates of the true adherence rate <xref rid="pone.0046909-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and the adherence reported for the last week may not adequately reflect adherence behaviors over longer periods because patients may become more adherent in the few days preceding their appointment <xref rid="pone.0046909-Cramer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, pharmacy refill data showed similar findings to self-reports. The trial design did not interfere with patient care by providing medication or lab tests so there are large amounts of missing data for CD4-positive-T-lymphocyte count and viral load. Drug stock-outs were also frequent in the last two months of the trial. This may explain why some participants missed their scheduled appointments. Importantly, participants in the control arm were not prohibited from using other reminder methods, so additional benefits may have been difficult to detect. Previous studies conducted in the same parent population suggest that up to 25% have systematic reminder methods <xref rid="pone.0046909-Mbuagbaw2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Finally, our sample size was powered to detect a 20% difference in adherence between both arms. The difference we found was much less.</p><p>Our findings should be interpreted in light of the published trials in Kenya <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, which show some improved adherence rates after twelve months, also reported in a Cochrane review synthesizing data from both trials <xref rid="pone.0046909-Horvath1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The interventions evaluated were somewhat different. While our trial used motivational messages, with the intention to produce a change in adherence behavior, and no compulsory feedback, the Weltel trial used a simple SMS inquiry on the participants' health and was therefore interactive <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The second trial used short and long one-way messages: the longer message with encouraging content, but no option for feedback <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Even though we used optional feedback, we did not detect any improvements in adherence. Only 48 participants in the intervention arm used the feedback option. We also used weekly messages like the Kenyan trials, but did not observe any significant benefits. Both Kenyan trials ran for up to one year, while our trial ended at 6 months. The duration of our trial might not have been sufficient to observe a significant effect.</p><p>Another important difference is the fact that both Kenyan trials enrolled participants who had recently initiated ART <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The median duration on ART at baseline in this study was 31 and 22 months for the intervention and control groups respectively. This may also explain the negative results, since duration on ART has been shown to have negative effects on adherence to ART in Cameroon <xref rid="pone.0046909-Roux1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We speculate that the SMS may be more effective in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve populations. While the risk of disclosure of status has been mentioned in some studies <xref rid="pone.0046909-Shet1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, this is the first study documenting a case of withdrawal for privacy reasons. In Cameroon, there is still a lot of stigma associated with HIV, and it is a known cause of poor adherence <xref rid="pone.0046909-Boyer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although we did not include the term &#x0201c;HIV&#x0201d; in the content of the text messages, we did include &#x0201c;medications&#x0201d; and gave a clinic number which could arouse suspicion by non-participants reading the message. Interestingly, we had a very high proportion of clients in this study who reported having disclosed their status to their families. This may have reflected a selection bias for enrolment, and larger benefits may have been observed in individuals who do not realize the support of disclosing. Confidentiality and disclosure are important considerations for the scale-up of text message interventions <xref rid="pone.0046909-Thirumurthy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>High levels of satisfaction have been documented in other text message trials, particularly in those which offer two way communication <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. While the majority of participants in our trial were satisfied with the text messages, a considerable number did not want the intervention to continue. A study conducted prior to this trial reported that patients would like to receive messages with a wide variety of characteristics in terms of timing, content and source <xref rid="pone.0046909-Mbuagbaw2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Some participants might not have wanted to continue if the messages weren't tailored to their needs. Yet, more than 80% would recommend it to their friends. Further research is needed on how best to tailor text messages. It is unclear whether the content of the message played a role in the outcomes, as other trials with no motivational component have reported improvements in adherence <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046909-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The ancillary analyses reported above need to be considered as secondary and therefore interpreted with caution in the light of our main findings.</p><p>In conclusion, motivational text messages did not significantly improve adherence to ART among treatment experienced patients in Cameroon after 6 months. Although interactive SMS associated with access to health advice has demonstrated to be effective in at least one large clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0046909-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and is reflected in current guidelines <xref rid="pone.0046909-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> more work needs to be done to determine how motivational content can be delivered by SMS alone. Text messages may come with a small risk of disclosure of status. Further trials are critical to determine what interventions should be taken to scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0046909.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
