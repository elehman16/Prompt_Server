Attacks are unpredictable, debilitating, and have a significant impact on quality of life. Patients may be prescribed prophylactic therapy to prevent angioedema attacks. Current prophylactic treatments may be difficult to administer (i.e., intravenously), require frequent administrations or are not well tolerated, and breakthrough attacks may still occur frequently. Lanadelumab is a subcutaneously-administered monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in clinical development for prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks. A Phase 1b study supported its efficacy in preventing attacks. A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study has been completed and an open-label extension is currently ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The primary objective of the open-label extension is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated subcutaneous administrations of lanadelumab in patients with type I/II HAE. Secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy and time to first angioedema attack to determine outer bounds of the dosing interval. The study will also evaluate immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, quality of life, characteristics of breakthrough attacks, ease of self-administration, and safety/efficacy in patients who switch to lanadelumab from another prophylactic therapy. The open-label extension will enroll patients who completed the double-blind study (&#x0201c;rollover patients&#x0201d;) and those who did not participate in the double-blind study (&#x0201c;non-rollover patients&#x0201d;), which includes patients who may or may not be currently using another prophylactic therapy. Rollover patients will receive a single 300&#x000a0;mg dose of lanadelumab on Day 0 and the second dose after the patient&#x02019;s first confirmed angioedema attack. Thereafter, lanadelumab will be administered every 2&#x000a0;weeks. Non-rollover patients will receive 300&#x000a0;mg lanadelumab every 2&#x000a0;weeks regardless of the first attack. All patients will receive their last dose on Day 350 (maximum of 26 doses), and will then undergo a 4-week follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Prevention of attacks can reduce the burden of illness associated with HAE. Prophylactic therapy requires extended, repeated dosing and the results of this study will provide important data on the long-term safety and efficacy of lanadelumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HAE.</p><p>

It is characterized by recurrent debilitating attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal edema, most often affecting the face, gastrointestinal tract, extremities, genitalia, and larynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Patients experience symptoms of localized swelling and pain. HAE type I and type II are caused by a deficiency in the quantity or functional activity of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), which results in dysregulation of plasma kallikrein activity and excessive release of the vasodilator bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">As angioedema attacks are unpredictable, and those affecting the larynx can be life-threatening, one treatment strategy for HAE involves the use of prophylactic agents to prevent angioedema attacks. Current long-term prophylactic therapies include the replacement of C1-INH with plasma-derived C1-INH or treatment with attenuated androgens (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, C1-INH replacement requires frequent intravenous administration, which may be inconvenient and difficult for some patients, and androgens are limited by a poor safety profile, especially for female and pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Current therapeutics for long-term prophylaxis in HAE</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Prophylactic treatment</th><th align="left">Route of administration</th><th align="left">Dosing frequency</th><th align="left">Efficacy</th><th align="left">Safety</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Plasma-derived C1-INH</td><td align="left">Intravenous</td><td align="left">Every 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days</td><td align="left">Effective in reducing attack rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]<break/>Breakthrough attacks still reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td><td align="left">Risk of thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]<break/>No safety concerns in patients treated with up to 2500 U [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Androgens</td><td align="left">Oral</td><td align="left">Daily</td><td align="left">Treatment associated with significantly fewer and less severe attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]<break/>Breakthrough attacks still reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</td><td align="left">Most common side effects: weight gain, virilization, headaches, myalgia, mood changes, menstrual disorders, liver dysfunction, increased serum lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]<break/>Contraindicated in pediatrics and during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tranexamic acid</td><td align="left">Oral</td><td align="left">Daily</td><td align="left">Not licensed for long-term prophylaxis, although often used for this indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]<break/>Efficacy unconfirmed.

An evaluation of lanadelumab over an extended period is valuable, as real-world use of lanadelumab would involve ongoing, repeated dosing. To date, clinical studies for lanadelumab have not indicated any safety concerns and have suggested preliminary data for efficacy in preventing angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. In a Phase 1a study, 32 healthy volunteers received a single dose of lanadelumab (dose range 6.2&#x02013;302&#x000a0;mg) or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All doses were well tolerated, there were no deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations owing to adverse events, and treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between subjects who received lanadelumab and those who received placebo. None of the subjects were positive for anti-drug antibodies. In a Phase 1b study, patients with HAE received two doses of lanadelumab (30, 100, 300 or 400&#x000a0;mg) or placebo, administered 14&#x000a0;days apart. The rate of adverse events was similar in lanadelumab-treated patients compared with those who received placebo, and the results of other safety outcome measures showed that lanadelumab was safe up to 400&#x000a0;mg. Non-neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were detected in a total of two patients: one in the 30&#x000a0;mg dose group, and one in the 400&#x000a0;mg dose group. Furthermore, the attack rate was reduced by 100 and 88% in patients who received 300&#x000a0;mg and 400&#x000a0;mg lanadelumab, respectively, relative to placebo. The reduction in attack rate coincided with drug exposure and a decrease in cleaved HMWK levels, providing proof of concept for the mechanism of action of lanadelumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">The double-blind study will assess the efficacy and safety of lanadelumab over 26&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Following the double-blind study, results from the open-label extension study will confirm findings on safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic effect from prior clinical studies. By delaying the second dose for rollover patients until the first attack has occurred, the study design incorporates a unique feature to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of lanadelumab. However, the design is not adaptable in that individual adjustments in the dosing interval will not be made based upon each patient&#x02019;s response. The open-label extension study will also assess the safety, efficacy, and impact on quality of life of lanadelumab for patients who are currently using other long-term prophylactic therapies. Patients with HAE have a strong preference for self-administration of therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and the open-label extension study will evaluate patients&#x02019; experience with self-administration of lanadelumab. This will help to assess treatment burden and potential ease and convenience of lanadelumab therapy.</p><p id="Par90">A recognized potential limitation of this study, as for any controlled clinical trial with established inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment, is the possibility of investigator bias introduced by study patient selection. Some degree of selection bias may inherently be introduced as part of the study enrollment process. These potential limitations will be acknowledged and addressed as part of the Discussion when results are available.</p><p id="Par91">Although current prophylactic treatments for HAE may be effective at reducing the frequency, duration, and severity of HAE attacks, there remains an unmet need for more effective and less burdensome treatment of attacks. The key attributes for a new prophylactic therapy would be improved efficacy (reduced attack frequency and increased proportion of patients who are attack-free), safety and tolerability, and patient convenience in order to ease both the burden of illness and treatment for individuals with HAE.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p>
