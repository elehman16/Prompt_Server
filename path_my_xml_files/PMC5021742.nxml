However, we have previously shown that a cannabis extract devoid of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC still stimulates appetite, indicating that other phytocannabinoids also elicit hyperphagia. One possible candidate is the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG), which has affinity for several molecular targets with known involvement in the regulation of feeding behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the study was to assess the effects of CBG on food intake and feeding pattern microstructure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Male Lister hooded rats were administered CBG (30&#x02013;120&#x000a0;mg/kg, per ora (p.o.)) or placebo and assessed in open field, static beam and grip strength tests to determine a neuromotor tolerability profile for this cannabinoid. Subsequently, CBG (at 30&#x02013;240&#x000a0;mg/kg, p.o.) or placebo was administered to a further group of pre-satiated rats, and hourly intake and meal pattern data were recorded over 2&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CBG produced no adverse effects on any parameter in the neuromotor tolerability test battery. In the feeding assay, 120&#x02013;240&#x000a0;mg/kg CBG more than doubled total food intake and increased the number of meals consumed, and at 240&#x000a0;mg/kg reduced latency to feed. However, the sizes or durations of individual meals were not significantly increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that CBG elicits hyperphagia, by reducing latency to feed and increasing meal frequency, without producing negative neuromotor side effects. Investigation of the therapeutic potential of CBG for conditions such as cachexia and other disorders of eating and body weight regulation is thus warranted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Appetite</kwd><kwd>Appetitive</kwd><kwd>Cachexia</kwd><kwd>Cannabigerol</kwd><kwd>Cannabis</kwd><kwd>Consummatory</kwd><kwd>Feeding</kwd><kwd>Hyperphagia</kwd><kwd>Phytocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>Tolerability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Reading</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. has been utilised for medicinal and recreational purposes for millennia and is increasingly being recognised as a valuable source of unique compounds (phytocannabinoids) with a multitude of potential therapeutic applications (Deiana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). The main psychoactive constituent of <italic>C. sativa</italic>, &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC), was first isolated and characterised in the 1960s (Mechoulam &#x00026; Gaoni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1965</xref>; Gaoni &#x00026; Mechoulam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1971</xref>), and this has been followed by the discovery of numerous additional phytocannabinoids (pCBs) over the last two decades (see Mechoulam &#x00026; Hanus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2000</xref> for review). Over 100 pCBs have now been isolated from <italic>C. sativa</italic> (Elsohly &#x00026; Slade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>), but despite their structural similarities, the pCBs show considerable heterogeneity in their pharmacological targets and/or physiological activities (Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012a</xref>).</p><p>One of the better known properties of <italic>C. sativa</italic> is its ability to stimulate appetite (hyperphagia), which has been described anecdotally by recreational users and demonstrated under laboratory conditions (Hollister <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1971</xref>; Mattes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1994</xref>). In rodent models, our laboratory has shown that oral administration of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC to pre-satiated rats produced significant short-term hyperphagia (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>), characterised by a marked reduction in latency to begin feeding (Williams and Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002a</xref>), an effect that was reversed by co-administration of the selective CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) antagonist SR141716 (Williams and Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2002b</xref>). Similarly, CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated hyperphagic effects have also been observed following administration of the endocannabinoids (eCB) anandamide (AEA) (Williams &#x00026; Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1999</xref>) and 2-arachidonoylglyerol (2-AG) (Kirkham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). Importantly, in the latter study, we also demonstrated altered brain levels of AEA and 2-AG during fasting and feeding states, implicating eCBs in the control of appetite.</p><p>In the years since these findings, the role of the eCB system in appetite regulation and energy balance has been the subject of intensive research and is now emerging as a major target area for a variety of metabolic disorders (see Di Marzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref> for review). Despite promising therapeutic potential, treatments directly targeting CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated appetite regulation have, thus far, had limited clinical success. The CB<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SR141716 was licenced as an anti-obesity treatment in Europe in 2006; however, it was withdrawn 2&#x000a0;years later due to adverse side effects including depression and suicidality (Derosa and Maffioli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012</xref>). Synthetic &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC (dronabinol) is licenced for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; however, it is not recommended as a first-line treatment due to adverse side effects associated with its psychoactivity (Todaro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). Two clinical trials conducted on &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC for appetite stimulation in cancer cachexia patients did not show positive results, possibly due to the low doses required to attain an acceptable tolerability profile (Jatoi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>; Strasser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we have started investigating the effects of the non-&#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC pCBs on feeding behaviour (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010b</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012b</xref>; Brierley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). This work suggests that some pCBs may offer potential for therapeutic appetite regulation without the psychoactive side effect profile of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC-containing preparations. In the present study, we investigated the effects of one such pCB, cannabigerol (CBG), which does not produce &#x02018;cannabimimetic&#x02019; psychoactive side effects and is hence typically described as non-psychoactive (Mechoulam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1970</xref>). CBG is a relatively little-studied biosynthetic precursor (in <italic>C. sativa</italic>) of the major pCBs &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) (Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012a</xref>). Pharmacodynamic studies of CBG in vitro have determined that it acts as a potent &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2&#x000a0;nM) and a modest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R competitive antagonist (at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and can weakly bind, but not activate, CB<sub>1</sub>R and CB<sub>2</sub>R (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;81 and 2600&#x000a0;nM, respectively) (Cascio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>; Pertwee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of the endocannabinoid AEA (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and interacts with a number of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, acting as an agonist at TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPV2 (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.7, 1.3 and 1.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, respectively) and as a potent antagonist at TRPM8 (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.16&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) (De Petrocellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). CBG has also recently been shown to block voltage-gated sodium channels Na<sub>v</sub> 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;88, 79 and 36&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, respectively) (Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). Given that CBG readily penetrates the blood brain barrier (Deiana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>) and interacts with a number of eCB and non-eCB targets with known involvement in the control of feeding and energy balance (Halford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>; Di Marzo and Matias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>), the in vitro data available suggest this that pCB could conceivably elicit a centrally mediated stimulation of feeding behaviour. Although there is a paucity of in vivo studies of CBG in general, and feeding studies in particular, it has been reported that an acute low dose (2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.p.) administered to rats enhanced saccharin palatability in a taste reactivity test (O&#x02019;Brien et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). As part of one of our previous studies, we investigated the effects on feeding behaviour of low doses of CBG (0.176&#x02013;17.6&#x000a0;mg/kg, p.o.), which were scaled to the concentrations found in a low-&#x02206;9-THC cannabis extract which induced hyperphagia (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012b</xref>). In that study however, despite a suggestion of increased food intake over 2&#x000a0;h, no significant effects of CBG on appetite were found.</p><p>The present study was thus conducted with the aim of investigating whether CBG was able to stimulate appetite, at higher doses than previously tested. To ensure that any potential therapeutic utility of CBG would not be compromised by detrimental neuromotor side effects, our first experiment comprised a neuromotor tolerability test battery to assess the pCB&#x02019;s effects on locomotor activity, balance, fine motor control and muscular strength. As CBG has previously been found to have no cannabimimetic effects in the mouse tetrad assay up to a maximal tested dose of 80&#x000a0;mg/kg (El-Alfy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>), had minimal behavioural effects (at 3&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg/kg) in a mouse Irwin assay (Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>) and no signs of acute toxicity were reported in a pharmacokinetic study of 120-mg/kg doses (Deiana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>), a dose range of 30&#x02013;120&#x000a0;mg/kg was used in this tolerability experiment. Subsequently, a second experiment was conducted using a pre-feed satiation paradigm to assess the acute hyperphagic effects of CBG. Results from a pilot of this experiment suggested that CBG may elicit dose-dependent hyperphagia, which did not appear to have a ceiling effect up to 120&#x000a0;mg/kg, and so an additional 240-mg/kg dose group was included in the design of the experiment. Infrared activity monitoring was performed concurrently throughout the feeding experiment to corroborate the effects of CBG on locomotor activity determined during the tolerability battery and to extend this investigation over a longer time frame and higher dose range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiment 1: effects of CBG in a neuromotor tolerability test battery</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Drugs</title><p>CBG (GW Pharmaceuticals, UK) was dissolved directly into sesame seed oil (by magnetic stirring at 57&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to produce a maximal working concentration of 120&#x000a0;mg/ml.

All animals received doses separated by a minimum 48-h washout period. On test days, animals were administered CBG or vehicle 60&#x000a0;min prior to commencement of testing.

On test days, all procedures were conducted during the first half of the dark period (12:00&#x02013;18:00) in the same room as the animals were housed. All test equipment was cleaned with 70&#x000a0;% ethanol and allowed to dry completely between animals. All tasks were presented in the order below with animals having a 5-min rest period in their home cage between tasks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Open field</title><p>Consisting of a 1.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.4-m black acrylic-lined box, delineated into a 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5 square grid and comprising a 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3 central sector and a single square-wide peripheral sector, the open field was illuminated by dim red light (&#x0223c;10&#x000a0;lx). Animals were placed in a consistent corner of the open field, and behaviour was video recorded for 5&#x000a0;min. Videos were analysed offline using Observer XT software (Noldus, Netherlands). Locomotor activity was quantified based on the number of times animals crossed the lines on the open field floor, with time spent in the central area of the field and latency to first entry used to quantify anxiety-like behaviour (i.e. degree of thigmotaxis). It should be noted that the habituation period animals received to the open field component of the test battery is necessary for within-subject assessment of drug-induced changes of locomotor activity. However, as a consequence, the aversive/novel nature of the environment is attenuated in comparison to the non-habituated version of this task, which is primarily used to assess anxiety-like behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Static beam</title><p>The apparatus consisted of a 3.2-cm-diameter cylindrical beam, 1&#x000a0;m in length and suspended 0.5&#x000a0;m above floor level. A bright light was positioned at the start of the beam and an enclosed goal box at the end. Animals were placed at the start of the beam and allowed a maximum of 5&#x000a0;min to successfully traverse its length to reach the goal box. Animals were then given a 2-min rest period in home cages prior to repeating the test. Tests were video recorded for off-line coding using Observer XT software (Noldus, Netherlands). In the static beam test, performance generated four outcome measures, based on successful completion or length of beam traversed prior to falling (pass rate and distance travelled), number of times paws were fully extended past the beam (foot slips) and time taken to traverse the middle 50&#x000a0;cm of beam (speed).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Forelimb grip strength</title><p>Animals completed two repeats of the forelimb grip strength test, separated by a 30-s rest period.

The wet-mash comprised 1-part rat and mouse expanded ground diet (SDS, Witham, UK) and 1.25-part tap water. Animals were allowed 2&#x000a0;h to consume the wet-mash, following which they were returned to their home cages and quantity of wet-mash consumed was measured. Animals were habituated to this pre-feed procedure until a stable consumption level was reached, as indicated by a non-significant main effect of test day by one-way ANOVA across four consecutive habituation days (<italic>F</italic><sub>3, 63</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.5603, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.644), with mean consumption during these days being 19.9&#x02013;20.5&#x000a0;g.</p><p>On test days, immediately after the pre-feed procedure, animals were administered doses of CBG or vehicle and returned to their home cages for 1&#x000a0;h to allow for drug assimilation, during which time food was unavailable.

Furthermore, CBG acutely administered at doses &#x02264;120&#x000a0;mg/kg did not elicit any detrimental neuromotor effects on locomotor activity, balance, fine motor control or muscular strength, and at 240&#x000a0;mg/kg appears to have some stimulant activity.</p><p>The widely utilised and validated feeding paradigm employed in this study is designed to sensitively detect even relatively small hyperphagic actions of cannabinoid agents (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>). The paradigm provides detailed analysis of meal microstructure, allowing quantification of discrete behaviours during the appetitive and consummatory phases of feeding. The incorporation of an infrared locomotor activity monitoring system provides additional measures of ambulatory activity and rearing behaviour, allowing differentiation of locomotion-dependent and locomotion-independent effects of drugs on feeding behaviour. The use of this paradigm in the present study allows the direct comparison of the effects of CBG to previously published results using the same paradigm for the eCB anandamide (Williams and Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002a</xref>); the purified pCBs &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC, CBD, cannabiniol (CBN) and cannabidiolic acid (Williams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>; Williams and Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2002b</xref>; Williams and Kirkham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2002a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012b</xref>; Brierley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>); and low- and non-&#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC cannabis extracts and analogues (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010b</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012a</xref>). It should be noted that, unlike these previous studies of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC, the doses of CBG used in the present study are considerably higher than concentrations typically found in whole <italic>C. sativa</italic> preparations. As such, the hyperphagic activity of CBG reported here is unlikely to meaningfully contribute to the appetite-stimulating effects of cannabis consumption in humans.</p><p>In this study, administration of CBG at 120&#x02013;240&#x000a0;mg/kg dose dependently increased total food intake over the 2-h test period. This is in contrast to previous studies of various &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC formulations, which elicit a robust increase in intake during hour 1 followed by a compensatory decrease during hour 2 (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012a</xref>). The pCB CBN elicits a similar biphasic effect on food intake during this 2-h paradigm, with hyperphagia blocked by the CB<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SR141716, indicative of a &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC-like mechanism of action (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012b</xref>). In our study, CBG also increased appetitive phase feeding behaviour, with the onset of feeding advanced by approximately 30&#x000a0;min, from 83 to 54&#x000a0;min. However, this is somewhat in contrast to previous studies of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC formulations and CBN, in which feeding was initiated within 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min, despite similar long latencies in vehicle groups (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012a</xref>; Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012b</xref>). Hence, it appears that whilst CBG may stimulate the appetitive component of feeding behaviour, it does so to a lesser degree than &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC and CBN.</p><p>Whilst the CBG-induced increase in feeding frequency and decrease in latency are consistent with stimulation of the appetitive component of feeding, the modest effects on intra-meal factors provide little evidence for stimulation of the consummatory component. Given that a significant effect of CBG was only evident on the cumulative size of meals 1 and 2, it is apparent that increased consumption is predominantly driven by the dose-dependent increase in feeding frequency, rather than significant increase in individual meal sizes. Similarly, the lack of significantly increased durations of individual meals does not support a stimulatory effect of CBG on the consummatory component of feeding behaviour. Differences are thus again evident between consummatory meal microstructure parameters following administration of CBG, and those of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC formulations, which are typified by robust increases in both the size and duration of the first meal consumed (Farrimond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010a</xref>). Considered overall, the alterations in food intake and meal pattern microstructure induced by CBG demonstrate a dose-dependent hyperphagic effect, predominantly mediated by stimulation of the appetitive component of feeding behaviour.</p><p>Such differences in patterns of feeding behaviour stimulation between CBG and pCBs acting directly as CB<sub>1</sub>R agonists are consistent with the limited in vitro pharmacodynamic data on CBG, which have shown that whilst it has some affinity for this receptor, it does not appear to activate it (Cascio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>; Pertwee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). Given that CBG has been shown to be one of the most effective pCBs at inhibiting AEA reuptake (De Petrocellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>), it is instead possible that it elicits CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated hyperphagia in an indirect manner, via upregulation of orexigenic endocannabinoid tone (Kirkham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>; Reyes-Cabello et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>). The TRPV1 agonist activity of CBG could conceivably contribute to such a mechanism, given the recent observation that TRPV1 agonists can themselves inhibit AEA reuptake (Hofmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>). Alternatively, CBG-induced hyperphagia may be mediated by its activity (to date only observed in vitro) as a highly potent agonist of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors (Cascio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). Consistent with this, stimulation of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus has been shown to have hyperphagic effects in satiated rats (Wellman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1993</xref>; Taksande et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>), whilst administration of the &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine into the median raphe nucleus had orexigenic effects in free feeding (Mansur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>) but not fasted or food-restricted rats (Ribas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). Whilst the above studies suggest that central &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor activation may be involved in the hyperphagic activity of CBG, it should be noted that recent cardiovascular safety assays in dog did not reveal any effects on cardiovascular parameters (T. Hill, personal communication), indicating that &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonism may not be the predominant action for CBG. Given that cannabinoids acting as CB<sub>1</sub>R agonists have demonstrated limited clinical utility as appetite stimulants, the possibility that CBG induces hyperphagia via indirect and/or CB<sub>1</sub>R-independent mechanisms warrants urgent further investigation, as this pCB may represent a valuable novel therapeutic option for such applications.</p><p>A further interesting observation from the feeding experiment is the stimulation of ambulatory activity over the 2-h test duration. These data support the predicted lack of sedative effect for the 240 mg/kg dose based on results up to 120&#x000a0;mg/kg in the neuromotor test battery. However, they are not wholly consistent, given that a non-significant increase in activity during the feeding experiment was observed at 120&#x000a0;mg/kg, which was not observed in the open field test. This is not inherently contradictory however, as it is plausible that differences in test environment, and the considerably longer test duration and drug exposure time (180 vs 65&#x000a0;min from drug administration), allow the detection of effects too subtle to be observed in the open field.</p><p>The coincident increases in total food intake and ambulatory activity suggest the following two possible alternative interpretations of these data: that increased locomotor activity is an artefact of increased food seeking; or that increased food intake is secondary to increased activity or general arousal. For the first interpretation to be valid, any compound which increases food intake by a similar magnitude in this system would have to also increase locomotor activity levels. However, validation studies of the feeding and activity cages, using 0.5&#x02013;2-mg/kg &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC-containing formulations, resulted in the expected stimulation of feeding behaviours but did not increase locomotor activity (unpublished observations). Given these data, and video observations showing that the majority of animals&#x02019; activities in the cages were exploratory rather than food seeking, it is apparent that the activity data do indeed represent generalised locomotor stimulation. For this locomotor stimulation to be the primary driver of increased food intake, via a general arousal mechanism, patterns of activity and food intake would have to closely mirror one another, both in terms of temporal profile and dose response. Upon close inspection of hourly intake and activity levels, it can be observed that whilst intake levels in hour 2 are very similar to hour 1 (and indeed 10&#x000a0;% higher in the 240-mg/kg group), activity levels in hour 2 are approximately half that in hour 1(data not shown). Further evidence of the disconnect between activity and intake can been seen in the dose response, with the highest intakes during hour 1 in the 120 mg/kg group, in contrast to the highest activity levels being in the 240 mg/kg group. These data thus argue against the interpretation that the hyperphagic activity of CBG is driven by generalised arousal, but rather that this compound directly stimulates motivation to feed, with coincident feeding-independent locomotor activation apparent at the highest dose. Whilst beyond the scope of the present study, this apparent stimulant effect of higher CBG doses warrants further investigation in models which can assess locomotor activation over extended time periods, without any confounding effects of feeding stimulation.</p><p>The tests comprising the neuromotor tolerability battery have been previously utilised for the assessment of pCBs and other drugs with known clinical neuromotor side effects. A number of drugs with known sedative effects in humans, e.g. &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC and benzodiazepines, elicit a sedative effect on locomotor activity in the open field test (Navarro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1993</xref>; Prut and Belzung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2003</xref>). The static beam and grip strength tests have similar predictive validity for clinically observed detrimental motor effects, with both the anti-epileptic drug valproate and &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC-containing cannabis extracts resulting in impaired performance in these tests (Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). In contrast to &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC, but like the non-psychoactive pCBs CBD and cannabidiolic acid (Long et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Brierley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>), CBG in the present study had no effect at any dose on locomotor activity in the open field test. In the static beam and grip strength tests, CBG did not elicit any detrimental effect on balance or fine motor control measures, nor on muscular strength, again in contrast to previous reports of the effects of &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC-containing cannabis extracts in these tests (Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the only published investigation of the side effect profile of CBG has been in the mouse tetrad test for classic cannabimimetic activity, in which it did not induce typical CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated effects of hypomotility, catalepsy, hypothermia or analgesia up to the maximal tested dose of 80&#x000a0;mg/kg (El-Alfy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). The present study thus confirms that acute CBG administration does not elicit sedation and further demonstrates that it does not have detrimental effects on balance, motor control or muscular strength.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates for the first time that the non-psychoactive plant cannabinoid CBG is able to stimulate appetite in pre-satiated rats, and does so without detrimental neuromotor side effects. Analysis of meal pattern microstructure revealed that CBG predominantly stimulated feeding behaviour by decreasing the latency to feed and increasing the frequency of feeding rather than by increasing individual meal size or duration. This observed meal pattern is distinct from that elicited by the major psychoactive plant cannabinoid &#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC, suggesting that CBG acts via an as yet undetermined mechanism unlikely to be direct activation of CB<sub>1</sub>R. These data thus provide a rationale for pre-clinical investigation of CBG as a novel treatment in models of cancer- or chemotherapy-induced cachexia, for which there is an urgent unmet clinical need for well-tolerated appetite stimulants.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBG</term><def><p>Cannabigerol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBD</term><def><p>Cannabidiol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pCB</term><def><p>Phytocannabinoid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eCB</term><def><p>Endocannabinoid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-THC</term><def><p>&#x02206;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CB<sub>1</sub>R</term><def><p>Cannabinoid receptor type 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CB<sub>2</sub>R</term><def><p>Cannabinoid receptor type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AEA</term><def><p>Arachidonoylethanolamide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>2-AG</term><def><p>2-Arachidonoylglycerol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R</term><def><p>5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor type 1A</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>This research was supported by grants to CMW and BJW by GW Research and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and in part by the University of Reading Research Endowment Trust Fund to DIB.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The work reported was funded in part by grants to BJW and CMW from GW Research and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals.
