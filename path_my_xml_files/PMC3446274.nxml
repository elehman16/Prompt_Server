We aimed to demonstrate that epigenetic changes in normal cells, collected years in advance of the first signs of morphological transformation, can predict the risk of such transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of over 27,000 CpGs in cytologically normal cells of the uterine cervix from 152 women in a prospective nested case-control study. We used statistics based on differential variability to identify CpGs associated with the risk of transformation and a novel statistical algorithm called EVORA (Epigenetic Variable Outliers for Risk prediction Analysis) to make predictions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We observed many CpGs that were differentially variable between women who developed a non-invasive cervical neoplasia within 3 years of sample collection and those that remained disease-free. These CpGs exhibited heterogeneous outlier methylation profiles and overlapped strongly with CpGs undergoing age-associated DNA methylation changes in normal tissue. Using EVORA, we demonstrate that the risk of cervical neoplasia can be predicted in blind test sets (AUC = 0.66 (0.58 to 0.75)), and that assessment of DNAm variability allows more reliable identification of risk-associated CpGs than statistics based on differences in mean methylation levels. In independent data, EVORA showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect pre-invasive neoplasia and cervical cancer (AUC = 0.93 (0.86 to 1) and AUC = 1, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate that the risk of neoplastic transformation can be predicted from DNA methylation profiles in the morphologically normal cell of origin of an epithelial cancer.

Consistent with this view, a recent study has shown that regions that are differentially methylated between normal and cancer tissue appear to be highly variable in cancer itself, and that identification of cancer-relevant markers may therefore benefit from statistics that measure differential variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Based on these insights, we here aimed to demonstrate that analysis of epigenetic variability in prospectively collected normal cells can predict the risk of future morphological transformation.</p><p>In order to demonstrate this in humans, two requirements are mandatory: the cells that are used for epigenetic analyses need to be (i) the cells of origin for the studied cancer, and (ii) they need to be collected years in advance of the onset of cytological and morphological signs of cancer. Currently, the only human organ that meets these two requirements is the uterine cervix. Thus, we used Illumina Infinium technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] to measure DNA methylation (DNAm) at 27,578 CpG sites in cytologically entire normal cells (liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples) from the uterine cervix of 152 women (aged 19 to 55 years) in a nested prospective case-control study within ARTISTIC (A Randomised Trial of HPV Testing in Primary Cervical Screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Prospective cases were women who developed a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) within 3 years of sample draw, while controls were women who remained disease-free. To further support our data we used completely independent LBC samples with abnormal cytology and associated controls, as well as cervical cancer tissue and normal cervix specimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><sec><title>The ARTISTIC trial</title><p>The LBC samples we analyzed were collected from women as part of the ARTISTIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All women underwent two screening rounds with an interval of 3 years. Within the ARTISTIC trial, women, aged 19 to 64 years who were undergoing routine screening as part of the English National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme in Greater Manchester were randomly assigned in a ratio of 3:1 to either combined LBC and human papilloma virus (HPV) testing where the results were revealed and acted on, or to combined LBC and HPV testing where the HPV result was concealed from the patient and investigator. There were a total of 24,510 eligible women at entry. In the first round of screening 453 women had CIN2+. In the second round of screening 75 women (who were screen-negative in the first round and who had a sample stored from the first round) had developed CIN2+ (44 were HPV-positive and 31 were HPV-negative in the first round). Seventy-seven women who had not developed any cytological changes were matched (age and HPV status in round 1) to the cases. The cytologically normal samples from round 1 from these 152 women were used for DNAm analysis. Further details, cytology and HPV scoring are described in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN25417821.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA methylation nested case control study</title><p>A total of 152 samples in a prospective nested case control study within ARTISTIC were selected for DNAm analysis. Cases were 75 women who had normal cytology in screening round 1 but demonstrated CIN2+ after 3 years in round 2. Controls were 77 women who had normal cytology at entry and in the second screening round. Cases and controls were matched for age (Wilcox rank sum test <italic>P </italic>= 0.95) and HPV status: 92 were HPV-positive (44 cases and 48 controls) and 60 were HPV-negative (31 cases and 29 controls) at entry (Fisher test <italic>P </italic>= 0.74). Informed consent was obtained from the main study population and this study has been approved by the ethical committee (National Research Ethics Service Reference Number 10/H1107/15).</p></sec><sec><title>Other DNA methylation data sets</title><p>In addition to the nested case control prospective study within ARTISTIC, we used two additional DNAm data sets that were also generated using the same Illumina Infinium 27 k platform. Set 1 comprised a total of 30 LBC samples (19 HPV-negatives and 11 HPV-positives) with normal cytology and 18 LBC samples (all HPV-positive) with CIN2+, as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Set 2 comprised a total of 63 cervical tissue samples: 48 cervical cancers, 15 normals. The normal cervical tissue samples were from women (mean age 55.4 years) who underwent a hysterectomy for fibroids of the uterine corpus, that is, these women did not have fibroids in the uterine cervix. The 48 cervical cancer specimens were from women (matched for age with mean age 56.8 years) who were treated at the Innsbruck Medical University. Of these 48 cancers, 26 were of stage 1, 10 of stage 2, 4 of stage 3 and 7 of stage 4 (1 sample had missing stage information). In terms of grade, 7 were of grade 1, 28 of grade 2 and 11 of grade 3 (2 samples had no grading). All specimens were obtained with informed consent and approval from the ethics committee UN4044-290/4.9.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction and methylation assay</title><p>The DNA extraction protocol is described in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Genome-wide methylation analysis using the Illumina Infinium Methylation27K beadchip (Illumina Inc., USA, WG-311-1201) was performed. This chip interrogates the methylation status of over 27,000 CpG sites throughout the human genome, covering the promoters of over 14,000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

For each downloaded data set we only selected the normal squamous cervix epithelial and squamous cervical cell carcinoma samples: for [GSE9750] there were 24 normal and 33 cancers, for [GSE7803] there were 10 normals and 21 cancers, and for [GSE6791] there were 8 normals and 20 cancers. Probes mapping to the same Entrez ID were averaged, resulting in 13,213 genes [GSE9750], 13,262 genes [GSE7803] and 20,827 genes [GSE6791].</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA expression data analysis</title><p>From the above three expression data sets we built an integrated (merged) expression set over 42 normal cervical epithelial samples and 74 cervical cancers using a procedure that we have validated many times previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Briefly, there were 13,213 genes in common between all three expression arrays. For each of these genes and for each expression set we then renormalized the gene expression profile to mean zero and unit variance, yielding 'z-profiles'. For each gene, its z-profile in each of the three studies was then merged. This resulted in a merged expression set over 13,213 genes and 116 samples (42 normal and 74 cancers). For each gene, we then computed a <italic>t</italic>-statistic <italic>P</italic>-value against normal/cancer status. Of the 140 risk genes, 86 were found in the merged expression set. Of these 86, 46 exhibited differential expression <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05. A binomial test was used to test the significance of the skew towards differential under- or overexpression. To adjust for any global (that is, over all 13,213 genes) skew towards under- or overexpression, we also estimated the <italic>P</italic>-value using a Monte Carlo procedure (1,000 Monte Carlo runs) in which 86 genes were selected at random and a binomial test <italic>P</italic>-value was recomputed. The fraction of the 1,000 runs with a binomial test <italic>P</italic>-value more extreme than the observed gives an independent <italic>P</italic>-value estimate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Full details of statistical methods are in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.

False discovery rate (FDR) estimation was implemented as in the q-value package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To identify age-independent variable CpGs (vCpGs), we adjusted the data for age, and subsequently estimated the variances for each CpG. Because of the heteroscedasticity of &#x003b2;-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we also estimated the variance using <italic>R</italic>-values (defined as <italic>R = M/U</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To identify differentially variable CpGs (DVCs) between prospective CIN2+ cases and normals, we used Bartlett's test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In doing so, variances were estimated after the methylation profiles were linearly adjusted for age within each phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>EVORA: Epigenetic Variable Outliers for Risk Prediction Analysis</title><p>Full details and the model assumptions on which EVORA is based are described in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. There are three important statistical aspects to EVORA: (i) identification of candidate risk CpGs; (ii) identification of samples that constitute methylation outliers; and (iii) a method for assigning risk to each sample, which is robust and independent of the scale used. For (i) we use Bartlett's test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], since our hypothesis is that DVCs defined by outlier profiles are more likely to define risk CpGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To define outliers in a scale-independent fashion (ii) we use the COPA (Cancer Outlier Profile Analysis) transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Lastly, to assign a risk score to a sample, we use an adaptive index algorithm framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Prospective cases (<italic>n </italic>= 75) and controls (<italic>n </italic>= 77) were matched for age and HPV status (Methods). Following the suggestion that epigenetic variability may mark genes that contribute to the risk of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we hypothesized that differential variability in normal tissue might be associated with an increased risk of neoplasia. We thus derived a list of CpGs that showed significantly different (age-adjusted) variability between future (CIN2+) cases and controls (DVCs) (Methods). We observed many DVCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) and among the top 500 (FDR &#x0003c; 0.0001; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) the majority (73%) were more variable in future cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The set of DVCs was largely unchanged if variability was not adjusted for age or if also adjusted for HPV status (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In contrast, testing for differential methylation using <italic>t</italic>-statistics (differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs)) did not yield genome-wide significance levels (FDR ~0.6 for the top 50 CpGs; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). DVCs that showed significantly higher variance in future cases (hypervariable DVCs) generally exhibited small yet consistent increases in mean methylation levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Inspection of typical methylation profiles of such DVCs revealed that the increased or decreased variability was due to approximately 20 to 30% changes in DNAm present in only a relatively small number of 'outlier' samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Developmental genes, and in particular polycomb group targets (PCGTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for precise definition), were enriched only among the DVCs showing increased variance in the normal cells of prospective cancer cases (odds ratio = 4.9 (3.9 to 6.3), <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 1<italic>e</italic>-31) and were six times more likely to exhibit higher variability in prospective cases than lower (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). PCGTs were also the most highly enriched gene category out of a total of 6,173 gene sets in a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Random permutation of sample labels also showed that this enrichment could not have arisen by chance (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Thus, all these results indicate that increased DNAm variability affects PCGTs and is an intrinsic property of normal cells predisposed to neoplasia.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Differentially variable and differentially methylated CpGs</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Histograms of <italic>P</italic>-values derived from Bartlett's test comparing differences in variance between normal samples that become neoplastic (CIN2+) and samples that remain normal (differentially variable CpGs (DVCs)). <bold>(b) </bold>Histograms of <italic>P</italic>-values derived from <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing differences in mean CpG methylation levels between the same two phenotypes (differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs)). <bold>(c) </bold>Scatterplot of Bartlett statistics (logarithm of the ratio of the variance in prospective CIN2+ to that in normal) shown on the y-axis against the corresponding <italic>t</italic>-statistics (x-axis) for the top 500 DVCs.

Interestingly, we observed that the 644 CpGs undergoing age-associated changes in DNAm (aCpGs) showed specific directional changes associated with the future development of CIN2+ even though these changes were not individually significant (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Specifically, those CpGs undergoing significant hypermethylation with age were generally also hypermethylated in future CIN2+ cases (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). To test further if age-hypermethylated aCpGs are indeed associated with CIN2+, we compared their methylation levels in an independent data set (also generated with the Illumina 27 k platform) consisting of 30 normal and 18 age-matched CIN2+ samples (Set 1, Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The mean methylation level of these aCpGs was also significantly higher in the CIN2+ samples of this set (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Significant overlap of hypervariable DVCs and age-hypermethylated aCpGs</title><p>Next, we explored the relationship between DVCs and aCpGs. Many CpGs showing age-associated hypermethylation also showed significant increases in (age-adjusted) variability within the normal tissues of future CIN2+ cases, while age hypomethylated aCpGs did not (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a-c</xref>). Thus, CpGs that are more variable in prospective CIN2+ cases independently of age overlapped significantly with CpGs that undergo age-associated hypermethylation in normal tissue independently of prospective disease status. This could mean that detecting DNAm changes across a group of individuals of the same age but who may have had variable lifetime exposures to environmental risk factors (and therefore be at variable disease risk) is similar to detecting age-associated changes in a population of differently aged individuals (since lifetime exposures accumulate with age). Because PCGTs were enriched in both hypermethylated (hyperM) aCpGs and hypervariable (hyperV) DVCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), it was natural to ask if aCpGs mapping to PCGTs and that had been identified from other tissues (for example, whole blood) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] would also exhibit a preferential skew towards hypervariability. Remarkably, out of the 69 PCGT CpGs identified as hypermethylated with age in whole blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the overwhelming majority were more variable in the epithelial cells of future CIN2+ cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). In contrast, the 20 PCGT CpGs undergoing age-associated hypomethylation in blood showed no skew towards either increased or decreased variability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Thus, we can conclude that genes prone to epigenetic variation are also prone to undergo age-associated hypermethylation and that PCGTs define a significant subset of these genes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Relation between differentially variable and age-associated CpGs</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Bartlett test <italic>P</italic>-values (on -log10 scale) of CpGs indicating significance of differential variability (between prospective CIN2+ and controls) (y-axis) versus their average &#x003b2;-value across all samples (x-axis).

Since the typical DVC methylation profile (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>) is one in which a small number of samples exhibit increased outlier methylation (&#x02265; 20% methylation change), we hypothesized that cancer-risk in a given sample may be associated with the number of such risk CpGs (hypervariable DVCs/hypermethylated aCpGs) becoming 'methylation hits' (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). To test this idea, we applied a novel statistical algorithm called EVORA (Methods; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), which aims to assess the risk of neoplastic transformation from the number of methylation outliers. Using multiple training/test set partitions, we found that EVORA could predict the future risk of CIN2+ in blind test sets (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.66 (0.58 to 0.75), <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), while an analogous classifier based on differences in mean methylation levels could not (AUC = 0.51 (0.30 to 0.72), <italic>P </italic>= 0.46; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Flowchart describing the EVORA model.

We postulated that this pool of 140 risk CpGs would also necessarily diagnose CIN2+ status, since for established neoplastic cells we would expect an even higher fraction of these CpGs to be hypermethylated. Indeed, in an independent Illumina Infinium 27 K methylation data set of normal cervical smears and age-matched CIN2+ samples (set 1; Methods), EVORA was able to predict CIN2+ status with very high accuracy (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Importantly, while the risk scores of the normal samples in ARTISTIC and set 1 were comparable to each other, the scores of the CIN2+ samples were significantly higher than those of normal cells that only become CIN2+ within 3 years (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), reflecting a progressive increase from normal cells at low risk, to normal cells at high risk, and finally to cells in a pre-invasive neoplastic state. Importantly, risk CpGs (that is, differentially variable CpGs) identified from the ARTISTIC cohort predicted CIN2+ status better than CpGs that were not differentially variable, even if they mapped to PCGTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Since risk CpGs performed similarly irrespective of PCGT status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), this indicates that differential variability is the key feature of cells at risk of morphological transformation and not PCGT status.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Heatmaps over risk CpGs</bold>. <bold>(a-c) </bold>Heatmaps of COPA-transformed methylation values for the top 140 risk CpGs that are (i) significantly hypermethylated with age and (ii) show significant increased variability in future CIN2+ cases, as determined in the ARTISTIC cohort.

The outlier risk scores were significantly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) owing to the fact that risk CpGs exhibited much more of a bi-modal methylation pattern between cancer and normal tissue; that is, risk CpGs were invariably either hemi- or fully methylated across a high proportion of the cancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Nevertheless, a small subset of risk CpGs retained their outlier profiles in cervical cancer and EVORA was therefore still highly predictive of cancer status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Adapting EVORA to the original beta methylation scale to better capture the observed bi-modal methylation profiles yielded a perfect discrimination of normal and cancer tissue (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Risk genes are underexpressed in cervical cancer</title><p>To evaluate if the genes associated with the identified risk CpGs show expression changes in cervical cancer, we built an integrated data set of mRNA expression profiles over 13,213 genes and encompassing 42 normal cervical epithelial and 74 cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) specimens (Methods). The integration was done using a renormalization procedure that we have validated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Of the 140 risk genes, 86 could be mapped to this merged data set. Comparison of average mRNA levels of our 86 risk genes between normal and cancer tissue confirmed that risk genes showed lower average expression levels in cervical cancer (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). Analysis of individual gene statistics further showed that 46 were differentially expressed and that there was a significant skew towards underexpression in cancer (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). Moreover, in only 13 of 1,000 random selections of 86 gene sets (Monte Carlo analysis described in Methods) did we observe a skew as significant as the one observed for the risk genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we have addressed two fundamental questions. First, do DNAm changes precede the morphological signs of neoplastic transformation? And second, can these epigenetic changes (a) predict the risk of neoplastic development, and (b) allow detection of early (non-invasive) cancers? We have addressed these questions in the context of the uterine cervix, currently the only human organ allowing relatively easy access to the cell of origin of the associated cancer well in advance of the first morphological signs of neoplastic transformation.</p><p>Based on the hypothesis that epigenetic variability may reflect exposure to various genetic and non-genetic risk factors (including age), and that differential epigenetic variability may reflect underlying differential exposure to these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we posited that differentially variable methylated CpGs (DVCs) might be potential risk indicators of neoplastic transformation. Our prediction algorithm based on epigenetic variance (EVORA; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) could predict, with low but statistically significant accuracy (AUC = 0.66, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), prospective CIN2+ status in blind test sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). In contrast, an analogous classifier that uses differential methylation instead of differential variability statistics could not predict prospective CIN2+ status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Using EVORA, the set of risk CpGs could also accurately identify independent CIN2+ and cervical cancer samples (AUC &#x0003e; 0.9; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Using these additional data sets, we also showed that differential variability is a more important characteristic of risk CpGs (supporting the findings in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) than PCGT status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, these results support the view that differential variability is a key characteristic of cells predisposed to morphological transformation.</p><p>We have obtained these results in the context of cervical cancer using a study design that was matched for age and HPV status. Since HPV infection is a well-known necessary causal factor for cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it is thus reasonable to assume that those HPV-negative samples that later developed a CIN2+ will have done so only by acquiring an HPV infection after sample collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is important, therefore, to point out that the increased DNAm variability at the identified loci only increases the risk of CIN2+ in the background of an existing HPV infection. Given that HPV infection is a necessary but not sufficient factor to cause cervical carcinogenesis (most HPV-infected women do not develop cervical cancer), it is indeed very likely that unknown 'tumor-suppressor' factors play a role in determining which HPV-infected women develop a CIN2+. Thus, our data support a model in which increased DNAm variability at the identified loci may compromise specific tumor suppressor functions, predisposing HPV-infected women to develop a CIN2+. In this context, it is also important to note that we did not observe HPV infection to have a major effect on DNAm patterns and the EVORA risk score itself was not correlated with HPV status (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>). Nevertheless, we did observe a very weak marginal association of DNAm with HPV status within only the prospective CIN2+ sample subgroup (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>). Thus, while increased DNAm variability may synergize with a background HPV infection to increase the risk of CIN2+, HPV infection itself only appears to have a minor effect on DNAm patterns in the earliest stages of cervical carcinogenesis. It is possible, however, that HPV infection may cause significant DNAm and mRNA changes during the latter stages of carcinogenesis, as reported, for instance, in the case of head and neck cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In line with our hypothesis that epigenetic variable CpGs are involved in carcinogenesis, we find that they become more homogeneously methylated (that is, either hemi- or fully methylated) across cancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), in stark contrast to their heterogeneous (that is, unmethylated versus hemi- or fully methylated) outlier profiles in potent CIN2+ and established CIN2+ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, b</xref>). This transition from heterogeneous outlier profiles in the earliest stages of cervical carcinogenesis to more homogeneous methylation profiles in the more advanced cancer stage points towards a dynamic process in which DNAm is initially acquired in a largely stochastic manner, as hypothesized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but that later becomes more homogeneous and deterministic. However, we should point out that risk CpGs remain highly variably methylated across the invasive cancers, as previously reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the heatmaps of the prospective and pre-invasive cancer series (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a, b</xref>) also revealed the existence of a striking bi-modality within the cases only, with a small subset of cases exhibiting a highly correlated pattern of CpG methylation, in contrast to the more stochastic pattern of methylation seen in the majority of samples. It is particularly interesting that the risk CpGs identified in ARTISTIC generated this same characteristic stochastic versus correlated bi-modal pattern in the CIN2+ samples of set 1. To investigate this further, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to divide up the CIN2+ samples (of set 1) and the cervical cancers (of set 2) each into two clusters according to the average level of methylation over all CpGs mapping to CpG islands excluding the 140 risk CpGs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>). Interestingly, in both sets, the EVORA risk scores obtained from the 140 riskCpGs were significantly higher for the cases exhibiting the higher global levels of CpG island methylation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>). Thus, the risk CpGs appear to correlate particularly strongly with CIN2+ samples and cervical cancers of overall higher CpG island methylation levels. It will be interesting, therefore, to explore the relationship, if any, of the identified risk CpGs to a potential CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] in cervical cancer. Using an unsupervised consensus clustering over the 1,000 most variable CpGs in the ARTISTIC set - that is, the unsupervised procedure used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to define a CIMP, did not yield a clear CIMP, nor did the clusters correlate with the EVORA risk scores, suggesting that there is no CIMP (in the sense defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) present three years in advance of morphological transformation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>).</p><p>Over the years extensive evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that PCGT methylation is crucially involved in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although we have here provided substantial evidence that differential variability is a more fundamental characteristic of transformation than PCGT status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), our analyses nevertheless implicate a subset of PCGTs in the earliest stages of carcinogenesis (69 out of the 140 risk CpGs mapped to PCGTs). Numerous risk CpGs were also annotated to genes that have been previously demonstrated to be linked to cervical cancer, including <italic>CALCA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], <italic>CXCR4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], <italic>DCC </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <italic>HOXC10 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>MYOD1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], <italic>SFRP4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], <italic>SOX1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], <italic>TWIST1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and <italic>WT1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, we note that only <italic>HOXC10 </italic>had its risk CpG site located within 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In fact, of the 140 risk CpG sites, only 64 were within 200 bp of the start site, and of these only 24 were upstream. Thus, even though we observed the genes associated with our risk CpGs to be frequently underexpressed in cervical cancer, it remains to be seen if methylation of the identified risk CpG sites plays a part in the underlying regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Our data also revealed a remarkably strong overlap between CpGs undergoing age-associated hypermethylation in normal tissue and CpGs that were hypervariable in prospective CIN2+ cases. PCGTs made a large component of this overlap and age-associated hypermethylated CpGs also correlated significantly with CIN2+ status, further strengthening our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We stress that even those PCGT CpGs that were identified as undergoing age-associated hypermethylation in other tissues (for example, whole blood) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] were also more hypervariable in prospective CIN2+ samples and could indicate the risk of neoplastic transformation. This strong overlap between hypermethylated aCpGs and hypervariable DVCs is consistent with a model in which differential exposure to risk factors accumulates with age, thus generating the observed stochastic epigenetic variability. That these methylation changes and overlaps are not due to changes in cell-type composition is supported by many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We also observed here that changes in cell-type composition were more likely to be captured by age-independent variable CpGs (vCpGs), defined as CpGs that showed the largest (age-adjusted) variation across all normal samples. Specifically, these maximally varying vCpGs exhibited fairly large (&#x0003e; 80%) changes in methylation, did not overlap with DVCs, and accordingly were neither enriched for PCGTs nor discriminatory of prospective CIN2+ status (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). In fact, vCpGs were enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to extracellular space and mesenchymal features, including also many cell differentiation markers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>), and thus it is possible that methylation variation in these CpGs reflects variations in the epithelial to mesenchymal and stromal cell ratio. Since risk CpGs were not enriched for these stromal and mesenchymal features, it supports the view that their observed methylation changes reflect clonal heterogeneity within the epithelial cell population only.</p><p>The reliability of the methylation data generated from the ARTISTIC cohort is strongly supported by emerging biology and successful validations in two independent data sets. Nevertheless, to further check the reliability of the Infinium methylation data, we compared the &#x003b2;-values to those obtained using Methylight.

As shown in Hansen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in the context of cancer, differential variability is associated with increased spatial variability and loss of stability of the sharp methylation boundaries. Thus, it will be interesting to explore the spatial variability around the identified CpG risk sites with a more comprehensive and unbiased technology such as the Infinium 450 K methylation beadarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], as this may reveal a similar loss of methylation boundaries surrounding these sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have demonstrated that variability in DNAm, which is associated with age and other factors, and which occurs well in advance (at least 3 years) of the first morphological neoplastic changes, is associated with the risk of neoplastic transformation.
