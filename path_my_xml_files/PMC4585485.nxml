The aims of this phase I study were to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between nebivolol, a vasodilatory &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-selective blocker, and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and to assess safety and tolerability of the combination. This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 3-way crossover trial in 30 healthy adults aged 18&#x02013;45 years. Participants were randomized into 1 of 6 treatment sequences (1:1:1:1:1:1) consisting of three 7-day treatment periods followed by a 7-day washout. Once-daily oral treatments comprised nebivolol (20 mg), valsartan (320 mg), and nebivolol&#x02013;valsartan combination (20/320 mg). Outcomes included AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;,ss</sub>, C<sub>max,ss</sub>, T<sub>max,ss</sub>, changes in BP, pulse rate, plasma angiotensin II, plasma renin activity, 24-hour urinary aldosterone, and adverse events. Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions were observed but deemed not clinically significant. Systolic and diastolic BP reduction was significantly greater with nebivolol&#x02013;valsartan combination than with either monotherapy. The mean pulse rate associated with nebivolol and nebivolol&#x02013;valsartan treatments was consistently lower than that associated with valsartan monotherapy. A sharp increase in mean day 7 plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II that occurred in valsartan-treated participants was significantly attenuated with concomitant nebivolol administration. Mean 24-hour urine aldosterone at day 7 was substantially decreased after combined treatment, as compared with either monotherapy. All treatments were safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, nebivolol and valsartan coadministration led to greater reductions in BP compared with either monotherapy; nebivolol and valsartan lower BP through complementary mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>nebivolol</kwd><kwd>valsartan</kwd><kwd>combination</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>STATUS</meta-name><meta-value>ONLINE-ONLY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hypertension occurs in one-third of adults in the United States, 77% of whom are treated with antihypertensive medications<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; however, 40% of patients receiving pharmacologic therapy are unable to attain blood pressure (BP) control [systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg].<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Over a 10-year period, there was a significant increase in the use of multiple antihypertensive agents to help achieve BP control, with 48% of patients currently treated with 2 or more drugs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Combining 2 antihypertensive drugs is associated with better efficacy<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and tolerability<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> than doubling the dose of a monotherapy.

Potential participants were screened within 21 days before study entry, and eligible individuals were randomized into 1 of 6 drug treatment sequences (1:1:1:1:1:1). Each sequence consisted of three 7-day drug treatment periods followed by a 7-day washout period, for a total of 36 days not including the screening visit. Once-daily treatments consisted of nebivolol 20 mg tablets (treatment A), valsartan 320 mg tablets (treatment B), or nebivolol 20 mg tablets plus valsartan 320 mg tablets (treatment C). All treatments were given orally, with 240 mL of water, under fasted conditions (no food before 10 hours of dose and after 4 hours of dose). For each period, participants reported to the clinical site at least 1 day before the first day of the period (days 1, 14, and 27) and remained in-house for the duration of that period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PK/PD sampling and analytical methods</title><p>Blood samples were collected on days 1, 14, and 27 (0 hours before dose) and on days 7, 20, and 33 (0 hours before dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dose) in tubes containing K<sub>2</sub>EDTA and centrifuged at &#x02265;2500<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The plasma was then transferred into polypropylene tubes and frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until assayed. Concentrations of <italic>d</italic>-nebivolol, <italic>l</italic>-nebivolol (nonconjugated, <italic>d</italic>- and <italic>l</italic>-nebivolol), total nebivolol glucuronides (nonconjugated nebivolol and conjugated nebivolol glucuronides measured after enzymatic hydrolysis), and valsartan were determined by means of independent, sensitive, validated methods of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using internal standards labeled with stable isotopes. After off-line automated plasma sample cleanup through mixed cation exchange on the Quadra Liquid Handler (Tomtec, Hamden, CT), nonconjugated <italic>d</italic>-nebivolol and <italic>l</italic>-nebivolol were quantified with an enantiospecific assay on a Chiralpak IA column (250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 5-&#x003bc;m particle size; Chiral Technologies Inc, West Chester, PA). Detection of the analytes was performed by means of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in the positive mode on an API 4000 (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) with a detection range of 0.05&#x02013;20.0 ng/mL. Total plasma nebivolol was quantified using a separate method after the addition of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase in a 200 mM ammonium acetate solution and incubation for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. Samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed, treated with ammonium hydroxide, and cleaned up by a Quadra Liquid Handler using liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction with methyl-tert-butyl ether. Detection of total nebivolol (detection range 0.5 to 200 ng/mL) was carried out using ESI-MS in the positive mode on an API 4000. The quantification of <italic>d</italic>-nebivolol and <italic>l</italic>-nebivolol and total nebivolol was carried out at Forest Research Institute (Farmingdale, NY). The quantification of valsartan was carried out at Tandem Labs (Salt Lake City, UT) using protein precipitation and detection with ESI-MS in the positive ion mode. For each participant, concentration of <italic>d</italic>,<italic>l</italic>-nebivolol was calculated by adding the concentrations of both nonconjugated enantiomers; levels of nebivolol glucuronides were determined by subtracting the corresponding concentrations of nonconjugated <italic>d</italic>-nebivolol and <italic>l</italic>-nebivolol from the total nebivolol concentration (combined concentrations of conjugated and nonconjugated molecules).</p><p>Blood samples for determining the PRA and the concentration of angiotensin II were collected on days 1, 14, and 27 (0 hours before dose) and on days 7, 20, and 33 (0 hours before dose and at 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours after dose) and processed as explained above. PRA analysis was carried out at Quest Diagnostics using a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay. Plasma samples were incubated with a generation solution containing aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This solution also contained a double-isotope labeled angiotensin I degradation standard to correct for the degradation by other proteases. Once angiotensin I was generated, the samples were quenched and subjected to solid-phase extraction, and isolation and detection were performed with ESI-MS in the positive ion mode. The detection range of the PRA assay was 0.127&#x02013;129.651 ng&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Plasma angiotensin II levels were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay that was validated at Keystone Bioanalytical, Inc. This entailed partial purification of angiotensin II using phenyl solid-phase extraction columns and quantification through solid-phase immobilized epitope immunoassay. Optical density was read at 414 nm and the detection range was 1.955&#x02013;62.5 pg/mL. Aldosterone levels were determined from urine samples collected during 24-hour periods, beginning at 8:00 <sc>am</sc> (before dose) on days 1, 7, 13, 20, and 26 and were measured using validated HPLC-MS/MS at Keystone Bioanalytical. The assay entailed liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction for sample cleanup and detection with ESI-MS in the negative ion mode with a detection range of 0.1&#x02013;50.0 ng/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Safety and tolerability assessments</title><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed using descriptive statistics based on the Safety population.

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed, and natural-logarithm-transformed C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;,ss</sub> values were analyzed using analysis of variance (MIXED procedure), with treatment sequence, treatment, treatment period, and participant included in the model. The effect of treatment sequence was tested using participants nested within treatment sequence as the error term (&#x003b1; = 0.05, 2-sided). In addition, a 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the geometric means of C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;,ss</sub> between nebivolol plus valsartan (treatment C) and nebivolol alone (treatment A) was calculated, and T<sub>max,ss</sub> comparisons were performed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The criterion for no PK interaction effect was met if the 90% CIs around the geometric mean ratios for the C<sub>max,ss</sub> and AUC<sub>0-&#x003c4;</sub>, were within the range of 80%&#x02013;125%. Finally, the attainment of steady state was determined through visual inspection of the PK concentration profiles. Any plasma concentrations falling below the lower limit of quantification method were entered as zero.</p><p>The PD assessments comprised measurements of plasma concentration of angiotensin II, PRA, 24-hour urinary concentrations of aldosterone, and resting PR and BP. PD analyses were based on the Safety population, defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed for all PD parameters. All measures except for 24-hour urinary aldosterone levels were analyzed using a general longitudinal linear model with time (as a class variable with unstructured variance&#x02013;covariance matrix), treatment sequence, drug treatment, treatment period, and participant within treatment sequence as factors and baseline value as a covariate. A general linear model that included the same factors mentioned above, with the exception of baseline as a covariate, was used to analyze the 24-hour urinary aldosterone data. For angiotensin II and PRA, a paired <italic>t</italic> test was applied to compare the sum of the baseline-corrected AUCs after the single drug treatments with the AUCs after concomitant treatment. The values for angiotensin II and PRA were log transformed for both analyses. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.1.3.</p><p>The outcome measures of drug safety and tolerability comprised vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and electrocardiograms (screening, days 14 and 27 before dose, and study completion).
