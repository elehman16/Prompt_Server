The eCB system also has an important role in reward mechanisms, and nicotine addiction has been associated with aberrant reward processing. Motivated by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that eCB modulation of reward processing is altered in subjects with a nicotine addiction (NAD). For this purpose, we compared reward-related activity in NAD with healthy controls (HC) in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study using &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration to challenge the eCB system. Eleven HC and 10 NAD participated in a 3-T functional MRI (fMRI) study with a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design, using a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm with three reward levels. Reward activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen during anticipation and feedback of reward was compared after THC and placebo. fMRI results indicated a significant reduction of reward anticipation activity in the NAcc in NAD after THC administration, which was not present in HC. This is indicated by a significant group by drug by reward interaction. Our data show that THC significantly reduces the NAcc response to monetary reward anticipation in NAD. These results suggest that nicotine addiction is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds important human data to existing evidence implicating the eCB system in nicotine addiction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endocannabinoid system</kwd><kwd>functional MRI</kwd><kwd>nicotine addiction</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>THC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent estimates of the World Health Organization have shown that there are about 1.25 billion smokers worldwide and that five million deaths occur each year as a direct result of tobacco use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> This makes tobacco use one of the most important causes of preventable death worldwide.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system modulates the addictive properties of nicotine, the main addictive ingredient of tobacco, as well as several other drugs (see for review, refs.

Animal studies have shown that blocking the eCB receptor CB1 with the antagonist rimonabant reduces self-administration of nicotine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and relapse to nicotine seeking (as well as other drugs, such as cocaine and ethanol).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Nicotine withdrawal has been shown to be accompanied by fluctuations in the levels of the eCB anandamide (AEA) in several brain structures in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In humans, clinical trials have indicated that rimonabant can facilitate smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> The eCB system has also been widely implicated in the reward properties of non-drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> which has recently been supported by human neuroimaging studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Preclinical studies have, for instance, shown that CB1 receptor agonists can increase food intake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> whereas the CB1 antagonist rimonabant has been demonstrated to reduce obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and reduce striatal brain activity during reward processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> In addition, there is evidence of deficient reward processing in nicotine addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility that nicotine addiction may be associated with an altered interaction between the eCB system and reward processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> This paper presents the results of the first human neuroimaging study that tested the hypothesis that nicotine addiction is associated with abnormal involvement of the eCB system in reward processing. The study builds upon a previous study, in which a similar method was used to examine the involvement of the eCB system in reward processing in a healthy population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> As in the previous study, we performed a double&#x02013;blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study probing the brain reward system in which the eCB system was challenged with &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Importantly, in the current study, we compare the effects of THC on reward processing in a sample of subjects with a nicotine addiction (NAD) with a new sample of healthy controls (HC). Reward processing was assessed using a task based on the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> The MID is an established reward paradigm that provides the possibility of separate measures of brain activity related to anticipation of reward as well as to notification that the reward has been won. Previous studies using this paradigm have indicated that anticipation of a reward activates the ventral striatum, especially in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Image analyses were focused on the NAcc and caudate putamen (CPU), areas that have been implicated in addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> as well as reward processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Based on our hypothesis that nicotine addiction is associated with abnormal involvement of the eCB system in reward processing, we expect that THC administration has a stronger effect on the response of the brain to rewarding stimuli in NAD than in HC. We postulate that THC should enhance the brain response to natural rewards in HC, which is in line with previous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> We further expect the enhanced sensitivity to THC in NAD to lead to a maximized level of activity in the reward system, resulting in a significantly diminished additional response to natural rewards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><p>This study is part of the Pharmacological Imaging of the Cannabinoid System (PhICS) study.

The actual study consisted of 2 test days, separated by at least 2 weeks to allow for complete clearance of drugs. A standard breakfast or lunch was provided at the beginning of each test day, to ensure equal states of metabolism on both of the test days. Subjects were instructed not to use cannabis for at least 2 weeks before the first test day. Compliance was tested by means of a urine sample at the beginning of each test day. Venous blood samples were collected to determine plasma concentrations of THC and its two most important metabolites, 11-OH-THC and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC. Blood samples were processed according to methods published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Subjective effects were measured using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after each task, on a scale from &#x02212;100 to 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Drug administration</title><p>THC or placebo was administered at four time points by inhalation (&#x02018;breathing') using a Volcano vaporizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> (Storz and Bickel GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). Five minutes before administration, THC was vaporized at a temperature of 225&#x02009;&#x000b0;C into an opaque polythene bag equipped with a mouthpiece, preventing the loss of THC in between inhalations. Subjects inhaled the volume of this bag in 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;min, holding their breath for 10&#x02009;s after each inhalation. They were not allowed to speak during the inhalation process, which was practiced at screening using placebo. Vehicle (ethanol only) was used as a placebo. The first dose consisted of 6&#x02009;mg THC or placebo. To maintain equal levels of intoxication effects throughout the experiment, upload dosages of 1&#x02009;mg were used, 30&#x02009;min apart, in between scan sessions of different paradigms.</p></sec><sec><title>Task</title><p>To activate reward circuitry, an adapted version of the &#x02018;MID' task as developed by Knutson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> was used. In this task, subjects are required to press a button as fast as possible on seeing a target stimulus. Depending on the cue that precedes the target stimulus, subjects can win or lose a certain amount of money. After each trial in each condition, except neutral, subjects are given visual feedback, about the amount won or lost in that trial, as well as the total amount won (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Brain activity of both anticipation and feedback of reward and loss can be assessed with this task.</p><p>Our MID task had four conditions: neutral, reward (10 cents (&#x02018;small') or 5 euro (&#x02018;large')) or a loss (5 euro). There were 16 trials for the neutral and reward conditions, and 12 for the loss condition. The function of the loss trials was to prevent adaptation to rewards, and they were not meant to be included in the analysis. The reward earned by subjects was dependent on actual task performance.</p><p>The reward cue was presented for 0.5&#x02009;s, while the feedback was presented for 1.0&#x02009;s. A correct response (&#x02018;HIT') was defined as a response before the target disappeared. All other responses are considered incorrect (&#x02018;MISS'). Target presentation time was individually adapted in order to ensure close to 50&#x00025; correct responses for each subject, so that all subjects received comparable total rewards in both of the sessions. This was achieved by presenting half of the trials 200&#x02009;ms longer and half of the trails 150&#x02009;ms shorter than the subject's shortest reaction time (RT), based on 10 practice trials. The intervals between cue and target (the anticipation phase or &#x02018;ANT'), between target and feedback, as well as the inter-trial interval were varied to allow for event-related fMRI analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning parameters</title><p>Image acquisition was performed on a Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla MR scanner with a Quasar dual gradient set (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands).

This hypothesis was tested using an eCB challenge with THC in a pharmacological fMRI experiment. Subjective measures indicated that THC had a measurable effect on the mental state of our subjects. Both HC and NAD reported increased levels of &#x02018;feeling high', reduced alertness, reduced contentedness and external perception. Calmness was only significantly reduced in HC, but the level of the reduction was small.</p><p>We measured the functional response in NAcc and CPU to anticipation and feedback of monetary reward after placebo and THC in both of the groups. The key finding of the study was that HC and NAD showed opposite effects in NAcc response on monetary reward anticipation after THC administration. Although THC administration in NAD caused a significantly reduced NAcc response, in HC there was a slightly increased NAcc response. The effects appear to be similar but weaker in the CPU. First, there was also no significant difference in reward anticipation response in the placebo session. Second, we also found a significant lower anticipation response in NAD than in HC in the THC session. However, in CPU, unlike in NAcc, the difference between the placebo and the THC session was not significant.</p><p>These results support the notion that altered eCB dynamics in the context of reward processing have a role in nicotine addiction, adding human findings to the evidence that the eCB system is involved in nicotine addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Our expectation that THC would have an opposite effect on reward processing in HC and NAD appeared to be supported by the reward anticipation results in NAcc. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>, THC reduces brain activity in NAcc in NAD, whereas this effect appears to be opposite in HC.</p><p>Our results suggest that in nicotine addiction the eCB system may have a stronger influence on the reward system than in HC. In HC, the slight increase in reward anticipation activity (although by itself not significant) is in line with previous reports that indicate that administration of eCB antagonist Rimonabant can reduce rewarding effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> By contrast, the absence of an anticipatory NAcc response to monetary reward after THC in NAD suggests the possibility of a ceiling effect on activity in NAcc, which is not present in HC. If activity is strongly elevated by THC in NAD during baseline, this may leave less room for further elevation of activity by the monetary stimuli. This difference between HC and NAD could, therefore, be due to a maximized level of dopamine receptor occupation in NAD after THC due to reduced availability of dopamine D2 receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> In HC, THC also increases dopamine receptor occupancy, but as dopamine receptor availability is not compromised, there is room for a further increase in response to a monetary reward. In addition, it is also possible that nicotine addiction is associated with altered sensitivity to THC or non-dopaminergic mechanisms in NAcc (for example, Berridge and Kringelbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup>).</p><p>The abnormal NAcc response in NAD to monetary rewards after THC may be related to prodromal differences in eCB function, potentially constituting a predisposition to addiction. Activation of nicotinic receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area by nicotine is hypothesized to increase release of the eCB AEA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Functional mutations in the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and fatty acid amide hydrolyze genes (FAAH; the main enzyme that breaks down AEA) have been linked to rewarding effects of nicotine as well as other drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, marijuana and heroin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Inhibition of FAAH with a selective inhibitor URB 597 has been shown to enhance nicotine reward in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> This is hypothesized to be a direct result of increased levels of AEA. On the other hand, URB 597 has also been shown to neutralize rewarding effects of nicotine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> The proposed mechanisms for this effect is that AEA is protected from rapid degradation by URB597, resulting in increased activation of CB1 receptors. This reduces activation of dopaminergic neurons and release of dopamine from their terminals in the NAcc shell. It has been previously suggested that the different effects are dose related.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Although the exact working mechanisms may still be unknown, a recent review provides several convincing arguments for a direct link between the eCB system and addiction, associated with polymorphisms in the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and FAAH genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The current study is one of the first to add human brain imaging results to support this view.</p><p>Although the present study sample only included subjects with a nicotine addiction, the results may be relevant for other drug addictions as well. It is known that addiction to nicotine causes comparable reductions in striatal DA D2 receptor density as addiction to other drugs of abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> There is evidence suggesting an interaction between the eCB system and alcohol dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> In addition, animal studies have shown that chronic exposure to nicotine, alcohol and THC (but not cocaine) increases eCB levels in the limbic forebrain, including the NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> These results suggest the possibility of a general involvement of eCB in drug addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> However, whether our results can be extrapolated to addiction in general warrants further investigation.</p><p>In addition to the main finding, there were several other notable findings in this study.</p><p>Our results in the placebo session in HC support those previously found with the MID task, as previous studies using this paradigm have indicated that anticipation of an increasing reward evokes an increasing response that is most pronounced in NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup></p><p>Our results also showed feedback-related activity in HC in CPU that was reward-size dependent. However, in contrast to previous studies using the MID paradigm, we also found a near significant reward feedback activity in NAcc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> This finding is potentially related to the applied ROI-based analysis, which is more powerful than the more commonly applied voxel-wise analysis.</p><p>In contrast to some previous studies, we did not find a significant difference between HC and NAD in reward anticipation activity in NAcc after placebo. What may have influenced the NAcc results is the fact that all our subjects were occasional cannabis users, as well as that our HC were occasional smokers. Indeed, in a previous study, we found that NAD as well as cannabis users both showed a significantly reduced reward anticipation response in NAcc, compared with subjects who had never smoked or used cannabis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> It has to be noted, however, that previous results in this regard are inconsistent, as some have reported reduced response to monetary reward anticipation in nicotine addiction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> while others did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Likewise, reward studies using alcohol-dependent subjects also provide inconsistent results. Two studies have reported decreased activation in ventral striatum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> and one study showed normal activity during reward anticipation in the MID task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, NAD showed reduced feedback response in CPU, (and a trend for a similar effect in NAcc) after THC. This is also in line with the presented hypothesis that THC maximally activated the reward system in NAD, leaving less room for an additional response to monetary reward.</p><p>Behaviorally, we found that THC increased RT in HC as well as NAD. However, this effect was not reward dependent. The general effect of THC on RT is consistent with the reduced perceived alertness, measured with the VAS. Also, we did not find any group differences in the effect of THC on performance despite the difference in brain activity. There can be several explanations for this. The general slowing effect of THC, indicated by a significant main effect of drug on performance, may have introduced too much between-subject variation. Also, it is possible that reward-specific effects of THC are present but are too small to become significant owing to our relatively small sample. The RT effects do, however, appear to go in the same direction that can be expected based on the activity results, as the increase in RT in the largest reward condition is larger for NAD then for HC, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, we did not find an effect of THC on reward anticipation reactivity in CPU and NAcc in HC. Human imaging studies on these effects are sparse, and to our knowledge there is only one other study on this topic, also from our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> In that study, using a comparable experimental design, we also did not find a significant effect of THC on NAcc activity. It has to be noted, however, that NAcc showed low activity for all conditions in that study. In addition, Van Hell <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> did report significant striatal response to reward anticipation that also was not affected by THC. As the current study replicated this finding, the lack of effect of THC on reward anticipation in humans (not addicted to nicotine) appears to be a reliable finding. It has to be taken into account, however, that due to ethics protocol requirements, in both studies HC were infrequent nicotine users as well as infrequent cannabis users, as THC is typically mixed with tobacco. This in contrast to several other studies where HC were nicotine-free.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> This also may have reduced the difference between NAD and HC in the placebo session.</p><p>Our results may also have been influenced by the fact that NAD were nicotine-abstinent for about 3&#x02009;h when performing the experimental task. This period was needed to ensure absence of acute effects of nicotine. The possibility that subjects were experiencing some withdrawal effects at the time of testing can, however, not be excluded, as early effects of withdrawal have been reported within 60&#x02009;min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> However, responses to the VAS during scanning did not suggest effects of withdrawal in NAD.</p><p>Although our ROI analyses are not corrected for multiple comparison, we do not feel that we capitalized on chance, as we only tested two ROIs. Additionally, although the main three-way interaction in NAcc changes to near significance after correction for two ROIs (<italic>P</italic>=0.06), many of the follow-up ANOVA effects that drive this interaction do survive correction for two ROIs. In this study, a cannabinoid agonist was used to investigate the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system. Although this is a well-established method of studying cannabinoid function, a disadvantage is that cannabinoid agonists like THC can activate cannabinoid receptors everywhere in the brain, regardless of the endogenous activity of the system. Future experiments that make use of a cannabinoid antagonist could have an important role in confirming the role of the endogenous system in reward processing in addiction.</p><p>We did not test for differences between HC and NAD in impulsivity, anxiety and depression. Also, there was a trend that the average age of NAD was higher than HC in the current study. These variables may have influenced our results. However, it should be noted that potential group differences were not reflected in the VAS, except for a small effect in &#x02018;calmness', but this showed that in HC calmness was more reduced after THC. Also, target presentation time, which was based on the shortest RT in a task practice session, was not significantly different between HC and NAD, indicating that a potential group difference in impulsivity did not affect task performance.</p><p>As THC was dissolved in 100&#x02009;vol&#x00025; alcohol and the solvent was used as placebo, we cannot exclude that the inhalation of alcohol might have affected blood alcohol concentration. However, as only 600&#x02009;&#x003bc;l alcohol was administered, this is very unlikely. As a comparison, this amount is less than one-tenth of one alcoholic beverage.</p><p>In conclusion, our study showed that in NAD the NAcc response to reward anticipation is significantly reduced after THC administration, while the response in HC was the opposite. These results suggest that nicotine addiction is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds human findings to the existing evidence that identifies the eCB system as a therapeutic candidate for nicotine addiction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The PhICS study is performed within the framework of Top Institute Pharma, project number T5-107.
