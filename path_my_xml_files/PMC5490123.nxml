This may compromise patient cooperation, an important component of regional anesthesia. We decided to determine the efficacy of dexmedetomidine (0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h) for allaying procedural discomfort and ensuring their cooperation in patients undergoing surgery with subarachnoid block.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Setting:</title><p>Tertiary care center.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Sixty patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Class I and II posted for surgeries under subarachnoid block were randomized into two groups of 30 each to receive dexmedetomidine in a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg in both groups followed by continuous infusion of 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h in Group D 0.3 and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h in Group D 0.5.

Fear of being awake during surgery, fear of needle, and fear of numbness wearing off early were expressed as major factors for refusal of spinal anesthesia by patients. Multiple other reasons such as cold operating environment, new people, awkward positioning, and need to lie down in the supine position for longer periods may increase patient anxiety and reduce patient satisfaction (PS) with anesthesia care.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Adequate sedation during spinal anesthesia relieves the patient anxiety, improves physiological and psychological stress, and increases the satisfaction of both the surgeon and patient.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist with properties of analgesia, sympatholysis, and flexibility to titrate sedation without causing major respiratory depression. It is well suited for conscious sedation as patients can be quickly aroused and oriented on demand.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Various studies have analyzed the dose of dexmedetomidine which causes adequate sedation for patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia. However, there is a paucity of studies which analyze the dose of dexmedetomidine which ensures patient cooperation to independently position for subarachnoid block despite being adequately sedated and not being able to perceive stimulus of spinal needle prick. In addition, the patient's and surgeon's perspective on satisfaction with the anesthetic care is an important clinical indicator of the quality of perioperative care.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>We designed a study to analyze the level of sedation, ease of positioning, response to spinal needle insertion, and recall of the procedure with dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for patients undergoing surgery with subarachnoid block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized, double-blind prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care center over a period of 1 year. After approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee, 60 patients aged between 18 and 60 years, of American Society of Anesthesiologist's (ASA) physical status Class I and II, posted for elective surgeries under subarachnoid block were included in the study. Patients allergic to local anesthetics, with contraindications to central neuraxial blockade, patients with heart blocks, sinus bradycardia or on beta blockers, were excluded from the study.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent, all patients were premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.5 mg in the night and 0.5 mg in the morning of surgery. After ensuring 8 h nil per oral status, all patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg Ringer lactate solution in the preoperative holding area.</p><p>On arrival to operating room, baseline hemodynamic parameters were recorded, and the patients were randomized into two groups by a closed envelope technique. Group D 0.3 received dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus over 10 min followed by 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h intravenous infusion and Group D 0.5 received dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus over 10 min followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h intravenous infusions [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. To ensure blinding, the test solution was given intravenously by an assistant who was not involved in the administration of anesthesia and monitoring. Observer assessment of alertness/sedation scale (OASS): 5 - Responds readily to name spoken in normal tone, 4 - lethargic response to name spoken in normal tone, 3 -responds only after name is called loudly and/or repeatedly, 2 - responds only after mild prodding or shaking, and 1-Does not respond to mild prodding or shaking; was noted 3 min after giving the test drug, and patient was put into the lateral position. Ease of positioning for subarachnoid block (while turning the patient to the lateral position) was assessed by a three-point scale: 1- patient turned on his own, 2 - patient turned with the help of one person, and 3 - patient turned with the help of more than one person. With all strict aseptic precautions, neuraxial block was performed without using local infiltration. Response to spinal needle insertion was noted and graded by 4 - point score: 1- gross patient movement, 2 - back muscle contraction 3 - minimal patient movement, 4 - no patient movement. Then, the patient was placed in the supine position for surgery. Monitored parameters-Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded every 5 min. OASS was assessed every 5 min. The maintenance infusion was discontinued at the time of the last skin suture. In recovery area when the patient was fully awake, patient recall of the subarachnoid block procedure was quantified as yes or no. The PS and surgeon satisfaction (SS) were assessed on a five-point scale as: 5 - very happy, 4 - somewhat happy, 3 - neutral, 2 - not very happy, and1 - not at all happy.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-294-g001"/></fig><p>Adverse events such as bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min), bradypnea (RR &#x0003c;8 breaths/min), desaturation (SPO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;92%), hypertension (an increase in systolic blood pressure or MAP &#x0003e;20% of baseline), hypotension (drop in systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;20% of baseline or MAP &#x0003c;60 mmHg), nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, or any other event during or within 2 h of the procedure was noted. Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine sulfate 0.01 mg/kg, hypotension with intravenous fluid and if needed, intravenous mephentermine sulfate 3 mg bolus was administered. In case of bradypnea, patient was woken up and was asked to take deep breaths. If patient attains deep sedation or evidence of airway obstruction, the infusion was stopped, airway maintained by chin lift, and supplemental oxygen was administered.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In our pilot study, OASS of 4 was achieved in 50% of patients in Group D 0.3 and 85% patients in Group D 0.5.

Several drugs such as midazolam, ketamine, propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine have been used for this purpose in the past.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we have used dexmedetomidine in a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg in both the groups followed by continuous infusion of 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h in each group, respectively, to produce sedation.</p><p>In Group D 0.3, median OASS ranged between four and three which implicates that the patients were arousable by their names called out in a normal tone of voice. This indicates appropriate and desirable level of sedation. In Group D 0.5, the median OASS ranged between three and two which means that they were arousable only if the name was called out repeatedly or responded only after mild prodding or shaking. This indicates a higher level of sedation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Observer assessment of sedation score measures the level of alertness in subjects who are sedated, and its validity has been tested.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] A 95% effective single dose of dexmedetomidine was found to be 0.35 &#x003bc;g/kg in elderly and 0.57 &#x003bc;g/kg in young patients undergoing surgical procedures with spinal anesthesia in a prior study. According to the authors, the dose requirement of dexmedetomidine for adequate sedation under spinal anesthesia is relatively less because spinal anesthesia may increase the sensitivity to a sedative agent, explaining the low ED95 for an OAA/S sedation scale.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies conducted to determine the effective dose of dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation with spinal anesthesia describe and define patient comfort based only on sedation scores with very little emphasis on patient cooperation under sedation and response to spinal needle insertion.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The desirable level of sedation would be when the patient can turn for spinal anesthesia on his own or with minimal help and still neither feel the spinal needle prick nor recall the procedure in postoperative period. We studied the patient ability to cooperate for positioning to administer spinal anesthesia through ease of positioning score and found that there was no difference between the two groups. Majority of patients in both the groups (<italic>n</italic> = 17) turned on their own while some of them (<italic>n</italic> = 11) in each group had to be turned with the help of one person. Two patients in each group required two persons to turn them to position for spinal anesthesia [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><p>Response to spinal needle insertion was recorded to assess patient comfort during the procedure of spinal anesthesia. Majority of patients in Group D 0.3 (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and Group D 0.5 (<italic>n</italic> = 18) had no movement in response to spinal needle insertion. Gross patient movement was noted in three patients in Group D 0.3 and none of the patients in Group D 0.5. The difference was statistically comparable between the two groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. However, none of the patients had a recall of spinal needle prick in postoperative period. Postspinal backache and needle prick pain were found to be the most common causes of refusal for spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] By achieving adequate sedation before the administration of spinal anesthesia patient comfort was ensured.</p><p>Trends in HR and mean arterial pressure show a decrease in both the groups although there was no statistically significant difference found between the two groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. This could be because both the groups received a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and bradycardia is seen with higher doses of dexmedetomidine (1&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;g/kg).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Subsequent hypotension is also related to the loading dose and is mainly due to blockade of central sympathetic outflow.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>RR and SPO<sub>2</sub> changes were minimal and statistically insignificant in both the groups. This could be because dexmedetomidine offers a unique ability of providing both sedation and analgesia without respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>PS is a major indicator of quality of healthcare provided.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Hence, we decided to evaluate overall PS with anesthetic care and found that most of the patient in Group D 0.3 (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and Group D 0.5 (<italic>n</italic> = 16) were happy; however, satisfaction score was higher in Group D 0.5 as compared to Group D 0.3 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. This could be because sedation was initiated before performing subarachnoid block and continued throughout the surgery. SS score was found &#x0201c;somewhat happy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;very happy&#x0201d; in majority of cases in both the groups with no statistically significant difference between the two groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>]. This is unique to our study, and it indirectly indicates that patients were well sedated and did not have spontaneous movements which may interfere with surgical procedure.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/h produces effective sedation in patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia while ensuring patient cooperation for positioning and without any recall of the procedure in postoperative period.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name><name><surname>Athiraman</surname><given-names>UK</given-names></name><name><surname>Jahagirdar</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sripriya</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Parthasarathy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravishankar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of efficacy of three subanesthetic doses of ketamine in allaying procedural discomfort during establishment of subarachnoid block: A randomized double-blind trial</article-title><source>Saudi J Anaesth</source><year>2015</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>55</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25558200</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Sedation and Analgesia by Non-Anesthesiologists.
