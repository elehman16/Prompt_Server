However, optimal mydriasis and anaesthesia remain fundamental for maximising the safety of the procedure and patient comfort intraoperatively. The standard topical regimen (ie, multiple drops of mydriatics and anaesthetics) presents several disadvantages. Topical drops need to be instilled repeatedly prior to surgery to ensure adequate intraoperative mydriasis, which is time consuming, can cause medication errors, ocular surface toxicity and even cardiovascular side effects.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Maintaining adequate mydriasis during the entire procedure can be problematic, and inadequate pupil size or intraoperative pupil miosis may jeopardise the quality of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Hence, there is a need to optimise the preparatory steps that facilitate the technical aspects of surgery and the surgical manoeuvres.</p><p>Intracameral (IC) administration of mydriatics is an alternative to the traditional topical regimen for cataract surgery. Pilot studies have reported the safety and efficacy of various custom blended, ad hoc IC formulations, mixed on-site, containing phenylephrine and cyclopentolate or tropicamide for cataract surgery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Studies using IC anaesthetic reported increased patient comfort, especially during IOL implantation, and greater surgeon satisfaction.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Thus, a combination of IC mydriatics and anaesthetics, injected after instillation of anaesthetic eye drops, could combine advantages of both techniques and result in improved mydriasis and greater surgeon and patient comfort intraoperatively. As custom preparation just prior to surgery is time consuming and prone to medication errors, a ready-to-use standardised injectable solution, prepared according to industrial quality controls, may be beneficial. Mydrane (Laboratoires Th&#x000e9;a, Clermont-Ferrand, France) is the first standardised preservative-free ophthalmic combination of mydriatics and anaesthetic for IC administration, just prior to beginning cataract surgery. Mydrane is intended for rapid and stable mydriasis and sustained intraocular anaesthesia during surgery. In this phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of IC Mydrane to a standard regimen of topical drops for phacoemulsification and IOL implantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This multicentre, international, randomised, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and safety of IC Mydrane (Mydrane group) to a standard topical regimen (reference group) for cataract surgery. Mydrane is a proprietary injectable salt-balanced and pH-balanced solution of two mydriatics (tropicamide 0.02% and phenylephrine 0.31%) and one anaesthetic agent (lidocaine 1%) for IC delivery just prior to beginning cataract surgery. The standard topical regimen was tropicamide 0.5% (Mydriaticum 0.5%; Laboratoires Th&#x000e9;a) and phenylephrine 10% (Neosynephrine 10% Faure; Laboratoires Europhta, Monaco). The hypothesis was that Mydrane was non-inferior to the standard topical regimen for inducing mydriasis to perform capsulorhexis without any additional mydriatics or pupil-expanding devices.</p><p>This study was conducted between September 2011 and February 2013 at 68 investigational centres in nine countries (see online supplementary appendix). Eligible patients were aged 40&#x02013;88&#x02005;years old, scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation under topical anaesthesia with clear self-sealing corneal incisions. Only one eye per patient could be included in this study. At the selection visit, a pupil diameter of at least 7&#x02005;mm had to be obtained within 30&#x02005;min following instillation of one drop of tropicamide 0.5% and one drop of phenylephrine 10% (maximum of three combined instillations at 10&#x02005;min intervals, if necessary), otherwise, the patient was excluded. Main non-inclusion criteria were a history of intraocular surgery or combined procedures, iatrogenic, traumatic or congenital cataract, corneal, epithelial, stromal or endothelial residual or progressive corneal disease, history of ocular trauma, infection or inflammation within the previous three&#x02005;months, pseudoexfoliation and exfoliation syndrome.</p><p>The randomisation procedure for assigning patients into the Mydrane group or reference group is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307587F1">figure 1</xref>.

The same regimen of tetracaine 1% (1&#x02013;2 drops of Tetracaine Faure, Laboratoires Europhta; 1 and 5&#x02005;min preoperatively) was used in both groups to allow povidone-iodine cleansing of the eyelids before the first incision (start of surgery) and to determine whether there was a difference in comfort between groups.

Pupil diameter measurement was centralised and performed by independent and masked operators using VLC media player software (VideoLAN Non-Profit Organization, Paris, France). Pupil diameter was measured on screen captures taken at five specific stages during surgery: just before the corneal incision (T1), just before injection of viscoelastic (Duovisc; Alcon, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) (T2), just before capsulorhexis (T3), just before IOL insertion (T4) and just before cefuroxime injection (end of surgery, T5). The measurement of pupil diameters was as follows. First, the real horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID) (ie, horizontal white-to-white measurement) was measured during the selection visit with a surgical calliper (precision=0.1&#x02005;mm). Then, the exact pupil size during surgery was obtained using the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2015-307587ueq1.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula></p><p>Corrective factor=real HVID/HVID on photograph.</p><p>All other medications used to obtain and maintain mydriasis or anaesthesia preoperatively or intraoperatively were noted.

Thus, the mITT Set was an intention-to-treat (ITT) Set excluding eyes that received treatment that could have influenced the quality of mydriasis. Anaesthesia assessments were primarily analysed in all randomised patients who used the study medications and who did not receive any additional anaesthetic before the start of surgery (mITT-An Set). Safety analyses were performed on all patients for whom there was evidence they received study medications (Safety Set). The per protocol (PP) Set were all patients in the mITT Set without any major protocol violation.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for the quantitative variables, and frequency distribution for the categorical variables. The quality of mydriasis was first tested for non-inferiority. If the latter test was significant, the major secondary efficacy end point was tested for superiority. As a closed testing procedure was used, no adjustment for the nominal alpha level for each test was necessary. The overall type I error was strongly controlled at the usual two-sided 0.05 level. For the primary efficacy variable, the non-inferiority was claimed at the usual 0.05 two-sided level if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the between-group difference in responder rates was not &#x0003c;&#x02212;7.5%. Superiority tests (analysis of variance, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenzel (CMH) tests based on modified ridit scores or Fisher's exact test) were used for between-group comparisons of other efficacy and safety variables. Statistical tests were two-sided at the 5% level of significance.</p><p>For the primary variable, patients with missing assessments at T3 were classified as non-responders. Missing anaesthesia assessments at T4 and T5 were replaced by the last available assessment (from T2). For other efficacy criteria, missing data were not replaced.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of 591 randomly selected patients, 36 (6.1%) patients were excluded preoperatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2015307587F1">figure 1</xref>) due to unexpected events (eg, did not fulfil exclusion criteria, patients cited personal reasons) or they withdrew consent just prior to surgery.

The active components, concentrations and volumes in the Mydrane formulation were based on the efficacy and safety of other IC formulations used for phacoemulsification cataract surgery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This randomised clinical trial showed that IC administration of a ready-to-use, standardised combination of mydriatics and anaesthetic (Mydrane) just after the first incision produces rapid and adequate mydriasis (mean pupil size &#x02265;7.5&#x02005;mm after viscoelastic injection throughout the surgery), allowing phacoemulsification cataract surgery in conditions at least as effective as the standard topical regimen. Additionally, the presence of lidocaine 1% in Mydrane led to improved intraoperative anaesthesia, with lower patient discomfort during IOL insertion (the most active phase of surgery) compared with the standard topical regimen. Surgeons were statistically significantly more satisfied with the IOL insertion step in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group. Preoperative time was much lower in the Mydrane group as there was no requirement for topical drops preoperatively or subsequent monitoring of the patient. Immediately postoperatively the global surgeon grading was higher with Mydrane compared with the reference topical regimen.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Preoperative preparation</title><p>Interestingly, sparing patients the discomfort of intensive topical mydriatics preoperatively was considered a significant benefit by patients in previous studies of custom blended, IC formulations, prepared on-site.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> IC administration just after the first incision resulted in a considerable reduction in preoperative preparation without significantly increasing the duration of surgery. Perhaps the considerable reduction in time spent in the preoperative room and surgical suite can lead to a less stressful experience for patients in the Mydrane group. IC administration is expected to improve patient flow and surgical team efficiency. In this study, the duration of the entire procedure (from the instillation of first topical drops to the end of the surgery) decreased by about 30&#x02005;min in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group. The time between the first incision and cefuroxime injection increased by 3&#x02005;min in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group. This small difference was due to the study protocol that required a wait of 1.5&#x02005;min after the administration of Mydrane and another 1.5&#x02005;min were due instrument handling. The decrease in total presurgical and surgical time may result in a more cost-effective cataract surgery. For example, nurses and operating room technicians may spend less time administering topical drops preoperatively. Additionally, more patients could be scheduled on surgical days due to the faster turnover of patients.</p><p>In the current study, the lead investigators for each country reached the consensus that topical instillation at 30&#x02005;min preoperatively was sufficient for pupil dilation. This decision concurs with the pupil dilation protocol accepted by the European Drug Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, intraoperative miosis is a risk regardless of the duration between preoperative topical instillation of mydriatics and beginning of surgery. Intraoperative miosis has been observed in protocols dictating instillation of topical mydriatics longer than 30&#x02005;min preoperatively.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Efficacy of Mydrane in achieving mydriasis</title><p>Capsulorhexis is a key step for the quality of the phacoemulsification and is strongly associated to the quality of mydriasis. Therefore, we elected to choose the time T3 (ie, just before the capsulorhexis) as the most relevant surgical step (primary end point) to evaluate the efficacy of Mydrane. Hence, the non-inferiority of the Mydrane to the reference topical treatment was established based on the rate of surgeons who performed capsulorhexis without using additional mydriatics (or pupil-widening manoeuvres). Currently, in cataract surgery, a planned capsulotomy diameter of 5.0&#x02005;mm requires an optimal pupil size of 6.0&#x02005;mm to account for a 0.5&#x02005;mm circumferential safety zone. In the Mydrane group, the rate of capsulorhexis performed without the use of additional mydriatics (or pupil-widening manoeuvres) and with a pupil size of at least 6&#x02005;mm just prior to capsulorhexis was very high (96.8%) and similar to the reference group.</p><p>In this study, surgeons subjectively considered the pupil size with Mydrane was more than adequate with stable mydriasis to safely perform cataract surgery. The surgeons found that IOL implantation was less challenging in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group with more cases of IOL implantation considered &#x02018;slightly challenging&#x02019; or &#x02018;challenging&#x02019; in the reference group (p=0.047). Once dilated, the pupil size remained stable in the Mydrane group with a mean size of approximately 7.50&#x02005;mm from viscoelastic injection until the end of surgery. These outcomes concur with a Swedish study of an IC formulation mixed on-site that reported a slightly lower pupil size at the end of surgery (approximately 6.5&#x02005;mm).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The differing results might be due to an additive effect of tropicamide contained in Mydrane. Notably, we found decreased mydriasis intraoperatively in the reference group. This drawback of the topical drop regimen has been previously documented.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Efficacy of Mydrane in improving comfort and patient satisfaction</title><p>The inclusion of lidocaine in Mydrane supplements the effect of topical anaesthetic, producing better intraoperative anaesthesia. The anaesthetic agent in Mydrane is a response to a medical need suggested by the off-label use of IC anaesthetics to improve patient comfort intraoperatively. In some cases, preoperative instillation of topical anaesthesia may be insufficient during surgery, especially during IOL insertion.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies evaluating intraoperative pain and patient satisfaction with topical anaesthesia alone compared with topical anaesthesia and adjunctive IC anaesthesia for phacoemulsification found that additional IC 1% lidocaine significantly decreased patient perception of intraoperative pain, increased patient cooperation and decreased the degree to which patients were bothered by surgical manoeuvres.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Hence, adjunctive unpreserved IC 1% lidocaine improves the effect of topical anaesthesia.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Previous studies have shown that 1% IC lidocaine does not cause endothelial cell toxicity,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> induces serum concentrations of lidocaine below a minimum detectable level<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and does not diffuse into the posterior segment (even with 500&#x02005;&#x003bc;L injection).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> An additional benefit is the mild mydriatic effect of IC lidocaine.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The intraocular anaesthesia due to Mydrane likely resulted in statistically significantly less discomfort (pain or sensation of pressure) during IOL insertion in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group (p=0.034; CMH test). Patient comfort was similar between groups for the other stages of surgery. Only one patient (0.4%) in the Mydrane group received an additional anaesthetic treatment after the start of surgery compared with four patients (1.7%) in the reference group. Patient cooperation during cataract surgery is crucial for performing the optimal surgical manoeuvres during capsulorhexis to IOL implantation. The additive effect of intraocular anaesthesia with Mydrane may have enhanced patient cooperation. This observation likely explains why surgeons considered IOL implantation less difficult in the Mydrane group.</p><p>Patient pain at 1&#x02005;week and ocular irritation/burning/stinging at 4&#x02005;weeks were statistically lower in the Mydrane group compared with the reference group. Possibly, IC administration reduces the need for preoperative eye drops, mitigating corneal toxicity and ocular surface damage. However, the reference group received multiple eye drops preoperatively and intraoperatively, which may increase the risk of developing corneal damage in the early postoperative period. This greater propensity towards ocular surface damage could make patients in the reference group less resistant to AEs related to topical steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commonly prescribed to prevent postoperative inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Safety of the constituents of IC Mydrane</title><p>Mydrane contains two mydriatics, a parasympatholytic (tropicamide 0.02%) and a sympathomimetic (phenylephrine 0.31%). Tropicamide was included due to the reduced cardiovascular risk<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and faster recovery (6&#x02005;h vs 24&#x02005;h) compared with other parasympatholytic agents, including cyclopentolate. The concentration of the constituents in Mydrane is very low compared with topical mydriatics, which should ensure greater safety and lower side effects. Notably, we found the changes in heart rate and blood pressure were similar between groups for the duration of this study (data not included). Similar cardiovascular outcomes have been reported in a comparison of cataract surgery with IC or topical mydriatics.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, a previous comparison reported a statistically significant decrease in pulse rate in patients who received topical mydriatics compared with IC mydriatics for cataract surgery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The relatively low concentration (0.31%) of phenylephrine in the Mydrane formulation likely mitigated any cardiac or systemic events.</p><p>An advantage of IC mydriatics or anaesthetics is the substantially increased bioavailability resulting in decreased systemic absorption.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Additionally, washout of the IC Mydrane was performed with a viscoelastic injection once maximal mydriasis was achieved, further mitigating the risk of systemic side effects. The outcomes of this study indicate that IC administration of Mydrane was safe intraoperatively and postoperatively out to 1&#x02005;month. The incidence of ocular AE related to the treatment (or with an unknown relationship) was below 3% in both groups. Our results with Mydrane are consistent with studies of IC lidocaine alone. Endothelial cell loss observed in the Mydrane group was similar to the reference group and was also consistent with the range of loss (4.3&#x02013;16.8%) reported after routine phacoemulsification cataract surgery.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

A previous study<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> reported 3.8% of 106 eyes developed macular oedema after cataract surgery. There were no serious AEs requiring hospitalisation or resulting in permanent visual loss in both groups in our study. This is especially important as this is the first large-scale study of a unique IC combination (Mydrane) that has been produced via standardised manufacturing practices. This outcome concurs with previous studies of IC lidocaine, IC mydriatics and on-site formulations blended for IC use that reported no difference in AEs between IC and topical administration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>A drawback of the present study was that a double-blind comparison was not feasible because the test treatment differed from the reference treatment in several aspects (dose regimen, packaging and administration route). To overcome this limitation, screen captures from the video recording were centrally reviewed by two independent observers masked to the route of administration or the type of medications. We believe the rigorous conservative methods used for pupil size assessments in this study increase the overall strength of the conclusions. This initial clinical trial enrolled a relatively homogeneous population of patients with cataract who responded well to mydriatics preoperatively. This inclusion represents the &#x02018;real world&#x02019; clinical experience in the vast majority of patients undergoing cataract surgery. However, our results cannot be extrapolated to the minority of patients with cataract with poor pupil dilation such as those with long-standing diabetes, exfoliation syndrome, posterior iris synechiae or a history of treatments potentially inducing intraoperative floppy iris syndrome. In this study, the ITT analysis mitigated overoptimistic estimates of the efficacy mydriasis and anaesthesia induced by Mydrane due to the removal of non-compliers. Some consider this analysis too cautious,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and hence, our outcomes may be considered understated. However, this was an international, multicentre trial including surgical centres and hospital-based clinics. The various worldwide locations and the types of centres and varying surgeon experience mean the results of this study are directly applicable to&#x02014;and more indicative of&#x02014;actual clinical practice.</p><p>Additionally, due to ethical concerns, the inclusion/exclusion criteria dictated that only patients with a normal response to topical tropicamide plus phenylephrine were selected. This excluded patients who may have difficulty achieving mydriasis and more technically challenging surgical cases. However, this is not a limitation in daily practice as Mydrane is applicable to patients with a good mydriatic response, which comprise the majority of patients in clinical practice. Additionally, the mydriatic response can be easily assessed during the dilated retinal exam at the screening visit. Hence, the incorporation of Mydrane into the surgical routine will not add an extra step for patients.</p><p>A final drawback of the present study is that 1-month outcomes may not necessarily be indicative of longer-term outcomes. However, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mydriatic and anaesthetic properties of Mydrane to determine its suitability for cataract surgery. Based on this objective, we believe the 1-month period is appropriate for this evaluation because (i) postoperative follow-up by most cataract surgeons is 1&#x02005;month; (ii) the potentially severe AEs of Mydrane (mostly toxicity on endothelial cells and macula, and bacterial contamination) were typically expected within days to weeks postoperatively; (iii) the patients included in the study and presenting with an AE had to be regularly followed following good clinical practice requirements and (iv) the long-term AEs of cataract surgery (ie, retinal breaks and detachments) are related to the surgical procedure rather than to the products used preoperatively or intraoperatively.</p><p>In conclusion, this evaluation of Mydrane indicates that it is efficacious and safe for IC injection just prior to beginning cataract surgery in patients with satisfactory pupil dilation as checked during the preoperative visit. Mydrane may have potential advantages in terms of rapidly achieving mydriasis, maintaining a stable pupil size during surgery and satisfactory patient comfort during intraocular manipulation. This ready-to-use combination of mydriatics and anaesthetics appears to be a simple approach. In addition to shortening the length of time the patient spends in the clinic on the surgical day, Mydrane may allow better patient flow in the operating room.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bjophthalmol-2015-307587-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1581" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it was published Online First.
