Most of inmate adolescents with aggressive behaviors suffer from ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). There is an elevated level of subcortical aggression in ADHD subjects in comparison to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). In addition, the symptom of impulsivity is found in many children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). The reason of high rate of aggression in ADHD is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Aggression can be classified into two groups: overt aggression, such as physical aggression and covert aggression, such as lying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>).</p><p>Hyperactivity is associated with physical aggression leading to poorer peer functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). Moreover, aggression in children with ADHD is associated with both overall ADHD symptom severity and the hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). While a review article reported that the first choice of medication for treating aggression in ADHD is the medication used for treating ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>), a recently published clinical trial reported that it needs to be examined whether treating the core symptoms of ADHD decreases the associated emotional and behavioral symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>). Meanwhile, both articles emphasized that more research is needed to investigate treating aggression in ADHD.</p><p>Folic acid is normally found in many foods such as spinach, beans and liver. It is a B vitamin. There are no serious side effects after taking folate. Some of the side effects of taking folic acid are: nausea, decrease of appetite, irritability, and boating. These adverse effects are usually self-limited and can be managed easily by modulation of its dosage. The therapeutic dosage for treating folic acid deficiency in children is 1 mg per day which can be taken orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intravenously. The therapeutic dosage of folic acid for maintenance therapy is about 0.5 mg/day.</p><p>ADHD, especially inattentive type is strongly associated with lower level of folate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). This association is independent of age and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). Moreover, higher hyperactivity and peers relations problem in offspring are associated with lower maternal folate red blood cell and total folate in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). In addition, folic acid improves restless leg syndrome which is very common in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>).</p><p>Folate administration is suggested for managing aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>). Folate deficiency is associated with aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). Since, no clinical trial study was found in this regard, conducting a clinical trial on this matter is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, stimulants are commonly administered for treating ADHD. Emotional problems, sleep problems, decreased appetite, and irritability are among common adverse effects of stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>). It is supposed that stimulants affect through dopamine system. Folic acid increases monoamines such as dopamine in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>).</p><p>According to a recently published review article, while aggressive behavior in ADHD is commonly reported, its reason or neurobiology is not clearly known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Stimulants and behavior therapy decrease aggression in about half of the children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). However, many of these children do not respond to stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>). In addition, the investigation of treatment for management of aggression in ADHD is highly recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>).</p><p>Current randomized placebo controlled clinical trial examines the effect and safety of folic acid as an adjuvant for treating aggression and the core symptoms of ADHD in children with ADHD.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0001"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The participants of this study were a clinical sample of children and adolescents with ADHD diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- Fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria. Assessment interviews were conducted by a board certified child and adolescent psychiatrist.</p><p>To examine the effect of folic acid on treating aggression, it was estimated that a sample of 28 participants (14 children in each group) was needed to provide 90% power to detect a difference in aggression score of 5 and SD = 4 with a P-value less than 0.05.</p><p>The children and adolescents were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to folic acid (5mg/day) or placebo group, and were assessed 3 times. The first assessment was conducted at baseline for consenting and screening. The follow up assessments were conducted on day 30 and day 60. Follow up phone calls were done for those subjects who were not visited in the clinic until the end of the study. All the patients in both groups took methylphenidate 10 mg/day for children less than 25 kg, and 20 mg for children over than 24 kg, which was administered in two divided doses.</p><p>Inclusive criteria were: being identified as a case with ADHD according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria; children with the age range of 5 or 16 years; children and parents who provided informed assent/consent.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: self-reported allergic reaction to folic acid; kidney disease; estimated mental retardation and mild pervasive developmental disorder; being on dialysis, infection; anemia; being alcoholic; epilepsy; taking medications such as phenytoin, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline; barbiturates such as phenobarbital; and antieplielptic medication such as phenytoin or primidone; a diagnosed psychotic disorder and mood disorder; other conditions that preclude participation (or increase risk) in the clinical trial (Type 1 diabetes mellitus; metabolic diseases, gastro-intestinal disorders affecting nutrient absorption, cancer); extensive use of nutritional folic acid supplements within the previous 3 months; and behavior therapy or any other psychotherapy in the last three months or during this study.</p><p>The primary scale for impulsivity was the Persian version of DSM-IV based parents&#x02019; ADHD rating questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>) which consisted of three questions. The answers were scored from 0 to 3, with higher score showing a worse condition.</p><p>The modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was used to measure aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>). This scale assesses four types of aggression including: verbal aggression, physical aggression against people, physical aggression against property or objects, and aggression against self (self-injurious behavior). This scale also considers duration and starting and finishing times of aggression. The severity of aggression was also assessed. A weighted score was assigned to the most severe form of aggressive behavior in each subscale. Then, the weighted scores were summed up to provide a total score.</p><p>Persian version of the 23-item PedsQL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 4.0 Generic Core Scales was used to measure the quality of life children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>). We assessed the two aspects of emotional functioning and social functioning; in this scale higher score represents worse condition of quality of life.</p><p>Children and the rater were blind to the treatment group. The study was conducted with the approval of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents and children.</p><sec id="S20002"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare age, the difference of mean total inattentiveness score during the trial, and the difference of mean total hyperactivity/impulsivity score during the trial between the two groups. Gender ratio was compared between the groups using Fisher's exact test. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine the effect of interventions on impulsivity, and aggression. The variables of hyperactivity and inattentiveness were considered as covariates. A significance level of .05 was set.</p><p>We performed the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation method. The patients who completed one month of the trial and had at least one assessment after the baseline evaluation were included in ITT analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Result</title><p>Out of 58 children with ADHD, 49 agreed to participate.

Verbal aggression decreased markedly in both groups. It means that there is no evidence for superior effect of folic acid over placebo in the treatment of ADHD symptoms and the different types of aggressive behaviors in children with ADHD. These results seem to be in line with review articles which concluded that ADHD medications should be administered for treating aggression in ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>).</p><p>In this study, quality of life, and emotional and social functioning were improved in both groups. However, current evidence does not support that administering folic acid improves the quality of life more than placebo.</p><p>The sample size of the current study was small and the results may be susceptible to sampling error or random effect. The rate of dropout was high. We are not sure if the exacerbation of ADHD symptoms or aggression had been as a high rate of drop out. The trend toward efficacy for the total aggression score separates folic acid and placebo group. However, the trend of efficacy on the types of aggression was not markedly different.</p><p>In addition, duration of the current study was relatively short, 8 weeks. Therefore, long-term safety was not guaranteed. Therefore, more time may be required to show folic efficacy. Another reason for negative results may be the low administered dose of MPH. In addition, current results were obtained from a single center. An approach to treat aggression in ADHD is to target co-morbid disorders. However, in the current study, those children with bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, and major depressive disorder were not included. The folic acid level of serum was not assessed. However, no other published trial was found on examining the efficacy of folic acid on ADHD and aggressive behavior.</p><p>It should be mention that folic acid was well tolerated. There was no markedly increase in the rate of adverse effect in the folic acid group.</p><p>In conclusion, this preliminary report suggests that MPH improves ADHD core symptoms. Moreover, current results suggest that MPH may non-significantly decrease aggression in children with ADHD. However, folic acid augmentation adds noting to MPH efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation
