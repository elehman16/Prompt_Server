Insulin glargine was added and systematically titrated during a 12-week run-in, after which candidates with fasting glucose &#x02264;7.8 mmol/L and HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7&#x02013;9% were randomized to lixisenatide 20 &#x000b5;g or placebo for 24 weeks while insulin titration continued. The primary end point was HbA<sub>1c</sub> change after randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The randomized population (<italic>n</italic> = 446) had mean diabetes duration of 9.2 years, BMI 31.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and daily glargine dosage of 44 units. HbA<sub>1c</sub> had decreased during run-in from 8.6 to 7.6%; adding lixisenatide further reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.71 vs. 0.40% with placebo (least squares mean difference, &#x02013;0.32%; 95% CI, &#x02013;0.46 to &#x02013;0.17; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

For those patients not fully successful with this regimen, the approach to treatment intensification is of current interest, especially with regard to improving control of postprandial hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Adding one or more injections of rapid-acting insulin with meals is effective for many patients but has drawbacks, including increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Another recently available option is addition of a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to previous oral and basal insulin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Currently available GLP-1RAs are twice-daily exenatide (Byetta), once-daily liraglutide (Victoza), and once-weekly exenatide (Bydureon). Each has a glucose-dependent insulinotropic and glucagon-reducing effect, promotes satiety, and seldom causes hypoglycemia when used alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, short-acting exenatide appears more effective in controlling postprandial glucose (PPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whereas long-acting preparations, such as liraglutide and once-weekly exenatide, have greater effects on fasting hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Lixisenatide is a novel GLP-1RA that shares the main features of these agents but has a profile of action that appears intermediate between short-acting exenatide and longer-acting agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Lixisenatide is effective administered once-daily yet retains the ability to reduce PPG, an effect associated with slowing of gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding lixisenatide in the problematic subgroup of people with type 2 diabetes who have relatively acceptable control of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) after initiating and titrating basal insulin but have HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels remaining persistently elevated (&#x02265;7.0%).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This phase III study (NCT00975286) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group protocol conducted from October 2009 to August 2011 in 140 centers in 25 countries. It included a 12-week run-in phase, during which insulin glargine was started and titrated, and a 24-week randomized treatment period for participants who were eligible after the run-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2462/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees of the participating centers, and it was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization&#x02013;Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent. An independent Data Monitoring Committee supervised conduct of the study. The Allergic Reaction and Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committees performed masked adjudication of possible events in these categories.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Adults with type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year at the time of screening were eligible. Entry criteria included the following: use of metformin at a stable dose of at least 1.5 g/day for at least 3 months alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea or glinide or a thiazolidinedione (TZD), or a combination of these; HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0 and &#x02264;10% (&#x02265;53 to &#x02264;86 mmol/mol); and BMI &#x0003e;20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included the following: use of oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents other than metformin, sulfonylureas, glinides, and TZDs within 3 months; use of weight-loss drugs if not at a stable dose for &#x02265;3 months; history of hypoglycemia unawareness, gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged nausea, and vomiting; and hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or allergic reaction to any GLP-1RAs. After enrollment, participants continued metformin and a TZD if previously used but stopped any secretagogue. Morning administration of insulin glargine was started at 10 units daily and was titrated weekly, targeting a fasting range of 4.4&#x02013;5.6 mmol/L (80&#x02013;100 mg/dL). At completion of the 12-week run-in, participants were eligible for randomization if they had HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7% and &#x02264;9% (&#x02265;53 and &#x02264;75 mmol/mol) and fasting self-measurement of plasma-referenced glucose (SMPG) for the past 7 days averaging &#x02264;7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) early in the trial or &#x02264;7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) after a protocol amendment in July 2010.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Eligible participants were centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to add either lixisenatide or injectable placebo to their current regimens. Lixisenatide or placebo was packaged in accordance with the centrally generated randomized treatment kit number list. Corresponding treatment numbers for each randomized participant were allocated using a centralized interactive voice response system. Investigators did not have access to the randomization code, the bioanalyst was blinded, the Allergic Reaction Assessment Committee reviewed and adjudicated allergic reactions, and the Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee reviewed and adjudicated major cardiovascular events in a blinded manner. Randomization was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> values after the run-in (&#x0003c;8%, &#x02265;8% [64 mmol/mol]) and TZD use (yes or no). A two-step dosage increase was used with both placebo and lixisenatide (10 &#x003bc;g for 1 week, 15 &#x003bc;g for 1 week, and then 20-&#x003bc;g maintenance dosage if tolerated), with injections self-administered by participants &#x02264;1 h before breakfast. Adjustment of dosage of insulin glargine was permitted throughout randomized treatment targeting fasting SMPG 4.4&#x02013;5.6 mmol/L (80&#x02013;100 mg/dL). Rescue therapy with short-acting insulin was permitted through week 8 if FPG was repeatedly &#x0003e;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or if HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x0003e;9.0% (75 mmol/mol), and after week 8 if FPG was &#x0003e;10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) or if HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x0003e;8.5% (69 mmol/mol).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Efficacy and safety measurements</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was the absolute change of HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to week 24. Continuous secondary efficacy variables included the following: the change from baseline to week 24 in 2-h PPG and blood glucose excursions during a standardized breakfast meal test; seven-point plasma-calibrated SMPG; FPG; body weight; and average daily insulin glargine dosage. Measurements of body weight, insulin dosage, FPG, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were recorded at baseline, at end point, and at intervals throughout the trial. The standardized breakfast meal (Ensure Plus drink; Abbott) contained 600 kcal and was consumed within a 15-min period 30 min after study drug administration. The PPG measurements were assessed 2 h after the meal, and the blood glucose excursion was calculated as the 2-h PPG&#x02013;plasma glucose 30 min before the meal test before administration of lixisenatide or placebo. Additional categorical secondary efficacy variables included the percentage of participants achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &#x0003c;7% or &#x02264;6.5% (&#x0003c;53 or &#x02264;48 mmol/mol) at week 24 and the percentage of participants requiring rescue therapy during the double-blind 24-week period.</p><p>Safety was assessed by report of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), symptomatic and severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, injection site reactions, allergic events, and laboratory tests.

Fifteen participants (6.7%) in the lixisenatide group and five (2.2%) in the placebo group had injection site reactions; two lixisenatide-treated participants discontinued for this reason. One participant in the placebo group had a TEAE of pancreatitis compared with none in the lixisenatide group. Two participants receiving placebo had a TEAE of calcitonin increase (&#x02265;20 ng/L) compared with none in the lixisenatide group. No significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate occurred in either group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s18"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>These results demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement in glycemic control by addition of once-daily lixisenatide to basal insulin glargine together with oral therapy in a subpopulation of people for whom treatment options are of current interest. Initiation of basal insulin in patients not responding to oral therapy is a successful strategy for many people, yet 40&#x02013;50% do not attain HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0, presumably because PPG levels remain elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The study participants evaluated had a meaningful initial HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction after addition and titration of insulin for 12 weeks but had not attained HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;7.0%. The possibility of poor adherence to titration of insulin was minimized by requiring participants to have, in addition to HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.0%, at least moderate control of FPG (&#x02264;7.8 mmol/L). Approximately one-third of participants completing the run-in were not eligible because of having attained HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;7.0%, and 7% were not eligible despite HbA<sub>1c</sub> values between 7 and 9% because FPG was found to be &#x0003e;7.8 mmol/L. At randomization, the mean FPG was 6.6 mmol/L and mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 7.6%. Thus, although further improvement in FPG was needed, residual postprandial hyperglycemia had to be an important contributor to the continued elevation of HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p><p>Traditionally, the next therapeutic option in this setting has been addition of rapid-acting insulin at mealtime. This can involve initiation of full basal bolus therapy, but a stepwise process beginning with a single injection at the main meal has recently been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Early experience with this approach suggests that a further reduction of 0.3&#x02013;0.5% HbA<sub>1c</sub> can be obtained with addition of a single mealtime insulin injection, but with a requirement for additional SMPG tests to guide dosing, and with the potential for further weight gain. The present findings suggest that adding a single injection of lixisenatide can provide a similar improvement of glycemic control as adding a single injection of short-acting insulin, but without the need for additional glucose testing and with a modest beneficial effect on weight rather than weight gain. The mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> attained by participants treated with lixisenatide was &#x02212;0.7% compared with &#x02212;0.4% with placebo, and 56% of the lixisenatide group achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%. As expected in a study in which lixisenatide was added to basal insulin glargine, no additional improvement of FPG was evident, although other studies have demonstrated that lixisenatide&#x02014;as monotherapy or add-on to oral antidiabetic agents&#x02014;significantly reduces both FPG and PPG, as well as HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The seven-point SMPG profiles and the standardized breakfast meal test show that improvement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in this study was mainly attributable to reduction of increments of glucose above the fasting level. Approximately 50% reduction of the increase of glucose after breakfast was evident in the profiles, and there was a smaller reduction after the midday meal as well. Results of the standardized breakfast test confirmed a marked reduction in PPG.</p><p>As expected, there was a modest increase in confirmed hypoglycemia accompanying the improvement of glycemic control with lixisenatide, occurring primarily in the first 6 weeks of treatment. One severe hypoglycemic event with lixisenatide was reported. The other adverse effects of lixisenatide in this population were similar to those demonstrated in other studies; nausea and vomiting were the most common and led to discontinuation in 4% of participants. A three-fold increase of injection-site skin reactions occurred with lixisenatide, although only two (0.9%) patients discontinued treatment for this reason. Addition of lixisenatide was not associated with increased heart rate or blood pressure changes compared with placebo. The two TEAEs leading to death during the treatment period and the TEAE of pancreatitis were in the placebo group.</p><p>This study has limitations and did not address some clinically relevant questions. Approximately 40% of participants randomized to lixisenatide did not attain the 7.0% HbA<sub>1c</sub> goal, and what further measures might improve their success remains unknown. The run-in period was relatively short (only 12 weeks for initiation and optimization of basal insulin glargine), and further dosage increases of glargine before randomization might have been possible if the run-in period had been longer. Also, although it has been shown that a 20-g dose of lixisenatide administered once daily in the morning had generally comparable effects as other lixisenatide regimens when added to metformin, whether the effectiveness of adding lixisenatide to basal insulin may be improved by alterations in the timing of administration of basal insulin glargine by administering it in the evening and administering lixisenatide at breakfast, or by administering basal insulin in the morning and lixisenatide at the main meal, often dinner, is unknown. In addition, lixisenatide was evaluated versus placebo rather than an active comparator, such as mealtime insulin. Determination of which individual patients might fare better with lixisenatide and which would fare better with mealtime insulin would be clinically helpful. Finally, further studies to examine directly the tolerability and effectiveness of lixisenatide relative to other therapies, especially other GLP-1RA agents, DPP-4 inhibitors, and &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors when added to basal insulin therapy, would be of great interest.</p><p>In summary, for people whose HbA<sub>1c</sub> remained 7.0% or higher after initiation and titration of insulin glargine and continuation of oral therapy, adding lixisenatide to their treatment regimen significantly improved HbA<sub>1c</sub> and reduced PPG, allowing a majority to attain HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0%. Adding lixisenatide prevented weight gain and led to an expected increase in the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects and modestly increased rates of hypoglycemia. This treatment approach deserves consideration as an alternative method of intensifying treatment for people not reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> goals with recently initiated basal insulin.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2462/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2462/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
