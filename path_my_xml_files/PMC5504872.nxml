Lithium disilicate is a moderately strong glass ceramic with a high crystalline content. It combines esthetic and strength and can be used for metal-free crowns and ultra-thin veneers. IPS e.max CAD is a machinable block of lithium disilicate ceramic developed to fabricate inlays and onlays or other esthetic restorations through computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Lithium disilicate ceramic has little porosity and roughness and thus additional surface treatment is required to create sufficient micromechanical and chemical retention between cement and ceramic and thus increasing the clinical longevity of restoration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Several attempts have been made to increase the bond strength of cements to lithium disilicate ceramic. Acid etching with fluorine-containing agents such as hydrofluoric (HF) acid, ammonium bifluoride, and acidulated phosphate fluoride is a traditional preparation technique to create micromechanical bonding.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Air abrasion with aluminum oxide particles has also been used for surface preparation of lithium disilicate ceramic. It has been suggested that this technique not only promotes surface area and micromechanical interlocking but also increases surface energy and decreases surface tension on ceramic, thereby enabling optimal wetting of silanes, bonding agents, or self-adhesive cements.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Lasers have been used for various applications in dentistry, including conditioning dental and restorative surfaces.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Previous studies have focused on the use of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] lasers for surface preparation of different types of ceramic. However, there are a few studies that employed laser radiation to prepare lithium disilicate ceramic for the bonding process.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] According to the authors' knowledge, no study has investigated the efficacy of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser for enhancing the adhesion of bonding cement to IPS e.max CAD ceramic.</p><p>The concept of fractional photothermolysis (FP) was introduced in 2003[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to reduce the side effects of the skin resurfacing with ablative CO<sub>2</sub> and Er:YAG lasers, such as prolonged downtime, long-lasting erythema, edema, burning and scarring.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Instead of producing layers of thermal heating, FP generates multiple columns of microscopic thermal wounds called microscopic treatment zones, while the surrounding tissues remain healthy and untreated, thus supporting the wound healing process. The use of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser in dentistry could be associated with several advantages. It allows the clinician to predetermine the radiation area where the laser irradiates multiple zones with predefined space between them. In this way, the need for manual movement of the laser handpiece by the clinician is eliminated, and a more homogenous etching pattern is attained on the surface while the risk of thermal damage to the underlying tissues is minimized.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>This study was conducted to compare the effect of the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser with other methods of surface treatment on shear bond strength (SBS) and mode of bond failure of resin cement to lithium disilicate ceramic. The null hypothesis was that fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser conditioning could not increase bond strength to IPS e.max CAD ceramic more than the other surface treatment modalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>In this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, 72 lithium disilicate-based all-ceramic cubes (3 &#x000d7; 3 &#x000d7; 2 mm in thickness) were fabricated using CAD/CAM milling process (IPS e.max CAD<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) according to the manufacturer's instructions. No glaze was applied on the ceramic surface of the cubes. The specimens were immersed in distilled water to remove surface residues and dried; then they were examined under a magnifier to discard those with any visible flaws, cracks or other surface defects. The ceramic specimens were mounted horizontally in self-cured acrylic resin blocks (Acropars, Marlic Co., Tehran, Iran), ensuring that the ceramic surface remained intact for the bonding procedure. The surfaces were cleaned with ethyl alcohol and dried carefully in air before treatments. The ceramic specimens were randomly divided into six groups (<italic>n</italic> = 12) in terms of the surface treatments applied as follows:</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Group 1 (acid etching)</title><p>The surfaces of ceramic blocks were etched with 9.6% HF acid (Porcelain Etch Gel, Pulpdent Corp., Watertown, MA, USA) for 2 min.

Sandblasting was performed under 2.5-bar pressure for 15 s, and the tip of the device was held at a distance of 10 mm perpendicular to the ceramic surface. The specimens were then rinsed thoroughly under running tap water to remove remaining particles and air-dried.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Group 3 (carbon dioxide laser, 10 W/14 mJ)</title><p>The surfaces of the specimens in group 3 were etched with a fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser (a wavelength of 10.6 &#x003bc;m; Lutronic Inc., Princeton Junction, NJ, USA). The laser device was run in the dynamic mode, and the setting was so that a square area of 4 &#x000d7; 4 mm was irradiated at the middle of the specimen. The laser tip was held manually perpendicular to the ceramic surface at a distance of 3 cm. The frequency of 200 Hz (pulse per se cond) and irradiation time of 10 s were selected. The power and pulse energy were 10 W and 14 mJ, respectively.

The surface was then dried with an air spray. A dual-cured self-adhesive resin luting cement (Clearfil SA Luting; Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc., Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan) was applied to the ceramic surfaces in all the groups. An adequate and equal length of base and catalyst pastes of luting cement was dispensed and mixed with a plastic mixing spatula. The resin cement was then poured into plastic molds measuring 2 mm in height and 1.5 mm in diameter, held perpendicular over the ceramic substrates. The excess cement was removed with a sharp explorer from the periphery of the mold, and the luting agent was then polymerized for 40 s by putting a light guide (Bluephase C8, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) at four opposite directions (10 s each) using a power density of 650 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. All the procedures were carried out by one operator.</p><p>After 30 min, the plastic molds were separated and carefully removed, and the specimens were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 h. Each sample was mounted in a holding device in a Universal Testing Machine (Santam, Model STM-20, Tehran, Iran) to measure the shear bond strength of the adhesive interface at fracture. The cross-head was placed perpendicular to the cement-ceramic interface, and the specimens were loaded at a speed of 1 mm/min.

The unglazed ceramic surfaces were used in this study because in the clinical situation the internal surface of the restoration remains unglazed. Theoretically, unglazed surfaces exhibit greater irregularities and micromechanical interlocking and thus higher bond strength compared to glazed surfaces.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The luting agent used in this study (Clearfil SA Luting) is a self-adhesive dual-cured resin cement. The use of resin cements is associated with several advantages such as additional retention, enhanced optical properties, low solubility, better marginal adaptation and most importantly enhanced fracture resistance of ceramic restorations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Chemical bonding through silane application plays an important role in ceramic-resin adhesion. The use of silane improves wettability of the ceramic surface and promotes adhesion between adhesives and ceramic/metal. However, the long-term stability of chemical bonding using silane coupling agents is still under debate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A previous article on bonding to glass ceramics revealed no significant differences in bond strength values between different treatment groups (sandblasting, polishing, HF acid, or phosphoric acid etching) when a silane coupling agent was applied after surface treatment, whereas in the absence of silane application, HF-etched and sandblasted groups exhibited the highest microshear bond strength.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study, silane was applied in all the groups because it is a simple clinical procedure that promotes bond strength regardless of the type of surface treatment employed.</p><p>HF acid was applied as a surface treatment strategy in the present investigation and produced bond strength value (18.08 MPa) that was significantly higher than that in air-abraded specimens and those treated by fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser alone. Ceramics with a high glassy phase and a large amount of silica are called acid-sensitive or glass ceramics, generally classified into feldspathic, leucite-reinforced, fluormica glass or lithium disilicate. Etching with HF acid could be considered an effective modality for glass ceramics as it dissolves the glassy phase of acid-susceptible ceramics, producing suitable surface texture for bonding and facilitating the penetration of resin into ceramic.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The content of silica in lithium disilicate ceramic is approximately 60 wt%, as mentioned by the manufacturer, and could be considered sufficient to obtain reliable bond strength after dissolving in acid solutions.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Several studies demonstrated that the use of HF acid on glass ceramics creates higher surface roughness and greater bond strength compared with other acid etchants, surface grinding, or sandblasting techniques.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The combination of HF acid etching and silane application has been recommended by several authors as a method of choice for surface preparation of feldspathic, lithium disilicate or other types of glass ceramics.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Roughening the surface with 25&#x02013;50-&#x003bc; aluminum oxide particles is a traditional way to achieve micromechanical retention on ceramic substrates. Surface roughening increases both the bonding area and the wettability of the ceramic surface.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Recent studies indicated higher surface roughness in sandblasted lithium disilicate ceramic in comparison to Er:YAG laser-irradiated or HF acid-treated specimens.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] However, the ceramic specimens subjected to air abrasion exhibited the lowest SBS in the present investigation. It is possible that the irregularities created by the air abrasion process were not effective in enhancing the bond strength to lithium disilicate ceramic.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The deposition of aluminum oxide particles on the surface, which could interfere with the cement-ceramic adhesion,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] might be another reason for the lowest bond strength in air-abraded specimens. Other authors believe that air abrasion creates surface damage and removes a significant amount of substances from the surface, thus weakening the ceramic and leading to premature fracture.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The outcomes of this study are consistent with the results of Colares <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who reported significantly lower bond strength in lithium-disilicate ceramic blocks treated with sandblasting compared to those prepared by HF acid and silane application.</p><p>In the present study, the use of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser at either 10 W/14 mJ or 20 W/10 mJ was not capable of improving the bond strength to IPS e.max CAD ceramic. However, when the CO<sub>2</sub> laser irradiation was followed by HF acid etching, the resultant bond strength was significantly higher than all the other modalities employed, indicating a synergistic effect between CO<sub>2</sub> laser and HF acid for conditioning lithium disilicate substrate. No significant differences were found between SBS values of 10 W/14 mJ and 20 W/10 mJ groups, either followed or not followed by acid conditioning. It has been assumed that the fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser is capable of roughening the ceramic surface through the process of thermomechanical ablation, increasing micromechanical retention and enhancing bond strength at the cement-ceramic interface. There is also the possibility of chemical alteration of the irradiated ceramic surface favoring enhanced adhesion; however, further studies are warranted to verify this assumption.</p><p>To date, no study has employed fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser for conditioning lithium disilicate ceramic; therefore, comparison of the results of this study with those of previous studies is limited. The results of this study are consistent with those of Kursoglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who reported that the highest bond strength was achieved in lithium disilicate samples treated by HF acid compared to those prepared by erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er, Cr:YSGG) laser (1.5, 2.5, and 6 W). Shiu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that feldspathic surfaces conditioned with HF acid exhibited significantly higher bond strength than Er:YAG laser-irradiated specimens. Zarif Najafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] investigated the effect of superpulse CO<sub>2</sub> laser irradiation on SBS of metal orthodontic brackets to porcelain and found that HF etching produced the highest bond strength, but CO<sub>2</sub> laser irradiation also provided adequate SBS, while allowing for elimination of the HF acid step. The results of this study contradict those of previous authors[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] who observed the greatest bond strength in zirconia specimens treated with a CO<sub>2</sub> laser at parameters similar to those employed in this study. Another study revealed that the use of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser at either 10 W/10 mJ or 15 W/10 mJ resulted in a significant increase in bond strength of orthodontic brackets to feldspathic porcelain without producing surface damage.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The differences between the results of this study and those of previous studies[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] might be attributed to the different types of ceramic employed as they have dissimilar compositions and can absorb the laser light differently.</p><p>In the present study, the highest bond strength was obtained when the combination of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser irradiation and HF acid etching was employed for surface treatment of lithium disilicate substrate. Therefore, this method could be recommended in situations when extra retention is required for lithium disilicate restorations. Akyil <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggested the use of combined Er:YAG or Nd:YAG laser irradiation and acid application to improve resin adhesion to feldspathic ceramic. They observed in scanning electron microscopy analysis that when HF acid was applied after laser irradiation, the resultant fissures and cracks were larger than those created by laser irradiation alone.</p><p>The quality of the bond should not be just assessed through the bond strength data as the mode of failure also provides valuable information for predicting the clinical performance of bonded restorations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The results of the present study showed that adhesive fracture between the luting cement and porcelain occurred with the highest frequency in all the experimental groups. Despite the significant difference in bond strength between the study groups, the mode of bond failure was comparable among groups, indicating the lack of relationship between SBS and the type of bond fracture. Therefore, factors other than bond strength could affect the mode of failure at the bonding interface.</p><p>Some authors believe that values &#x02265;20 MPa could provide sufficient bond strength, whereas others considered the higher limit of 25 MPa to represent sufficient bond strength in the clinical setting.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Keeping this in mind, the results of the present study suggested that treatment of lithium disilicate ceramic with HF acid produced SBS that was lower but close to the threshold limit required for clinical applications. On the other hand, the use of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser followed by HF acid etching provided bond strength value that well exceeded the threshold limit required for successful bonding in the clinical situation. This technique might be extremely useful in lithium disilicate restorations with limited or no mechanical retention in the preparation design, requiring a high bond strength at the bonding interface. In addition to the routine benefits of laser etching (less time and elimination of the rinsing step),[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] the use of fractional CO2 laser for the preparation of restorative materials is associated with other advantages, as scanning the surface is made by the laser apparatus itself and thus a more homogeneous etching pattern would be created on the ceramic specimen.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it used SBS test for evaluating the effectiveness of surface conditioning procedures. This test can produce fracture at a distance from the resin-ceramic interface, leading to misconception of the bond quality. In spite of such limitations, SBS remains a simple and appropriate test to evaluate bonding performance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The bond between ceramic and resin cement is influenced by several factors such as temperature changes, saliva, diet, chewing force and other habits in a complex oral environment. We did not employ thermacycling or any other fatigue cycle in this study because of the diversity of the treatment groups and the controversial results of previous studies regarding the effect of these procedures on SBS.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the durability of the bond in CO<sub>2</sub> laser-treated ceramic specimens subjected to long-term water storage or fatigue cycling procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Under the conditions used in this study:</p><p>
