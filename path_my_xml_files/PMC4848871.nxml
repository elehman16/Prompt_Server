Extended-release formulations of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) block heroin and other opioid agonists competitively for around 4 weeks per administration. XR-NTX thus enables opioid users to experience abstinence from opioid agonists with greatly reduced risk of overdose compared to medication-free abstinence. While XR-NTX has shown promise compared to placebo and daily naltrexone tablets, there is limited information on long-term safety and its performance compared to daily maintenance treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In this five-hospital RCT with long-term follow-up, we aim to recruit <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;180 patients in treatment for opioid dependence and allocate them in an open, randomized manner (1:1) to receive either 4-week XR-NTX or daily buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX) for the duration of 12&#x000a0;weeks. Allocation is open-label due to the risk of overdose during attempts to self-unmask allocation using heroin. Urine drug tests are scheduled every week with follow-up visits &#x00026; assessment every 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are abstinence from illicit opioids in urine drug tests and self-report, as well as retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes include other substance use, injecting behavior, drug craving, mental health, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, abstinence motivation, opioid agonist effect rating, insomnia, and pain. Observation is continued for another 36&#x000a0;weeks in order to assess longer-term safety, adherence and effectiveness. The study is an investigator-initiated trial, funded by public grants and approved by an Independent Ethical Committee (the Regional Ethical Committee for Research South-East B # 2011/1320) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite minor implementation problems, the protocol appears sufficiently robust to generate results of high interest to patients, clinicians and policy makers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov # <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01717963">NCT01717963</ext-link>, first registered: Oct 28, 2012.

A chronically relapsing disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], addiction to illicit opioids often includes criminal activity, poly-drug use and blood-borne infections such as HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Due to high risk of relapse and overdose associated with abstinence, the preferred treatment for opioid addiction is substitution of the illicit opioid with a prescribed opioid medication like the full opioid agonist methadone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or partial opioid agonist buprenorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This agonist replacement therapy (ART) is generally effective at reducing illicit opioid use, overdose mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as important drug-related outcomes such as criminal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and injection-related disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>As ART presents a risk of illicit diversion and abuse of prescribed methadone or buprenorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], ART providers will often attempt to minimize this risk by utilizing control measures such as supervised medication intake, urine drug screens, limits on take-home dosing and&#x02013;travel outside the catchment area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A disadvantage of these control measures is their tendency to reduce patients&#x02019; sense of personal freedom, potentially undermining their motivation to remain in ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As methadone, a full opioid agonist, is considered to have a high potential for abuse and overdose, the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine is sometimes preferred. The abuse risk of buprenorphine can be further reduced when combined with a component of the short-acting opioid antagonist naloxone; this combination product tends to not cause withdrawal when ingested correctly (sublingually), but is likely to cause some withdrawal symptoms if the medication is injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite the dilemmas inherent in treating opioid users with opioid agonists, current guidelines recommend ART due to its ability to retain patients in treatment while greatly reducing illicit opioid use and overdose risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This in contrast to the other main treatment principle, medication-free abstinence, which is generally not recommended due to the elevated risk of overdose following a period of abstinence from opioid agonists. Despite the risks, treatment based on medication-free abstinence is available in most countries, e.g. as long-term residential treatment or therapeutic communities with outpatient follow-up.</p><p>A main concern for opioid addiction treatment is its limited uptake in the user population: Only about 50&#x000a0;% of the patient base are estimated to be in treatment at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The potential human and social benefit of increasing the number of opioid users in treatment is the main incentive to exploring novel treatment approaches.</p><p>One recent innovation is sustained release formulations of the opioid antagonist naltrexone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (SRX). Following detoxification from all opioid agonists (e.g. heroin, morphine, methadone, buprenorphine), naltrexone medication will support the person in avoiding relapse by rendering attempts at relapse futile: as naltrexone competitively blocks the action of heroin and other opioid agonists, the drug euphoria (or &#x02018;high&#x02019;) as well as sedative effects should effectively be inaccessible to the patient. The only version of SRX currently approved by the FDA, extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX), is administered intramuscularly in the gluteus where it releases naltrexone at therapeutic levels&#x000a0;for the duration of 4&#x02013;5 weeks per injection. XR-NTX appears superior to placebo in both laboratory and clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; other sustained release naltrexone (SRX) formulations have shown promising results compared to daily oral naltrexone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and to usual-treatment controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Given the success of ART in clinical practice, a valid policy question is the need to implement another treatment like extended-release naltrexone for the target disorder, opioid dependence. This is best addressed by a randomized controlled trial of long-acting naltrexone with the currently most similar ART medication on offer, daily ART with buprenorphine-naloxone.</p><p>In addition to the advantages offered by a randomized comparison, most observers emphasize the need for observation beyond the 8 to 24&#x000a0;weeks often reserved for RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. With XR-NTX, only a handful of studies have so far investigated long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Long-term observation will also improve the accuracy estimates of occurrence of adverse events. Oral naltrexone tablets has been available since the 1980s, but lack of adherence undermines clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and creates uncertainty about the validity of safety data.</p><p>Although naltrexone has shown the ability to reduce craving for several substances of abuse e.g. alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and heroin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], there is still clinical interest in whether poly-drug using patients will increase non-opioid substance use during XR-NTX. Other long-term consequences of opioid antagonism are also subject to debate, mainly based on preclinical and/or case data: Some suggest naltrexone could reverse receptor-level changes attributed to chronic opioid agonist intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; others think it plausible naltrexone could increase users&#x02019; vulnerability to overdose upon discontinuation of the medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] due to chronic antagonism stimulating receptor growth and sensitivity.</p><p>The present protocol describes a study of adult opioid users randomized to receive either 4-week intramuscular naltrexone (XR-NTX) or daily buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX) in a clinical setting. The purpose of the study is to explore recovery&#x02013;and medication-related outcomes of similarly motivated patients randomized to either treatment. For ethical reasons, patients will not be discontinued from XR-NTX but permitted to receive XR-NTX for up to 48 Weeks total, providing an opportunity to observe longer-term effects of chronic medication with XR-NTX.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a 12-week open-label randomized-controlled trial comparing 4-week intramuscular injections of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) to a currently recommended treatment for opioid addiction, daily buprenorphine-naloxone (BP-NLX). As this is he first RCT comparing these two medications, we consider the scientific approach to be exploratory.</p><p>For ethical reasons (see below) study medication (XR-NTX) will not be terminated upon RCT completion, but will be available for an additional 36&#x000a0;weeks (48&#x000a0;weeks total observation time).

While a placebo design increases internal validity and the precision of efficacy estimates, generalizability and estimates of clinical effectiveness may be reduced. In particular, a placebo design with this population risks &#x02018;self-unmasking&#x02019; by use of illicit opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reducing the potential benefit of a masking procedure and increasing risk of illicit opioid use by participants, enhancing their vulnerability to overdose and relapse during or after study participation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Because transferring patients to standard treatment would either re-instate physical dependence on prescribed opioids like methadone in ART or risk relapse and overdose in medication-free abstinence, we consider the best solution to offer continuation of XR-NTX medication to participants post completion of the 12-Week phase as the alternative. This will also enable the collection of much needed long-term data on XR-NTX. BP-NLX patients who wish to continue on their medication will be offered to do so as part of the national ART program.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants &#x00026; setting</title><p>Patients have been recruited during the period from November 2012 to July 2015 by trained personnel based at five research hospitals in urban centers in Norway: Oslo University Hospital, Akershus University Hospital, Haukeland University Hospital, Stavanger University Hospital, and Vestfold Hospital Trust. An agreement is in place between the study management and the Directorate of Norwegian Correctional Service for study sites to recruit opioid users who are completing criminal sentencing in criminal justice facilities.</p><p>Opioid dependent (DSM-IV) adults (18+) without serious mental or somatic disease are eligible to participate: study personnel screen patients for acute or chronic suicidality or psychotic disorders using the MINI 6.0 interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], while a physician examines patients for serious somatic disease such as acute hepatic failure (Child-Pugh level 3+) or AIDS-indicator disease. Eligible patients can also be screened in an outpatient setting before entering detoxification in a protected environment (inpatient or closely monitored outpatient). All patients must be formally enrolled in Norway&#x02019;s national ART program at one of the study sites in order to be eligible for randomization. This ensures personal follow-up by a counselor as part of standard outpatient treatment, and rapid access to other ART program resources (e.g. prescribed methadone) for patients who drop out of the study treatments. As the effects of XR-NTX on fetal development are not yet known, female participants are screened for pregnancy during inclusion and assisted in finding effective contraception for the duration of the study. Patients treated with opioid-based analgesics for chronic pain conditions will only be eligible if successfully transferred to a non-opioid replacement (e.g. benzodiazepines).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment procedure</title><p>Participants are recruited via written information on brochures, webpages, and posters at site clinics, and via personal contact with their counselor or physician. After receiving verbal and written information about the study from study staff, patients are screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the written informed consent.

Detoxification and induction on to study medication is conducted in a controlled environment, usually an on-site inpatient detoxification unit. Only patients unwilling or assessed as unable to undergo inpatient detoxification, an outpatient detoxification with daily staff contact can be arranged with daily or bi-daily urine drug screening.</p><p>Buprenorphine is the recommended medication for alleviating opioid withdrawal symptoms during detoxification in Norway, and is administered to all participants at the discretion of the on-site treating physician. A higher dose is typically administered to ART patients habituated to a daily buprenorphine dose (16&#x000a0;mg/buprenorphine is the standard target dose in ART) tapered for a standard 2&#x000a0;mg/day, while a lower dose (2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mg buprenorphine/day) is typically administered to illicit heroin users. Any regular methadone users are required to taper down and discontinue methadone for a minimum of 72&#x000a0;h before randomization. Once participants are stable in the 0&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mg buprenorphine/day range, they are considered ready for random allocation (1:1) to either standard treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone (target dosage 16&#x000a0;mg/day, range 4&#x02013;24&#x000a0;mg) or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) 380&#x000a0;mg every 28&#x000a0;days, for the upcoming 12&#x000a0;weeks/84&#x000a0;days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomization</title><p>Allocation is conducted by non-study personnel on a per-patient basis using a permuted block algorithm accessible via a computer program with full-entry tracking. Participants are randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio to either XR-NTX or BP-NLX independent of site, setting (clinic or criminal justice) or gender. When a study staff member contacts allocation staff for inclusion and randomization, inclusion criteria are verified before the patient is formally included into the database and allocated to one of the two medication groups. Group allocation is communicated openly to study staff via telephone, who are then free to communicate the results of the allocation procedure to patient and clinical staff in an open-label manner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study medications</title><p>Before discharge from a controlled environment, buprenorphine-naloxone patients are inducted on to a flexible dose of BP-NLX: Range 4&#x02013;24&#x000a0;mg/day of buprenorphine, target 16&#x000a0;mg/day, with a 1/4 naloxone component (range 1&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mg; 4&#x000a0;mg in the target dose). The approach is based on Norway&#x02019;s national ART guideline on buprenorphine pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence, which is based on an evaluation of the scientific literature. For the BP-NLX group, medication is provided courtesy of existing healthcare services for opioid users in Norway.</p><p>For patients allocated to receive extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), tapering is continued with a flexible, standard 2&#x000a0;mg/day regimen followed by a minimum of 72&#x000a0;h without opioid agonists in order to prevent inducing withdrawal symptoms. A naloxone challenge (0.2&#x02013;0.4&#x000a0;mg) is administered prior to the first XR-NTX (380&#x000a0;mg) dose in order to confirm the absence of opioid agonist. Following induction onto either study drug (usually 3&#x02013;7 days), patients are discharged from detoxification and are requested to attend regular ART program counseling and present weekly urine drug tests for the next 12&#x000a0;weeks. As XR-NTX is currently not available for purchase in Europe, study management requested the manufacturer to supply it free of charge for this study without additional funding and without conditions for manufacturer influence over study implementation, analysis or dissemination. The XR-NTX manufacturer (Alkermes, Inc) complied with this request.</p><p>After the completion of the 12-Week follow-up, participants are asked whether they wish to continue for the long-term observation phase of the study (48 Weeks total observation time).</p><p>BP-NLX patients who wish to continue on their medication will be free to do so as part of the national ART program, but conclude regular participation in the study. BP-NLX patients who wish to transfer to XR-NTX will undergo a washout period with detoxification and naloxone test similar to procedures described for the XR-NTX induction (above).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outpatient follow-up</title><p>Weekly urine drug tests (UDTs) are administered on site, at the local laboratory or at the GP&#x02019;s office. A scratch card incentive is offered for each UDT (a maximum of 12) in order to increase UDT attendance. Every 4 weeks, participants have scheduled follow-up with data collection on all outcomes of interest (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This coincides with re-administration of XR-NTX for patients allocated to this group and could coincide with one of four standard weekly counseling sessions offered in the on-site ART clinic. All 4-week assessments (except UDTs) are continued for patients who complete the 12-week RCT and elect to participate in the 36-week long-term observation phase. Adherence is monitored through self-report and can be verified by consulting each patient&#x02019;s electronic journal on the site clinic, where each dose collected of either BP-NLX or XR-NTX is registered.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SPIRIT Flowchart of Study Events for the study&#x02019;Optimal Prevention of Overdose Deaths and Opioid Relapse Following Discharge: A Multi-Center RCT of Naltrexone versus Buprenorphine in Norway&#x02019;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40360_2016_61_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discontinuation</title><p>Discontinuation can occur on the participants&#x02019; request and will be considered by the investigator should the participant develop conditions contrary to inclusion criteria; e.g. acute or repeated psychotic episodes or suicide attempts, life-threatening or debilitating somatic conditions not compatible with participation (e.g. pharmacological incompatibility, preventing outpatient follow-up), assessed by a physician to have need for opioid-based analgesics with no feasible non-opioid replacements, pregnancy, or failure to adhere to study medication regimens. For BP-NLX this study adheres to clinical guidelines for ART where a flexible regimen is used to determine the dosage based on feedback on withdrawal and craving symptoms; a failure to attend BP-NLX administration for two consecutive days or more is considered non-adherence. For XR-NTX patients, adherence conditions are violated if re-dosing occurs more than 4 days past the standard 28-day re-dosing interval.

To increase accuracy of responses relative to the Europ-ASI standard, timeline follow-back is used: a technique of backtracking and questioning about use and abstinence to obtain as accurate an estimate as possible of total number of days&#x02019; use of a specific substance in the 28-day follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the primary outcomes, we explore secondary outcomes of importance to recovery: Number of patients fulfilling MINI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] (DSM-IV) criteria for dependence on illicit opioids (exempting the 12-month criterion). The Addiction Severity Index administered every 4th week also records information on the use/abuse of alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines), as well as other illicit substances (e.g. LSD, MDMA, GHB), and poly-drug use; days of injecting drug use; any overdoses (non-lethal) and hospitalizations in somatic or psychiatric health care; workdays and days engaged in illegal activities; number of days with conflicts in close relations, days physical and mental illness.</p><p>Craving for heroin is assessed using a 0&#x02013;10 Visual analogue scale (VAS) on two questions: &#x02018;I need heroin&#x02019; where &#x02018;0&#x02019; signifies &#x02018;Strongly disagree&#x02019; and 10 &#x02018;Strongly agree&#x02019;; and &#x02018;How much have you been bothered by thinking about opioids or their use in the past 4 weeks?&#x02019; with 0 indicating &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; and 100 &#x02018;constantly&#x02019;.</p><p>Mental health is assessed using the 25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], life satisfaction using the Temporal Satisfaction With Life Scale &#x02018;present&#x02019; items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

For between- group comparisons and to control for the effect of baseline characteristics, we will use a General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approach containing factors for treatment group, sex, and sex-by- treatment interaction, and with age, duration of opioid dependence, and duration of last pre-study inpatient detoxification as covariates. For outcomes violating the normality assumption, a General Alinear Mixed Models (GAMM) approach will be used. Regular statistics (e.g. ANOVA, linear regression) may be utilized if the arguments for using GLMM or GAMM over legacy analysis types are considered to provide limited benefit.

Such comparisons are currently lacking from the knowledge base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, longer-term data on the performance of XR-NTX in opioid dependent patients is central in evaluating the clinical feasibility of XR-NTX in this high-risk, chronically relapsing patient group. Registry linkage data provides an option to study the clinical trajectories of participants before, during and after the active follow-up phase, providing opportunities to address long-term recovery outcomes as well as concerns of increased overdose risk upon termination of naltrexone medication.</p><p>Parts of the original protocol have not been possible to implement: One site investigator has passed away prematurely without leaving a competent successor, leading to the premature closing of one site. A policy change greatly reduced the number of patients imprisoned for possession of minor quantities of drugs, meaning it has not been feasible to recruit a large proportion of participants from the criminal justice system. In order to maintain recruitment targets using only clinical sites, the inclusion phase of the study has had to be extended about by 25&#x000a0;% compared to the original schedule. As the clinical population of opioid users has a lower incidence of lethal overdose than opioid users discharged from criminal justice settings, overall mortality figures are expected to decrease below what is considered a meaningful basis for statistical estimation. Despite these implementation difficulties, we consider the protocol to retain its intended value as a &#x02018;first of a kind&#x02019; comparison.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NK and AO wrote the initial drafts of this paper before presenting to LT, KSH, KKS, ZHL, ZG, for revision and approval.
