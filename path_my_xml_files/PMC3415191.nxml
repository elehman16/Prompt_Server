So, we chose the so-called Memoral herbal for our this preventive new study, which has never been used for this propse.</p><p>The Memoral herbal capsules, each contains 360 mg of Boswellia oleo-gum resin and 36 mg of Zimgiber rhizome. The most important constituent of Boswellia is gum resin 60%, mosilage 20-23% and essence 5-9%, which contains a-b-Thujon, p-cymen and linanol. Boswellia Serrata has Boswellic acid and acetyl- 11- keto-beta boswellic acid too, which are responsible for many therapeutic effect. The volatile oils in Boswellia dilate the vasculator of the brain thus can increase the blood passage through the brain. Boswellia extract has been demonstrated by a battery of rigorous tests to have anti-inflammatory effect. Boswellic acid has memory enhancing and anti-dementia properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The mechanism by which Boswellia can improve memory is through its anti-inflammatory effect on the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare Memoral herbal with placebo in prevention of ECT-induced cognitive impairments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial which was done during 9 months of 2011 at Noor hospital (Isfahan, Iran). The studied population was inpatients with mood disorder who were candidates for ECT. The sample size was 70 patients, based on 80% power and 95% confidence interval. Each consequent patient placed randomly in intervention (Memoral) or control (placebo) group, i.e., 35 patients in each group. The inclusion criteria were: 15-65ys/o, diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) according to the impression of therapist (academic member) documented in the patient file, prescribed at least 4 ECT sessions by the therapist and informed consent for participation. Exclusion criteria were: Mental retardation (MR) or dementia as documented in hospital file by psychiatrist, discontinuation of ECT before fourth sessions, discontinuation of participation before the end of study, and arising delirium during the course of study. The ethical issues of this study was approved by ethical committee of Behavioral Sciences Research Center (BSRC) of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Iran. The study process registered at Iranian Registering of Clinical Trials office, with IRCT ID: IRCT201102072232N2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The study was illustrated to patients and an informed consent form was signed by each patient or his/her first degree related person who was supporting him/her (In cases the patient was unable to decide). Each patient received three capsules (TID) of either Memoral or placebo from the day before first ECT session until 2 months after the last session of ECT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Memoral and placebo capsules were produced by Goldaru pharmaceutical manufactory (Isfahan, Iran). The capsules were labeled by only &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; brand and were taken to patients by a nurse. Both patients and nurse were blind to the Memoral or placebo capsules.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment</title><p>The cognition of patients was evaluated by Addonbrokes Cognitive Examination (ACE). This scale was developed through extension of mini mental status examination (MMSE) memory, language and visuospacial ability subscales, and adding verbal fluency subscale to it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It is translated to Persian and validated by Pouretemad H.R.(2006). Its sensitivity and specificity for screening normal persons from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is 93% and 91% , respectively; for screening alzheimer patients from MCI patients is 73% and 93%, respectively, and for screening normal persons from Alzheimer patients is 100% and 96%, respectively. It has five subscales: attention and orientation, memory, language, verbal fluency, visuospatial ability. Also it has the capacity for scoring based on the past so-called MMSE scale.</p><p>It takes approximately 15 minutes to fill the questionnaire. The patients&#x02019; cognitive function was assessed at four occasions: before the first ECT session, before the 4<sup>th</sup> ECT session, 1 month and 2 months after the last ECT session, by a psychologist.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The probable side effects of Memoral were also evaluated at those occasions, using a checklist. The psychologist was blind for Memoral or placebo using by each patient.</p><p>The findings were analyzed by Repeated Measure of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chi-Square, using SPSS18.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 70 patients, two patients from Memoral group and five patients from placebo group were excluded because of premature discontinuation of ECT and discharge from the hospital, causing disruption of participation.

Considering educational levels, there was not any significant difference between two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18): including 6 (9.5%) patients had primary school studies, 23 (36.5%) guidance school, 24 (38.1%) high school, 10 (15.9%) had university studies. The frequency of patients&#x02019; diagnosis was: 26 (41.3) patients with BD manic or mixed episode, 13 (20.6%) patients BD depressive episode, 24 (38.1%) patients with MDD. There was not any significant difference between Memoral and placebo group about diagnoses distribution (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09). Also there was no significant difference between the number of ECT sessions in two groups (Pv=0.95%); included 2 (3.2%) patients received five ECT sessions,25 (39.7%) received six sessions, four (6.3%) received seven sessions, 17 (26.9%) received eight sessions, two (3.2%) patients received nine sessions, 8 (12.7%) received 10 sessions, two (3.2%) patients received 11 sessions, two (3.2%) patients received 12 sessions, and one (1.6%) patient received 14 ECT sessions.
