postural techniques and expiratory muscle strength training on the enhancement of the
swallowing function of patients with dysphagia caused by Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. [Subjects
and Methods] The subjects of this study were 18 patients who received simultaneous
application of postural techniques and expiratory muscle strength training and 15 patients
who received expiratory muscle strength training only. Postural techniques were conducted
in the order of chin tucking, head rotation, head tilting, bending head back, and lying
down, while expiratory muscle strength training was conducted at a resistance level of
about 70% of the maximal expiratory pressure. Swallowing recovery was assessed by using
the Functional Dysphagia Scale based on videofluoroscopic studies. [Results] The mean
value obtained in the videofluoroscopic studies for both groups decreased after the
treatment. In the postural techniques plus expiratory muscle strength training group, the
decrease was significantly greater than that in the expiratory muscle strength
training-only group. [Conclusion] The results imply that simultaneous performance of
postural techniques and expiratory muscle strength training is more effective than
expiratory muscle strength training alone when applied in the swallowing rehabilitation
for patients with dysphagia caused by Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Expiratory muscle strength training</kwd><kwd>Dysphagia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>From a functional perspective, the swallowing process is composed of 3 phases, namely the
oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In general, dysphagia caused by neurological
disorders is frequently caused by problems in the pharyngeal phase<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pharyngeal phase is defined as the process from
pharyngeal swallowing to complete passage of food boluses through the upper esophageal
sphincter.</p><p>In cases of epiglottal folding, the closure of the vocal cord and laryngeal vestibule is
incomplete in the esophageal phase; thus, aspiration or penetration, which is the passage of
food boluses through the pharynx, can occur. Severe cases can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
Thus, in order to prevent aspiration pneumonia and achieve safe swallowing, optimum
intervention strategies that consider the symptoms of dysphagia are required.</p><p>Especially, as unlike stroke, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease worsen
dysphagia with disease progression, regular diagnosis and rehabilitation are required for
the rest of the patient&#x02019;s life. Hence, for successful rehabilitation of swallowing function
in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, a transdisciplinary approach is critical, in which physicians,
nurses, physical therapists, speech pathologists, and nutritionists make decisions in a
cooperative manner<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Compensation techniques such as postural techniques and maneuver have been generally
conducted as swallowing rehabilitation interventions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. These compensation techniques (e.g., postural techniques) have been
verified to be significantly effective for the enhancement of swallowing function by many
studies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) was reported to be effective for
swallowing rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMST is a treatment
intervention for patients with functional disorders of the respiratory system that are
caused by weakening of respiratory muscles. It not only enhances respiratory functions but
also postpones the outbreak of complications of the respiratory system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Respiration is an essential condition for optimum swallowing. The respiratory system is
composed of the respiratory tract, lungs, expiratory muscles, and thoracic cage, and plays a
role in the inhalation of oxygen from the air and exhalation carbon dioxide produced by
energy metabolism<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, both
inspiration and expiration are performed by the movements of the diaphragm, respiratory
muscles, and thoracic cage. Inspiration is performed by active movement, while expiration is
performed by passive elastic recoil<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
elderly generally not just emit less amount of air because of decreased lung capacity but
also have to inspire more often to supply adequate amount of oxygen for the body<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, in old age, the possibility of ultimate decline in the function of closure of
the vocal cord is high owing to crevice in the larynx or &#x0201c;distinct glottal arrowhead,&#x0201d; which
is the bending of the vocal cords<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
structural changes such as these can have adverse effects on the swallowing function in old
age, strengthening of respiratory function in swallowing rehabilitation is crucial<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Especially in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, respiratory problems stand out because of
gradual rigidity of expiratory muscles<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
With the progression of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, the movements of the diaphragm and abdominal
muscles become abnormal<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
eventually affects both expiration and inspiration<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, strengthening of the expiratory muscle is required for
optimum swallowing rehabilitation. Nevertheless, studies on the respiration in Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease have mainly focused on the characteristics of respiration in the disease<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, while only a few studies have been
conducted on the relationship between the strengthening of expiratory muscle and swallowing
function.</p><p>This study investigated the effect of simultaneous application of postural techniques and
EMST on the enhancement of the swallowing function of patients with dysphagia caused by
Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants of this study were 33 patients with dysphagia caused by Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease who attended the rehabilitation departments of 2 general hospitals in Seoul and
Inchon between September 2014 and February 2015. The criteria for subject selection were as
follows: first, those who had aspiration or penetration discovered in the pharyngeal phase;
second, those without problems in the oral phase, such as chewing; third, those without
respiratory diseases such as pneumonia or asthma; fourth, those without cognitive problems
with Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version scores of&#x0003e;24; fifth, those who can
communicate; sixth, those without facial paralysis; seventh, those without moderate or
severe hypertension (systolic hypertension of &#x02265;160&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and diastolic hypertension of
100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg). This study was approved by the institutional review board and was conducted in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects were
given sufficient explanation regarding the purpose and experimental method of this study

the oral cavity; third, after performing maximum inspiration followed by maximum expiration
8 times in succession, the subject rested for 30 seconds; fourth, this procedure was

Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. Like this study, preceding studies verified the enhancement of
swallowing functions, such as reduction of aspiration and opening of the upper esophageal
sphincter that result from EMST for patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially EMST positively affected the vitalization of the
suprahyoid muscle<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The suprahyoid muscle protects the airway by raising the hyoid bone and plays the role of
supporting safe swallowing by the opening cricopharyngeus muscle. Dysphagia caused by
neurological problems such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease weakens the suprahyoid and cricopharyngeus
muscles. EMST was verified to enhance the pharyngeal swallowing function by strengthening
swallowing muscles such as the suprahyoid muscle<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the combined intervention group had a significantly higher enhancement of
swallowing function than the EMST-only group, which is deemed to be the result of the
synergic effect of the two treatment modalities. Postural techniques such as lowering the
chin are performed to complement structural and physiological defects by changing the
direction of food boluses going down or the area of the pharynx by adjusting posture rather
than strengthening the muscles themselves<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These postural techniques have been reported to be effective for the
swallowing rehabilitation of patients with dysphagia who have limited movements of the
tongue base or have weakened laryngeal raise<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, EMST is a muscle training method that uses
resistance and is effective for vitalization of swallowing muscles and raising the
larynx<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In summary, simultaneous
application of postural techniques and EMST is presumed to have a stronger effect on the
enhancement of swallowing function by complementing safe swallowing and strengthening of
swallowing muscles. In order to investigate the vitalization of the swallowing muscles in
greater detail, studies that use surface electromyography are required in the future.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows: First, as the number of subjects was small,
generalization of the study results is difficult. Second, as most of the subjects were male
patients, analysis of treatment effects according to gender is required in the future.
Third, effects based on the duration of intervention were not analyzed. Studies that analyze
the effect of the intervention duration of EMST and postural techniques are required in the
future.</p><p>The results of this study imply that simultaneous performance of postural techniques and
EMST is more effective than EMST alone when applied in the swallowing rehabilitation for
patients with dysphagia caused by Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Logemann</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group>: Evaluation and treatment of swallowing disorders.
