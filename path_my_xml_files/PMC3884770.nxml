A rigorous assessment of the effect of lenalidomide on QTc intervals was conducted in healthy volunteers who each received, in randomized order, a single oral dose of 10&#x000a0;mg lenalidomide, 50&#x000a0;mg lenalidomide, 400&#x000a0;mg moxifloxacin (positive control) and placebo. Plasma lenalidomide exposure was compared between healthy volunteers and patients with multiple myeloma or myelodysplastic syndromes. In healthy volunteers, moxifloxacin produced the expected significant prolongation in QTcI (individual correction). For lenalidomide 10&#x000a0;mg and 50&#x000a0;mg, the time-matched changes from placebo in the baseline-adjusted least-squares mean QTcI were &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;ms with the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the change &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ms at all time-points. No subjects experienced QTcI &#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms or change from baseline &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms after lenalidomide administration. Similar results were seen with QT interval data corrected by Fridericia and Bazett methods. The C&#x02013;QTc analysis yielded no significant association between lenalidomide concentrations and QTcI changes up to 1522&#x000a0;ng/mL; this range was close to that observed in patients receiving lenalidomide doses up to 50&#x000a0;mg, including those with reduced drug clearance due to renal impairment. In conclusion, single doses of lenalidomide up to 50&#x000a0;mg were not associated with prolonged QTc intervals in healthy males. The C&#x02013;QTc analysis further assured that lenalidomide doses up to 50&#x000a0;mg are not expected to prolong QTc intervals in patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug with proven clinical activity against a range of haematological malignancies. In combination with dexamethasone, it is currently licensed in the USA, Europe and other countries for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone has also been associated with good tumour response rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, improved progression-free survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and/or improved overall survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> in patients with newly diagnosed MM; this indication is currently under clinical evaluation. In the USA and a few other countries, lenalidomide is also approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The efficacy of lenalidomide is currently being evaluated in clinical studies for other haematological cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and B-cell lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>The maximum approved therapeutic dose of lenalidomide is 25&#x000a0;mg daily for patients with RRMM and 10&#x000a0;mg daily for patients with MDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The maximum clinical dose of lenalidomide for other haematological cancers is generally &#x02264;25&#x000a0;mg. In terms of pharmacokinetic disposition, lenalidomide undergoes minimum metabolism, and 82% of the lenalidomide dose is eliminated unchanged via urinary excretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Renal impairment reduces the elimination of lenalidomide, thereby increasing drug concentration in plasma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. As patients with MM or MDS often have compromised renal function due to their age or comorbidities, plasma lenalidomide exposure is generally higher in these patients than in young healthy volunteers. Dose adjustment according to renal function has been recommended for patients with moderate or worse renal impairment 13.</p><p>The QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR; QTc) is a measure of ventricular repolarization on a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Drug-induced inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG) potassium channels has been associated with QT/QTc interval prolongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. QT/QTc prolongation can lead to an increased susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias, in particular <italic>torsades de pointes</italic>, that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Therefore, regulatory agencies have emphasized the need to characterize the effect of drugs on QT/QTc intervals.</p><p>The potential risk of lenalidomide in delaying cardiac repolarization was investigated previously in non-clinical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular electrophysiological study, a minor (8%) inhibition of hERG current was observed at an extremely high lenalidomide concentration (204&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL); this concentration is approximately 400 times greater than the mean maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) of lenalidomide observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses (up to 25&#x000a0;mg). In anaesthetized dogs, no adverse changes were observed in the cardiovascular system at single intravenous doses of lenalidomide (up to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg). The plasma <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> at 20&#x000a0;mg/kg in dogs was approximately 48 times greater than the efficacious peak plasma concentrations observed in patients. Overall, these non-clinical results suggest that the likelihood of significant QT/QTc prolongation in human beings may be very low for lenalidomide even at supratherapeutic concentrations. However, to date, the effect of lenalidomide on ventricular repolarization in human beings has not been assessed rigorously.</p><p>We conducted a thorough QT (TQT) study to evaluate the effect of lenalidomide on the QTc interval in healthy male volunteers according to the E14 guideline from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. To confirm that the results obtained from the TQT study can be extended to targeted patient populations, we also compared the plasma lenalidomide exposure of healthy volunteers in the TQT study with that of targeted patient populations in other clinical studies and assessed the lenalidomide concentration&#x02013;QTc (C&#x02013;QTc) relationship.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>TQT study</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Sixty healthy male volunteers, aged 18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years, in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical laboratory tests were eligible for enrolment in this study. Body mass index (BMI) and body-weight were required to be in the ranges of 19&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 50&#x02013;115&#x000a0;kg, respectively. Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease and HR &#x0003c;50 or &#x0003e;100 beats per min. were excluded. Subjects with a QT corrected by the Bazett method (QTcB) or by the Fridericia method (QTcF) &#x0003e;430&#x000a0;ms, or with a QTcF &#x0003c;300&#x000a0;ms were also excluded.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to enrolment. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating centres and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single-centre, randomized, single-dose, cross-over study conducted in the USA. The fluoroquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin was used as a positive control in this study because of its well-characterized and consistent QTc prolongation effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The study comprised four periods and four treatment sequences. Participants (<italic>N&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>60) were randomized into four sequences (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>15 per sequence). Each of the 60 subjects received four treatments, in a randomized order: lenalidomide 10&#x000a0;mg, lenalidomide 50&#x000a0;mg, moxifloxacin 400&#x000a0;mg (positive control) and placebo. All treatments were administered orally at the same time each period (approximately 08:00 on day 1 of the period) under fasting conditions together with 240&#x000a0;mL water. There was a 7- to 10-day washout period between treatment periods. The lenalidomide and placebo treatments were given in a double-blind manner, whereas moxifloxacin treatment was open-label to both the investigator and subjects. ECG readers were blinded to all treatments and sequences, including moxifloxacin.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of sample size</title><p>The assumptions made in the sample size calculations for QTc assessment were as follows: (a) the within-subject standard deviation was 9.2&#x000a0;ms; and (b) the true difference in the time-matched and baseline-adjusted QTc between lenalidomide and placebo was 3&#x000a0;ms. According to these assumptions, a sample size of 49 subjects with triplicate ECGs per time-point would provide &#x02265;80% power (for up to 10 time-points) to show that the upper limit of each two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in the baseline-adjusted QTc between lenalidomide and placebo would fall &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ms. The total number of subjects was increased to 60 to account for potential drop-outs during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamic evaluation</title><p>Continuous 12-lead Holter ECG monitoring was performed for approximately 24&#x000a0;hr on the day before treatment (day &#x02212;1) and on the treatment day (day 1) of period 1, and on day 1 of periods 2&#x02013;4. On day 1 of each period, continuous ECG monitoring began 30&#x000a0;min. prior to drug administration and continued for &#x02265;23&#x000a0;hr after administration. ECG monitoring began at a similar time on days &#x02212;1 and 1 of period 1. Subjects were asked to rest in the supine position for 10&#x000a0;min. before and after each scheduled time-point for ECG measurement on days &#x02212;1 and 1. The scheduled ECG measurements were taken at 1&#x000a0;hr and at 0.5&#x000a0;hr before drug administration, immediately before drug administration (denoted as time 0), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 23&#x000a0;hr after drug administration. For a given subject, all baseline and after treatment ECGs were performed using the same ECG Holter monitor. ECGs, recorded on flash memory cards, were sent to the core ECG laboratory (Quintiles, Mumbai, India) for blinded, third-party evaluation. Triplicate ECGs, taken 2&#x000a0;min. apart, were extracted from the flash memory card at the scheduled time-points. ECGs were analysed for ventricular HR, PR intervals, QRS complexes, RR intervals, QT intervals and morphological changes in the ECG waveform. A single ECG reader, who was blinded to the study, was assigned to read all ECGs for a particular subject on 1&#x000a0;day.</p><p>The primary method used to correct QT interval for HR was the individual correction method: QTcI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>&#x003b2;</sup>, where RR is the interval between adjacent QRS complexes and &#x003b2; is the patient-specific correction factor. All the individual QT and RR interval pairs collected on day &#x02212;1 and prior to dosing on day 1, in period 1, were used to calculate the correction factor &#x003b2; for QTcI. Secondary correction methods included the Fridericia method, where QTcF&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>, and the Bazett correction method, where QTcB&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;QT/RR<sup>1/2</sup>. For evaluation of QTc prolongation, triplicate QTc measures were averaged at each time-point. The baseline QTc value was defined as the average of pre-dose assessments at 1, 0.5 and 0&#x000a0;hr prior to drug administration on day 1 of each treatment period.</p><p>For central tendency analysis, a mixed-effect analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) was performed on change from baseline in QTcI with fixed effects for treatment, period, sequence, scheduled time, period-specific baseline value as a covariate and the interaction of treatment by scheduled time with scheduled time as a repeated measure. The upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI was calculated for the difference in the baseline-adjusted least-squares (LS) mean QTcI between lenalidomide and placebo treatments at each time-point. If the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI (equivalent to the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI) at all time-points fell &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ms (regulatory concern) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, it was considered that the lenalidomide doses tested do not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically significant degree (i.e. negative QT study). Similar analyses were performed for QTcB and QTcF.</p><p>The effect of moxifloxacin on QTcI was evaluated at 1, 2, 3 and 4&#x000a0;hr after administration to assess study sensitivity. At each time-point, the difference in the baseline-adjusted LS mean QTcI between moxifloxacin and placebo treatments and the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% CI for the difference was computed using <sc>ancova</sc>. If the lower limit of the 97.5% CI was &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;ms for at least one time-point for moxifloxacin, the study was deemed acceptable for evaluating the effect of lenalidomide on QTc.</p><p>For categorical analyses, the number and percentage of subjects with maximum QTc interval values &#x0003c;450, 450&#x02013;480, 481&#x02013;500 and &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;ms, and the number and percentage of subjects with maximum QTc interval increases from baseline to &#x0003c;0 or no increase, 1&#x02013;30&#x000a0;ms, 31&#x02013;60&#x000a0;ms and &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms were calculated. The results were compared between treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic evaluation</title><p>In each treatment period, blood samples were collected from each subject before, within 5&#x000a0;min. of drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 23&#x000a0;hr after administration. After administration samples were collected within 5&#x000a0;min. after the nominal ECG time to avoid interference with the ECG recordings.</p><p>The plasma concentrations of lenalidomide were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.

If the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the C&#x02013;QTc relationship was used, the increase in QTc for the 50&#x000a0;mg dose would be 2.71&#x000a0;ms (corresponding to a slope of 0.00273&#x000a0;ms&#x000a0;ng/mL), which was far below the threshold of the regulatory concern (10&#x000a0;ms).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of the TQT study was to provide a rigorous assessment of the potential for lenalidomide to prolong the QTc interval in human beings across the therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentration ranges. The primary hypothesis compared the change in QTc interval from pre-dose baseline values between lenalidomide and placebo treatments. In this study, there was no detectable increase in QTc at any time-point studied after lenalidomide administration.</p><p>The TQT study was carried out in healthy volunteers to circumvent many of the obstacles to QTc evaluation encountered in patients with cancer. Patients with MM or MDS are older (often elderly), have multiple comorbidities (e.g. hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, anaemia) and receive concurrent medications including those associated with QTc prolongation. These patients may also be at increased risk of severe cardiac arrhythmias due to treatment-related factors such as electrolyte imbalances (hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia), poor nutritional status and the effects of supportive medications (antiemetics, antihistamines) on QTc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Performing a QT interval study in healthy volunteers allows the collection of robust ECG and pharmacokinetic data, minimizes confounding factors and uses a positive control, all of which facilitate data interpretation.</p><p>Single doses were chosen in this study because lenalidomide and its major metabolites (&#x0003c;5% of the parent compounds in plasma) do not accumulate over time in plasma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The lenalidomide dose levels of 10 and 50&#x000a0;mg were chosen to cover a broad concentration range similar to that observed in clinical trials with patients. A higher dose, causing a plasma concentration in substantial excess of that observed in the targeted patient population, was not used in this study due to non-clinical toxicity profile considerations.</p><p>The sensitivity of the study in detecting a modest increase in QTc interval was established with the positive control moxifloxacin at a dose of 400&#x000a0;mg. The time-matched changes from placebo in the baseline-adjusted LS mean QTcI interval were between 7 and 10&#x000a0;ms 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;hr after moxifloxacin administration, with the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% CI &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;ms at 2 and 4&#x000a0;hr. The timing and magnitude of QTc prolongation after the administration of moxifloxacin was consistent with the response typically reported for this positive control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Thus, the study has demonstrated the ability to detect a small QTc prolongation.</p><p>For lenalidomide doses of 10 and 50&#x000a0;mg, all time-matched changes from placebo in the baseline-adjusted LS mean QTcI interval were &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;ms, with the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI staying substantially &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ms. The central analyses also showed negative results using QTcF and QTcB data. In addition, there were no extreme QTc values (QTc &#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms or QTc change from baseline &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms) after lenalidomide treatment. The ICH E14 definition of a negative TQT study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> was thereby met.</p><p>Regulatory guidance requires examination of QT/QTc prolongation at supratherapeutic doses to account for increased systemic drug concentrations, which may be encountered in clinical practice. Lenalidomide at a dose of 50&#x000a0;mg is twice the approved maximum therapeutic dose for MM (25&#x000a0;mg) and five times that for MDS (10&#x000a0;mg). The mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (698&#x000a0;ng/mL) achieved at the 50&#x000a0;mg dose in the TQT study was approximately 26% more than that observed in patients with MM (555&#x000a0;ng/mL at 25&#x000a0;mg), and 390% greater than the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> reported in patients with MDS (179&#x000a0;ng/mL at 10&#x000a0;mg) (table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In the TQT study, individual lenalidomide <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> in plasma ranged from 76 to 1522&#x000a0;ng/mL, and no statistically significant or clinically important relationship was observed between drug concentration and QTcI change. The <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> range observed in the TQT study was close to that observed in patients receiving lenalidomide doses up to 50&#x000a0;mg (58 to 2413&#x000a0;ng/mL, with only two patients having a <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> &#x0003e;1500&#x000a0;ng/mL). Further, utilizing the C&#x02013;QTc model obtained from the TQT study, the upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the changes in QTcI at the geometric mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (994&#x000a0;ng/mL) was predicted to be far below the 10&#x000a0;ms threshold in patients with MM receiving the supratherapeutic dose (50&#x000a0;mg).</p><p>In the absence of dose adjustment, the most likely condition associated with elevated lenalidomide exposure in plasma is renal impairment. Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> reported individual <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values ranging from 376 to 1047&#x000a0;ng/mL (25&#x000a0;mg dose) in patients with various degrees of renal impairment, a range that is within the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> range evaluated in the current TQT study. Thus, even at the maximum therapeutic dose (25&#x000a0;mg), lenalidomide concentrations in patients with renal impairment are not expected to exceed the highest level observed in the TQT study.</p><p>In patients with MM or MDS with comorbidities, lenalidomide may be coadministered with antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antiemetics, antihistamines and other chemotherapies, some of which are known to be associated with QT prolongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, pharmacokinetic interactions are not anticipated between lenalidomide, and most of these comedications because lenalidomide is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes that are responsible for elimination of many QT-prolonging drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In addition, lenalidomide has little effect on the hERG current <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations far above the clinical concentration range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>; interaction with other drugs at the hERG potassium channels is also unlikely to occur. Thus, when lenalidomide is coadministered with a QT-prolonging drug, the likelihood of an increased risk in QT prolongation is considered to be low.</p><p>MM and MDS are diseases occurring at advanced age, and most patients with MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality are female. These two populations (female sex and advanced age) are more susceptible to drug-induced long QT syndrome and <italic>torsades de pointes</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Although the current TQT study excluded females and the elderly due to safety considerations, in pivotal lenalidomide trials, the median age of patients with MM was approximately 63&#x000a0;years with 40% of them are female. The median age of patients with MDS was approximately 70&#x000a0;years with over two-thirds female [data on file]. Data from these patients treated with lenalidomide did not reveal any concerns with regard to QTc prolongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Also, as mentioned earlier, the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> range observed in the TQT study was close to that observed in the pharmacokinetic studies of patients (35% female and approximately 33% elderly) receiving lenalidomide doses up to 50&#x000a0;mg (the supratherapeutic dose). Given the negative QTc findings over this wide <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> range, it is unlikely that lenalidomide would cause clinically relevant QTc prolongation in female and elderly patients.</p><p>When taken together, the negative QTc findings from the central and categorical analyses, the flat C&#x02013;QTcI relationship and the known drug concentration ranges in patients, all support that lenalidomide up to 50&#x000a0;mg is unlikely to cause QTc prolongation in the targeted patient population.</p><p>In conclusion, single doses of lenalidomide 10 and 50&#x000a0;mg were not associated with prolongation of the QT interval in healthy male patients. The C&#x02013;QTc analysis further confirmed that lenalidomide doses up to 50&#x000a0;mg are not expected to prolong QTc intervals in patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lilia Weiss, MD, for her critical review of this manuscript.
