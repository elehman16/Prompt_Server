</p></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Melasma is a common pigmentary disorder that presents as irregular light grey brown patches over the face having serrated, irregular and geographic borders. The etiology of melasma is multifactorial.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Based on depth of pigmentation, melasma is classified into epidermal melasma, dermal melasma and mixed pattern. Management of melasma involves the use topical medications such as hydroquinone, tretinoin, azelaic acid (AA), kojic acid, corticosteroids and their various combinations; chemical peels such as glycolic acid (GA), salicylic acid, lactic acid, trichloroacetic acid, phenol etc.; and laser treatments.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Triple combination (TC) cream is considered the first-line treatment of melasma.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] One of the modifications of Kligman's formula employs a TC of 4% hydroquinone, 0.05% tretinoin, and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] For the Indian skin, which is mostly of 4&#x02013;6 Fitzpatrick skin type, one of the most widely available market preparation is the low potency TC in which the strength of hydroquinone has been reduced to 2% and of topical tretinoin to 0.025&#x02013;0.05%. AA, 20% cream has been shown to be as effective as 4% and superior to 2% hydroquinone, but without its side-effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] GA peels act in melasma due to the effect on epidermal remodeling and accelerated desquamation, resulting in quick pigment dispersion.</p><p>The present study was aimed to assess the efficacy of low potency TC (hydroquinone 2%/tretinoin 0.05%/fluocinolone 0.01%) versus GA peels/AA 20% cream (GA/AA) combination in melasma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized study of 24 weeks duration conducted during the period from May to October 2012. An approval was obtained from Institute's Ethical Committee before starting the trial. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of melasma attending the pigmentary clinic at our institute were screened for recruitment into the study. Pregnant or lactating females, patients with a known hypersensitivity to chemical peels/AA/hydroquinone/retinoic acid in the past, patients on isotretinoin in the past 6 months, and patients with active infection or recent tanning were excluded.</p><p>An informed consent was taken from all patients before recruitment. Detailed history regarding the duration and extent of the disease, family history, past treatment and aggravating/initiating factors was recorded. Clinical examination including melasma area and severity index (MASI) scores of all the patients was noted. MASI score was calculated a dermatologist colleague by ranking the severity of melasma in terms of its darkness (D), homogeneity (H) of appearance and the percentage area of the face affected (A) and then using the following formula:</p><p>MASI = 0.3(D<sub>F</sub> + H<sub>F</sub>)A<sub>F</sub> + 0.3(D<sub>MR</sub> + H<sub>MR</sub>) A<sub>MR</sub> + 0.3(D<sub>ML</sub> + H<sub>ML</sub>)A<sub>ML</sub> + 0.1(D<sub>C</sub> + H<sub>C</sub>)A<sub>C</sub></p><p>Darkness was ranked from 0 to 4, homogeneity from 0 to 4 and area from 0 to 6.</p><p>The lesions were photographed with and without flash with a standard 5 pixel digital camera at 30 cm distance and approximately 2 Mb resolution. In addition, visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to + 10 was assessed by comparing follow-up images to the baseline photograph pretreatment. VAS was assessed by the same dermatologist colleague who was blinded and not involved in administering treatment to the patients. On the VAS, 0 represented no pigmentation and 10 represented maximum pigmentation. VAS measurements of photographic documentation were available at time points 0 (baseline) and 12 weeks. Finally, based on the extent of improvement, the patients were arbitrarily classified into one of the following categories: Marked if there was &#x0003e;75% reduction from baseline MASI; good if MASI reduced by 50&#x02013;74%; satisfactory if it reduced by 25&#x02013;49% and less than satisfactory if &#x0003c;25% reduction in MASI was achieved.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Forty patients with melasma were randomly allotted to one of the two treatment groups using random number table. The patients were recruited by RM, AJK, DP and MSK. Random numbers were generated by RM who was also responsible for allocating patients to respective intervention groups. RS was not involved in patient recruitment and treatment allocation and was involved in evaluating the efficacy outcomes. Patients who were already on some topical treatment for melasma were given a wash-off period of at least 2 weeks before recruiting into the present study.</p><p>Group A: Comprising of 20 patients received topical low potency TC cream (hydroquinone 2%/tretinoin 0.05%/fluocinolone 0.01%) for once daily application at night time. The choice of TC cream was the low potency cream containing hydroquinone 2% instead of 4% (as approved by USFDA) as the former concentration of hydroquinone is present in most of the TC brands available in Indian market.</p><p>Group B: Comprising of 20 patients received combination of GA/AA in the treatment of melasma. For starting GA peels, no priming was required. Initially unbuffered 20% GA was kept for 3&#x02013;5 min and the concentration was gradually increased to 35%, 50% and 70% for 3&#x02013;5 min. End point of treatment session was attainment of the stipulated period or appearance of erythema. The peel was neutralized with cold water. All patients were advised strict sun protection and liberal use of emollients and broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30. GA peels were repeated at every 2 weeks interval. AA 20% cream was prescribed for once daily application at night time for ensuring greater adherence. However, for 2 days before and after GA peels, application of AA 20% cream was discontinued.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Evaluation</title><p>The treatment was continued in all patients for 12 weeks.</p><p>Primary outcome</p><p>During the study period, MASI score was calculated at baseline (0 week), 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.

The topical steroid in a TC cream helps to minimize the irritation potential of a topical retinoid as well as that of hydroquinone in addition to having its own tyrosinase inhibiting activity. The topical retinoid helps to increase the proliferation of keratinocytes as well as increases the penetration of hydroquinone. Due to its irritant potential, the combination has been modified to suit ethnic skin such that the concentration of hydroquinone has been reduced to 2 &#x02212; 4% and tretinoin to 0.025 &#x02212; 0.05% and the steroid has been variously changed to fluocinolone, fluticasone or mometasone. Due to its efficacy, it is extensively used as first-line therapy for melasma.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the present study, the low potency TC group showed a significant reduction in mean MASI score after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy with only 4 patients experiencing mild adverse effects. Good to marked reduction in MASI was seen in 70% of the patients. This further confirms the efficacy and safety of TC in management of melasma.</p><p>However, a similar efficacy was seen with GA/AA 20% cream combination (group B). The mean MASI scores in group B were significantly reduced after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment and were not significantly different from group A. Seventy-five percent of the patients in group B achieved good to a marked reduction in MASI after 3 months of therapy. The rate of reduction in MASI was also comparable between the two groups. As expected, dermal melasma was more recalcitrant to treatment in both groups. Although one patient withdrew from group B citing increased photosensitivity, the number of patients experiencing adverse events was similar in both the groups. Monotherapy with both GA peels and AA 20% cream have been shown to be effective in melasma.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Moreover, GA peels have been combined with modified Kligman's formula,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] AA,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with the combination therapy showing superiority over monotherapy. A pilot study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with TC cream and a series of GA peels found 13 of 20 participants to have achieved treatment success by week 12.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>From these results, we can infer that both GA peel/AA 20% cream combination and low potency TC cream are effective in reducing the severity of melasma among Indian patients. However, the GA peel/AA 20% cream combination may offer several benefits over the TC cream. As mentioned above, AA 20% is superior to 2% hydroquinone.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Moreover, long term use of hydroquinone have been associated with several adverse effects such as confetti like the depigmentation also visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, oochronosis, mutagenecity, and rebound hyperpigmentation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Addition of GA peels to AA cream is also advantageous as GA peels lead to improved surface texture and appearance.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The exfoliative effect of GA peels stimulates new epidermal growth and collagen with more evenly distributed the melanin. These have been shown to improve photodamaged skin and fine wrinkles.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] GA is a versatile peeling agent. It alters dermal collagen and matrix via fibroblast modulation.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and also has an antioxidant action, thus offering photoprotection.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Finally omission of steroid (either fluocinolone or mometasone) prevents the steroid associated adverse effects. An advantage of TC cream is the ease of application since it is not associated with any downtime seen with GA peels. Another aspect is the cost of treatment as the cost of chemical peels will be much higher in a private clinic. However, in this study, in-house prepared peels were offered free of cost to the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title/><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations of the present study. First is a small size due to which the power of the study was inadequate. Another limitation is a relatively short follow-up period of 3 months. Since the study was not placebo controlled or blinded, it may give rise to additional bias. Although randomization was done, no other measures were taken to conceal the random allocation. Hence, larger studies with longer follow-up of 6 months to 1 year should be undertaken to validate the results of the present study. However, it may be noted that although combining GA peels with a topical agent is not a new idea, yet either AA 20% cream/GA peels may be used for long-term maintenance after desirable results have been achieved with the TC cream. This is the first study that shows the efficacy and safety of GA peels/AA 20% cream combination in treating melasma.</p><p>We conclude that considering the similar effectiveness in reducing MASI, GA peel/AA 20% cream combination is an effective alternative to the widely available and used low potency TC creams in ethnic skin in the management of melasma. However, we may add that more rigorous trials are needed to validate the observations of our study.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p><bold>What is new?</bold></p><p>Low potency triple combination cream and GA/AA 20% cream combination both lead to a similar reduction the melasma severity in ethnic skin.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sheth</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pandya</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Melasma: A comprehensive update: Part I</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>2011</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>689</fpage><lpage>97</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21920241</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sheth</surname><given-names>VM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pandya</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Melasma: A comprehensive update: Part II</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>2011</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>699</fpage><lpage>714</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21920242</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Majid</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mometasone-based triple combination therapy in melasma: Is it really safe?</article-title><source>Indian J Dermatol</source><year>2010</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>359</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21430890</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torok</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comprehensive review of the long-term and short-term treatment of melasma with a triple combination cream</article-title><source>Am J Clin Dermatol</source><year>2006</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>223</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16901182</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torok</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Wieder</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A large 12-month extension study of an 8-week trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of triple combination (TC) cream in melasma patients previously treated with TC cream or one of its dyads</article-title><source>J Drugs Dermatol</source><year>2005</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>592</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16167418</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bali&#x000f1;a</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Graupe</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The treatment of melasma 20% azelaic acid versus 4% hydroquinone cream</article-title><source>Int J Dermatol</source><year>1991</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>893</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1816137</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zaumseil</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Graupe</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Topical azelaic acid in treatment of melasma-pharmacological and clinical considerations.
