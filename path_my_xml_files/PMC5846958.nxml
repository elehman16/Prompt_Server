The disorder is characterized by a chronic progressive demyelination and axonal degeneration within the central nervous system, leading to a wide variety of cognitive and physical symptoms. While these symptoms vary greatly among MS patients, walking impairment and fatigue have been identified as two of the most common symptoms in MS. Clinical research has shown that exercise in MS patients can improve muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and fatigue. Some research suggests, though this is still debated, that exercise may also slow MS disease progression through its effect on stress hormones, the immune system<sup>1</sup> and/or growth hormones. Neuroscience studies investigating the role of exercise in the white matter (WM) of healthy individuals reported an increase of WM fiber pathways after active training.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Similar results were obtained in MS patients, where a group undergoing motor training preserved their WM integrity in the corpus callosum, as opposed to the control group, which experienced a significant worsening in microstructural integrity.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Not all MS patients, however, appear to benefit from rehabilitation and the benefit can be short lived. Which exercise or rehabilitative program is <sup>best</sup> remains also an unresolved question. A recent review of rehabilitation strategies in MS has highlighted the paucity of well-designed studies evaluating the different approaches used in MS rehabilitation.</p><p>Fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a pre-synaptic potassium channel blocker found to improve axonal conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers, as well as synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, resulting in an enhancement of neurological functions in people with MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the past several years, multiple clinical trials confirmed the beneficial effects of fampridine on walking speed and distance in MS patients, with improvement in walking abilities ranging from 31% to 46%.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr13-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Fampridine was also found to have long-lasting improvement on the quality of life of MS patients (e.g. relationship difficulties, fatigue, time perspective).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Prolonged-release fampridine (PRF) 10 mg twice a day (BID) is now considered a standard treatment for MS patients experiencing walking difficulties.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2055217318761168" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, less than 40% of MS&#x000a0;patients will show measurable benefit from PRF.</p><p>NeuroGym has developed a rehabilitation program for MS patients known as enabled active motor training (EAMT). This approach (see Appendix 1) focuses on improving motor control, biomechanics and strength of movement, in addition to the expected improvement in conditioning that is associated with exercise. The training program includes elements of strength training, mobility, balance and control training that address the major deficits identified in the initial individual evaluation of each patient with a focus on mobility. The approach maximizes brain-muscle interaction by manipulating both environmental and physical resources.</p><p>At the neurophysiological level, in MS patients acquiring motor skills implies learning to compensate for lost neural connections. Pharmaceutical intervention that enhances neural communication such as PRF could potentially facilitate such a process. We hypothesized that combining PRF with EAMT could lead to greater improvement in motor function and in a greater percentage of MS patients than with EAMT alone.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate in MS patients of all types with moderate disability the effect of a rehabilitation program as per the EAMT approach combined with PRF 10&#x000a0;mg BID or placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-2055217318761168"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec3-2055217318761168"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The present study was reviewed and authorized by the Canadian Shield institutional review board. Consent was obtained from each patient. A sample of 41 patients diagnosed with MacDonald criteria (2010) MS were recruited for this pilot, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week study. Patients were evaluated four weeks prior to randomization then at 0, 6, and 14 weeks post-randomization. The patients were randomized so half received PRF 10 mg BID, while the other half received a placebo. All patients met the prescribed criteria for PRF use as per product monograph, were clinically stable at entry and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.5 and 7.0 with a pyramidal system functional assessment score of 2 or greater and the ability to complete all the assessments at baseline with or without aids. All the EDSS were performed by a single Neurostatus-trained neurologist. All patients underwent rehabilitation as per the NeuroGym EAMT approach, consisting of three sessions of one hour per week for a period of six weeks. The NeuroGym protocol (see Appendix 1) consists of a safe, physiotherapist-supervised training environment with an emphasis on repetition of enabled movement using biofeedback combined with a significant element of strengthening and biomechanics optimization. Movements necessary for walking are enabled despite significant disability with the help of specialized equipment such as the Bunger Mobility Trainer or the sit-to-stand (STS) apparatus. Biofeedback is attained using electromyography (EMG)-triggered video games. Walking balance is regained through controlled repetition of relearning exercises. This was followed by an eight-week observational period, during which patients kept taking their medication (PRF or placebo) and were encouraged to continue a training program at home.</p><p>Responders to treatment were defined as patients who displayed a 20% improvement from baseline in a specific task at a specific time point. Mean percentage improvement was measured for all patients within each of the two groups (placebo or PRF treated). Randomization was stratified according to EDSS to ensure a similar number of patients with EDSS of six or more in each group.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2055217318761168"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="sec5-2055217318761168"><title>Timed 8-meter walk (T8MW)</title><p>The T8MW measures the time needed by a patient to walk eight meters, from the initiation of the instruction to reaching the eight-meter mark.

Our study similarly demonstrates the capacity of MS patients despite having significant preexisting disability (mean EDSS 4.7) to undergo a training program that resulted after only six weeks in significant motor improvement in the placebo group as shown by the 6MW (8% mean group improvement) and FTSTS (18.8% mean group improvement) but interestingly not for the T8MW. The NeuroGym EAMT program employed in our study provided training in many aspects of mobility but especially for standing (see Appendix 1), which we believe explains why the greatest improvement was noted in the FTSTS. The fact that the benefit was still present after an eight-week observational period testifies to the durability of the benefit.</p><p>Comparison of the PRF group to the placebo group demonstrates the benefits of PRF in addition to motor training, noting both a greater number of responders and greater group mean improvement at both time points. The lack of statistical significance can be attributed to our study being underpowered. The benefit was more marked in regards to gait and standing speed as measured by the T8MW and FTSTS and less with regards to endurance as measured by the 6MW. This could be explained by the PRF mechanism of action and/or the greater impact of the EAMT on the 6MW.</p><p>While the PRF group displayed consistent improvement in walking speed over time, the placebo group when compared to baseline actually performed slightly worse over time. A potential explanation for the lack of &#x0201c;improvement&#x0201d; in the T8MW is the nature of motor training combined with the requirement of the task. The NeuroGym EAMT program encouraged and resulted in mechanical changes in gait (e.g. focus on bending at the knee during stance and avoiding hyperextension)&#x02014;such changes, though functionally very effective, can result in a different focus and in a temporary decrease in short distance gait speed.</p><p>A large number of patients qualified as responders in one or more of the three tests at weeks 6 and 14. While the number of responders was as expected higher at week 6 than at week 14 for the T8MW and the 6MW, the opposite was true for the FTSTS, with more patients qualifying as responders at week 14 than at week 6. Though our confidence intervals were large, this could suggest a more sustained improvement in lower extremity strength from the PRF-enhanced motor training and/or the result of improving other tested components of the FTSTS such as balance.</p><sec id="sec11-2055217318761168"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study had several limitations, including but not limited to small sample size and relatively short duration. The question would have been better addressed with a study design that included a group of PRF alone and a group without either motor training or PRF. Though we stratified randomization according to EDSS, the placebo group had consistently poorer performances on all three measures including at weeks &#x02013;4 and 0. Randomization stratification according to performance at the week &#x02013;4 evaluations could perhaps have resulted in more balanced groups when it came to motor performance. Our confidence intervals were quite large and overlapped significantly, indicative of significant heterogeneity within groups, which is to be expected with inclusion of EDSS ranging from 3.5 to 7.0 inclusively. Perhaps with a greater study population we could have further divided the groups into EDSS less than 4 and greater than 4, resulting in more homogenous groups and tighter confidence intervals. Our repeated use of the study measures could have induced a learning effect throughout the study. However, closer examination shows that there did not seem to be any significant &#x0201c;learning&#x0201d; of the study measures when we look at changes in the results between the evaluations at weeks &#x02013;4 and 0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec12-2055217318761168"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though none of our between-group study endpoints reached statistical significance, all of our results trended toward a beneficial effect of combining PRF treatment with active motor training. These performance increases were present in patients with all types of MS, and were more noticeable compared to placebo at week 14. We believe that with greater statistical power our study would have confirmed an additive benefit of using PRF as an adjunct to motor training in MS&#x000a0;patients both in degree and sustainability of the improvement.</p><p>Our results confirm previous studies demonstrating that MS patients, despite significant disability, do benefit from a rehabilitation program. Such benefit was sustained eight weeks later. Our study is the first to show a trend suggesting that PRF in MS patients appears to enhance the benefit of EAMT. Further studies are required to confirm this.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was presented during a poster session at the conference of American Academy of Neurology, 2015.</p></ack><sec id="sec15-2055217318761168"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr F.

Following an evaluation of strength, range, balance, mobility and control deficits, a training program is designed for each individual. The training program includes elements of strength training, mobility, balance and control training that address the major deficits identified in the evaluation&#x02014;with a focus on mobility.</p><p>The NeuroGym movement enhancement approach is a system of training that maximizes brain-muscle interaction by manipulating both environmental and physical resources. For example, the Bungee Mobility Trainer (BMT: see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurogymtech.com">www.neurogymtech.com</ext-link>) is an apparatus allowing patients to experience falls without injury and is equipped with a &#x0201c;body weight support system&#x0201d; assisting them in balance and mobility exercises if needed. The STS is essentially a counter-weight system allowing the patient to strengthen the leg&#x02019;s muscles specific to the ability of standing up from a chair. The Ankle Trainer (AT) isolates movements of the ankle in all directions in order to improve proprioception and strength. Finally, the NeuroGym biofeedback (BFB) allows training of specific movements using EMG and movement sensors to control simple video games.</p><p>Balance exercises include mobility training (ambulation, tandem walking, high knee walk and supervised treadmill) and exercises performed in the BMT (soccer, assisted single-leg stance on the affected leg, side steps, and &#x0201c;step up&#x0201d; on stool). Strength training is active or active assisted and focuses mainly on the weaker leg for hip flexion, hip abduction, knee flexion-extension, ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and eversion (using the AT). When necessary, active assisted STS is performed using the STS apparatus. Control exercises using NeuroGym biofeedback are necessary to improve control and proprioception of the affected leg&#x02019;s knee (avoiding hyperextension) and the control and proprioception of the ankle (promoting dorsiflexion and avoiding inversion).</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back></article>
