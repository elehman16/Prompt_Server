Weight gain measurement during anti tuberculosis (TB) treatment period is an important component to assess the progress of TB patients. In this study, Latent Growth Models (LGMs) were implemented in a longitudinal design to predict the change in weight of TB patients who were given three different regimens under randomized controlled clinical trial for anti-TB treatment. Linear and Quadratic LGMs were fitted using M<italic>plus</italic> software. The age, sex and treatment response of the TB patients were used as time invariant independent variables of the growth trajectories. The quadratic trend was found to be better in explaining the changes in weight without grouping than the quadratic model for three group comparisons. A significant increase in the change of weight over time was identified while a significant quadratic effect indicated that weights were sustained over time. The growth rate was similar in both the groups. The treament response had significant association with the growth rate of weight scores of the patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>India remains one of the highest TB burden countries with an estimate of 2.2 million cases out of global incidence of 8.7 million cases and 300, 000 deaths out of 1.4 million global TB death in 2011 <xref rid="pone.0091152-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Comparative indices compare the target model with fit of the base line model. For example, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), CFI and TLI range from 0 to 1.

A significant increase in weight scores was observed in the all three groups whereas the increase in group three is higher than the group one and two (Group 1: Intercept &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40.274 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.458), p&#x0003c;0.001, slope &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.309 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.068), p&#x0003c;0.001; quadratic effect &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.115, (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.012), p&#x0003c;0.001; Group 2: Intercept &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40.031 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.517), p&#x0003c;0.001, slope &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.343 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.081), p&#x0003c;0.001; quadratic effect &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.112 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.011), p&#x0003c;0.001; Group 3: Intercept &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40.088 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.496), p&#x0003c;0.001, slope &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.390 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.087), p&#x0003c;0.001; quadratic effect &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.126 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.013), p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Because of RMSEA value of the model was higher, the conditional quadratic LGM was fitted by adding the covariates age, sex and response to explain the individual differences in initial mean and changes over time in the sample of 1000 using bootstrap method. The mean intercept, slope and parameter estimates for the multi groups LGM analysis of weight scores of the patients who received the three regimens are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091152-t003">Table 3</xref>. The fit indices for the model was improved (CFI &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.986, TLI &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.974, RMSEA &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.110) than the linear LGMs and the basic quadratic LGM. All the three groups showed a significant increase in weight scores while the increase was little higher for the group 3 (1.408, p&#x0003c;0.001) as compared to group1 (1.344, p&#x0003c;0.001) and group 2 (1.183, p&#x0003c;0.001). But a significant quadratic effect showed weights were sustained over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091152-t003">Table 3</xref>). There were no group differences in intercept and slopes by assuming there was no variance for quadratic effect in the three groups. Gender differences were found to be statistically significant in the intercepts of three groups. The corresponding estimates of intercept on the covariate sex are 7.822 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.836, p&#x0003c;0.001), 7.002 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.095, p&#x0003c;0.001) and 7.264 (S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.991, p&#x0003c;0.001) for group1, 2 and 3 respectively and no differences were observed in slopes. Hence, there were no differences in the change of weight scores across the three regimen groups of TB patients during the treatment period. There were no age effects on intercepts and slopes in the three groups except for the third group. The response was significantly associated with increase in the weight scores of first regimen group at the intercept level (2.976, S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.079, p&#x0003c;0.01) and in the third regimen group at slope level (0.178, S.E &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.075, p&#x0003c;0.05).

LGM has several advantages in using longitudianl design than conventional techniques such as repeated analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA). One among the strengths of LGM is the use of latent repeated measures which is not used in other techniques of model trajectory <xref rid="pone.0091152-Bollen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. LGM was very helpful in this study to identify a complete picture of a linear or nonlinear change of parameter estimations along with their co-variances. The main aim of the paper was to explore the LGM models in weight changes of the TB patients under different regimens. LGM and Quadratic LGM were fitted for the weight of TB patients using the initial stage of treatment as the baseline for assessing pattern of changes over time. The quadratic LGM without grouping was found to be better model than multiple group quadratic LGM for studing the changing pattern of weight of the TB patients.</p><p>A statistically significant gender difference was identified in the change of weight over time on the latent factor intercept but not in slope. But the age effect on slopes was having negative association with the wieght scores where as the response was significantly associated with increase in weight scores of the patients over time. Weight loss is one of the major symptoms along with other respiratory disease in patients with TB at the time of TB diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0091152-VanLettow1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091152-Baldwin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091152-Cegielski1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091152-Schwenk1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Once TB patients start to receive anti-TB treatment, there would be an increase in concomitant appetite and weight gain. When the infectivity symptoms are reduced, the weights are sustained over time. These may be probable reasons for the trend of weight of TB patients over time follows nonlinear.</p><p>There are many studies from our centre that have shown that the effect of gain in body weight on the treatment outcome. An epidemiological survey conducted in Tiruvallur district, south India reported that higher death rates of TB patients were associated with their initial loss of body weight (&#x0003c;35 kgs) <xref rid="pone.0091152-Vasantha3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and cure of TB patients were associated with gain of weight during treatment period <xref rid="pone.0091152-Vasantha2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A study from Peru reported that patients with good outcome gained, on average, almost 1 kg compared to their baseline weight, whereas those with poor outcome lost 1 kg after adjusting for age, gender, type of TB, scheme of treatment, HIV status, and sputum variation during follow-up, after the first month of treatment <xref rid="pone.0091152-BernabeOrtiz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Hao et al, 2013 <xref rid="pone.0091152-Hoa1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, assessed the relationship between change in weight and anti TB treatment outcome. They found that new sputum smear positive TB patients with a successful treatment outcome gained an average of 2.6 kg during treatment. Patients with weight loss during the first two months of treatment were more likely to have an unsuccessful outcome than those without weight loss.</p><p>Our quadratic LGM model identified the trend of weight scores and the significance between the weight score and the treatment out come. Hence Quadratic LGM models are valuable tools to predict the changes in weight scores of TB patients that determine the progress or failure of the treatment. The data considered in this paper were limited and did not include other important assessments of TB diagnosis which are related to cure of the patients. The other extensions and applications of growth curve models include growth mixture models, piecewise growth curve models, modeling changes in latent variables and structured latent curve models need further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0091152.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
