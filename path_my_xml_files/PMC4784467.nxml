Many interventions encourage self-monitoring of steps, which can increase physical activity in the short term. However, these interventions appear insufficient to increase motivation for sustained change. There is a need for innovative strategies to increase physical activity motivation in this population. Narratives are uniquely persuasive, and video games show promise for increasing motivation. This study will determine the effectiveness of an intervention that combines narrative and gaming to encourage sustained physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>SMARTGOAL (Self-Monitoring Activity: a Randomized Trial of Game-Oriented AppLications) is a randomized controlled intervention trial. The intervention period is six months, followed by a six month maintenance period. Participants (overweight, sedentary postmenopausal breast cancer survivors aged 45&#x02013;75) will be randomized to a self-monitoring group or an enhanced narrative game group. The self-monitoring group will be encouraged to use a mobile application for self-monitoring and feedback and will receive 15 counseling phone calls emphasizing self-regulation. The narrative game group will be encouraged to use a mobile application that includes self-monitoring and feedback as well as a narrative-based active video game. The 15 calls for this group will emphasize concepts related to the game storyline. Counseling calls in both groups will occur weekly in months 1 &#x02013; 3 and monthly in months 4 &#x02013; 6. No counseling calls will occur after month 6, but both groups will be encouraged to continue using their apps. The primary outcome of the study is minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at six months. Other objectively measured outcomes include fitness and physical function. Self-reported outcomes include quality of life, depression, and motivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol will result in implementation and evaluation of two technology-based physical activity interventions among breast cancer survivors. Both interventions hold promise for broad dissemination. Understanding the potential benefit of adding narrative and game elements to interventions will provide critical information to interventionists, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.

Breast cancer survivors represent a large population that faces unique challenges to health and well-being from their cancer, its treatment, and from co-morbidities. Physical activity is an increasingly recognized method to address many of these challenges. Physical activity improves mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], leading to improvements in quality of life and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Both physical activity duration and intensity appear to have a dose&#x02013;response relationship with improved health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but improvements can result from as little as 15&#x000a0;minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While 150&#x000a0;minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity per week has been associated with decreased breast cancer recurrence and mortality as well as improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], only 37&#x000a0;% of breast cancer survivors reported meeting this recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Objective measures of activity revealed that breast cancer survivors accumulated approximately four minutes per day of moderate to vigorous intensity activity, compared to eleven minutes in non-breast cancer controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This difference was sustained years after diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Cancer mortality was higher among African-American than among White women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and disease-free survival, quality of life, and physical function were lower in African-American and Hispanic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Though physical activity could produce beneficial effects for survival, comorbidities, and quality of life, minority breast cancer survivors were less active than White survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, interventions are needed that appeal to a broad range of women, in particular African American and Hispanic survivors.</p><p>Interventions for increasing physical activity among cancer survivors typically include pedometers to self-monitor walking along with behavioral counseling to deliver behavior change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These interventions have been effective in the short-term, but adherence decreased quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For example, by week 9 of a 12-week intervention, only 53&#x000a0;% of participants reached their activity goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Assessment of behavior maintenance in the absence of further investigator contact is rare in physical activity studies, particularly among breast cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Secondary investigations of intervention trials and review papers have suggested that targeting autonomous motivation may be one of the most promising methods for maintaining activity among survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, current approaches appear to be inadequate for producing sustained increases in physical activity, and little is known about how behaviors change once investigator contact ceases. Increasing autonomous motivation to be active is a promising strategy for improving intervention effectiveness and maintenance thereof. Innovative techniques are needed to target motivation and ensure intervention components motivate women of all races and ethnicities.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>This intervention is predicated on constructs from Self-Determination (SDT) and Narrative Transportation Theories (NTT). SDT proposes a continuum between autonomous and controlled behavioral regulations or motivations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with autonomous motivation being more strongly associated with physical activity over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Autonomous motivation for physical activity includes both completely intrinsic motivation (motivation due to inherent interest and enjoyment) as well as integrated and identified regulation (relatively autonomous forms of extrinsic motivation that involve internalizing external motivations and valuing the outcomes of activity, respectively). Autonomous motivation is increased by the fulfillment of psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Several large-scale autonomy-promoting interventions have demonstrated long-term maintenance of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Narrative transportation, i.e. absorption into a story, can influence both autonomous motivation and beliefs about health behaviors, such as cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Transportation has been associated with media enjoyment and attentional focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which were associated with positive affect and motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Breast cancer survivors who watched a video of other survivors telling their stories, compared to those who watched an informational video, reported feeling more attentive and less upset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Narratives reduced counter-arguing as compared to standard information provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which led to greater attitude change. Narrative transportation may even affect individual perceptions of identity and belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>This study will test a conceptual model that consists of two complementary pathways: one involving narrative, identity, and persuasion, and another involving playfulness and intrinsic motivation. An active video game that includes both narrative and fun elements should impact each of the pathways, which would ultimately lead to adoption of the desired behavior, physical activity. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays the major relationships of interest.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SMARTGOAL conceptual model with relationships of interest</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2016_2244_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Narrative transportation pathway</title><p>The identity and persuasion pathway involves narrative transportation influencing participants&#x02019; beliefs about themselves. We hypothesize that narrative transportation in the game will increase exercise imagery and character identification, leading to changes in identity and values.</p><p>Exercise imagery is typically operationalized by asking individuals to imagine themselves exercising and to feel certain emotions related to exercise. Live-action role playing in a game context by its very nature should produce a substantial amount of imagery, as players are encouraged to actively imagine participating in the game world and events. Imagery scripts typically describe a workout, thoughts and feelings that might occur while exercising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and achieving goals via exercising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Imagery (as a general concept) is also one of the theoretical components of narrative transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Story imagery that involves exercise may function similarly to explicit exercise imagery interventions. Enjoyment and energy-related imagery have been linked to increased positive affect related to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Imagery related to technique and enjoyment were also related to autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Character identification, as defined here, indicates a temporary shift in self-perception during which game players perceive their attributes as similar to those of the character they play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In other words, character identification offers an opportunity to &#x0201c;try on&#x0201d; new characteristics and values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], potentially reducing discrepancy between the current self and the imagined ideal self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Video gaming resulted in strong identification effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], perhaps due to the explicit role-playing and &#x0201c;experience-taking&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] that occurs during video game play, compared to reading or listening to a story. Character identification has been associated with both narrative transportation and behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesize that exercise imagery and character identification will also affect two forms of autonomous motivation: identified regulation and integrated regulation. For example, an individual would exercise because they value its outcomes (identified regulation) and because they value exercise itself (integrated regulation). Also, by experiencing an identity that values fitness and strength while pretending to be a game character, players may come to value fitness and strength.</p><p>The identity and persuasion pathway may be particularly important for minority race/ethnicity women. Culturally appropriate storytelling persuaded ethnic minority women to be screened for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Narratives that included characters similar to the reader/listener enabled character identification and thus persuasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Video games are excellent vehicles for such storytelling because they can provide racially ambiguous and/or customizable characters that are similar to a broad range of players.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intrinsic motivation pathway</title><p>The intrinsic motivation pathway hypothesizes a causal relationship such that playful experience and perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence intrinsic motivation. A playful experience is one that is perceived as emphasizing freedom, focused attention, and safety from real-world consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. All play is in essence practice because it is viewed as having fewer consequences than real-life behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Games encourage experimentation with difficult behaviors by making failures expected on a challenging trajectory towards mastery, framing failure as a state rather than a trait &#x02013; unstable, specific, and within one&#x02019;s capacity to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>Video games are also effective tools for influencing the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, in turn increasing intrinsic motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Greater intrinsic motivation, or the similar concept of enjoyment, has been linked to greater physical activity over time in studies of game-based cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and to greater energy expenditure in laboratory studies of cycling and console active games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Even in a game with a pre-determined narrative, players can feel autonomy by making choices and via representational agency (e.g., feeling powerful because they are role-playing as someone powerful) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Games support competence by providing guided practice opportunities to work towards mastery. Non-player characters in games, much like supporting characters in books, can provide social influence and feelings of belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>This project will test the effectiveness of an intervention that uses narrative and play elements coupled with a standard self-monitoring mobile intervention on physical activity. We hypothesize that the narrative game intervention will produce greater physical activity at the conclusion of the intervention period (6&#x000a0;months) as well as at 1&#x000a0;year (6&#x000a0;months of maintenance) than self-monitoring alone. We will also explore the effects of the intervention on other physiological outcomes (fitness, function, weight) and self-reported outcomes (quality of life, depression, fatigue, anxiety, sleep), hypothesizing that the narrative game intervention will also produce greater positive effects on these and intermediate motivation-related variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Preliminary focus group and pilot intervention data</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Focus groups and interviews</title><p>Prior to carrying out a pilot study, it was necessary to determine basic feasibility of the technologies to be used. Focus groups and interviews with 20 female breast cancer survivors 55 &#x02013; 79&#x000a0;years old were conducted to investigate what kinds of mobile devices and games were considered usable and acceptable in this population. A convenience sample was recruited using newspaper and email list solicitations, and meetings occurred in common meeting locations for breast cancer survivors (e.g., space used for support group meetings). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>When asked about video games, the women reported a lack of general knowledge. However, many of those same women also discussed playing and enjoying games such as <italic>Angry Birds</italic>, <italic>Farmville</italic>, and <italic>Lumosity</italic>, which they did not consider video games. Seven of the women mentioned experience playing active video games using a Nintendo Wii console, and nearly all stated that they were interested in trying active games if someone explained how to play.</p><p>The women were very skeptical of smartphones, but enthusiastic about tablets. They commonly mentioned simplicity as the most important aspect of any technology, and they perceived tablets as simpler than smartphones (perhaps due to comparisons &#x02013; tablets are simple in comparison to computers, whereas smartphones are complicated in comparison to regular phones).</p><p>When asked specifically about their preferences for an active game, the women mentioned greatly enjoying music. However, they worried that the dance games we showed them (<italic>Dance Central</italic> and <italic>Just Dance</italic>) were too difficult or too complicated. There was substantial enthusiasm for games that involved pretending to be in interesting places. When questioned specifically about <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic>, the participants expressed skepticism initially about a zombie-themed game, but enjoyed the idea of a suspenseful story-based game once the specific concept was explained. A &#x0201c;Choose Your Own Adventure&#x0201d; style interactive narrative was also deemed interesting. They liked the idea of scavenger hunt games, but thought they would get bored with a game that only consisted of collecting resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pre-experimental study of narrative-based mobile games</title><p>A 12-week pilot study was conducted to test basic feasibility and acceptability of a narrative-based mobile walking game. Ten adult women (52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13&#x000a0;years old, 31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4 BMI, sedentary and overweight) were recruited from the community using newspaper and online mailing list solicitations. Nine women completed the study, and one dropped out because she became pregnant. Participants were provided with mobile phones with the game <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> (Six to Start, London, UK) pre-installed. They were also provided $55 for downloading music to use while playing the game. (The game will be described in detail in the intervention section below.) At the initial session, participants set goals for weekly walking. Weekly phone calls reviewed goals and briefly addressed other behavior change techniques based in self-regulation, such as self-monitoring, feedback, and problem-solving.</p><p>The major outcomes of this trial involved acceptability and feasibility difficulties due to loaning phones (iPhone 4, Apple, Inc., Cupertino, CA) to participants. Acceptability was measured by self-report questions previously used in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], scores on validated psychological measures, as well as open-ended feedback. Feasibility was operationalized as ability to use various aspects of the technology as intended.</p><p>All 10 participants completed questionnaires related to their feelings on the first <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> mission. Narrative transportation ratings were relatively high (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;47.6, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.77 using a 12-item version of the Narrative Transportation Scale with an 84 maximum possible score; items from this scale are mentioned in the measurement section below), even higher than in our past studies of women playing active video games, sedentary video games, and watching TV (means of 35, 37, and 44, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Intrinsic motivation was rated a mean of 5.1 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2) out of 7, similar to intrinsic motivation ratings of active and sedentary video games and watching TV in the above-mentioned study (5.2 &#x02013; 5.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>Acceptability measures adapted from previous similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] were recorded on 5-point Likert scales from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). None of the participants reported problems with the storyline or being turned off by the scary nature of the game. All participants reported that zombie chases encouraged them to go faster. Other acceptability ratings were lower than expected, although these ratings may be due to frustrations with the phones rather than the content of the mobile application (app). For example, of the nine women who completed the study, only four agreed or strongly agreed that they felt confident using the phone we provided. Six of nine women agreed or strongly agreed that the app was convenient to use and user-friendly.</p><p>Open-ended feedback from participants indicated that several of them disliked having to deal with two different phones, since they had phones of their own. Several participants stated that they preferred the option to use their own devices rather than be forced to use the loaner phone we provided. The game itself appeared to be acceptable, but the mobile device used for its delivery should be changed.</p><p>It was determined that protocol feasibility would also require refinements. Participants were harassed by collection agency and scam phone calls despite our best efforts to block numbers (91 calls across 10 phones), indicating that a device without phone functionality would likely be more usable. Connection of the <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> game to the <italic>Runkeeper</italic> (Fitnesskeeper, Inc., Boston, MA) system for surveillance purposes was found to be feasible. Each participant&#x02019;s <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> account was connected to a matching <italic>Runkeeper</italic> account, which allowed investigators to view logs of the date and length of time of participants&#x02019; walks via <italic>Runkeeper</italic>&#x02019;s online portal. Five participants used only the accelerometer, and four used both the accelerometer and GPS. It appears that an iPod Touch or smartwatch would be adequate to play the game and avoid some of the problems associated with the smartphone device.</p><p>We concluded that the game was likely feasible and appropriate if implemented using several protocol refinements: 1) allowing participants to use their own phones if they wish, 2) providing mobile devices that were not phones, such as an iPod Touch, and 3) ensuring that we provide sufficiently clear and simple technical instruction on use of the mobile devices and game.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>SMARTGOAL (Self-Monitoring Activity: Randomized Trial of Game-Oriented AppLications) is a randomized controlled trial that will compare two different technology-based interventions. Participants will be randomized to either an intervention that enhances standard self-regulatory content with narrative and game elements, or to a standard intervention only providing self-regulatory content. We will recruit 120 breast cancer survivors to participate in the year-long study. Only orientation, initial counseling, and assessment contacts will take place in-person. Exercise will be self-paced and self-directed walking, with motivational assistance from one of two mobile applications (depending upon intervention assignment). All other investigator contact will occur via phone or the app assigned to that intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Recruitment, screening, and randomization</title><p>We will recruit participants in three cohorts of 40 participants each. We anticipate recruiting a convenience sample of participants primarily via mailings based on registries of local older adult volunteers, individuals who have consented to be included in participant registries for aging studies, and lists of breast cancer patients who receive care at affiliated clinics (with consent and a signature from their physicians).

Participants in the trial will each attend four visits: a baseline assessment/orientation, an initial individual counseling/goal-setting meeting, a 6&#x000a0;month assessment, and a 12&#x000a0;month assessment. Visits will occur in University-owned clinical buildings in Galveston or Harris counties. Prior to the baseline assessment, potential participants will be provided with informed consent information in a private room and allowed time to read and ask questions as necessary. Only after signing an informed consent document approved by the Institutional Review Board will participants move on to assessment activities. Regular intervention contacts by phone (weekly for months 1 &#x02013; 3, monthly for months 4 &#x02013; 6) will occur for the first 6&#x000a0;months. The period between 6 and 12&#x000a0;months will be monitored as a maintenance period, to determine whether behaviors are maintained in the absence of further counseling. The schedule of enrollment, intervention, and assessment is shown in the format recommended by the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], which mirrors applicable items from the CONSORT 2010 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

They will also keep the provided intervention tools (mobile device, music, and either game app or monitoring app) as an additional incentive. Participants will receive iPod Touch devices to solve problems related to smartphones. iPods function more like a &#x0201c;Walkman&#x0201d; or miniature tablet than a phone, do not receive phone calls that could harass users, and contain enough space to include both very large game apps and music files. They are thin, easily fitting in a purse, bag, or sport armband. All participants will be instructed to either use their personal Wi-Fi Internet access or to travel to a Wi-Fi hotspot once per week to ensure that we receive information from their apps. In the Galveston and Houston areas, free Wi-Fi hotspots are common in coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and in commercial and tourist areas. Participants wishing to use their own phones (Android or iOS) rather than the iPods will be provided with the iPod, but will also be given credit to either the Google Play or iTunes stores and shown how to download the app to their phone. Due to the iPod&#x02019;s small physical size, large data capacity, and different perceived utility as compared to a phone, we anticipate that the majority of participants will choose to use the iPod. However, this choice should improve acceptability. Participants will be allowed to use their own smart device if they find it more convenient.</p><p>Phone counseling will be conducted by three interventionists, all trained by a doctoral-level behavioral scientist using standardized procedures (including role-play and supervised calls with feedback). The counseling prompts are highly standardized, as discussed below, and extensive notes will be taken in phone logs to ensure quality assessment and treatment fidelity. In addition to the topic-based content for each group, counselors will provide feedback on whether the weekly goal was met, ask and record why if it was not met, and inquire about any possible adverse events during the last week.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention overview</title><p>The two interventions compare the effectiveness of an enhanced intervention to an exemplar of current intervention strategies.

This game was chosen due to its acceptability in pilot testing, unique blending of an involved narrative storyline with game mechanics, and interactive behavioral tools (e.g., self-monitoring, feedback, goal-setting). <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> encourages bouts of 30 &#x02013; 60&#x000a0;minutes of walking, jogging, or running at the player&#x02019;s preferred pace. Minutes of activity will be the primary measure of activity for this app as well, to prevent possible differences in accelerometer accuracy across devices and apps. Players use the mobile device to set up the game, but during exercise the game is audio-only, with the device held or worn on the arm. The game plays user-chosen music and places clips of an audio narrative in between those songs, to provide an illusion of other characters &#x0201c;radioing in&#x0201d; while the player travels by foot in a post-apocalyptic world. While songs are played, the game provides audio cues when players &#x0201c;pick up&#x0201d; virtual supplies or are chased by zombies. Zombie chases (which can be turned off) prompt players to increase their speed by 20&#x000a0;% for one minute in order to out-run their pursuers. Supplies can be used to build a virtual base, which implements resource management gameplay (planning how to use supplies to create the best base) and provides virtual rewards related to story events (e.g., memorials to fallen characters or buildings specific to new characters&#x02019; expertise).

The game clearly reinforces several of Runner 5&#x02019;s character traits &#x02013; heroism, competence, endurance, and loyalty &#x02013; but leaves the characterization otherwise open to interpretation. As discussed briefly in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the game uses the words of other characters to demonstrate their esteem for Runner 5 and to provide encouragement.</p><p>The game includes over 120 missions in the main storyline across four &#x0201c;seasons,&#x0201d; with side missions that provide additional insight into some of the characters. Additional content is planned for future release, so the storyline will be more than long enough to sustain play without repetition over the year-long period. The narrative is written by a professional writer and includes main characters of multiple genders and races.

It has a goal, rules, and conflict. How can we make your experience in this program like a well-played game? We&#x02019;ve set your goals, but what are the rules for reaching them? What conflicts do you think might occur that you&#x02019;ll need to overcome in order to play well and follow your rules?</td></tr><tr><td>Safety</td><td>When you decide to play a game, you create what is called a &#x0201c;magic circle.&#x0201d; The magic circle is what makes the game safe. You carve out a little piece of the world and say &#x0201c;here, I can try even the hardest thing, and if I fail it&#x02019;s not a big deal. I&#x02019;m trying things out in a safe place.&#x0201d; Do you have any &#x0201c;stretch&#x0201d; goals that are a little harder than your current weekly goals that you&#x02019;d like to try out, knowing that it&#x02019;s okay if you don&#x02019;t reach them?</td></tr><tr><td>Identification</td><td>When you experience a story, you get to &#x0201c;try on&#x0201d; the characteristics of your character. You play the role of that person. You get to see what it feels like to be that person. What are your impressions of Runner 5? Do you admire her physical strength and endurance? How do you feel when you play as her? What would it feel like if you were more like her?</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise imagery</td><td>Think about a time when you found exercise really enjoyable and energizing. Imagine what it felt like as vividly as possible. What did you see, and what did you hear? How did you feel physically? How did you feel emotionally? On your next walk, try to keep these feelings in mind as you begin.</td></tr><tr><td>Narrative transportation</td><td>Let&#x02019;s try using imagery while you play the game. The next time you play, try to use all of your senses to really feel like you&#x02019;re experiencing what Runner 5 is experiencing. Create the scene vividly in your mind. What do you see and hear? How does it feel? How do you-as-Runner 5 feel about what is happening?</td></tr><tr><td>Relatedness</td><td>There are a lot of characters you&#x02019;ve met in the game. Who do you think is your favorite character? Why? Real life people aren&#x02019;t the only ones who can give you support and encouragement. How does it feel when Sam and the others praise you? Even though they&#x02019;re pretend, your feelings when interacting with them are real.

An additional subscale related to enjoyment (&#x0201c;When I think about exercise, I imagine myself having fun while exercising&#x0201d;) will be included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The resulting scale has 12 items and responses range from 1 (&#x0201c;Never&#x0201d;) to 9 (&#x0201c;Always&#x0201d;). Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas ranged between 0.79 and 0.93 for the four subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Character identification cannot be accurately compared across groups, as the monitoring app does not include characters. To provide a proxy for character identification, we will use the procedure described by Przybylski and colleagues for investigating discrepancy between the ideal self and self while playing the game/using the app [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Participants will complete the Ten Item Personality Inventory with reference to their ideal self (at baseline), then regarding themselves while using the app (other time points). Correlations between ideal self and game-self for each of the items will be averaged, with neuroticism items reverse-coded, to create a number between &#x02212;1 and 1 that indicates ideal-self and walking-self convergence. This convergence will be considered a proxy measure of the extent to which identification with the player character led to &#x0201c;trying on&#x0201d; of her characteristics.</p><p>The Play Experience Scale is a 16-item scale made up of four subscales: freedom (&#x0201c;I was able to make the game do what I wanted it to&#x0201d;), no extrinsic (&#x0201c;I was not worried about someone judging how I performed in the game&#x0201d;), play-direct (&#x0201c;I would characterize my experience with the game as playing&#x0201d;), and autotelic-focus (&#x0201c;When I was using the game, I was focused on the task at hand&#x0201d;). Responses range from 1 (&#x0201c;Strongly disagree&#x0201d;) to 6 (&#x0201c;Strongly agree&#x0201d;). This is a relatively new scale with few published studies using it, but it has demonstrated reliability (alpha&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;.80) and convergent validity with intrinsic motivation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.79) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>The Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale will measure autonomy (&#x0201c;I feel that the way I exercise is the way I want to&#x0201d;), competence (&#x0201c;I feel that exercise is an activity which I do very well&#x0201d;), and relatedness (&#x0201c;My relationships with the people I exercise with are very friendly&#x0201d;). Responses to this 11-item scale use a 1 &#x02013; 5 Likert scale (&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t agree at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;I completely agree&#x0201d;). Reported alphas for the subscales were 0.75 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. This scale has been used similarly in past studies, for example to investigate the relationship between perceived competence and exercise role identity (partial r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, demographic information will be collected regarding gender, race, and age. Cancer-specific information will also be collected regarding time since diagnosis, type/stage of breast cancer, and type of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Acceptability and process measures</title><p>Acceptability items will be adapted from Vandelanotte and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Items will measure aspects of acceptability for both the device (e.g., &#x0201c;I found the device very cumbersome to use,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I think I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this device&#x0201d;) and the applications (e.g., &#x0201c;I think the app is user-friendly&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;it was convenient for me to use the application&#x0201d;). Process measures for both groups will include logs of completed counseling phone calls, time spent in each call, attrition, and adverse events related to participation. Brief specific questionnaires (including measures of narrative transportation and identification discussed above) will be provided for participants in the narrative group to complete immediately after the first mission and specific highly emotional missions (&#x0201c;A Voice in the Dark&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Alternates&#x0201d;), to determine the acceptability of content. Objective process measures will also be recorded from the two apps. <italic>Zombies, Run!</italic> will send exercise session information to the <italic>Runkeeper</italic> service, where an interventionist account will &#x0201c;friend&#x0201d; the participant&#x02019;s account. Number of walks per week and total minutes per week will be abstracted from the website. Thus, we will be able to investigate both overall lifestyle activity (Actigraph) as well as activity specifically related to the apps.</p><p>During the 12&#x000a0;month visit, we will conduct brief interviews with all participants regarding their opinions on the apps and counseling sessions. These discussions will be audio recorded, transcribed, systematically coded using thematic analysis procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and used to better understand the acceptability of different intervention components.</p><p>Adverse events will be tracked throughout the study via direct inquiry during each counseling call, direct inquiry during assessment visits, and review of information taken from the apps that may indicate dangerous activities (e.g., over-exertion). Call scripts/log sheets will include prompts for counselors to inquire about a list of anticipated adverse events (muscle pain, chest pain, etc.) as well as to ask open-ended questions about any other possible adverse events in the past week. Information on adverse events, whether they are related to the study, their descriptions, any participants who withdraw due to the events, and risk of events in each group will be collected. We will use the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events grading scale (from a score of 1 for mild events to 5 for death related to the event) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The study physician (Dr. Volpi), who will be blinded as to group assignment, will make attributions as to whether events are related to the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data management and analysis</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>This study is powered to detect differences between the two groups in minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity at 6&#x000a0;months. We used SAS 9.4 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC) to calculate sample size based on several studies similar to this one. Similar trials of telephone counseling and activity monitoring among breast cancer survivors produced effect sizes ranging from 0.53 to 0.82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. This study includes an alternative intervention rather than a true control group, so it is likely that the alternative group will show improvements as well. We anticipate that improvements in the other group will be weak at 6&#x000a0;months due to the absence of motivation-related intervention content. We thus have powered for a conservative effect size for physical activity at 6&#x000a0;months of approximately d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65, which would require an N of 78 for 80&#x000a0;% power at an alpha of 0.05. This effect size translates to a between groups difference of approximately 20&#x000a0;minutes per week (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x000a0;minutes). Assuming a correlation between baseline and follow-up physical activity of approximately r&#x02009;=&#x02009;.65 (based on the pre-experimental pilot study), the required N would be even smaller, approximately 50.</p><p>Similar studies that investigated maintenance are few and show disparate results; thus, power was difficult to calculate. For example, Rogers et al. reported large differences in change scores between groups from baseline to the end of maintenance (79 vs. -22&#x000a0;minutes per week; 3&#x000a0;month follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], whereas Vallance et al. reported smaller differences (24 vs. -14&#x000a0;minutes per week; 6&#x000a0;month follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Assuming large standard deviations for these change scores, we plan to recruit a sample of 120. This sample should be sufficient to detect group differences during the intervention and maintenance period even in the case of heavy attrition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Analytic plan</title><p>This study is an evidentiary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], with behavior as the outcome of interest. Thus, the primary endpoint of this study will be behavioral change in minutes of objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity at 6&#x000a0;months. We will use an analysis of covariance to test the difference between groups at 6&#x000a0;months, controlling for baseline. A secondary analysis will use linear mixed modeling to investigate changes in minutes of objectively-measured moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity over time at baseline, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months. All analyses will follow the intent to treat principle and will be conducted after assessing measure reliability, variable distributions, and outlying observations. Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation, and significance will be set at an alpha of 0.05. Effect sizes for the difference between the two groups will be calculated for all models run. Analyses will be performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). Age, race, and time since cancer diagnosis will be included as covariates, and both adjusted and unadjusted results will be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. We will also use Student&#x02019;s t and chi square tests to compare those who complete the study to drop-outs.</p><p>We will follow the same analysis procedures for the health outcomes (fitness, function, weight, quality of life, depression, fatigue, anxiety, and sleep). For the intermediate outcomes, we will conduct exploratory investigations using correlation analyses and the ANCOVA procedures discussed above. Because so little is known about potential effect sizes for variables such as character identification and exercise imagery in these contexts, simple exploratory tests appear most appropriate to inform mediation analyses in future studies. Results of these investigations will be used for refining the conceptual model for eventual testing in a larger trial.</p><p>For the qualitative interviews, we will combine grounded theory with an overall theory-based framework to conduct the thematic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. That is, theory will guide the questions asked and the initial codes used to analyze the transcripts. While coding the transcripts, grounded theory will guide development of additional codes based upon themes that arise from participants&#x02019; words. We have previously used this strategy to investigate specific questions about theoretical constructs as well as discover unexpected reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To improve the health of breast cancer survivors, novel intervention strategies that can increase physical activity and sustain those increases over time are required. This trial will compare the effectiveness of two novel, technology-based interventions, each with the capacity for large-scale improvement of breast cancer survivors&#x02019; health. This comparison builds upon several years&#x02019; worth of formative data, including focus groups and pre-experimental pilot tests.</p><p>By comparing the two interventions, we will test the additive benefit of a focus on narrative and games over and above the benefit of a basic self-monitoring intervention. We hypothesize that a combination of a narrative-based active video game and counseling that reinforces persuasive elements of the game will increase exercise identity, intrinsic motivation, and autonomous forms of extrinsic motivation such as integrated and identified regulation. Identity and autonomous motivation are powerful theoretical constructs that we hope can produce sustained, long-term change in exercise behavior patterns.</p><p>This protocol has several limitations. By using commercial technology, we cannot control changes to the apps over time. Large-scale changes to either app are unlikely, as their core components have not changed over the past three years, and similar apps exist that could be used if necessary. Some participants may not enjoy the zombie theme of the narrative game; in this case, we have made a list of missions that tell stories with little violent or horror content.</p><p>Even in the case of null results, this trial will produce a large amount of illuminating data. Investigators will be able to closely monitor exercise behavior in both groups for as long as participants use the apps. If and when participants stop using the apps is very useful information regarding the life cycle of app use. Little is known about how active game or activity monitor use changes over extended periods of time. Measurement of many potential mediating variables and process measures will help answer not just whether but how and why the interventions are successful.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12885_2016_2244_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: </label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.
