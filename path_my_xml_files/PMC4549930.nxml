At the baseline, patients were evaluated for inclusion or exclusion criteria. This study was approved by medical ethics committee of Isfahan university of medical sciences and Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) and the code is: IRCT201204059256N2.</p><p>We had included adults with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infectious. Diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was based on positivity of a rapid urease test (RUT) or based on histology. In all patients, five biopsies (two antrum, two bodies, and one angulus) specimens were taken for histological assessment and two specimens (one from antrum and one from body) were taken for RUT and histology evaluations. In the cases that RUT was negative, biopsy samples were sent to the pathology laboratory for specific histological test of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Our exclusion criteria were: Previous treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, use of PPI (proton pomp inhibitors) during 2 weeks and/or antibiotics during 4 weeks before the study, peptic ulcer, GERD, gastrointestinal malignancy, previous gastro-oesophageal surgery, severe concomitant cardiovascular, hypertension, respiratory or endocrine diseases, clinically significant renal or hepatic disease, hematological disorders, any other clinically significant medical conditions that could increase risk, history of allergy to any of the drug used in the study, pregnancy or lactation, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, severe neurological or psychiatric disorders, contraindication of consumption of NSAID, and long-term use of corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p>Patients were then randomly assigned to three treatment groups (Simple Randomization Method was used) and follow-up evaluation was done to assess the eradication rate of the infection. A total number of 172 patients were included in final design of the study, who were randomly divided in three groups: (1) 54 patients received the following regime: Traditional quadruple therapy including azithromycin 250 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg, bismuth subcitrate 240 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg, twice a day for 1 week (group A); (2) 56 patients received a regime same as group A regime plus diclofenac-Na, 100 mg daily for 1 week (group B); 62 patients received a regime same as group A, but for 2 weeks (group C) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participants&#x02019; retention versus attrition</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-143-g001"/></fig><p>Patients were enrolled by gastrointestinal specialist at the hospitals after assessment of appropriate indication and ruling out any contraindication to the treatments. Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of the three schedules of treatment to receive the relevant drugs.</p><p>Patients were interviewed at completion of therapy to assess adherence to the therapeutic regimen and adverse events by medical personnel blinded to the eradication regimen of each patient. In particular, first, open-ended questions on side effects and then specific questions on anticipated adverse events were asked. Four weeks after completion of therapy, <italic>H. pylori</italic> status was re-evaluated by stool antigen assay, by personnel unaware of the eradication regimen of each patient to assess whether the infection had been successfully eradicated. Infection was considered eradicated in the patent, if the test was negative.</p><p>Statistical procedure was done by Statistical Program for Social Sciences software (SPSS) version 18.

Participants were divided in to three groups; group A received quadruple regime for 1 week, group B received quadruple regime and diclofenac-Na for 1 week, and third group regime was the same as second group but their treatment duration was 2 weeks. The eradication rate in group A was 66.7%, 82.1% in group B and 82.3% in group C. Our results show a significant difference between groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The cause of better effect of treatment in group B and C proposed that diclofenac decreases of thickness of the mucosal gel layer and so the drugs effect better on <italic>H. pylori</italic> bacteria that get under mucosal layer.</p><p>Some others papers had evaluated the effect of different NSAIDs agents on <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment. Gokturk <italic>et al</italic>. had evaluated the effect of Asprin in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. In their study, 77 participants were Asprin users with dyspepsia symptoms and 79 years of age and sex-matched dyspeptic patients. Their eradication regime was Lansoprazole (30 mg twice a day), Clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day), and Amoxicillin (1 g twice a day) for 14 days. They had reported that in dyspeptic patients who used Asprin eradication ratio was 64/77 (83%) and in other group was 42/79 (53%). There was a significant difference between their findings (P &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our findings in groups which used NSAIDs in addition to our therapeutic regimen was almost the same with Gokturk's report (82.1% in group B and 82.3 in group C vs. 83% in Gokturk's study). Our findings are agreed with Gokturk's results.</p><p>Park <italic>et al</italic>. had reported that adding aspirin to Omeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin regime had increased <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rate (86.7% in patients who used Asprin added to their regime vs. 80.3% in other group). There was no statistical differences between their groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Our eradication rate was lower than their results were significant.</p><p>Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. in 2009 had evaluated the effect of Celecoxib as a selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. They had reported that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication followed by Celecoxib had improved gastric paraneoplastic lesions.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>According to our findings and other reports using NSAIDs could increase the <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication ratio. Mechanisms by that NSAIDs increase eradication in not well recognized but some of them may be: NSAIDs could increase antibiotics endocellular concentrations and inhibiting the virulence factors of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Another factor that could affect the eradication rate is the bacterial load. Moshkowitz <italic>et al</italic>. used triple therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication and they had proved that low bacterial load is associated with a higher eradication rate.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Patients <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It was proved that NSAIDs such as: Sodium salicylate, aspirin, indomethacin and celecoxib have a dose-dependent effect on <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication and it may be because of the effect of NSAIDs on <italic>H. pylori</italic> virolence factors.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Finally we can conclude that NSAIDs such as Diclofenac-Na, Asprin, celecoxib could increase the <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rate. In this study, if we had a larger sample size our findings might be significant. We suggest that further studies should be established to evaluate the effect of NSAIDs on <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication but sample size and treatment duration should to be considered and we also recommend to use RUT for follow ups in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
