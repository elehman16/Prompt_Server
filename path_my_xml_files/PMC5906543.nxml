Over one-third of US adults are afflicted with obesity (35% men and 40% women) and specifically women, not men, had worsening disease severity and progression to class III [body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>] between 2005 and 2014 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). About 18 and 7.9% of children and adolescents have obesity and severe obesity (&#x02265;120% of 95th percentile for BMI; class II and class III obesity) respectively (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). There also has been a rise in obesity in adolescents between the ages of 16&#x02013;19&#x02009;years with 41.5% having obesity and 4.5% meeting criteria for class III obesity (&#x0003e;140% of 95th percentile for BMI); children ages 6&#x02013;11&#x02009;years have had similar increase in obesity prevalence to 37.3% with respective 12.8% meeting criteria for class II and III obesity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In particular, in the US, the epidemic is marked by racial and ethnic disparities: non-Hispanic Black (15.8%) adolescents have the highest prevalence of this disease than non-Hispanic Whites (13.1%), non-Hispanic other race or multi-race (10.9%), and Hispanic (15.2%) adolescents with obesity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A lower percentage of non-Hispanic Blacks (35%) seek weight loss treatments compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts (39%) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); non-Hispanic Blacks are also more likely to avoid care (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26&#x02013;0.90) and less likely to initiate weight loss discussion with their providers than non-Hispanic Whites (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Persistent barriers and disparities to care among racial/ethnic minorities exist likely due to a combinatory effect of social, economic, biological, and environmental factors affecting macro- and micro-environments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) with US medical professionals not adept or trained at addressing the complexity of care and higher attrition rates for medical weight loss visits (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>As a result, it becomes more essential to evaluate novel effective obesity-care delivery models among various populations. In regards to chronic diseases and obesity, shared medical appointments (SMAs) are innovative, patient-receptive, cost-effective methods of clinical practice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) with a family-based approach particularily utilized for pediatric interventions, such as in childhood obesity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). SMAs are a redesign of chronic care models where groups of patients (8&#x02013;20) are seen by a multidisciplinary team in 1&#x02009;h in efforts to improve clinic throughput and efficiency and have shown improved cardiovascular benefit and quality improvement in diabetes management (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These group-based patient visits address the gaps in knowledge, skills, and support necessary to maintain overall health and well-being, while increasing the time allocated to discuss lifestyle modification and healthy behaviors, especially in the context of a busy clinical practice where an individual visits may last only 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;min (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Moreover, in an effort to increase accessibility to care and address disparities, SMAs have been adopted as novel methods to address those needs among healthcare systems (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, to date, SMAs have not been studied in challenging or culturally relevant populations, such as in African-Americans, where attrition rates are typically higher and patients often present with decreased literacy, non-adherence to recommendations, and transportation concerns, along with patient&#x02013;physician weight bias, all of which present remarkable barriers to effective treatment for obesity (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). SMAs may provide burgeoning solutions to more effective care for these populations in the long-term through group engagement, where individuals may identify themselves with others of similar background and through use of family friendly tools to enhance motivational change. Furthermore, previous studies evaluating group medical visits have shown the shift in focus of the provider to that of an adjudicator advocating self-care norms based on medical knowledge in the context of the patient&#x02019;s lived experience and subsequently the patient disseminating these norms to others within the family unit (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Medical group visits may have tangible benefits to bridging challenging social needs, complex chronic diseases, and improving patient&#x02013;provider experiences (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Additionally, SMAs are typically age-specific, targeting either adult or pediatric patients (but not both) with specific disease process or health goals, rather than being an all-inclusive design with common health targets. Thus, we sought to determine feasibility of a unique monthly parent&#x02013;child-based weight loss intervention among African-American families utilizing a novel family centered SMA model at an adult and pediatric weight management center associated with an urban safety net academic hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Shape-up and eat right (SUPER) families was a pilot program to identify the feasibility of a family-based multidisciplinary group program for weight loss at Boston Medical Center (BMC) over a period of 1&#x02009;year to foster healthy eating and exercise patterns for the entire family. The study was a collaboration between two weight management programs at BMC: a pediatric program, the nutrition and fitness for life (NFL) and an adult program, the nutrition and weight management center (NWMC). The primary outcomes were: (1) family attendance rate and (2) satisfaction with the program. Secondary outcomes included (1) change in BMI and (2) change in eating and sedentary behaviors.</p><sec id="S2-1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The study was approved by the BMC/Boston University Medical Campus institution review board. It was supported by the Vela Foundation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: African-American parents &#x02265;18&#x02009;years from the NWMC with either overweight or obesity (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with one or more children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;years with at least overweight status (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;85th percentile for weight and height based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&#x02032;s BMI Percentile Calculator for Child and Teen [<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/">http://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/</uri>]) or if the parent and/or guardian from the NWMC had a child currently being treated at the NFL program or if a child from NFL had a parent with overweight or obesity who may have not been part of NWMC. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) families not currently enrolled in either NFL or NWMC, (2) primary language other than English, (3) inability or not willing to provide informed consent/assent, (4) ethnicity other than African-American, and (5) non-overweight or obesity in adult or child. Informed consent was obtained from parents of children at the time of enrollment and children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;years provided assent. Once consent was obtained, all contact information was updated. The initial contact was made in the respective clinic or telephone based. Demographic information querying zip code, race, ethnicity, level of education, primary source of income, employment status, insurance coverage, health of household members, and number residing in the household were collected. An abridged self-reported physical activity questionnaire modified from PAQ-C and PAQ-A (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was also completed by telephone, assisted by the nurse practitioner, with the purpose of guiding exercise education and physical activity component of the group sessions. The participants were then notified of the first group visit by phone, email, and/or postal mail. The pilot program aimed to enroll at least six families (at least one adult parent/guardian and one child) based on allocated funding from the Vela Foundation. Because families were recruited directly from either NFL or NWMC and this was a feasibility study, there was no randomization. To protect the children participating in this study, children were not separated from the parents. All materials provided to the children were &#x0201c;child-friendly,&#x0201d; while adult materials were written at a fifth grade reading level. All program visits occurred at BMC.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Monthly Group Visits (Visit #1&#x02013;11)</title><p>There were 12 monthly 60&#x02013;90&#x02009;min sessions scheduled over a period of 1&#x02009;year. A nurse practitioner with a Masters in Exercise Science, registered dietitian, and research coordinator were present at each group. A routine medical intake was completed by the nurse practitioner during the initial visit. Attendance was recorded at each visit. During monthly group visits, anthropometric measurements (height/weight) were taken for both adults and children. The Food Stamp Program&#x02019;s Food Behavior Checklist (FBC) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which measures basic dietary behaviors, including frequency of fruit, vegetables, juice and low-fat dairy consumption, food insecurity, shopping, and cooking techniques, was administered at the first and last group session to assess changes in dietary behavior. A second questionnaire, The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) Food Checklist (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which evaluates the way families plan and prepare food and assesses sedentary and screen-time behaviors in children was also administered during the first and last group session. Adult participants were encouraged to use a free pedometer application if they had a smartphone; all families were provided a pedometer. All participants were given a food journal and a log to record their daily steps as well as a physical activity goal-setting worksheet. Degree of satisfaction was assessed using a validated five-point satisfactory Likert scale (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) at the end of each group visit and the end of the program. A mid-point survey was collected at 6&#x02009;months to determine if program adjustments were needed. Families were contacted <italic>via</italic> telephone, email, and postal mail between visits.</p><p>Group visits included topics for nutrition, exercise, and stress management. Sessions began with a 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min of exercise training (body weight/calisthenics) including moderate cardiovascular exercise led by a nurse practitioner trained in exercise science. Physical activity and exercise education were adapted from the guidelines promoted by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the CDC. Workouts included a dynamic warm up and a combination of calisthenics (burpees, alligator walks, kicks, jumps) and body weight exercises (push-ups, lunges, and plank exercises). Participants were monitored by clinical study staff for any exercise-related adverse events and were asked to report during and after exercise if they were experiencing any chest pain, dizziness, leg pain, calf pain, or hip pain. Families were expected to do these exercises on their own as a family for 2&#x02013;3 times per week with written explanations of the workouts provided upon request. Families were also expected to perform moderate-to-vigorous cardiovascular exercise 2&#x02013;3 times weekly to achieve the ACSM/CDC recommended minimal levels of physical activity weekly. Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant/realistic, time-based short-term and long-term goal worksheets were also provided to patients during each visit, along with pictures and description of potential exercises which could be conducted within the home without the need for access to a gym, to help improve dietary intake and physical activity.</p><p>The second part of each session was devoted to nutrition education and counseling led by the dietitian. This included the basics of healthy eating (macronutrient content and calories), options for navigating dietary changes with children, plus optional healthy cooking demonstrations biweekly located at the demonstration kitchen on campus. The nutrition curriculum utilized in this pilot study was adapted from <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://myplate.gov">myplate.gov</uri> &#x0201c;10 Tips Nutrition Education series&#x0201d; and developed by NFL&#x02019;s registered dietitians. Information was adapted and provided in an age appropriate format.</p><p>Attendance was calculated by totaling the number of group visits completed, divided by the number of group visits offered. Satisfaction was measured <italic>via</italic> survey using a 1&#x02013;5 Likert scale (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Weight status was measured by comparing the height and weight from baseline to the end of the program.

The intervention was designed specifically taking disparities to care into account such as level of education (materials designed at fifth grade reading level), occurrence during evening hours to accommodate work/school schedules, and all-inclusive free visits, including accessibility to dietitians and medical providers on-site. A program fee was also not charged to any of the participants. Those who attended were likely quite motivated and thus rated the program as satisfactory. Parents were queried about barriers to attendance and reasons for this low affluence included several socioeconomic concerns; primary stability and sustainability of the family unit barred from attending medical group visits in the SUPER-families. The lack of participation and overall completion rate of this program reinforces current research noting and addressing significant barriers to care and health disparities among African-Americans (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>In our study, the SMA model was within a traditional clinical academic urban hospital setting, rather than outsourced or integrated within a community or neighborhood. Barriers predominately at the socioeconomic and community level precluded attendance at the sessions and suggest that group-based interventions such as SUPER-families will likely be more successful in a community-based neighborhood setting with closer proximity and improved accessibility to care adopting the SMA model. However, probably more important than placement of these SMAs in community-based locations, is community engagement to determine strategies that might work in enhancing attendance. Though barriers to attendance were queried, parents were not queried on strategies to help overcome low attrition and attendance rates, which should be included in future reiterations of this intervention. Furthermore, though the urban inner-city academic hospital where the study took place serves a diverse racial/ethnic minority underserved population, efforts to engage the community in recruitment of community-based participatory research needs attention. A previous study from this institution has cited challenges in recruitment for pediatric obesity trials even with financial incentives (out of 179 eligible, only 4 attended the visits) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Recently, the Communication, Awareness, Relationships, and Empowerment (C.A.R.E.) model to engage at-risk African-American population in the Washington, DC area cultivated not only a visible presence at community events, but also through partnerships with churches, health organization, academic institutions, and governmental agencies, was able to successfully recruit and retain the study participants (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Other strategies have included establishment of a community advisory board for at-risk populations in the metro area, which was able to conduct focus groups and pilot web-based and wearable technology through members representing churches in a cardiovascular health and needs assessment study (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Community-based interventions have been shown to promote weight loss or positively influence diet and physical activity behavior in a culturally congruent manner, such as in churches or school-based programs, among African-Americans (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). For example, recently churches have been recognized as powerful outreaches for health services and interventions in an effort to address disparities among lower income, African-Americans families given the pastors&#x02019; view on holistic health with integrated faith, such as their perspectives on obesity and infant mortality (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Scalable, community-based weight loss programs with combination interventions, such as portable kiosks for assessments, email/text supports, and online-health coaches utilized in the Weigh and Win study of 40,038 adults, which combine outreach, effectiveness, and costs may help reduce disparities among African-Americans (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Other studies have shown some benefit with incorporation of other resources such as tailored, interactive text-messages to enhance weight loss success among African-Americans with obesity (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The use of a community-based participatory research approach to recruit African-Americans into pilot interventions and innovative health promotion programs has demonstrated success and feasibility along with scalability of the intervention as it applies to minority at-risk populations (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus, though this current pilot SUPER-families SMA model was not successful in a hospital-based setting due to attrition and retention, programmatic elements could be better applied using the C.A.R.E. model for community engagement.</p><p>Though not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that the pilot study suggested an improvement of an average BMI change of &#x02212;2.6&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the children post-intervention. The study possibly suggests that this type of parent&#x02013;child group-based intervention may potentially have long-term benefits for younger children with obesity. The education provided during the intervention did improve healthy living behaviors for all participants involved without determining overall effects on weight. Children may perhaps be more receptive to an intensive group-based education and weight loss intervention when paired with a parent/and or guardian. Moreover, the intervention improved sedentary time and decreased screen time behaviors for the children involved in the study. Of important consideration is that the rate of severe obesity has significantly increased in pre-school age children 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;years, since the 2013&#x02013;2014 cycles (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Because childhood obesity correlates closely with adolescent and adult obesity leading to worsening disease severity when older (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and because children have a natural affinity toward their mothers, this SMA pilot intervention utilizing the mother&#x02013;child relationship has a potential prospective of being adopted in pregnancy with a focus on prevention, rather than treatment. Early nutrition and growth in the initial years of life are important determinants of later body weight and metabolic health (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Therefore, future SUPER-family models may consider preventive strategies targeting either pregnant African-American women or younger children ages 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;years, rather than 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;years old.</p><p>Furthermore, the pilot study, though a small number of enrolled participants, suggests an improvement in overall basic education around nutrition, eating, and sedentary behaviors with increased likelihood of implementation of these positively learned behaviors in the future, especially with regards to reducing salt intake and decreasing screen (video/computer) time. Reported screen time &#x0003e;3&#x02009;h independent of physical activity has been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and high BMIs in children (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Also noteworthy that these two behaviors (reduced salt intake and screen time) were simple, inexpensive, and could be implemented without difficulty and without much disruption to regular household duties, reinforcing that obesity interventions most likely need to be simplified in this specific population. Additionally, cost of food was of highest concern for the SUPER mothers though they preferred healthier foods. Recent studies have highlighted higher costs of healthier foods (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which could potentially be a challenging factor adversely affecting nutrition among African-American families. Research around understanding alternative healthier, affordable food patterns in this population to alleviate disparities to nutrition is recommended. Interestingly, differences in consumption of sugary beverages pre- and post-intervention in the study were not statistically significant though participants reported an average consumption of 2.4 drinks per day. A decrease in soda consumption could have led to cost savings, and the possibility of participant underreporting pre-intervention should be considered. Recent efforts discouraging sodas consumption from a public policy standpoint and overall public awareness (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) may have resulted in participant stigmata when answering the question relevant to beverage consumption. Because high fructose corn syrup found in sugary beverages has been well known to correlate with higher childhood adiposity and detrimental effects on metabolism (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), more emphasis on avoidance of sugary beverages may be needed in future SUPER-families studies including clarifying the families&#x02019; perception and understanding of these beverages given the negative statistical significance on the questionnaires compared to the food journal and written feedbacks.</p><p>Last, the study has several limitations. First, because the primary objective of the study was to estimate rate of participation, drop-out, or compliance, with a pre-determined number of minority families (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) recruited based on funding allocated, data has limited interpretation due to small sample size, high attrition, and low retention rates, and cannot be generalizable to a whole population. A robust sample size is likely needed to determine overall effects of the study on primary and secondary outcomes. In addition, self-reported data on food journals, logs, and written feedback likely contain potential bias due to exaggeration and attribution. The families enrolled were already seeking treatment for weight loss prior to enrollment into the study and preselected without randomization. Thus any failure to lose weight may have been attributed to their perceived barriers to success and positive nutrition or physical activity behaviors exaggerated. Also, the study emphasized maternal&#x02013;child pair, rather than father&#x02013;child, or coparent&#x02013;child relationship though fathers, grandparents, and/or legal guardians of the children were also invited to be part of the study. The latter relationships may yield different results. All adults in the study were mothers through self-selection and motherhood may reflect a greater role in child healthcare among this population. Though the study was done in African-Americans, the study cannot be generalized to other racial and/or ethnic minorities. Future improvements could also tailor culturally relevant exercises, rather than body weight and calisthenics conducted in the study.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although the study demonstrated an overall benefit in children more than adults in this particular population and was deemed satisfactory by enrollees, a family-based SMA intervention for weight loss in African-American families does not address barriers precluding high attrition rates for monthly nutrition and exercise visits, and would be more successful if applied in a field-based community setting. Despite acknowledging satisfaction and barriers half-way through the program, changes made were not enough to overcome barriers to care experienced by African-Americans in urban communities. Future research is needed to develop novel ways to deliver knowledge on nutrition and exercise, valued by families within a group program such as the one designed in this pilot study. New programs may include community-based locations, home visits, and web-based interventions to disseminate nutrition and physical activity education and tools in an effort to eliminate barriers to care and improve health outcomes as they relate to overweight and obesity within the African-American community. Moreover, because community engagement perpetuates scalability of the intervention, future re-design of the intervention might consider community-based advisory boards and partnerships for participant recruitment and retention.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and the relevant policies of the Human Research Protection Program, BMC, and Boston University with written informed consent from all adult subjects.
