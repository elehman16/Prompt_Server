Care home residents are especially vulnerable, with an estimated 30%&#x02013;42% at risk. There is no internationally agreed protocol for the nutritional treatment of malnutrition in the care home setting. Widely used techniques include food-based intervention and/or the use of prescribed oral nutritional supplements, but a trial comparing the efficacy of interventions is necessary. In order to define outcomes and optimise the design for an adequately powered, low risk of bias cluster randomised controlled trial, a feasibility trial with 6-month intervention is being run, to assess protocol procedures, recruitment and retention rates, consent processes and resident and staff acceptability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Trial recruitment began in September 2013 and concluded in December 2013. Six privately run care homes in Solihull, England, were selected to establish feasibility within different care home types. Residents with or at risk of malnutrition with no existing dietetic intervention in place were considered for receipt of the allocated intervention. Randomisation took place at the care home level, using a computer-generated random number list to allocate each home to either a dietetic intervention arm (food-based or prescribed supplements) or the standard care arm, continued for 6&#x000a0;months. Dietetic intervention aimed to increase daily calorie intake by 600&#x000a0;kcal and protein by 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;g.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary outcomes will be trial feasibility and acceptability of trial design and allocated interventions. A range of outcome assessments and data collection tools will be evaluated for feasibility, including change in nutrient intake, anthropometric parameters and patient-centric measures, such as quality of life and self-perceived appetite.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The complexities inherent in care home research has resulted in the under representation of this population in research trials. The results of this feasibility trial will be used to inform the development and design of a future cluster randomised controlled trial to compare food-based intervention with prescribed oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in the treatment of malnutrition within the care home population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN38047922">ISRCTN38047922</ext-link>

Commonly described as both a cause and a consequence of adverse outcomes, PEM predisposes individuals to disease and delays in recovery from illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In UK, more than three million people are either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition and in 2007, the associated health and social care costs were estimated to exceed &#x000a3;13 billion annually, more than 10% of the public expenditure on health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Care homes, which provide residential accommodation, together with nursing or personal care are arguably home to one of our most vulnerable populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], 30%&#x02013;42% of whom are believed to be at risk of PEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and most of whom have multiple physical and mental health and social care needs. PEM has significant negative impacts on the physical and emotional well-being of care home residents and has been linked to increased vulnerability to infection and pressure ulcers, clinical complications, depression, anxiety and a decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Evidence for nutritional strategies to address malnutrition in the care home setting is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Widely used dietetic techniques to enhance oral dietary intakes include food-based intervention (recipe enrichment or fortification to increase energy and/or protein density, flavour enhancement, provision of nourishing snacks and/or fortified drinks) and/or the use of prescribed oral nutritional supplements (ONS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], considered to be &#x02018;dietary foods for special medical purposes&#x02019; (FSMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) and The National Prescribing Centre (NPC) advocate improving nutritional intake first using enrichment of conventional food and secondly by prescribed means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, few trials have evaluated the food-based approach and it remains unclear whether this intervention is able to improve clinical and functional outcomes for malnourished individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The use of nutrition support interventions for the treatment of malnutrition has received growing attention within the literature, with the majority of studies using prescribed ONS as the main nutritional intervention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Existing systematic reviews of malnutrition interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have tended to focus on the effectiveness of ONS intervention compared with placebo or usual care, predominantly within the acute setting. Reviews of the efficacy of ONS in the treatment of malnutrition have demonstrated improved nutritional status when compared to usual care, but the current level of evidence suggests that the length of intervention of the reviewed studies is often too short to be able to detect differences in morbidity, functional status and quality of life.</p><p>A Cochrane review and meta-analysis conducted in 2007 and updated in 2011 aimed to address the impact of food-based intervention and dietary advice on PEM, compared with usual care or ONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The evidence from the review suggests that dietary advice and intervention with or without ONS for the treatment of malnutrition may improve weight and indicators of muscle mass. However, whilst most included trials provided information on the duration of the intervention, there was almost no information on the nature, intensity and content of the food-based interventions. The review also highlighted a complete lack of evidence for the effects of food-based intervention on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) such as quality of life (QoL), which may be an important determinant of intervention effectiveness.</p><p>No systematic review to date has made any specific conclusions regarding nutritional interventions for the treatment of malnutrition in the elderly care home setting. There is a tendency to avoid research in care homes, because of the challenges and methodological issues involved in conducting research in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Many research studies specifically exclude care home residents on the basis that their inclusion would present the research team with ethical and practical difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Studies, which have been conducted in the care home setting often, include dementia and immobility within the exclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], despite these being well-established risk factors for malnutrition. As a result, knowledge on the actual effectiveness of nutritional intervention in this vulnerable population is limited and the clinical applicability of findings to those care home residents most at risk of malnutrition is often questionable. With an ageing population set to increase in the coming years, care homes will play an increasingly vital role in supporting and caring for older people. The lack of evidence to support the best practice has led to recommendations for more studies to be conducted in the care home setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and provides an opportunity to bring new ideas to the field.</p><p>To enable the efficacy of food-based interventions to be compared with ONS intervention within a care home population, an adequately powered RCT is required, using interventions that are equivalent in energy and protein composition, alongside a comparative routine care arm. The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] explicitly recommends that complex interventions should be investigated using preliminary studies, prior to evaluation in a RCT, in order to optimise the trial design, to define the outcomes and to ensure feasibility. Given the expected complexities of care home research, a feasibility trial for a multi-centre cluster RCT was proposed, to explore trial design, staff, and resident acceptability and to provide data to estimate the parameters required to design a definitive RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This protocol has been reported in reference to the CONSORT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research ethics approval</title><p>To meet the requirements of the Research Governance framework, approval for the trial was required from the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and the Research and Development (R&#x00026;D) Department of the NHS Trust for sponsoring the research. This protocol was submitted to the West Midlands NHS Local Research Ethics Committee for proportionate ethical review and obtained approval prior to commencement (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>The REC requested for randomisation and intervention allocation to take place at the level of the care home. The committee determined that participation in the collection of participant-reported outcome measures (PROM&#x02019;s) within the feasibility trial would not be of benefit to the wider population of adults that lack capacity, and their inclusion in PROMs could not be justified in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The protocol was also submitted to the Research and Development Department of the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust for Research governance approval.

A sequential, explanatory mixed method design was proposed, beginning with a quantitative method to assess trial feasibility (phase 1), followed by a qualitative method, involving detailed exploration with a few individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (phase 2).</p><p>A cluster trial design has been chosen primarily to avoid contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], because the assigned care staff receiving additional training and support cannot be expected to treat individual residents differently, but it is also being used for practical reasons. The aim of the trial is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering and evaluating nutritional interventions for malnutrition in the care home setting, and hence the home is the unit of randomisation.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 1</title><p>Recruitment for phase 1 of the trial began in September 2013 and concluded in December 2013. The quantitative phase follows a controlled experimental design, collecting data on changes in anthropometric markers and nutrient intake along with the use of quantitative questionnaires. The trial needed to be open label due to the nature of the nutritional interventions under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 2</title><p>Recruitment for phase 1 of the trial began in July 2014 and is expected to conclude in October 2014. Following phase 1, the quantitative findings will be further explored with a sample of residents and care home staff, using semistructured interview and focus group techniques. The qualitative findings will be used to complement, explore and explain the quantitative data collection and will ensure that resident and staff perspectives are used to inform the future trial design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Setting and population</title><p>The feasibility trial is being conducted within the borough of Solihull, West Midlands, in England. Prior to trial commencement, 17 care homes in Solihull, providing accommodation for older people, were receiving regular dietetic input, to improve the identification and first-line nutritional management of malnutrition. Six privately owned care homes were invited to take part in the trial. The care homes were purposively sampled to obtain a diverse sample based on ownership, size and type of care provided (nursing and/or residential), to enable the evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the trial design and methodologies across a range of long-term care settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Phase 1</title><p>Eligible residents within each of the participating care homes were identified using routine malnutrition screening, a review of care home medical records and consultation with care staff (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two assigned care home staff (nurses or senior carers) within each care home site conducted nutritional screening using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] to identify those with or at risk of malnutrition. &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; classifies risk as low, medium or high on consideration of current body mass index (BMI), history of unintentional weight loss (%) and acute illness effect. Monthly screening of all residents by nursing or senior care staff was already a standard practice within the selected care homes. &#x02018;MUST&#x02019; has been validated for use in adults, has very good to excellent inter-observer reliability in care homes (kappa values of 0.8&#x02013;1.0) and has been found to be acceptable to both participants and healthcare workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Whilst some areas may advocate dietetic assessment for patients scoring high risk, it is now more common for dietetic services to recommend that care homes implement first-line advice and possibly a trial with sip feeds prior to considering dietetic referral. This trial has been designed to reflect usual practice within these care homes, therefore dietetic assessment was not conducted following identification using &#x02018;MUST&#x02019;. The care home staff were provided with a screening log, with a checklist of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (below). The staff reviewed the care records of those residents identified as medium or high risk of malnutrition, against the eligibility criteria, consulting with the Solihull Nutrition support dietetic service and the care home GP, as required. Each eligible resident was assigned a unique trial number, and the GP for each participating care home site was informed in writing of the involvement of the care home in the study (with the care home consent to do so) (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

</p><p>It was anticipated that the population of residents identified with or at risk of malnutrition in each care home would include individuals lacking the capacity to consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In accordance with the requirements of the approving REC, residents that lacked capacity were excluded from taking part in PROMs. The decision to exclude non-native English speaking residents with capacity from participation in the collection of PROM&#x02019;s was based on existing knowledge and experience of the population group and a consideration of the finances available to run the feasibility trial. The primary researcher works clinically as a dietitian within the Solihull borough and estimated that less than 5% of the resident and staff population are non-native English speaking. This feasibility trial is being conducted as a student Master&#x02019;s project. Due to limited resources, interpreter services could not be engaged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Individual consent for PROM&#x02019;s</title><p>Written consent was sought on an individual basis from those residents that have been assessed by trained care home staff or the care home GP as having capacity. Each resident was provided with a participant information sheet and was given 1&#x000a0;week to read, ask further questions and decide whether they would like to provide information on quality of life, health state and dietary satisfaction through questionnaires and self-reported scales. Each resident was then asked to sign a consent form.</p><p>As the screening and consent process took place prior to cluster randomisation, the residents, care home staff and the researcher were all blinded to the allocated intervention. This ensured that decisions regarding eligibility and consent were not influenced by the nutritional intervention allocated to the care home site.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Phase 2</title><p>Following data collection of PROMs for phase 1, those residents that were indicated on the consent form that they would like to be considered for individual interviews will form the sampling frame for potential inclusion within the qualitative phase. A non-random method of purposive sampling involving care home staff discussions and consideration of the PROMs data will be used to identify two to three potential participants per care home for individual semistructured interviews with the primary researcher.</p><p>A focus group of six to eight staff will be identified within each care home site that has management approval for staff participation. Care home staff will be selected on the basis that they have participated in the trial and will therefore have something to say. Separate information sheets and consent forms for residents and staff have been developed for the qualitative phase and will be presented to eligible residents and staff prior to their inclusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interventions</title><p>Assigned care home staff within each care home received dietitian-led training to support delivery of the 6-month allocated intervention and/or a refresher on current standard care.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Food-based intervention</title><p>The content of the food-based intervention was based on the developed resources and guidelines of the Solihull Nutrition Support Project, the PrescQIPP Nutrition Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the Malnutrition pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which was developed and agreed by a multi-professional consensus panel. Assigned care staff within the care homes randomised to food-based intervention received face-to-face instruction by the primary researcher to increase participating resident&#x02019;s daily nutritional intake by 600&#x000a0;kcal and 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;g protein, using agreed interventions, alongside the standard care home nutritional intervention for malnutrition. Food-based interventions included the provision of homemade enriched drinks between meals and/or the provision of between-meal fortified snacks. The intervention combination agreed by the primary researcher and the care home staff was documented for each resident, at baseline and at 3&#x000a0;months. The intervention recipes and a breakdown of the calorie and protein content were provided to the care home staff and catering teams.</p><p>The primary researcher continued to make dietetic visits to the care homes on a monthly basis and determined compliance with the intervention at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.

</p><p>No other risks were anticipated, and therefore it was considered reasonable to collect only targeted dietary intervention-related AEs and only serious adverse events (SAEs) requiring hospital admissions that were due to avoidable malnutrition or dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events</title><p>The care home staff were required to inform the primary researcher if any AEs/SAEs relating to a resident&#x02019;s malnutrition and/or its treatment were identified, through the completion and faxing of an adverse event form. The incidence and frequency of AEs were recorded at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of intervention duration. Death from any cause was reported by care home staff on an AE form and faxed to the primary researcher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Joint trial steering committee (TSC)/data monitoring committee (DMC)</title><p>The joint TSC/DMC includes the dietitian researcher, Chief Investigator of the trial and three independent members. The independent members include an independent statistician, a dietitian not involved in the trial and a member of a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) panel care. The TSC/DMC meets every 3&#x000a0;months to undertake safety monitoring.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Research governance</title><p>The conduct of the trial is in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidance for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and the Department of Health&#x02019;s Research Governance Framework (RGF).</p><sec id="Sec43"><title>Confidentiality of personal data</title><p>No personal information is being collected within this trial, with the exception of resident name and signature, for those residents that consent to take part in PROMs and individual interviews. This information is being collected on paper consent forms and is securely stored at the HEFT Nutrition Support Service office base, within locked cabinets. Residents are asked to consent to this. The trial data is entered onto a secure computer database. Only the primary researcher has access to this database. All information collected is treated as strictly confidential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Long-term storage of data</title><p>In line with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, all essential documentation and data will be retained for at least 5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Strengths and limitations of this trial</title><p>A clear strength of this trial is that it aims to include care home residents with cognitive or mobility impairment, to allow for the evaluation of feasibility and acceptability with this unique and complex population, frequently at risk of malnutrition. To address the lack of good quality evidence for all reported outcomes within the care home setting, the trial proposes the evaluation of feasibility of a wide range of outcome parameters, including participant-centric outcome measures. Piloting allows for outcome assessments that are found to be infeasible or unsatisfactory to be modified in the definitive trial design. This trial provides an opportunity to develop and refine consistent practices and to improve data integrity. Refinement of documentation, recruitment and consent processes and data collection tools and methods will be informed by the outcomes of this trial, enabling for the future trial to be designed and conducted with accuracy and precision.</p><p>A limitation of this trial is that it is only being conducted within six care home sites in the Solihull area, limiting generalisability to other care home sites across the UK, where dietetic input may not be as regular or intensive. Due to the nature of the nutritional interventions under investigation, it has not been possible to blind the care home residents or staff to the allocated interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This protocol has defined the aims and objectives of a feasibility trial and has provided a detailed description of the interventions, the study design and the methods of data collection. For the definitive trial, the protocol will be revised to incorporate the suggestions provided by care providers. The future trial will aim to consider and compare a number of outcomes, including nutrient intake, anthropometric parameters, patient-reported outcomes and the cost effectiveness of the interventions. It is anticipated that the results of the definitive trial will inform decisions by dietitians, general practitioners, care home providers and commissioners, regarding the appropriate use of nutritional treatment for malnutrition in care homes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Authors&#x02019; information</title><p>Contributor RS is an MRes student at the University of Birmingham and a senior nutrition support dietitian at the Heart of England NHS Foundation trust.
