There has been a large increase in the number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery for FAI; however, a recent Cochrane review highlighted that there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatment effectiveness. We aim to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery versus best conservative care for patients with FAI syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We will conduct a multicentre, pragmatic, assessor-blinded, two parallel arm, RCT comparing arthroscopic surgery to physiotherapy-led best conservative care. 24 hospitals treating NHS patients will recruit 344 patients over a 26-month recruitment period. Symptomatic adults with radiographic signs of FAI morphology who are considered suitable for arthroscopic surgery by their surgeon will be eligible. Patients will be excluded if they have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis, previous significant hip pathology or previous shape changing surgery. Participants will be allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to receive arthroscopic surgery or conservative care. Recruitment will be monitored and supported by qualitative intervention to optimise informed consent and recruitment. The primary outcome will be pain and function assessed by the international hip outcome tool 33 (iHOT-33) measured 1-year following randomisation. Secondary outcomes include general health (short form 12), quality of life (EQ5D-5L) and patient satisfaction. The primary analysis will compare change in pain and function (iHOT-33) at 12&#x02005;months between the treatment groups, on an intention-to-treat basis, presented as the mean difference between the trial groups with 95% CIs.

Since first described in 2003, there has been increasing recognition of the syndrome of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), which seems to account for a proportion of the previously undiagnosed cases of hip pain in young adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Subtle deformities of hip shape combine to cause premature contact between the femoral neck and the acetabular rim which may result in hip pain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These shape abnormalities typically divide into three categories:<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cam-type, in which the femoral head is oval rather than round, or there is bony prominence on the femoral neck;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pincer-type, in which the rim of the acetabulum is excessively prominent, in one or more areas of its circumference;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mixed-type hip impingement, a combination of cam and pincer types.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Surgery can be performed to reshape the bony contour of the proximal femur and/or acetabular rim in order to prevent impingement. Surgery for FAI has evolved more quickly than our understanding of the epidemiology or natural history of the condition,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and is becoming an established treatment for FAI.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The risks of complications from open surgery are greater than those for arthroscopic surgery and current evidence suggests that the outcomes of arthroscopic treatment for the symptoms of FAI are comparable to open surgery.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Consequently, hip arthroscopy for FAI is a rapidly growing new cost pressure for health providers.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, a recently published Cochrane review highlighted the absence of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FAI surgery with conservative care such as physiotherapist-led exercise.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Physiotherapy has also been shown to be beneficial in patients with FAI syndrome.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the randomisation programme will not release the randomisation code until the patient has been recruited into the trial. In order to improve baseline balance between intervention group samples, a minimisation (adaptive stratified sampling) algorithm will be implemented using study site and impingement type (cam, pincer or mixed) factors.

Arthroscopic hip surgery will be performed under general anaesthesia according to the surgeon's usual practice. Shape abnormalities and consequent labral and cartilage pathology will be treated. Bony resection at the acetabular rim and at the head&#x02013;neck junction will be assessed by intraoperative image intensifier radiographs and/or satisfactory impingement-free range of movement of the hip. Patients will be allowed home when they can walk safely with crutches (usually within 24&#x02005;hours). On discharge, patients will be referred for a course of rehabilitation as per usual care for that surgeon. We will not specify a protocol for this postoperative physiotherapy, but will record the surgeons' routine postop care and any case-by-case changes to this. Care will be taken to ensure that physiotherapists delivering postoperative care to FASHIoN trial participants are different from those trained and providing PHT in order to avoid contamination between groups. Patients will also have a postoperative MRI after 6&#x02005;weeks.</p><p>In order to ensure the fidelity of the surgery and to identify participants for a secondary analysis, a panel of international experts will review operation notes, intraoperative images and postoperative MRI scans to assess whether adequate surgery was undertaken.

In situations where the patient needs additional review, support or guidance, further sessions with the physiotherapist are permitted up to a maximum of 10 contacts. Evidence of exercise individualisation, supervision and progression will be sought from individual participant physiotherapy case report forms (CRFs). Accuracy of CRFs will be audited against the physiotherapist's treatment notes.</p><p>The PHT CRFs will be assessed for intervention fidelity to identify participants for a secondary analysis by the panel that developed the protocol for PHT, including: Professor NEF (Senior Academic Research Physiotherapist), Ivor Hughes and David Robinson (UK; Extended Scope Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists) and PW (Academic Orthopaedic Surgeon).</p><p>Crossover of participants between interventions can be problematic in trials of this nature. In order to minimise, this care will be taken prior to enrolment in the trial to ensure potential participants:

The short-term risks of this study relate to the two interventions. These risks are described below and inform the expected serious adverse events (SAEs).</p><p>Hip arthroscopy requires a general anaesthetic. The risk of complications from hip arthroscopy is about 1&#x02013;2%. These include:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Infection&#x02014;thought to be &#x0003c;1 in 1000.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bleeding&#x02014;possibly causing bruising or a local haematoma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Traction-related&#x02014;in order to perform hip arthroscopy, traction is required to separate the hip joint surfaces. Sometimes after the procedure, the pressure from the traction can cause some numbness in the leg. The numbness usually resolves within a few hours or days.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Osteonecrosis&#x02014;during surgery, the blood supply to the hip joint could be damaged. However, there are no reported cases of osteonecrosis following arthroscopic FAI surgery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Femoral neck fractures&#x02014;this is also a very rare complication. This complication would require a further procedure to fix the fracture.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Personalised hip therapy</title><p>There are some small risks with pain medications and joint injection. However, the main risk is muscle soreness and transient increases in pain from the exercises that will be undertaken.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Baseline data will be collected from participants once consent is obtained and prior to randomisation.

We also propose a 5 and 10-year no-cost ascertainment of hip replacement by linkage to the UK National Joint Registry (NJR) and Hospital Episode Statistic (HES) databases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The development work for iHOT-33 reported a mean iHOT-33 score of 66 and an SD of 19.3 in a heterogeneous population with a variety of hip pathologies. The baseline iHOT-33 data from our pilot trial (HTA grant 10/41/02) suggests the target population of patients being considered for hip arthroscopy for FAI have lower scores with less variability, with a mean of 33 and SD of 16. The MCID for iHOT-33 in this population is 6.1 points.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Our sample size calculation is therefore based on an SD of 16 and a between-group MCID of 6.1: a standardised effect difference between groups at 12&#x02005;months of 0.38. The expected sample size for 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.38 at 12&#x02005;months, at a 5% significance level, assuming an approximately normal distribution of the iHOT-33 score is 292. Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up at 12&#x02005;months, we will recruit a sample of 344 participants over 26months in the UK (172 in each group).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will be of differences in hip-related quality of life (iHOT-33) at 12&#x02005;months between the two treatment groups, blinded, on an intention-to-treat basis and presented as the mean difference between the trial groups with a 95% CI. iHOT-33 data will be assumed to be normally distributed; possibly after appropriate variance-stabilising transformation.</p><p>The minimisation randomisation procedure should ensure treatment group balance across recruiting sites. We have no reason to expect that clustering effects will be important for this study, but the possibility of such effects will be explored as part of the analysis.<sup>33</sup> We plan to account for clustering by generalising a conventional linear (fixed-effects) regression approach to a mixed-effects modelling approach; where patients are naturally grouped by recruiting sites (random-effects) and, if amenable to analysis, also by physiotherapist and surgeon. This model will formally incorporate terms that allow for possible heterogeneity in responses for patients due to the recruiting centre, in addition to the fixed effects of the treatment groups, and patient characteristics that may prove to be important moderators of treatment effect such as age, gender and FAI type. This analysis will be conducted using specialist mixed-effects modelling functions available in the software packages Stata (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, Texas, USA: StataCorp LP) and R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). All tests will be two-sided and considered to provide evidence for a statistically significant difference if p values are &#x0003c;0.05 (5% significance level).</p><p>Secondary analyses will be performed using the above strategy for other approximately normally distributed outcome measures, including iHOT-33 at 6&#x02005;months, SF-12 (and computed subscales) and EQ5D. Differences in dichotomous outcome variables such as AEs, complications related to the trial interventions and the need for further procedures will compared between groups using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests (or Fisher's exact test) and mixed-effects logistic regression analysis will be undertaken, adjusting for the stratifying variables, with differences between trial intervention groups quantified as ORs (and 95% CIs). The temporal patterns of any AEs will be presented graphically and if appropriate, a time-to-event analysis (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) will be used to assess the overall risk and risk within individual classes of AEs. Ordinal scores for patient satisfaction will be compared between intervention groups using proportional odds logistic regression analysis, assuming that the estimated intervention effect between any pair of categories is equivalent.</p><p>Our inferences will be drawn from the intention-to-treat analysis. We will perform two exploratory secondary analyses. One will compare patients who received surgery and those who received conservative care. A second exploratory analysis will compare patients randomised to surgery or PHT and received treatment deemed to be of a high fidelity by the respective review panels. We plan to perform a subgroup analysis by FAI type because it is possible that treatment effect is moderated by type. We anticipate that adequate steps have been taken to prevent crossovers from being a major issue for this study. Therefore, we expect the main intention-to-treat analysis to provide definitive results. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor crossovers and adherence to treatment and advise on appropriate modifications to the statistical analysis plan as the full trial progresses.</p><p>The initial feasibility and pilot studies (HTA 10/41/02) were designed explicitly to assess feasibility and measure recruitment rates, and not to estimate treatment effectiveness.
