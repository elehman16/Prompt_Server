Among the lot, few microbiota eventually can adhere to the host forming dental plaque leading to the induction of infectious diseases such as gingivitis and periodontal disease.

Along with mechanical mode of plaque control, chemical plaque control too has gained popularity due to its unique characteristics.</p><p>In the field of dentistry, the most popularly rewarded chemical means of maintaining a good oral hygiene has been gained by chlorhexidine. It is considered the gold standard due to its diverse properties.

The subjects recruited were compliant and met the follow-up visits after a single setting of nonsurgical periodontal therapy. A clinically significant reduction was seen in experimental (curcumin) group and control (chlorhexidine) group as compared to placebo in moderate-to-severe gingivitis.</p><p>Curcumin has plethora of activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant agent. The lipophilic nature of the molecule allows rapid permeability of cell membrane. The PI in the Group A and Group C was comparable from Group C. The reduction in the plaque level at 28<sup>th</sup> day follow-up period could be attributed to bactericidal property of the herbal product. The curcumin mimics various events that happen during apoptosis process by causing change in the function and structure of cell membrane.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The GI score and sulcus bleeding index score of both curcumin and chlorhexidine showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline to 14 and 28 days. This result of the experimental mouthwash group could be best explained by its anti-inflammatory property, which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent NF-B activation, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The curcumin is also known to be immune modulating agents which downregulates the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory enzyme. Downregulation of various inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon, and some other chemokines are also carried by the circumin.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Considering the anti-inflammatory effect of turmeric and chlorhexidine mouthwash, the results of the present study were consistent with the results of Waghmare <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Van der Weijden <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Grundemann <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Leyes, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The progression of disease progression was markedly reduced by the activity of curcumin as pro-oxidant and antioxidant by scavenging the free radical, a reducing agent and a DNA damage inhibitor.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The curcumin inhibits ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A study done by Mali <italic>et al</italic>. evaluating turmeric mouthwash with chlorhexidine showed a considerable decrease in plaque and gingival score which was further emphasized with the use of microbiological testing showing a reduction in supragingival microbial load.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Muglikar <italic>et al</italic>. in 2013 evaluated 30 subjects for 21 days and observed that circumin mouthwash was comparable to chlorhexidine mouth wash as a potent anti-inflammatory agent.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The curcumin mouthwash was biocompatible to oral tissues and was acceptable in taste. Observation from the present study from subjective criteria stated that bitter taste was experienced by few subjects using curcumin mouthwash but was not statistically significant when compared to the gold standard chlorhexidine mouthwash. No side effects were reported by the subjects in using the three mouthwash during the study. Group C showed a mild stain formation on the lingual surface of mandibular anterior segment by few of the subjects.</p><p>Although multiple pharmacological effects of curcumin have showed a wide variety of activities, it has been found to be quite safe in both animals and humans. Fewer research with different concentrations of circumin has been evaluated for short-term and long-term Toxicity. The doses evaluated were at 50, 250, 480, 1300 for periods of 13 weeks or 2 years in rats and mice where side effects such as increase in liver weight, discoloration of face and when received at a dose of 2600 mg/kg showed mucosal epithelium hyperplasia in the cecum and colon of animals but were considered as relative toxicity.</p><p>However, considering the recent outlook, the Food and Drug Administration has declared curcumin as &#x0201c;generally safe.&#x0201d;</p><p>Standardizing the dose of curcumin and the formulation is known to have a wide array of usage in the field of periodontology and can be compared to the gold standard chemical plaque control due to its diverse property as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Thus, the results obtained from the present clinical trial, proves the antiplaque and antigingivitis efficacy of curcumin mouthwash.
