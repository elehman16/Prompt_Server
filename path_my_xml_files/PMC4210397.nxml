(CCE) for patients after medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. [Subjects
and Methods] Forty patients after MPFL reconstruction were randomly divided into an OCE
group and a CCE group. All the patients were evaluated at four different time points.
[Results] The mean change of thigh circumference decrease in the CCE group was lower than
that in the OCE group at both the 3rd and 6th month after surgery. The Lysholm score of
the CCE group was higher than that of the OCE group at both the 3rd and 6th month. At the
3rd month after surgery, the visual analog scale score of the CCE group was lower than
that of the OCE group. [Conclusion] CCE is better than OCE for both short and long term
outcomes of patients after MPFL reconstruction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction</kwd><kwd>Open-chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Closed-chain exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patella dislocation is a common orthopedic disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Anatomical research has
demonstrated that the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the major medial soft-tissue
restraint preventing lateral displacement of the distal knee-extensor mechanism, and
provides approximately half of the total restraint force<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, it has been
reported that patella dislocation is accompanied with MPFL injury or tear in most
patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. MPFL reconstruction is an effective surgical treatment for patella
dislocation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the clinical
effect depends not only on the surgical operation, but is also closely associated with
appropriate rehabilitation intervention after surgery.</p><p>There are two types of knee rehabilitation exercise, open chain and closed chain exercises.
The straight leg raise is the typical open-chain exercise while the half-squat is a
well-known type of closed-chain exercise. Two kinds of rehabilitation exercises are used
widely in clinical practice<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The clinical application of open chain and closed chain for

However, there has been no standard rehabilitation procedure for MPFL reconstruction, and no
study has compared the clinical effect of open chain and closed chain exercises on patients
after MPFL reconstruction. This study prospectively compared the clinical effect of open
chain and closed chain exercises in order to provide clinical evidence for selecting the
proper rehabilitation procedure after MPFL reconstruction surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty inpatients were recruited from the Department of Joint Surgery at our hospital from
March 26 of 2008 to June 30 of 2009. They were randomly divided into 2 groups: the open
chain exercise (OCE) group (12 males, 8 females; mean age 29.8&#x000b1;12.6&#x02005;years) and the closed
chain exercise (CCE) group (11 males, 9 females; mean age 28.6&#x000b1;14.3years). All the
procedures were approved by the Academic Ethics Committee of Hebei Medical University.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: unilateral knee with recurrent patella dislocation,
and a normal contralateral knee; patella dislocation without knee ligament and collateral
ligament injury; patellar instability following the initial dislocation persisting for
more than three months.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: previous knee injury or surgery; arthroscopic
meniscus repair or total meniscectomy; osteonecrosis with cartilage damage greater than
grade II (Outerbridge classification); patella alta (Insall-Salvati index greater than
1.2); Q angle greater than 20&#x000b0;; trochlear angle greater than 150&#x000b0;, with patellar dysplasia
grade IV and V (Wiberg classification); tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TTTG) distance
greater than 15&#x02005;mm; concomitant knee cruciate ligament or collateral ligament injury.</p><p>All surgery procedures were performed by the same senior surgeon, and were described in
our previous study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
semitendinosus tendon was harvested for ACL reconstruction by a closed-end tendon
stripper. The &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; shaped graft was made with an interlacing suture on the femoral and
patellar ends. The femoral attachment of the MPFL was positioned in the saddle between the
adductor tubercle and the medial epicondyle, and the patellar attachment point was on the
medial third section of the proximal patellar margin.</p><sec><title>The 1st rehabilitation stage (1st day to 3rd day after surgery)</title><p>All patients wore braces for fixation of the knee, and they started to do isometric
quadriceps training in order to prevent muscle atrophy and increase muscle strength. In
addition, ankle pump exercise was encouraged to promote blood circulation, reduce
swelling, and prevent deep vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>The 2nd rehabilitation stage (3rd day to 6th week after surgery)</title><p>In the open chain exercise group, straight leg raise exercise was done by every
patient. The patients lay on a bed, slowly lifted the involved lower limb with the knee
extended until 45&#x000b0; hip flexion, held that position for 5 seconds, then lowered the leg
and rested for 3&#x02013;4 seconds. This was a complete exercise movement. From the 3rd day
after surgery, the patient did this exercise 5 times, twice daily. Five more times were
added every 2 days. By the end of the 6th week after surgery, the subjects were
performing 100 straight leg raises twice a day.</p><p>In the closed chain exercise group, a half-squat exercise was done by every patient.
The patients stood on their lower limbs and held the bed rails with their hands. The
patients were ordered to flex the extended knee 15&#x02013;20&#x000b0;, and hold this position for 3&#x02013;4
seconds, then full extended the knees and rest in the standing position for 3&#x02013;4 seconds.
This was a complete exercise movement. From the 3rd day after surgery, the patients did
this exercise 5 times, twice daily. Five more times were added every 2 days. By the end
of the 6th week after surgery, the subjects were performing 100 half-squats, twice a
day.</p><p>At the 4th week after surgery, all the patients could flex the extended knee 90&#x000b0;. They
began to try to walk on two legs with equal load gradually.</p></sec><sec><title>The 3rd rehabilitation stage (6th week to 12th week after surgery)</title><p>In this period, all the patients continued to do their exercises 100 times, twice a
day, as described above, until the 12th week after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>The 4th rehabilitation stage</title><p>From 12 weeks after surgery, the main task was to improve the whole function of knee to
enable the performance of sports. Specific items included isotonic and isokinetic knee
extension exercises, progressive resistance training within a tolerable range, and the
combination of short distance accelerative running and long distance slow running, as
described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The rehabilitation scheme for the patients 12 weeks after surgery</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Period</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise program </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13&#x02013;16 weeks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">jogging, backward run, deep squat by the involved leg</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17&#x02013;24 weeks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">quadriceps femoris resistance exercise and isokinetic

The visual analog
scale was used to measure the pain level during rest. A universal goniometer was used to
measure the joint range of motion. A tape measure was used to measure the thigh
circumference at 5&#x02005;cm above the patella superior border, and the one leg hop distance.
The Lysholm score was used to evaluate knee function. The patients were evaluated
barefoot. For the single leg hop test, the distance was normalized by the height of the
patients.</p><p>In order to reduce measurement error, the measurements were repeated 3 times and the
average value was used in the analysis. The data were analyzed using two-way analysis of
variance, and the time (before and after) and the group (OCE, CCE) were assumed to be
factors. If a significant interaction between groups was found, oneway ANOVA and the
t-test were used for each group or between groups. Analyses were performed using SPSS
16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The data are presented as Mean &#x000b1; SD. The
level of significance was chosen as 5% for all analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All patients were followed for one year. In the follow-up period, there was no report of

dislocation patients is mainly dependent on the rehabilitation exercise after the operation.
However, there is no standard rehabilitation procedures for after surgery. Therefore, it is
important to select appropriate rehabilitation procedures for such patients.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that long term joint immobilization might result in
dehydration of the extracellular matrix and the loss of ground substance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is not always possible to move joints immediately after surgical
operations, but early motion is clearly beneficial for the patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, early motion seems to be helpful for the
limb as a whole, as it alleviates pain, promotes healthy development of cartilage and
periarticular tissues, and prevents scar formation and capsular contractions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a word, rehabilitation exercises after
surgery are necessary for patients.</p><p>In this study, we used the two types of exercise for the rehabilitation process after
medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction to determine which was more suitable as a
post-operation exercise item. The single leg hop test was used to measure the maximal
explosive strength of the patients. The result of the single leg hop test for the CCE group
was better than that for the OCE group at both 6 and 12 months after surgery, indicating
that the closed chain exercise is better than the open chain exercise after MPFL
reconstruction at improving the maximal explosive strength of patients, especially the long
term outcome.</p><p>The mean change of thigh circumference decrease in the CCE group was lower than that in the
OCE group at both 3 and 6 months after surgery, indicating that closed chain exercise is
better than open chain exercise at alleviating muscle atrophy in the early and middle stages
after surgery. The Lysholm score of the CCE group was higher than that of the OCE group at
both 3 and 6 months after surgery, indicating that the closed chain exercise is better than
the open chain exercise at improving knee function after surgery. At 3 months after surgery,
the visual analog scale score of the CCE group was lower than that of the OCE group,
indicating that the closed chain exercise is better than open chain exercise at reducing
pain in the early stage after surgery.</p><p>In open chain exercises, the exerciser moves the end of the upper or lower limb freely in
space without contact. Closed chain exercises, the exerciser moves the adjacent joints with
lower limb in contact with an immobile surface<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study reported that closed chain exercises might
provide more sensory feedback than open chain exercises, which is beneficial for motor
control<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Open chain exercise and closed chain exercises are commonly used in prospective treatments
for many musculoskeletal system diseases, especially in patellofemoral joint dysfunction,
including lateral patellar compression syndrome<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, patellar chondromalacia<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and patellofemoral pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study indicated that both open and closed chain
exercises improved the subjective and clinical outcomes of patients with patellofemoral
pain, and that the closed chain exercise was a little more effective than the open chain
exercise in functional results according to the tested parameters<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although, open chain exercise was beneficial for the
development of strength and endurance of the knee extensor mechanism following anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction, and could be used effectively in a rehabilitation
program<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, closed kinetic chain
exercise seems to be more effective at improving dynamic balance ability than open kinetic
chain exercise within a six-week training period<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the results of electromyographic analysis, one-legged squats and step-ups are
effective for muscle rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. In
addition, closed chain activities might avoid the risk of anterior cruciate ligament graft
injury in the rehabilitation process, and closed chain exercises, exercises cost less to
implement than open chain exercises with expensive equipment; therefore, the clinical
application of closed chain exercise is more convenient<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study also indicate that closed chain exercise is better than open
chain exercise for both short and long term outcomes, reducing patellofemoral pain,
alleviating muscle atrophy and improving knee function.</p><p>Furthermore, several studies of rehabilitation methods after ACL reconstruction have
indicated that electrical stimulation was effective at reducing postoperative abnormalities
of gait and strength compared to voluntary contractions alone<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study also reported that electrical stimulation in
combination with voluntary exercises was superior to voluntary exercises alone at improving
normal gait and strength<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in
future studies, we will study whether electrical stimulation is beneficial for the
rehabilitation of patients after MPFL reconstruction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The present study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.
