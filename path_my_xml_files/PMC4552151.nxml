New cost-effective approaches that stimulate meaningful long-term changes in physical activity are required, especially within primary care settings. It is becoming clear that there are various dimensions to physical activity with independent health benefits. Advances in technology mean that it is now possible to generate multidimensional physical activity &#x02018;profiles&#x02019; that provide a more complete representation of physical activity and offer a variety of options that can be tailored to the individual. Mi-PACT is a randomised controlled trial designed to examine whether personalised multidimensional physical activity feedback and self-monitoring alongside trainer-supportive sessions increases physical activity and improves health outcomes in at-risk men and women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We aim to recruit 216 patients from within primary care aged 40 to 70&#x000a0;years and at medium or high risk of cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes mellitus. Adopting an unequal allocation ratio (intervention: control) of 2:1, participants will be randomised to one of two groups, usual care or the intervention. The control group will receive usual care from their general practitioner (GP) and standardised messages about physical activity for health. The intervention group will receive physical activity monitors and access to a web-based platform for a 3-month period to enable self-monitoring and the provision of personalised feedback regarding the multidimensional nature of physical activity. In addition, this technology-enabled feedback will be discussed with participants on 5 occasions during supportive one-to-one coaching sessions across the 3-month intervention. The primary outcome measure is physical activity, which will be directly assessed using activity monitors for a 7-day period at baseline, post intervention and at 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary measures (at these time-points) include weight loss, fat mass, and markers of metabolic control, motivation and well-being.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results from this study will provide insight into the effects of integrated physical activity profiling and self-monitoring combined with in-person support on physical activity and health outcomes in patients at risk of future chronic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN18008011">ISRCTN18008011</ext-link> Trial registration date: 31 July 2013</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Sedentary behaviour</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd><kwd>Feedback</kwd><kwd>Self-monitoring</kwd><kwd>Behaviour change</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Health promotion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Physical inactivity has substantial effects on global health and an increase in activity at the population level would have considerable impact on the future burden of chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health recently began a national programme (NHS Health Check) that aims to reduce chronic disease by identifying adults who are at increased risk and offering them personalised advice and support to lower their risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Physical activity has the potential to increase the success of such initiatives, but existing interventions in primary care have met with limited success and typically small improvements are not maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. New cost-effective approaches that stimulate meaningful long-term changes in physical activity are required and this is especially important in those identified as at risk of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.</p><p>To date, physical activity has typically been captured and recommended in unidimensional terms (e.g. 150&#x000a0;minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Physical activity is a much more heterogeneous behaviour than this approach implies, with various dimensions known to have clear biological and health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Indeed, past work shows that it is quite possible for an individual to score highly in one dimension of physical activity but low in another, while only very few people score consistently across all physical activity metrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This observation is a problem because people who focus on a single physical activity descriptor may form incomplete or inaccurate conclusions about the appropriateness of their behaviour. For example, many forms of structured physical activity have only a modest impact on overall energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Weight loss is critical to some health outcomes, or an outcome in itself, and it will be important for individuals aiming to lose weight (or prevent weight regain after substantial loss) to understand which aspects of physical activity have the largest thermogenic effect. In this specific scenario, a multidimensional approach will help people incorporate novel activity within the context of their existing behaviour such that the net effect on total energy expenditure is maximised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clearly, a multidimensional profile will provide greater insight, awareness, and deeper understanding than the reliance on more unidimensional feedback; enabling people to take greater responsibility for managing their physical activity.</p><p>In addition to providing a more accurate reflection of physical activity, the diverse options associated with a multidimensional physical activity profile create an exploitable social marketing opportunity. The marketing of structured and informational feedback and the provision of personally relevant and attainable physical activity options is potentially a key step in supporting an individual&#x02019;s satisfaction of autonomy and competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. When people experience a sense of self-endorsed and choicefully enacted behaviour this tends to improve the quality of their motivation and sustain engagement in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indeed, the provision of more comprehensive and revealing feedback on behaviour should also raise awareness and support the formation of implementation intentions (i.e. where, when and how to act); increasing goal attainment and habit formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>New technologies, which include wearable devices and web-based applications, enable self-monitoring of physical activity and create opportunities for the provision of personalised feedback regarding the multidimensional nature of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This type of individually tailored feedback tends to be more effective than generic messages about physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, feedback and self-monitoring in combination with specific goal setting are acknowledged as key constituents of successful behavioural interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In order to exploit the opportunities for physical activity monitoring and multidimensional physical activity profiling, we developed a website-based application for linking physical activity data with informational feedback; creating an interface for self-monitoring, specific planning and trainer interaction, that collectively forms the basis for the present trial. This was informed by prior work, in which we generated visualisations for the presentation of integrated physical activity profiles and demonstrated that patients at medium or high risk of chronic disease found this feedback to be informative, understandable and motivating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, while patients reported feeling confident in using technology and feedback for self-monitoring physical activity, it was identified that supplementary in-person guidance may further support behaviour change.</p><p>The Multidimensional individualised Physical ACTivity (Mi-PACT) study is a randomised controlled trial with the following objectives: (1) to examine whether personalised multidimensional physical activity feedback and self-monitoring using a web-based platform alongside in-person advice supports an increase in physical activity in men and women at risk of future chronic disease; and (2) to examine whether this change is sufficient to generate meaningful weight loss and/or improved metabolic control and reduced risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>In Mi-PACT, patients at risk of cardiovascular disease or type II diabetes mellitus are randomly assigned to receive usual care (control group) or technology-enabled multidimensional physical activity feedback (intervention group).

We aim to recruit at least five general practices with variety in terms of socioeconomic status according to National General Practice Profiles and the English Indices of Deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We will recruit potentially eligible participants via two routes. Firstly, individuals in medium or high-risk groups (based on existing risk-score information in patient notes) will be identified by searching practice databases. Secondly, because not all people will have risk information in their records, individuals at potentially increased risk will be identified (people with a body mass index (BMI)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in combination with a total cholesterol level between 5.5 and 7.5&#x000a0;mmol/L and/or blood pressure&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;140/90&#x000a0;mmHg). This is consistent with Health Check criteria, and clinical data from baseline assessments will be used to verify that individuals are in medium or high-risk groups, using QRISK&#x000ae;2 and QDiabetes&#x000ae; algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Potentially eligible participants will then be approached by a letter from their general practitioner (GP). The recruitment letter will emphasise that participation is entirely voluntary and that individuals will be free to withdraw at any time without any impact on their health care provision. A study information sheet and sample consent form will be included with the letter so that patients have time to consider their participation. The invitation letter will include a free post reply slip for the patient to return to the research team indicating whether or not they wish to learn more about the study. Individuals who return positive replies will then be contacted by the research team. Those not wishing to participate will not be contacted again.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant screening and baseline assessment</title><p>A research nurse will first conduct a telephone screen to re-confirm eligibility. In addition, information regarding marital status, ethnicity, smoking status, profession and education will be recorded. All potentially eligible participants interested in taking part will be invited to attend a 60-minute baseline assessment clinic following an overnight fast. At baseline clinics, the research nurse will further explain the nature of the study and answer any questions. Individuals who agree to participate following the briefing will be provided with an informed consent form, indicating their full understanding of the study and their protected rights for confidentiality and withdrawal from the study without giving a reason. For those providing written informed consent, concomitant medications and relevant clinical history will be recorded and a questionnaire pack will be issued for completion within clinic. Thereafter, the nurse or researcher will measure each individual&#x02019;s blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference and take a blood sample. During the clinic, individuals will receive an activity monitor with oral and written instruction for use and will be provided with a freepost envelope for returning monitors to the research team. For those participants who choose to opt-in, a visit to the University of Bath will be arranged for the assessment of body composition via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Blood results will be shared with each patient&#x02019;s GP. Patients with a fasting blood glucose of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l at this stage will be excluded from further participation as this will likely initiate further testing by the GP and is indicative of probable diabetes mellitus. People successfully completing activity monitoring who are not highly physically active and are in medium-risk or high-risk groups (confirmed via recalculated risk scores using baseline measurements and the results of blood tests) will be eligible for randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation/allocation</title><p>Eligible people will be randomised to one of two groups. We opt for an unequal allocation ratio (intervention: control) of 2:1, primarily to increase our experience with and amount of information on the new intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] (the small loss of precision with unequal allocation only increases the total <italic>N</italic> required by 20). Participants will be allocated remotely by the trial statistician by concealed minimisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], providing balance across the trial arms for sex (male/female), age group (40&#x02013;59 and 60&#x02013;70 years), general practice, risk (medium/high) and PAL&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.75 or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.75. Although individual patients are the unit of randomisation, we believe that the threat of contamination within a practice is largely theoretical, especially given that the intervention is personalised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Follow-up assessment</title><p>Follow-up data collection will take place post-intervention at 3 and 12&#x000a0;months and will include the same measurements completed during baseline assessment. Participants who opt-in for the assessment of their body composition at baseline will be offered repeat dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans at follow-up clinics. Participants will receive a &#x000a3;50 voucher for completing all assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Usual care (control)</title><p>Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual care by their GP.

Hence, the trial will assess effectiveness over-and-above existing &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; alternatives. In order to standardise exposure to healthcare professionals and content, this group will attend a 20-minute meeting with a lifestyle coach at their GP practice following their baseline assessment (i.e. week 0). At this session, participants will receive standardised information (including printed materials and links to Internet-based resources) regarding cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus, the potential benefits of physical activity on reducing &#x02018;risk&#x02019;, current physical activity guidelines and ideas about getting more physically active. Standardised information and messages will be consistent with other print and Internet-based resources available in 2014 (for example, Department of Health: Change4Life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], NHS Choices: Live Well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) and include reference to local opportunities where applicable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention: overview</title><p>Mi-PACT is a complex intervention or &#x02018;treatment package&#x02019; involving multiple components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

This is where a multidimensional physical activity profile creates a clear social marketing opportunity.

In promoting the formation of new habits, implementation intentions are specific plans regarding where, when, and how to act, and have been found to increase goal attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and predict participation in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A multidimensional profile that supports the formation of implementation intentions as feedback is more revealing and plans may be considered within the context of an individual&#x02019;s existing behaviour.

Participants will attend their GP practice for 5 consultations with a lifestyle coach: at baseline, and after approximately 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks. Each participant will have access to activity monitors and the web-based platform for the duration of the 3-month intervention. Training materials for lifestyle coaches as well as hand-outs provided to study participants are available on request [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>In the first session, participants will initially receive the same standardised messages as in the control group. The primary aim of this session is to explain the multidimensional nature of physical activity, to provide an understanding of which personalised behaviours have contributed to each dimension and to explain the options and choices that are available. A further objective is to familiarise the participant to activity self-monitoring and using the web-based platform. For this purpose, each participant will be given a Mi-PACT platform user manual and quick-start guide along with an activity monitor and Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable (for docking to their computer). Participants will have access to a personalised website account (protected by a log-in and password) and accompanying software for uploading their physical activity data. Prior to their next session, participants will be encouraged to experiment and engage in new and enjoyable activities (i.e. &#x02018;trying different things&#x02019;) while self-monitoring and exploring the functionality of the platform.</p><p>Subsequent sessions will be approximately 20&#x02013;30 minutes in duration. Prior to meetings, coaches will be encouraged to log-in to the platform and review participants&#x02019; profiles as a preparatory exercise to help inform session delivery. Once it is established that the participant is confidently self-monitoring and reviewing their data, the aim of the second session is to revisit the participants&#x02019; physical activity profile and to discuss aspects of their physical activity behaviour that they would consider changing. Here, there will be a particular emphasis on identifying opportunities for achievable but sufficiently meaningful modification and specific goal setting regarding what, where and how to act. Participants who have low activity in every dimension have the most &#x02018;choice&#x02019; and will be guided through a menu of physical activity options. Participants who score well in one or more dimensions will be supported in adding to their existing behaviour knowing that what they are doing is recognised. In terms of the tone of advice provided, coaches will attempt to use neutral language and encourage choice (e.g. using terms such as &#x02018;you may choose to&#x02019; or &#x02018;how would you&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;you should&#x02019; or &#x02018;you must&#x02019;) and show empathy (e.g. &#x02018;I appreciate why you might find this difficult&#x02019;).

This process will be led by the participant and will inevitably be highly individualised. At the final session, participants will be encouraged to consider their progress by using the multidimensional profile to reflect on what has been achieved and to develop a future action plan towards long-term change.</p><p>Participants will be urged to make the most of the web-based platform by wearing their physical activity monitor as much as possible (day and night) and to regularly upload their data and review their informational feedback over the 3-month intervention period. As the server has two portals, one for the participant and one for the research team, technical issues (e.g. with uploading data) can be identified and resolved by the research team. For participants without access to a computer or the Internet, coaches will facilitate the upload of data to the platform within session and the individual&#x02019;s profile will be made available to them as a colour print-out where applicable. Participants with limited or no access to the platform outside of sessions will be provided with a diary for recording what aspects of their physical activity they have consciously changed between sessions (i.e. for self-monitoring purposes).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Training of the lifestyle coaches: intervention and control</title><p>We will recruit 4&#x02013;6 intervention providers from the local community (including healthcare providers and other appropriate settings) with experience and qualifications as physical activity or lifestyle advisors. Intervention providers will be added to the GP&#x02019;s office for the intervention period and may include registered healthcare professionals (e.g. dieticians) and/or non-registered professionals (e.g. health trainers). This mix of personnel is included in order to make the study as pragmatic and generalisable as possible to routine healthcare practice. To ensure delivery is compliant to treatment protocol, we will implement a number of strategies to maximise and monitor trial fidelity. Lifestyle coaches will participant in 2&#x000a0;days of training, including: (i) understanding the multidimensional nature of physical activity, (ii) familiarising with the web-based platform and self-monitoring technology, (iii) using the integrated physical activity profile for setting specific goals and forming implementation intentions, and (iv) provision of information in an autonomy-supportive manner (facilitating the participant&#x02019;s satisfaction of autonomy and competence inherent within multidimensional profiling). All coaches will be given a written manual to support delivery of the intervention and will have the opportunity to practice and receive feedback on delivery style and content. The manual includes reference to general information on facilitating behaviour change adapted from the Department for Health NHS Health Trainer Handbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

We will use the underlying raw data for minute-by-minute physical activity energy expenditure to extract multiple physical activity characteristics and determine the change in a given (multiple) dimension(s) of physical activity behaviour. Specifically, this includes: overall energy expenditure (expressed as PAL); time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accumulated on a minute-by-minute basis and in bouts of at least 10&#x000a0;minutes; time engaged in vigorous intensity activity accumulated in bouts of at least 10&#x000a0;minutes; and, non-sedentary time. To explore if the change in physical activity is meaningful, we will include secondary measures of weight, height, waist circumference, fat mass, lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides), glucose control (insulin and glucose) and C-reactive protein. In addition, processes of change (e.g. need satisfaction and markers of internalisation), habit strength, motivation (autonomous and controlled), and indices of well-being, health status and quality of life will all be assessed. Together with physical activity data, these measures will allow us to examine whether changes in specific dimensions of physical activity are more or less important for specific outcomes (e.g. PAL, time&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 METs). Based on previous research, small groups of 12&#x02013;20 people in each physical activity category would be sufficient to determine whether a change in a particular aspect of physical activity was important for these secondary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Anthropometry, blood pressure and body composition</title><p>Participants will be requested to remove any footwear and to wear only light clothing for anthropometric measurements. Body mass will be measured on a calibrated electronic or balance scale to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg, where participants will be asked to stand in the centre of the platform with their weight evenly distributed on both feet. Height will be measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm. Participants will be requested to hang their arms freely with their heels, gluteal area and shoulders in contact with the stadiometer and with their head in the Frankfort plane (orbitale and tragion are horizontally aligned). The participant inspires for measurement, and the recorder brings down the headboard to compress the hair. From these collective measurements, BMI will be determined (kg.m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). To assess waist circumference, participants will be asked to remove or lift their top to allow access to the measurement site. Otherwise, the measurement will be taken over the thinnest layer of clothing. With the participant standing with their feet together and weight evenly distributed, waist circumference will be assessed by positioning an anthropometric tape midway between the uppermost border of the iliac crest and the lower border of the costal margin, with the tape placed around the abdomen at the level of the midway point. Following a deep inhalation and a gentle expiration, the measurement is taken at the end of the expiration, with the tape snug but not compressing the skin. Three consecutive measurements will be made to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;mm. Blood pressure will be assessed using a stethoscope or automated monitor after at least a 5-minute period of seated rest.

In the past, we have deliberately avoided telling people that their physical activity is being observed (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) but, inevitably, this is not an option in the present study because the intervention group will become necessarily more aware of their physical activity and could potentially change their behaviour during specific outcome assessment periods (e.g. for social desirability). One approach to overcome this threat and to avoid any short-term changes in behaviour associated with physical activity outcome assessment is to extend the perceived assessment window. In order to achieve this, we will employ the use of a sham physical activity monitor worn on the wrist in the 1-month prior to follow-up measurements (in both groups). In most cases we will employ a genuine sham (i.e. an empty shell) but at least 5&#x000a0;% of sham monitors will be real working units (MotionWatch 8, Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK).

For this purpose, our specific outcome is mean physical activity energy expenditure (expressed as PAL). In middle-aged men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the standard deviation for PAL was 0.18 (we have no reason to suspect a substantially different variability in women). Our targeted effect size is a difference between intervention and control arms in the 12-month change in PAL from baseline to follow-up of 0.07. Based on our previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], an increase in PAL of that magnitude would result in an increase of 10&#x000a0;% in the proportion meeting the minimum physical activity recommendation of a PAL of 1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], which we define as the smallest worthwhile effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

The assumed correlation between baseline and follow-up (the 12-month reliability) is a conservative estimate, as we are aware of no long-term reliability data using the best objective measures.

In particular, the marketing of informational feedback and set of physical activity options is potentially a key step in supporting increased engagement and sustained lifestyle modifications.</p><p>With technological innovation, the capture and provision of multidimensional physical activity &#x02018;profiles&#x02019; is increasingly accurate, precise and scalable. In the present trial, we will examine whether multidimensional physical activity feedback from wearable physical activity monitors and self-monitoring using an online platform can be successfully incorporated into existing healthcare provision; and whether this leads to a meaningful change in physical activity in patients at risk of chronic disease. We envisage direct potential application within the context of public health initiatives (e.g. NHS Health Check). In addition, multidimensional physical activity profiling could become an adjunct to other public health strategies in primary practice (e.g. weight loss or cardiac rehabilitation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrolment into the study started on 13 May 2014.
