Patients randomized to the early parenteral nutrition arm of the clinical trial received a mean of 3.1 days (95% CI 2.4 days to 4.0 days) more parenteral nutrition than standard care patients. There were no differences between randomized groups with regards to any other measures of resource consumption or health states (hospital stay, infection rates, antibiotic use, etc) or any suggestions of harm attributable to the use of early parenteral nutrition.

Starting rates and daily rate increases were defined by two study PN delivery protocols (A and B), with Protocol B specifically designed for patients clinically suspected to be malnourished, who are known to be at risk of refeeding syndrome. Protocol B was the default protocol for patients with very low body mass index (&#x0003c;17 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Both PN delivery protocols reminded clinicians to provide vitamins, minerals, and trace elements daily, as clinically indicated. Protocol B made strong recommendations for the daily provision of vitamins, minerals, and trace elements to malnourished patients, who are known to be at risk of refeeding syndrome. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ceor-5-369">Table S2</xref> for complete details regarding the study PN delivery protocols.</p><p>The study parenteral nutrition was a shelf-stable product that did not contain vitamins or trace elements at time of delivery to the study hospital, so it did not require refrigeration for storage. Delivery of the study parenteral nutrition to hospitals participating in the Early PN Trial was received by the nutrition department or study ICU and the product was stored in the ICU&#x02019;s storeroom until use. Pharmacy storage and handling were not required.</p><p>Guided by a detailed study protocol, the administration and delivery of the study parenteral nutrition did not require review or supervision by a parenteral nutrition team, nor were any additional biochemical tests required beyond those routinely conducted on a daily basis by the study ICU. Furthermore, only patients who were sick enough to already need a central venous line in situ at time of screening for eligibility into the trial were recruited to participate, thus delivery of early parenteral nutrition did not require de novo placement of a dedicated central line.</p><p>Whilst receiving the study intervention, if the patient&#x02019;s clinical team decided the patient required additional vitamins, minerals, or micronutrients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ceor-5-369">Table S2</xref>), they were delivered via a separate infusion bag and not admixed with the study parenteral nutrition; as such, requirements for preparation of the study parenteral nutrition in a laminar flow environment were avoided.

Measures of clinical outcomes and health care resource consumption were obtained from a multicenter clinical trial (the Early PN Trial). Costs of care and costs of providing early parenteral nutrition were obtained from the published literature. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulation of a stochastic cost model revealed the provision of early parenteral nutrition might reduce the overall cost of care by US$3,150 per patient (95% CI US$1,314 to US$4,990). These findings were robust, with all sensitivity analyses demonstrating significant savings attributable to the use of early parenteral nutrition, including the sensitivity analysis conducted using European cost data.</p><p>Compared with previous economic analyses assessing the costs of nutrition therapy, which have largely been based on evidence of effectiveness of questionable methodological quality and taken a narrow focus on upfront acquisition costs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ceor-5-369">20</xref> our CMA is based on the results of a multicenter clinical trial conducted in a focused patient population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ceor-5-369">10</xref> using published costs obtained from comprehensive databases with a broad perspective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ceor-5-369">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ceor-5-369">15</xref> Although our findings of significant and substantial cost savings may appear to conflict with a recent economic analysis reporting increased costs attributable to parenteral nutrition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ceor-5-369">19</xref> this previously published economic analysis addressed a different clinical indication for parenteral nutrition than did our CMA. That study, by Vanderheyden et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ceor-5-369">20</xref>, assessed the financial consequences of administering additional parenteral nutrition to critically ill patients who were already able to receive enteral nutrition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ceor-5-369">21</xref> whereas our CMA addressed the financial consequences of administering parenteral nutrition to patients who were unable to receive early enteral nutrition due to short-term relative contraindications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ceor-5-369">10</xref></p><p>A series of a priori defined sensitivity analyses was undertaken to explore alternate decisions regarding major assumptions behind the primary CMA. Each of these sensitivity analyses concurs with the primary CMA, demonstrating significantly reduced costs associated with early parenteral nutrition use. Use of the CPI to index reported costs to 2012 US funds controlled for realistic cost increases over time, and led to an average index rate of 4.2% per annum, only slightly higher than the conservative sensitivity analysis index rate of 4.0%. Additionally, the results obtained by the sensitivity analysis under normal distributional cost assumptions were essentially identical to the primary CMA results, conducted under the gamma distribution. It is possible that distributional assumptions are more important when conducting smaller simulations but become moot in large-scale simulations (N = 1,000,000 trials). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis conducted under European cost assumptions also reported significant costs savings, which supports the primary CMA results based on US costs.</p><p>Although estimates of savings obtained by the sensitivity analysis conducted with European costs may appear lower than US savings, because the 95% CIs of the two estimates overlap, we cannot claim that estimates of cost savings differ significantly between the two different health care systems. Although it is commonly accepted that the US spends more on health care as a percent of its gross domestic product than any other country (17.9% of gross domestic product in 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ceor-5-369">22</xref>), the apparent difference between estimates of US and European cost savings reported in this CMA may be due to different cost-accounting methods used in the US versus Europe. Whereas the perspective taken by Dasta et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ceor-5-369">15</xref> in estimating US costs was broad and included all hospital costs incurred whilst patients were cared for in an ICU, the perspective taken by Tan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ceor-5-369">18</xref> to estimate European costs was slightly narrower. For example, although Tan et al explicitly reported accounting for costs of consultation time for non-ICU clinicians consulting on patients in the ICU, they did not report whether services delivered to critically ill patients by departments outside the ICU (eg, operating theatre expenses) were fully accounted for.</p><p>Indeed, many costing studies from Europe report the daily cost of ICU care as considerably lower than US-based studies; however, the European studies often employ a very restricted perspective, frequently reporting only direct costs of ICU care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ceor-5-369">23</xref> treating the ICU as a cost center within the acute care hospital. The economic assessment of competing health care alternatives delivered whilst a patient is cared for in an ICU may require a broader perspective. For example, technologies that increase direct costs to the ICU (eg, lease of an air suspension bed to prevent pressure ulcers, paid from the ICU budget) may prove cost-effective only when reduced costs to departments outside the ICU are considered (eg, reduced need for operating theatre time to conduct debridement surgery for Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers, paid from the surgery department budget).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ceor-5-369">24</xref></p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In addition to providing costs from the perspective of the acute care hospital, which include services offered by departments outside of the ICU, the cost matrix reported by Dasta et al (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ceor-5-369">Table 1</xref>) allows for accurate stochastic modeling because specific cost distributions can be assigned to specific patient groups (ventilated, medical, surgical, trauma) for each ICU day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ceor-5-369">15</xref> Furthermore, these US cost estimates, and the cost estimates for parenteral nutrition, were generated from robust databases containing tens of thousands of transactions fromhundreds of hospitals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ceor-5-369">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ceor-5-369">15</xref></p><p>Although the European micro-costing study by Tan et al does provide cost estimates for ventilated and unventilated ICU patient-days, it does not allow for accounting by patient type and was conducted in only one hospital from a narrower perspective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ceor-5-369">18</xref> Furthermore, as a consumer price index for medical consumers was not readily available for the Netherlands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ceor-5-369">25</xref> to allow comparability with the primary US-based CMA, the costs reported by Tan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ceor-5-369">18</xref> were indexed to 2012 funds using the conservative rate of 4%.</p><p>Consideration of European financial consequences was not a central objective of this paper.
