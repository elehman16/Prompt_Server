Teeth were decoronated to a standardized root length of 15 mm. Working lengths were established, and root canals were prepared to a size #50, 0.05 taper (F5) using ProTaper rotary instruments (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Peeso reamers (Mani Inc, Tochigi, Japan) ranging in size between #1 and #6 were introduced into the canals to obtain a standard internal diameter of 1.5 mm. Root canals were irrigated with 2 mL 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) between instruments and with 20 mL 1.5% NaOCl for five minutes following instrumentation. Canals were then rinsed with 20 mL saline and dried with paper points. Teeth were then randomly divided into four experimental groups and a control group (n=10 teeth per group).

The push-out bond strength was performed using a universal-testing machine (Shimadzu AG-1; Shimadzu Corp, Tokyo, Japan). A 1.20-mm diameter cylindrical stainless-steel plunger applying a constant compressive load at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min<sup>-1</sup> was positioned in such a way that it only contacted the filling material and avoided contact with the dentin. Also, the disk samples were positioned to allow the plunger to move in an apical to coronal direction, which resulted in the displacement of the filling material toward the larger diameter coronal aspect of the disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). This method ensured the alignment of the specimen in an accurate and reproducible manner and also maintained the plunger centralized and avoided its contact with the dentin wall when the material was pushed and dislodged from the dentin wall. The maximum load applied before failure was recorded in Newtons and converted to megapascals (MPa).<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Scheme of the specimen positioned on the apparatus for load application in the universal testing machine (F: force; P: plugger; RCF: root canal filling; D: diameter)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PJMS-34-310-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Failure analysis</title><p>Following push-out testing, all specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope (SZ61; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 40&#x000d7; magnification to evaluate the failure type.

The application of antibiotic pastes resulted in decreases in ERRM bond strength in comparison to untreated controls. Moreover, the application of CH as an intracanal medicament resulted in a non-significant increase in ERRM bond strength in comparison to controls. Thus, the null hypothesis was partially rejected.</p><p>The increase in bond strength of ERRM to dentin observed following the application of CH may be the result of either a chemical interaction between CH residue and the sealant material,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> or an increase in the frictional resistance and/or micromechanical retention of the sealant.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> No previous studies have reported on the effects of intracanal medicaments on the bond strength of ERRM to dentin; therefore, the results of this study were compared with previous studies examining the effects of intracanal medicaments on the bond strength of MTA. There are conflicting reports regarding the effect of residual CH on the bonding capacity of endodontic sealers. Bidar M et al.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> found CH improved the marginal adaptation of MTA used as an apical plug, and the authors suggested this could be due to a reaction between the MTA and the residual CH. In contrast to these findings, Guiotti FA et al.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and Topcuoglu HS et al.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> determined that prior application of a CH dressing did not significantly affect the push-out bond strength values of MTA. The discrepancies among study findings may be due to differences in the compositions of the sealers tested.</p><p>In the current study, the push-out bond strengths of the specimens previously treated with antibiotic medicaments (TAP, mTAP, and DAP) were significantly lower than those of the specimens treated with CH. These results suggest that irrigation is unable to adequately remove residual medicaments containing antibiotics. A previous study comparing the removal of CH and TAP from root canals found minimal amounts of CH residue, which was distributed rather superficially, and contained a smaller amount of material in comparison to TAP, which appeared to have greater retention and deeper penetration, making it more difficult to remove.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the present study, among the three antibiotic medicaments tested, the TAP group had higher bond strengths than both the mTAP and DAP groups.</p><p>The most likely explanation for this is that the bond strength of the sealant to dentin is increased through the chelation of calcium ions in dentin to residual minocycline from TAP.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The results of the present study are inconsistent with those of previous studies conducted using MTA. For example, although Topcuoglu HS et al.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> found DAP to have a negative effect on the sealing ability of MTA, which is in line with the present study&#x02019;s finding that DAP negatively affecting the bond strength of ERRM, the authors of this earlier study also reported CH and TAP to result in similarly high push-out bond strengths, which conflicts with the present study&#x02019;s finding that CH application resulted in significantly higher bond strengths when compared to TAP application.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Moreover, Dumani A et al.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> found the push-out bond strength of MTA to dentin was significantly decreased by TAP application, even though the TAP was removed from canals by irrigation. By contrast, while the present study found TAP application lowered the push-out bond strength of ERRM to dentin, the difference in bond strength was not statistically significant between the TAP and control groups. Given the differences in methodologies and materials between Topcuoglu HS et al.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and Dumani A et al.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and the present study, the differences in findings are unremarkable.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Although endodontic regeneration usually requires minimal or no instrumentation, in this study, root-canal instrumentation was performed in order to standardize the internal dimensions of the root specimens (to 1.5 mm diameter). Following instrumentation, irrigation was performed as recommended by the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) in order to replicate clinical practice.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Accordingly, conventional syringe irrigation was performed using 20 mL 17% EDTA followed by 10 mL saline in order to remove the intracanal medicaments. Although EDTA irrigation has been recommended as a means of clearing away medicament residue, opening dentinal tubules, and exposing various growth factors during endodontic regeneration,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> it has also been suggested that EDTA may inhibit the adhesion of hydrophilic materials to dentin by decreasing the wetability of dentin surfaces.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, even though saline was used as a final irrigation in this study, it may not have sufficiently flushed away residual EDTA and increased dentin wetability to allow ERRM, which is hydrophilic by nature, to achieve adequate adhesion to root dentin.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In this regard, one of the most important limitations of this study is that it did not evaluate the canal lumen or the amount of residual medicaments.</p><p>Another methodological issue to be noted in connection with the current study has to do with the concentrations of the antibiotic pastes used. Concerns have been raised that the relatively high concentrations of antibiotic pastes used during endodontic regeneration may have negative effects on the mechanical properties of radicular dentin<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and either direct or indirect cytotoxic effects on human apical papilla stem cells<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and dental pulp cells.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In line with clinical practice, in order to be able to produce a paste with the consistency required for it to be successfully introduced into an infected immature root canal, this study used TAP, DAP and mTAP concentrations of 1 g/mL,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> despite the fact that AAE has recommended a much lower concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The AAE recommendation is most likely based on the results of laboratory studies that have reported drug concentrations of more than 100 mg/mL to be cytotoxic to SCAPs and dental-pulp stem cells.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> While the use of lower concentrations of antibiotic medicaments might also help to minimize their negative effects on the mechanical properties of radicular dentin, the application of such low concentrations in clinical situations is difficult. Additional studies are needed to address this issue.</p><p>In order to simulate clinical practice and to minimize the detrimental effects of intracanal medicaments on bond strength, the present study protocol called for medicaments to remain in root canals for three weeks. Although some previous studies have recommended an interval of 2-6 weeks between first and second appointments for endodontic regeneration treatment,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> other studies have suggested that exposure to antibiotic pastes for periods of between 4-12 weeks may have a negative effect on the physical structure of dentin,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> leading to demineralization of the dentin matrix and an increased susceptibility to fracture.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Finally, it should be noted that in spite of the manufacturer&#x02019;s claim that ERRM has a setting time of four hour under normal conditions, an in vitro study by Damas BA et al.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> that focused on setting time of root-canal cements found that ERRM specimens stored in 100% humidity had not completely set in 72 hour. In the present study, in addition to storage in 100% humidity, cotton pellets moistened with distilled water were placed over the ERRM material, and specimens were wrapped in gauze soaked in distilled water. All of the ERRM samples were observed to have fully set within one week. In the present study, the effect of intracanal medicaments on bond strength of set ERRM was only evaluated. However in some previous studies, in order to simulate the clinical conditions, the surfaces of the biomaterial were in contact either with blood or phosphate-buffered solution (PBS).<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Enhanced biomineralization of MTA was observed as the formation of an interfacial layer with tag-like structures in those studies.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, additional research would be necessary to determine the push-out bond strength for ERRM in the situations similar to clinical conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The push-out bond strength of ERRM to root dentin is significantly higher when CH is used as an intracanal medicament as compared to an intracanal medicament containing antibiotics. These findings suggest that the use of CH in clinical practice may help improve the adhesion of calcium phosphate silicate cement to dentin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was presented as oral presentation in International Congress on Preventive Dentistry on March 7th,
