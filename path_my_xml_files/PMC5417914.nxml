No current Level I or II evidence addresses this question.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo&#x02013;controlled, clinical trial was conducted in which patients undergoing immediate tissue expander/implant based breast reconstruction were randomized to either: 1) intraoperative intercostal and pectoral nerve blocks with 0.25 % bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 4&#x02009;mg dexamethasone or 2) sham nerve blocks with normal saline. The surgeon, patient and researchers collecting postoperative data were blind to group allocation. Quality of recovery (QoR 40), pain score, and opioid use in the postoperative period were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney&#x02019;s U test. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used between categorical variables.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> 45 total subjects were enrolled. There were no statistically significant differences in quality of recovery, pain burden, or opioid consumption between groups at 24 hours following surgery. The difference in overall QoR 40 score approached clinical significance, and data trended towards reduced total opioid consumption and better pain control in PACU in the treatment group.<sup>1</sup> Both groups had a good quality of recovery. There were no injection-related complications.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSIONS:</bold> Intraoperative nerve blocks can be a safe and effective adjunct to a comprehensive regimen to improve quality of recovery and pain control following tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction.</p></body></article>
