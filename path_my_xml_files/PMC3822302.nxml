Despite this, there are no universally accepted pharmacological therapies for NASH. Liraglutide (Victoza), a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been shown to improve weight loss, glycaemic control and liver enzymes in type 2 diabetes. There is currently a lack of prospective-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 analogues in patients with NASH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Liraglutide efficacy and action in NASH (LEAN) is a phase II, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate whether a 48-week treatment with 1.8&#x02005;mg liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. Adult, overweight (body mass index &#x02265;25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH were assessed for eligibility at five recruitment centres in the UK. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of either 1.8&#x02005;mg liraglutide or liraglutide-placebo (control). Using A'Hern's single stage phase II methodology (significance level 0.05; power 0.90) and accounting for an estimated 20% withdrawal rate, a minimum of 25 patients were randomised to each treatment group. The primary outcome measure will be centrally assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver histology between liver biopsies at baseline and after 48&#x02005;weeks of treatment. Histological improvement will be defined as a combination of the disappearance of active NASH and no worsening in fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (East Midlands&#x02014;Northampton committee; 10/H0402/32) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Recruitment into the LEAN started in August 2010 and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients randomised. The treatment follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and is due to finish in July 2014. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinicaltrials.gov NCT01237119.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clinical Pharmacology</kwd><kwd>Histopathology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease, affecting up to 30% of the general population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref> and 70&#x02013;90% of high-risk individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> This prevalence relates to the dramatic rise in recent years of morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Even though simple hepatic steatosis (without fibrosis) is arguably a benign condition, up to a quarter of patients with NAFLD have the more severe, inflammatory condition known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Patients with NASH have an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and are expected to become the commonest indication for liver transplantation in forthcoming years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Despite this, there are no universally accepted pharmacological therapies for NASH. Therefore the need for novel, safe agents in NASH is of paramount importance to prevent disease progression and the accompanying clinical burden.</p><p>The strong association of NASH with metabolic syndromes, in particular central adiposity and insulin resistance, provides a strong rationale for investigating therapies that induce weight loss and insulin sensitivity. The gut-derived incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is therefore an attractive target option in NASH. Native GLP-1 has a potent blood glucose-lowering action mediated through its ability to induce insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, as well as suppressing appetite and slowing gastric emptying.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Human GLP-1, however, only has a short half-life (1.5&#x02013;2&#x02005;min) as it is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Liraglutide (Victoza) is a long-acting (half-life 13&#x02005;h) GLP-1 analogue with 97% structural homology to the native hormone and is administered once daily by subcutaneous injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Liraglutide has been shown to cause dose-dependent weight loss,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>

In addition, all five recruitment sites obtained approval from their respective hospital Research and Development (R&#x00026;D) departments prior to the start of&#x000a0;screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment groups</title><p>Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to a 48-week treatment of either liraglutide (Victoza; 1.8&#x02005;mg once daily) or liraglutide-placebo control (1.8&#x02005;mg once daily).</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Liraglutide (active experimental group)</title><p>Liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was supplied in a cartridge contained in a prefilled multidose disposable pen. Each prefilled pen contained 18&#x02005;mg liraglutide in 3&#x02005;mL of clear, colourless, isotonic solution (including water for injections, disodium phosphate dehydrate, propylene glycol and phenol). Liraglutide was administered once daily, at any time of the day, as a single subcutaneous injection into the abdomen, thigh or upper arm using the prefilled pen (30 or 31 gauge needles). Participants were encouraged to inject liraglutide at the same time each day, according to the most convenient time for them. Participants were instructed to perform an air shot of 0.2&#x02005;&#x000b5;L before the first use of each new prefilled pen to ensure that it functioned correctly.</p><p>To improve gastrointestinal tolerability participants underwent a 14-day dose-titration period in keeping with previous reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15 R16 R17 R18">13&#x02013;18</xref> The dose was titrated by 0.6&#x02005;mg every 7&#x02005;days from a starting dose of 0.6&#x02005;mg once daily until the maximum dose of 1.8&#x02005;mg once daily was achieved. Prior to the current trial design, no study had investigated any form of GLP-1-based therapy in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH or any other form of liver disease. Therefore, the rationale for using a dose of 1.8&#x02005;mg once daily was based on previous reports in overweight patients with or without T2D.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15 R16 R17 R18">13&#x02013;18</xref> Furthermore, a large meta-analysis of six phase III clinical trials (LEAD programme) of liraglutide therapy for poorly controlled T2D found that patients with abnormal liver transaminases had a similar drug safety profile to those with normal liver transaminases. In addition, greater improvements in liver transaminases and CT-measured hepatic steatosis were seen with 1.8&#x02005;mg liraglutide than 1.2 and 0.6&#x02005;mg doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Liraglutide-placebo (inactive, placebo-control group)</title><p>Liraglutide-placebo (Victoza, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was packaged, administered and dose-titrated in an identical manner to the liraglutide comparator, described above. The composition of the placebo solution for injection was identical to its comparator, with the exclusion of the active liraglutide substance. A placebo was used to provide an assessment of the level of response with an injectable placebo, which could potentially be higher than that seen with oral placebo agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Concomitant therapy</title><p>No dose reductions of liraglutide or placebo were allowed throughout the 48-week treatment period. Previous treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (metformin and/or sulfonylurea) was continued at the same dose in participants with T2D at randomisation. In the event of recurrent major hypoglycaemic episodes (requiring medical or hospital intervention), the dose of the sulfonylurea was reduced by 50% at the discretion of the investigators. The reported rate of hypoglycaemia in literature, with liraglutide monotherapy or in combination with metformin, is very low.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15 R16 R17 R18">13&#x02013;18</xref> However in the event of recurrent major hypoglycaemic episodes in which no dose reduction could be undertaken (ie, not on a sulfonylurea) the participant was withdrawn from treatment at the discretion of the chief investigator.</p><p>Glycaemic control was assessed at each 12-weekly trial visit with self-measured plasma glucose readings and HbA1c. In the event that glycaemic control deteriorated, defined as HbA1c &#x0003e;9% (75&#x02005;mmol/mol), the participant was informed and counselled with regard to starting open-labelled long-acting insulin detemir once daily (Levemir). However, the patient's participation in the trial was not jeopardised if they did not wish to start insulin detemir. The insulin detemir dose was titrated by trial investigators in accordance with European guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ema.europa.eu">http://www.ema.europa.eu</ext-link>) to ensure that the participant's standard of diabetes care was not significantly compromised as a result of participating in the clinical trial. The HbA1c cut-off &#x0003e;9% was based on the opinions of the TMG (MJA and PNN), consisting of expert endocrinologists (SCLG and JWT), and in accordance with previous clinical trial guidance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></p><p>In addition to study medications, participants continued to receive standard National Health Services (NHS) care recommendations concerning life-style modifications (ie, exercise, weight loss and dietary modification) and management of various coexisting illnesses throughout the trial. Patients were asked to limit alcohol consumption to less than 20&#x02005;mg/day for women (ie, 14&#x02005;units/week) and 30&#x02005;mg/day for men (ie, 21&#x02005;units/week). These levels were consistent with the UK Department of Health recommended daily alcohol allowance (British Medical Association 1995). Participants were not allowed any new prescription or over-the-counter therapies (ie, herbal remedies, milk thistle) that may improve or worsen NASH throughout the duration of the trial. Potential NASH therapies that were not allowed during the trial duration included thiazolidinediones (TZDs), DPP-4 inhibitors, other GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, exenatide), vitamin E and orlistat. Steroids (oral or intravenous), methotrexate and/or amiodarone were also not permitted based on their ability to promote hepatic steatosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants with a significant improvement in liver histology between liver biopsies at baseline (ie, within 6&#x02005;months of screening) and at the end of a 48-week treatment.

The primary aim is not to determine the efficacy of liraglutide compared with placebo but to assess whether the efficacy and safety profile of liraglutide is worthy of further investigation. Recruiting patients into a no-treatment control group provides simultaneous unbiased assessment of comparable patient groups.</p><p>At the time of the study design there were no available data to estimate histological response with a 48-week treatment of liraglutide (Victoza).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> it was assumed that 14&#x02013;17% of patients undergoing current standard of care (placebo) would have an improvement in NASH by week 48. It was estimated that 20% of the placebo-control arm would achieve an improvement in liver histology, based in part on the knowledge that the placebo effect might be exaggerated by the subcutaneous injection route of administration (vs oral route in previous NASH trials) in the current trial. To justify further investigation of liraglutide treatment, a clinically relevant improvement in liver histology was required in at least 50% of patients. The sample size was calculated using A'Hern's single stage phase II methodology,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> with a significance level of 0.05 (type 1 error) and power of 0.90 (type II error).

The proportion of patients with a reported improvement in liver histology will be presented and compared across treatments descriptively with 95% CIs. The proposed A'Hern's design stipulates that 8 or more evaluable patients of 21 in the experimental treatment group (liraglutide) need to achieve the defined improvement in liver histology for treatment with liraglutide to be deemed worthy of further investigation with a phase III trial.

On receipt, the two central &#x02018;blinded&#x02019; central histopathologists recorded the size and quality of the histology slides. A minimum of four unstained slides were available for each liver biopsy to enable repeat staining (H&#x00026;E, haematoxylin van Gieson, Ubiquitin) to ensure adequate quality for

This number is 2 more than planned so as to allow all participants that had registered/consented and found to be eligible to participate in the trial. Online supplementary figure S2 summarises the recruitment rate throughout the trial. A total of 73 patients were registered for the trial, 21 (29%) of whom were not eligible or withdrew consent before randomisation to the trial. Failure to meet the histological inclusion criteria (after central histopathology review) was the most frequent reason for ineligibility. The treatment follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and the last trial visit of the last participant is due to take place in July 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Compliance with the trial protocol and safety profile of liraglutide was reviewed on a biannual basis by an independent DMC, and no concerns were raised.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Challenges in trial design</title><p>Despite recent advances in non-invasive markers of liver injury (eg, transient elastography, serum fibrosis markers), liver biopsy remains the recommended method for the assessment of disease activity for phase II/III trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Liver biopsy is not without its limitations (such as sampling error, invasive nature and patient reluctance for repeat sampling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), but until the accuracy of serial measurements of non-invasive markers have been formally validated, it will be required for trials in NASH. The LEAN trial has attempted to minimise these limitations. First, liver biopsies (&#x0003c;6&#x02005;months of screening) performed for routine NHS diagnostic purposes were incorporated into the eligibility criteria and utilised as the baseline comparator, rather than performing two biopsies for the sole purpose of the trial. This approach is widely accepted in trials of NASH. Second, all of the liver biopsies (baseline, primary endpoint) underwent a blinded central review by two independent expert liver histopathologists (RMB and SGH) at the one site, ensuring that only patients with &#x02018;definite&#x02019; NASH were recruited to the trial and reducing intra/interassessor variability, which has previously been reported between trial sites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></p><p>In 2011, Sanyal and colleagues (update from AASLD research workshop, 2009) published expert guidance on clinical trial design in patients with NASH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Even though the LEAN trial design preceded this workshop, the definition of NASH and the outcome measures were in keeping with their recommendations. Patients with NASH have a higher risk of liver-related mortality than those with simple hepatic steatosis (&#x000b1; mild inflammation).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> Owing to the long time-span of NASH progression (ie, 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;years) to end-stage liver failure/death it is impractical to perform therapeutic trials with mortality as the primary outcome measure. Therefore, we elected to use the disappearance of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis as &#x02018;surrogate&#x02019; primary endpoint in LEAN. With this in mind, a 48-week treatment duration was selected, rather than 2&#x02013;5&#x02005;years, which would be required if we were aiming to demonstrate significant improvements in fibrosis. NAS has been incorporated as a secondary outcome measure (including the individual components of NAS) to represent disease activity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> rather than as the primary outcome as previously reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> NAS alone was not originally designed to infer absence or presence of NASH,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> which we deemed a more meaningful clinical outcome.</p><p>We elected to recruit patients with and without T2D to enhance recruitment rates and broaden the safety data in liraglutide in NASH, but under the provision that patients with diabetes must have moderate glycaemic control (HbA1c &#x0003c;9%) on diet &#x000b1; oral hypoglycaemic medications (with the exception of TZDs and other potential confounders, ie, GLP-1 based therapy) prior to trial entry. With the knowledge that diabetes is a potential confounding factor, randomisation was programmed to stratify for diabetes to ensure equal numbers in each treatment arm.</p><p>The efficient recruitment for clinical trials in NASH remains a challenge, mainly due to the requirement for liver biopsy, which has been compounded by the recent uptake of non-invasive markers (eg, transient elastography) in the UK resulting in a decline in liver biopsy requests in some recruiting centres.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Safety profile of liraglutide</title><p>Prior to the start of the LEAN trial, the summary of product characteristics (SmPc) for liraglutide (Victoza) stated special warnings and precautions for use in moderate/severe renal impairment, moderate/severe congestive heart failure (NHYA class III/IV), pre-existing thyroid disease and in patients at risk of pancreatitis/pancreatic carcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref> In turn, the eligibility criteria (box <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013003995TB1">1</xref>) reflected these warnings by excluding patients with or at risk of such conditions. In particular, based on the preclinical incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours in rodent models and the manufacturer&#x02019;s &#x02018;black box&#x02019; warning in humans,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref> all patients with a personal/family history of thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 and/or abnormal thyroid examination (goiter, nodules) were excluded from the trial. In addition, serum calcitonin, thyroid function tests and clinical thyroid examination were monitored throughout the trial as a precautionary measure.</p><p>In keeping with both the US FDA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> and EMA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> recommendations, all patients in LEAN were given written/verbal advise about the risks and carefully monitored for signs and symptoms indicative of pancreatitis. In March 2013, a small study (n=8) by Butler <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> reported pancreatic cellular changes, consistent with pancreatic duct metaplasia, in organ donors who had received GLP-1 therapy for diabetes prior to death. In response in July 2013, the EMA's committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) critically appraised the study and all other non-clinical/clinical data available, and concluded that the current evidence did not confirm an increased risk of pancreatic AEs with GLP-1 based therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref> Subsequently, the current safety measures adopted by the LEAN trial will continue until further information is made available.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Summary</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, the LEAN trial is the first multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT designed to investigate whether the long-acting GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide, is safe and improves liver histology in overweight patients with NASH.
