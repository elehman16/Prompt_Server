Participant follow-up was completed in March 2014. Eligible participants were identified from electronic lists of patients who were prescribed such treatment and had a mobile phone number on record. A text message was sent to 6884 patients to introduce them to the trial and to ask them to send a text reply if they were interested in meeting an investigator with a view to participating in the trial. A further 120 patients were invited to participate when attending their primary care practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After giving written consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive text messages (Text group) or to not receive text messages (No text group). The randomisation schedule was computer generated in blocks of 4 and allocated centrally from the coordinating centre by telephone. All other decisions regarding usual medical care were left to the discretion of the responsible physicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Text messaging</title><p>The text messages were automatically generated using a software application designed for the trial, comprising three linked components; a third party text message provider, a database to record sent and received texts, and a user interface to set up a participant profile. The text messages were customized so each patient received the text just after the time they were advised to take their medication. Patients with similar requirements (text policies) were grouped together to simplify administering the texts.</p><p>Patients in the Text group were sent daily texts for two weeks, then alternate day texts for two weeks and then weekly texts for 22 weeks (6 months overall) and participants were asked to send a text message reply to each message sent, indicating whether they had taken their medication, whether the message had reminded them to take it if they had forgotten or whether they had simply not taken it. The text schedule was sent by computer and responses automatically filed, so patients who had not taken their medication or not responded could be identified and telephoned to determine whether there was a reason for not taking their medication, and if so, discussing this with a view to resolving the issue. Further details of the software application are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/current-projects/INTERACT-trial">www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/current-projects/INTERACT-trial</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trial outcomes</title><p>The primary trial outcome in this analysis was medication use at 6 months, exceeding 80% of the prescribed regimen. Medication use was usually determined by personal enquiry at clinic visits, or failing that, using general practice electronic prescription records. Patients were asked whether they had stopped taking their medication and if not, the number of days in the previous 28 days that medication had been missed. For patients who could not be contacted but had electronic records, the number of days missed was imputed in proportion to the number in those who were contacted. Secondary outcomes were (i) the proportion of patients continuing their medication regardless of the number of days missed and (ii) among those continuing, the proportion taking &#x0003e;80% of their prescribed regimen. Blood pressure measurements were taken at 6 months in patients on blood pressure lowering medication at randomisation and similarly, serum cholesterol (total and LDL) in patients on cholesterol lowering medication at randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>We estimated that 300 patients would achieve at least an 85% power to detect a 15 percentage point or greater improvement in the proportion of patients who continued their medication and took it for at least 22 of the previous 28 days at a 5% level of statistical significance, assuming an adherence rate of 70% in the control group <xref rid="pone.0114268-Naderi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and 20% loss-to-follow up.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Comparisons between groups were performed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables, t-tests for continuous variables with Gaussian distributions and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables with non-gaussian distributions. Percentage differences in the proportion of patients who continued their medication and took it at least 22 of the last 28 days, and 95% Confidence Intervals were calculated. Subgroup analyses on the use of medication were performed according to age, sex, smoking, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary revascularisation). The effects of text messages in these subgroups were compared using interaction tests on the basis of a significance level of 0.01 or less. Analyses were performed using Stata, version 12.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Research ethics committee approval</title><p>The study was approved by the North Central London Research Ethics Committee in January 2011 and was registered on the ISRCTN Register (ISRCTN74757601) in April 2013 after recruitment began, due to an oversight.

Following a telephone consultation 20 or these patients (13%) resumed their medication and 3 stopped completely.</p><p>The results were not materially affected by age, sex, smoking, presence or absence of diabetes and history or no history of cardiovascular disease; no statistically significant interactions were found, but the power to detect differential effects was limited.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this trial show that in patients prescribed blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering medication for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, text messages improved the use of prescribed medication at 6 months compared with the use in patients who were not sent text messages. Stopping medication completely and taking less than 80% of the prescribed regimen were both reduced, by 9% and 7% respectively &#x02013; an overall improvement in medication adherence of 16%.</p><p>The 80% cut-off (&#x0003e;22 of the last 28 days medication was taken) that classified a person as adhering to their medication was arbitrary, but has been used in previous publications. <xref rid="pone.0114268-Naderi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114268-Karve1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> Had we adopted a lower or higher cut-off, say 75% or 85%, the difference in adherence between the text and no text groups would have been 15% or 20% respectively. The estimate is therefore reasonably robust.</p><p>The software used in this trial automated the sending of texts and recording of replies in a way that reminded patients to take their medication (about two-thirds of patients) and identified those who did not (1 in 6 patients), so the reason for not doing so could be determined and advice provided. This approach differs from previous trials which used one-way text messages to encourage the use of sunscreen <xref rid="pone.0114268-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, malaria prophylaxis <xref rid="pone.0114268-Ollivier1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, antibiotics <xref rid="pone.0114268-Suffoletto1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and blood pressure drugs <xref rid="pone.0114268-MrquezContreras1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and did not show statistically significant improvements in adherence. Two randomised trials that, like ours, sent a text message and required a response, did show statistically significant improvements in adherence in the use of anti-retroviral treatment among HIV patients, in one trial <xref rid="pone.0114268-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and vitamin C in healthy people in another <xref rid="pone.0114268-Cocosila1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Bidirectional texting may be an important factor in achieving a benefit.</p><p>The text messages were customized to the time of day that patients took their medication but the frequency that texts were sent was not automatically adjusted in the light of the response. Future versions of the software could be made more &#x0201c;intelligent&#x0201d; to enhance the customisation. The method was simple, is scalable and could be extended to other disorders for which drugs are taken long-term, such as asthma, epilepsy, HIV infection and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>In this trial, medication use was high because the main method of recruitment involved responding to a text invitation (response rate of 9%). The patient sample was likely to be a particularly conscientious group that was likely to adhere to their medication more than patients in general. This limited the trial's power to show statistically significant differences in cholesterol and blood pressure between the randomised groups. Such selection is probably inevitable in trials such as this, which require the consent and cooperation of the participants involved. As a consequence the results of this trial may underestimate the routine use of texting as a means of improving adherence to medication.</p><p>Several questions remain. For example, would the benefit of text messaging be improved or diminished in patients who were starting drug treatment, compared to patients who had been taking medication for some years already, as we studied here? Would the text intervention provide similar benefits in patients taking medication for other chronic disorders, such as tuberculosis or HIV infection? Would the improvement in medication adherence, observed at 6 months, be sustained if the text intervention stopped? Further research would be needed to answer these questions.</p><p>In conclusion, in this randomised trial, we found that among patients taking blood pressure and/or lipid-lowering treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease events, text messaging, improved the extent to which patients took their prescribed medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114268.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
