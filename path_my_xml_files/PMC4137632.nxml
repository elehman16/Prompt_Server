The exact mode of action is not clear, may be related to the sedative properties of the drug. The side-effect profile is similar to that of most of other muscle relaxants, except for a limited number of reported cases of significant hepatotoxicity particularly by chlorzoxazone.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Thiocolchicoside is a semi-synthetic derivative of colchicines, a natural glycoside originated from flower seeds of superba gloriosa.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has an affinity for the inhibitory glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors i.e., have glycomimetic and gaba mimetic activity, therefore shows muscle relaxant action. As it has GABA-mediated action, so it shows both myorelaxant as well as analgesic activity.
