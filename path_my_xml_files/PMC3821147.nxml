myocardial protection and decrease in use of inotropes, duration of ventilation, ICU and
hospital length of stay (LOS).There is little literature, however, in the comparative
use of inhalational and narcotic anesthesia in CCHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Following Institutional Ethical Review Board approval and parental consent, 35 patients
presenting for BT shunt were prospectively randomized to receive either a desflurane
anesthetic or a narcotic anesthetic. Institutional practice for all patients undergoing
BT shunt is to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) following median sternotomy.
Induction was accomplished with 5-7% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, 2ug/kg fentanyl,
0.05mg/kg midazolam and 0.1mg/kg vecuronium. After intubation, patients in the narcotic
group (n=16) received an additional 5-10ug/kg fentanyl, 0.1mg/kg midazolam, 100% oxygen
and vecuronium. Patients in the inhalational group (n=19) received desflurane, 0.6-1
MAC, 100% oxygen, 0.05mg/kg midazolam, IV paracetamol 15mg/kg and vecuronium. At the end
of surgery, patients were transferred to the ICU and received IV paracetamol and
midazolam. Ventilation was weaned when the patient was hemodynamically stable.
Demographics, baseline, intra and post-op heart rates, duration of inotrope use, ICU and
hospital LOS, pre and post-op creatinine and serious adverse events (SAE) were recorded.
Data were analyzed using Student, paired t, Mann-Whitney U and Chi square/Fisher exact
tests, P &#x0003c; 0.05 significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Demographic data were similar, except for a modestly higher pre-op heart rate in the
group receiving opioid anesthesia. Patients receiving desflurane had a significantly
shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU and hospital stay. Inotrope
use was similar in both groups. The group receiving opioid anesthesia had an increase in
creatinine post operatively which was not observed in the desflurane group. There was no
difference in incidence of significant adverse events in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Use of inhalational anesthesia has increased in adult cardiac surgery and has proved to
reduce duration of elective ventilation, decrease ICU and hospital LOS, and mortality.
Inhalational anesthetics are less well-studied in CCHD. In the current study, desflurane
was chosen because of its low solubility, decreased recovery time and lack of metabolism
or organ system toxicities. Although it is a popular belief that desflurane is
associated with tachycardia and airway irritation, findings of the current study are
consistent with those of the previous works demonstrating a lack of these side effects
below 1 MAC3. No hemodynamic instability was encountered and there was no evidence that
desflurane exerted a negative inotropic effect. Markers of cardio protection were not
examined, although desflurane may have had a renal protective effect compared to
narcotic technique. In the current study, a desflurane anesthetic for BT shunt decreased
the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital LOS by nearly three days,
with no difference in perioperative morbidity or mortality. Larger studies are required
to determine whether these changes result in overall decreased complication rate and
morbidity/mortality and whether desflurane has a cardio or renal protective effect in
the patient population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Research</kwd><kwd>Humans</kwd><kwd>Anesthesia</kwd><kwd>Heart Diseases</kwd><kwd>Desflurane</kwd><kwd>Analgesics, Opioid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec9854"><title>1. Background</title><p>Repair of cyanotic congenital heart disease often involves the placement of extracardiac
systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts, such as Blalock Taussig (BT), Glenn and Fontan
procedures, to allow blood flow to the lungs and thus oxygenation of the body&#x02019;s
tissues.For some patients with severely decreased pulmonary blood flow, a systemic to
pulmonary artery shunt is a necessity as a life-saving or temporizing form of palliation
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R1">1-5</xref>). The modified BT shunt is commonly done
in our insitiution utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. Traditionally these procedures are
accomplished by a total intravenous technique (TIVA), with the use of high dose fentanyl,
midazolam and a muscle relaxant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R6">6</xref>). This
technique is used because of its hemodynamic stability, but has a distinct disadvantage in
that it increases the period of mechanical ventilation, which predisposes the patient to
associated complications and increase intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Additionally, positive
pressure ventilation decreases pulmonary blood flow to the surgically created shunts,
thereby compromising shunt function. Thus, the shortest possible duration of mechanical
ventilation and ICU stay is desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R3">5</xref>). The use of inhalational anesthetic agents in lieu
of narcotics may shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, but may be
associated with myocardial depression and dysarrythmias, especially seen with halothane.
Newer inhalational agents, such as sevoflurane and desflurane, are not associated with these
cardiac side effects and, due to lower blood solubility, facilitate early awakening and
endotracheal extubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9855"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>These inhalational agents also provide &#x02018;anestheticpreconditioning&#x02019;, which
protects the heart from ischemic insults frequently encountered during cardiac surgery
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R8">8-12</xref>). Given its low tissue solubility in
addition to low blood solubility, low percentage of metabolism and a lack of effects on
other organs at commonly used concentrations, desflurane is particularly attractive as an
inhaled agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R12">12-14</xref>). The current study aimed to compare the utility of Desflurane
to TIVA in BT shunt procedures for cyanotic congenital cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec9856"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><p>Thirty five ASA class III and IV patients between two months and 12 years, scheduled for BT
shunt procedures for cyanotic congenital heart disease were studied after receiving approval
from local ethical committee and written informed parental consent. Patients requiring
emergent intervention or pressor support prior to surgery were excluded.Patients were
randomly divided into two groups &#x02013; TIVA (n = 16) and desflurane (n = 19).
Electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter and non-invasive blood pressure
were monitored before induction. Institutional practice for all patients undergoing BT shunt
is to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) following median sternotomy. Patients in both
groups did not receive premedication, and induction of anesthesia was achieved with the use
of 5-7% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 0.05 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 mg/kg
vecuronium. After induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the technique for
maintainence of anesthesia was dictated by sealed envelope randomization.Patients in the
TIVA group received an additional 5-10 mcg/kg fentanyl, in incremental doses, as needed to
control hemodynamic responses to surgical manipulation, 0.1mg/kg midazolam, 100% oxygen and
vecuronium, 0.05mg/kg, as needed for muscle relaxation. In the desflurane group, anesthesia
was maintained with desflurane at 0.6 - 1 MAC in 100 % oxygen, 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 1-2
mcg/kg fentanyl and vecuronium by bolus (0.1 mg/kg), as needed for muscle
relaxation/immobility. Pressure control ventilation was commenced in both groups and femoral
arterial and central venous catheters were placed.Hydration was accomplished with lactated
Ringer&#x02019;s infusion and blood loss was replaced, keeping hematocrit above 35% in all
patients. Hemodynamic parameters were maintained within 20% of baseline values using
nitroglycerine (NTG), dopamine and epinephrine infusions at the discretion of the
anesthesiologist.At the conclusion of the procedure, both groups were transported to the ICU
electively ventilated.On arrival in the ICU, hemodynamic parameters were recorded.Patients
in both groups received midazolam intravenously for sedation and paracetamol, 15 mg/kg,
intravenously for analgesia.Sedation was stopped once the patients were hemodynamically
stable and arousable and the patients were taken off mechanical ventilation using standard
weaning protocols. The decision to wean was based on hemodynamic stability and not on the
Sedation, Agitation or other systems of sedation scoring. Duration of elective ventilation,
inotrope use, ICU and hospital stay were noted. Serum creatinine levels were recorded
preoperatively, and then at 48 hours postoperatively. Any serious adverse events, such as
stroke, renal failure, arrhythmia, or any other major cardiovascular/neurologic events were
recorded. The starting point to note the duration of elective ventilation, inotrope use, ICU
and hospital stay commenced from the time the patient arrived in the ICU. SPSS 15.0 for
Microsoft Windows was employed to perform statistical analysis. Normally distributed
continuous data were compared using the Student t test to compare the two groups. If data
points were not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U tests were used. Categorical variables
between the two groups were tested with the chi square/ Fisher exact test. Correlation
analysis was carried out to see the relation within each group. Besides , the paired T- test
was applied to see the change in variables separately for each group. Repeated measure
analysis was carried out to see the trend in heart rate in the intraoperative and
postoperative period. A 2-tailed P value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec9857"><title>4. Results</title><p>The two groups were comparable with regard to the demographic and preoperative data. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3145">Table 1</xref>), although heart rate and systolic blood
pressure were modestly increased in the TIVA group.The patients of the TIVA group were
somewhat older than those of the desfurane group, but the difference was not statistically
significant (P=0.053). Statistical analysis and comparing the means of demographic and
baseline vital parameters indicated that there was a significant difference in the duration
of mechanical ventilation in the two groups (desflurane = 8.66 &#x000b1; 3.71 hrs; TIVA = 14.37
&#x000b1; 4.75 hrs, P= 0.001), ICU stay (desflurane = 3.67 &#x000b1; 1.96 days; TIVA = 5.50 &#x000b1;
1.63 days, P=0.006) and hospital stay (desflurane = 6.37 &#x000b1; 2.33 days; TIVA = 8.56
&#x000b1; 1.41 days, P= 0.002). However there was no significant difference in the duration of
inotrope use in the two groups (desflurane = 49.37 &#x000b1; 32.92 hrs; TIVA = 50.88 &#x000b1;
19.96 hrs, P=0.367) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3146">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2459">Figure 1</xref>). The creatinine levels measured at 48 hours
postoperatively were compared to the preoperative values as paired samples in both groups.
There was no significant change in the desflurane group (P = 0.613), but post-op creatinine
increased significantly in the TIVA group (P= 0.024). (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3147">Table 3</xref>).Repeated measure analysis was carried out to see the trend in heart rate
from preoperative baseline, during the intraoperative period (measured just before
cannulation of the great vessels) and the value on reaching the ICU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3148">Table 4</xref>). There was a significant decrease in intraoperative heart
rate (within physiological values for age) in the TIVA group (P &#x0003c; 0.05), which then
remained relatively constant in the postoperative period. In the desflurane group there was
no significant change in heart rate. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2460">Figure 2</xref>).
Pearson correlation was done between all the variables. There was an association between ICU
stay and hospital stay (r = 0.625, P = 0.004). However there was no correlation between the
duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay (r = 0.011, P = 0.964) and hospital stay (r
= 0.144, P = 0.557). There were no serious adverse effects (SAE) in the TIVA group. In the
desflurane group one patient had a sudden cardiac arrest within the first 24 hours of
surgery and did not survive.The event occurred several hours following surgery and did not
appear to be related to either the anesthetic or surgical procedure. Three patients in
desflurane group and one in the TIVA group had renal dysfunction in the form of oliguria and
deranged creatinine levels. The SAE (death) and renal dysfunction events were not
significant when compared using the fisher exact test.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3145" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical Analysis and Comparison in Mean of Demographic and Baseline Vital

tissues. Palliative surgery increases pulmonary blood flow, temporarily stabilizing the
patient and allowing him/her to grow and undergo future corrective or palliative procedures.
The most common shunt is the BT shunt, named after Blalock and Taussig who first described
it in 1945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R1">2</xref>). Here, the shunt is from a
systemic artery (e.g., the subclavian or the aorta) to the pulmonary artery (main, right, or
left).</p><p>Another type of palliative shunt is from a systemic vein (superior vena cava [SVC])
to the PA.This is termed a Glenn shunt. Because this shunt directs only deoxygenated blood
to the PA prior to its entry into the heart, it reduces the volume load on the heart.
Because the driving pressure in the Glenn shunt is the SVC pressure (rather than right
ventricular), the PA pressures must be low for this to be successful.PA pressures typically
decrease to acceptable levels to allow proper function of a Glenn shunt after an infant is
older than 2-3 months. Palliative shunts have become less common treatments for many
cyanotic heart malformations since the advent of early corrective procedures.Nevertheless,
certain subsets of patients require initial palliative surgery because their cardiac
disorders are not generally amenable to initial corrective surgery, owing to either anatomic
or physiologic causes.Moreover it may be an institutional practice in some centers to delay
definitive corrective procedures until 12-18 months of age. In these patients a systemic to
pulmonary artery shunt remains a necessity as a life-saving or temporizing form of
palliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R3">5</xref>). The modified BT
shunt involves interposing a Gore-Tex graft between the subclavian or innominate artery and
the ipsilateral PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R3">3</xref>). This shunt can be
performed with or without CPB via a thoracotomy or median sternotomy. An IV induction with
ketamine or fentanyl is desirable, but most infants and children will tolerate a mask
induction with either sevoflurane or halothane as there is a parallel decrease in pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Maintenance of anaesthesia
with high dose fentanyl, a muscle relaxant, and a benzodiazepine is most commonly done
because of the hemodynamic stability achieved.Opioids provide profound analgesia,
attenuation of unwanted visceral responses to surgery, and, in high doses, ablation of
stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R10">15</xref>). Duncan et al. compared different doses of fentanyl (range 2-150
&#x000b5;g/kg) in infants and young children undergoing cardiac surgery. They found that
fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg failed to prevent significant rises in cortisol and norepinephrine,
whereas 25 and 50 &#x000b5;g/kg were as effective as higher doses but provided greater
cardiovascular stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R11">16</xref>). The opioid
technique, however, has the disadvantages of bradycardia, oversedation and delay in weaning
from postoperative mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R12">17</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R14">18</xref>) which not only predisposes the patient to
complications of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, but, due to positive
pressure ventilation, also causes lower pulmonary blood flow to the surgically created
shunts, thereby compromising shunt function.Since it is desirable to decrease duration of
mechanical ventilation and reduce ICU stay, the use of volatile anesthetic agents may be
beneficial in terms of shortened duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Volatile
anesthetic agents when compared with TIVA/opioid-based technique in CABG surgery with or
without bypass, were found to decrease the time of mechanical ventilation, shorten ICU stay
and reduce risk of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R7">7</xref>).
Some volatile agents, however, are associated with myocardial depression and dysarrythmias,
especially halothane. These negative inotropic effects are significantly less potent in the
newer inhalational agents, sevoflurane and desflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R9">19</xref>). Moreover both sevoflurane and desflurane have been found to have
cardioprotective effects which are attributed to &#x02018;anesthetic preconditioning&#x02019;
that protects the heart from ischemic insult frequently encountered during cardiac
surgery.The first clinical trial to investigate the clinical efficacy of volatile
anesthetics in CABG was in 2002, reporting that sevoflurane preserved global hemodynamic and
left ventricular function with a lower postoperative troponin I compared with total
intravenous anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R8">8</xref>). Since then, well
designed animal and human studies (in the adult population) have repeatedly demonstrated
exposure of the myocardium to a volatile anesthetic before a period of ischemia
significantly protects the myocardium against subsequent ischemia- reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R9">9-11</xref>). Both sevoflurane and desflurane are reported
to have cardioprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R12">12</xref>). In one
study desflurane conferred a greater degree of cardiac protection than sevoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R14">14</xref>). Desflurane has the advantage of having lower
blood gas and tissue solubility than other volatile agents,allowing for rapid decrease of
alveolar concentrations during elimination, thereby facilitating early awakening and
extubation and therefore reduced duration of positive pressure ventilation. Thus desflurane
may have an advantage over sevoflurane in fast tracking, particularly following longer
cases, such as cardiac surgery. Desflurane has also shown to have cardioprotective effect in
terms of ICU stay and weaning from mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R9">9</xref>). Finally, absence of metabolic or breakdown byproducts, such as
fluoride or Compound A in desflurane, make it an attractive option in cardiac surgery,
wherein CPB may have a deleterious effect on the renal system. A thorough literature search
was done but only a few studies comparing inhalational agents to TIVA in cardiac surgery
patients were found. All these studies were in the adult population who underwent CABG
surgery. There is no study wherein these two techniques are compared for maintenance of
anaesthesia in cyanotic children undergoing palliative shunt surgery. Fabio Guarracino and
Giovanni Landoni evaluated the effects of volatile anesthesia versus total intravenous
anesthesia on cardiac troponin release in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB)
patients and found that myocardial damage could be reduced by volatile anesthetics during
OPCAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R7">11</xref>). In another meta-analysis, the authors
examined studies comparing a total intravenous anesthesia regimen versus an anesthesia plan
including desflurane or sevoflurane. They concluded that desflurane and sevoflurane have
cardioprotective effects that result in decreased morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R12">12</xref>). Desflurane is an acceptable volatile agent in
children undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Desflurane administered at 1 MAC or less does not
adversely affect hemodynamic parameters, hepatic or renal function in children. Desflurane
may be preferred over sevoflurane when early recovery from anaesthesia is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R8">13</xref>). Similar results were found in the patients under
study, wherein there was a significant decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation,
ICU stay, and the total duration of stay in the hospital in the desfluranegroup.
Additionally, in the current study TIVA was associated with an increase in post-operative
creatinine level which was not observed in the desflurane group. It is unclear whether
desflurane may have a renal protective quality that has not been well-studied.CPB is known
to have deleterious effects on renal function and like many other institutions, we routinely
measure post-operative indices of renal function to better address CPB-associated renal
insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R13">20</xref>). A potential renal protective
property of desflurane following CPB is an intriguing possibility that merits further study.
Desflurane is known to have negative inotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R9">19</xref>). In the current study there was no difference in the duration of inotrope use
in the two groups. There is evidence that desflurane confers myocardial protection in adult
patients undergoing cardiac surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R7">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R14">14</xref>),
but as the current study did not measure ischemic markers, it is unable to comment on this.
There were no significant serious adverse events in either group that could be attributed to
choice of anaesthesia technique. The use of desflurane is associated with increased
incidence of agitation especially in the pediatric age group, but no patient in the current
study had any episode of agitation / seizure. This may be because fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg body
weight was used during induction. Fentanyl has been found to prevent emergence agitation
while preserving the rapid recovery associated with desflurane anesthesia in children
undergoing non cardiac surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R20">21</xref>).
Additionally, the patients under study were not awakened until achieving hemodynamic
stability in the ICU and this extended time to awakening likely obviated any emergence
delirium. Desflurane is also associated with sympathetic stimulation when administered in
concentrations above 1.5 MAC.There was a significant decrease in heart rate (within
physiological values for age) in the TIVA group which was not observed in the desflurane
group. The desflurane patients had a relatively stable heart rate. The current study results
have been favorable for faster recovery in the desflurane group, but the study had some
limitations. First, it was a single center trial and was not blinded. Second, since ischemic
markers were not studied, objective analysis of myocardial damage was not done. Hemodynamic
parameters, such as arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure and central venous
oximetry, which change frequently during surgery, were not recorded at the three time
intervals when heart rate was recorded. TIVA with fentanyl, midazolam and non-depolarizing
muscle relaxant, is an established and accepted technique for BT shunt and other cardiac
surgeries, but has disadvantages of prolonged mechanical ventilation, potential shunt
compromise secondary to positive pressure ventilation, and prolonged ICU stay. The current
study demonstrated that the use of desflurane along with low dose fentanyl is a favorable
alternative to the high dose fentanyl, and benzodiazepine combination. Although the patients
under study were managed by an intensivist, independent of the anesthesia team, and weaned
according to institutional practice, the study was not blinded and it is not possible to
completely rule out bias or Hawthorne effect. It has been previously demonstrated that early
postoperative extubation correlates with decreased invasive intervention and use of
inotropes in demographically matched groups of like hemodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9511R21">22</xref>). A patient`s being awake and breathing
spontaneously versus unconscious and on a ventilator, may influence therapeutic strategy.
Even a completely blinded prospective study, thus, may not eliminate this
limitation.Although the current study did not directly measure markers of cardiac or renal
injury following CPB, the lack of a post-operative increase in creatinine in the desflurane
group is of interest and possible cardioprotective and renal protective effects of
desflurane in the pediatric population should be further studied.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge the all India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Nemours
