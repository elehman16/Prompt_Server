Clinical signs include swelling, edema and it is generally associated with debilitating pain<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>. The clinical approach to reduce pain in APA patients includes the mandatory need to identify the location of the suppurative mass<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>. Initially, pus can be confined to the periodontal ligament space, facilitating a drainage throughout the canal. When pus is located intraosseously, an expansion of the cortical bone (i.e., swelling) is present, which makes patients feel an intense pain. At a final stage, pus breaks the periosteum and invades the submucosal space making the swelling to display a floating aspect with a reduction in pain intensity. At this phase, a surgical drainage of pus is an effective possibility<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the treatment of APA, besides the local clinical approach, which relies on surgical access and/or root canal debridement and provide pus drainage, a systemic medication oncoming that involves the use of analgesics and antibiotics is also considered. Antibiotics can be prescribed as a complementary measure especially for abscesses associated with systemic involvement, including fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy; disseminating infections resulting in cellulitis, progressive diffuse swelling, and/or trismus; and abscesses in medically compromised patients at increased risk of a secondary infection following bacteremia<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. In APA cases, analgesia becomes challenging because the immunological mechanisms of pain have already been triggered. It is generally accepted the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control the pain associated with inflammatory signs such as swelling. Ahmad, et al.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> (1997) found that therapeutic doses of NSAIDs were more effective than the combination of acetaminophen (600-650 mg) and codeine (60 mg) in the treatment of pain caused by the extraction of third molars. However, for pain management of infectious diseases, the use of NSAIDs may mask clinical signs of infection<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, in the presence of infection and pain with moderate to severe intensity, the combined use of oral opioids (such as codeine or tramadol) and non-opioids (such as acetaminophen or aspirin) is considered more appropriate<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, even though there is a clear lack of clinical evidence to support using these drug combinations in pain controlling, especially in APA cases.</p><p>Codeine/acetaminophen is the most frequently used drug combination due to its efficacy and safety for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>. However, the tramadol/acetaminophen combination has also been proposed as an alternative to control acute pain<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. The use of tramadol has been proven effective in treating some cases of acute and chronic pain. However, the benefits of its use in the treatment of acute pain of dental origin are not well characterized. Because APA is an infectious process of dental origin that might spawn a severe debilitating pain experience to the patient, it seems relevant to compare the overall effectiveness of the two combinations of opioid/non-opioid medications, as indicated by the analgesic effect and the incidence of adverse reactions. The hypothesis is that no significant difference in analgesic effectiveness is present when combining these two opioids (codeine or tramadol) with acetaminophen (non-opioid) to manage pain in patients with APA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (12671913.1.0000.5347).</p><p>This double-blind, codeine/acetaminophen-controlled parallel design clinical trial was conducted following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guideline. The sample consisted of APA patients who sought emergency care at the dental school of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.

Patients were excluded if they had taken analgesics or antibiotics within 4 hours prior to emergency surgery, reported allergy to the drugs used in this study, had a history of gastric ulcer, liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or epilepsy, pregnancy or were breast feeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>All endodontic procedures, performed by the same investigator (M.F.S.) were standardized. Anesthesia was induced with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000. Pulpal chamber was accessed under rubber dam isolation. Next, septic-toxic contents were neutralized with K files #08,10 or 15 (Dentsply Maillefer; Ballaigues, Vaud, Switzerland) and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (Farm&#x000e1;cia Marcela; Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). Then, the coronal portions of the canals were enlarged with a LA Axxess drill (Sybroendo; Orange, California, USA) and the work length was electronically determined by the apex locator Apex DSP (Septodont; Paris, &#x000ce;le-de-France, France). The apical part of each root canal was prepared to a size 25 K-file using a crown down technique. The canals were profusely rinsed with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl and dried with paper points. A sterilized cotton pellet was placed in the access cavity and subsequently restored with the glass ionomer cement Vitro Fil (Nova DFL; Taquara, RJ, Brazil). Finally, the occlusion was checked.</p><p>After the first appointment, the patient signed a consent form outlining the procedure and its possible risks. Subsequently, patients were allocated to one of the following groups: Co/Ac, which received one fixed-dose oral tablet containing codeine/acetaminophen (30 mg/500 mg) every 4 hours for 3 days, or Tr/Ac, which received one fixed-dose oral tablet containing tramadol/acetaminophen (37.5 mg/325 mg) every 4 hours for 3 days. Instructions on how to perform the pain recordings using the VAS were given to each patient. An assistant accompanied the patients while the first dose of medication was taken.</p><p>The patients received a pain diary, containing the VAS, and a sealed package with the other doses of medication. If patients experienced pain that was not controlled by the tested medications, they were instructed to take additional medication (acetaminophen 500 mg, every 4 hours) using under an on-demand scheme.</p><p>Four days after the first visit, the patient returned the pain diary. To indirectly check adherence to the treatment plan, patients were also asked to return the medication package. Numerical values obtained at each time point (0, 6,12, 24,48 and 72 h after the first dose administration) for each patient were recorded.</p><p>In cases that drainage was not possible or in the presence of systemic symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, swelling or trismus), 21 amoxicillin capsules (500 mg) were prescribed and given orally every 8 hours for 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding procedures</title><p>The random allocation sequence was performed using random table numbers generated at randomizer. org. A pharmacist encapsulated the drugs in identical capsules, and packaged in white bottles numbered 1 to 26. Information on drug administration was described on the label. An assistant who was blinded to the aim and the protocol of the study generated the numbers using a spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the pain scores. They were obtained using VAS before and after the first appointment. Secondary outcomes included frequency of additional medication use and adverse reactions reported by patients. All information was registered in the pain diary by the patient.</p><p>The Number Needed to Harm (NNH), i.e., the number of patients receiving Tr/Ac treatment to cause one additional patient to be harmed, compared with patients who received Co/Ac treatment was also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.18.0 (IBM Corp.; Armonk, New York, USA).</p><p>Descriptive statistics were performed, with presentation of data as absolute and relative frequencies, median and 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles.</p><p>Student's t-test for independent samples was used to determine differences between the mean ages for each group. The Chi-square test was used to verify differences between the groups regarding gender, tooth type, antibiotic use and frequency of adverse reactions. Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify the difference between the mean initial pain scores between groups.</p><p>The two groups were compared considering a score-based evaluation in the same time interval using the Mann-Whitney U procedure.

Endodontic literature lacks information about the use of additional drugs in controlling pain of endodontic origin. Some studies in other fields have measured the use of additional drugs as a way to evaluate analgesic efficacy. Da Costa-Araujo, et al.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (2003). However, four patients from the Tr/Ac group were lost during follow-up due to an adverse reaction. Two patients (20%) did not tolerate the side effects and two (20%) sought other health service due to the therapeutic inefficacy of drugs tested. Therefore, considering overall safety, the Co/Ac combination could be taken as superior to Tr/Ac group, which partially reject the originally set hypothesis. These data suggest that the safety profile of both associations may be different and future studies must assess this outcome. However, because in this study the sample size calculation was not performed for this outcome (i.e. safety), the result can be a real difference between treatments or a statistic type II error (beta).</p><p>Opioid analgesics are useful agents for treating pain of various etiologies, however, adverse effects are potential limitations to their use. In a systematic review, Moore, et al.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (2000) concluded that the addition of 60 mg codeine to acetaminophen produced additional pain relief, but it may be accompanied by side effects, such as drowsiness and dizziness. The parameter used to evaluate the increased risk of an adverse event associated with a drug intervention is the NNH. In this clinical trial, the NNH presented for each group was 1.25, Citrome and Ketter<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (2002) calculated the NNH for tramadol and tramadol plus acetaminophen in relation to a placebo and found that for single-dose oral tramadol or tramadol plus acetaminophen the NNH for a patient to report any adverse effect were 5.0 and 5.4, respectively.

In contrast, this study prescribed the tested combinations in fixed-doses, every 4 hours over 3 days. This scheme allows evaluation of the analgesic efficacy and frequency of adverse reactions more closely to a real clinical setting, as well as the analysis of patient compliance.

</xref> (1999) observed that ketorolac (10 mg) was more effective than codeine/acetaminophen (15 mg/325 mg) in controlling pain caused by acute apical periodontitis. Nevertheless, the external validity of these results is questionable because for the baseline pain intensities reported by the authors (greater than 70 mm on VAS), the employed doses of codeine and acetaminophen were low, even when used in combination.</p><p>During the phase of abscess development, the pus is aiming to reach the exterior through the bone or periodontal tissue, which explains the pain reported by the patient.
