Activation of the rennin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system, the presence of an enhanced sympathetic tone and the use of potassium-wasting diuretics for a positive fluid balance increases the occurrence and consequences of severe hypokalaemia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Hypokalaemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Thus, potassium replacement therapy is the cornerstone therapy for hypokalaemia. It is desirable to avoid hypokalaemia by the proactive style and aggressive replacement of potassium. There is mounting evidence that the serum potassium level should be maintained between 4.5 and5.5&#x02005;mEq/L in acute cardiac injury settings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Although intravenous potassium replacement (IVPR) in hypokalaemia is the preferred route in most intensive care settings, it is associated with known safety risks.

<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Given these risks, IVPR is considered a &#x02018;high-alert medication&#x02019; by the Institute of Safe Medication practice.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Other issues with IVPR are the need for a central line that can lead to central line-related infection due to frequent access of the line during IVPR. Additionally, a larger volume of fluid is required during IVPR for delivery of the desired dose of potassium. This may not be preferred in postsurgical cardiac patients in whom a negative fluid balance is being achieved. Given all the aforementioned issues with IVPR, enteral potassium replacement (EPR), with its superior safety profile, may be a better alternative to IVPR. A retrospective review showed that the efficacy of EPR was comparable to that of IVPR in paediatric patients after congenital heart disease.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>We seek to explore this comparison between EPR and IVPR in a randomised prospective trial.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the efficacy of IVPR and EPR during an episode of hypokalaemia.</p><p>Alternate Hypothesis: There is a mean difference of 15% in the change in serum potassium levels between the two groups, that is, IVPR and EPR during an episode of hypokalaemia.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome: To compare the efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalaemia (measured as a change in serum potassium levels in mEq/L after potassium replacement).</p><sec id="s1b1"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Comparison of adverse effects after EPR and IVPR.

In case the child develops hypokalaemia, that is, serum potassium &#x0003c;4.4, the child will be followed till he/she reaches optimal potassium levels. This will be considered as a single episode. As long as the patient is in the PCICU, potassium monitoring will be continued as per the PCICU protocol and the patient will be recruited for the study in case he develops further episodes of hypokalaemia.

An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to account for cross-over patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Study procedure and monitoring</title><p>All postoperative patients in the PCICU are closely monitored using pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiography, invasive or non-invasive blood pressures. Potassium supplementation as part of this trial will only be carried out in the PCICU under the aforementioned monitoring. As per the PCICU protocol, a 1&#x02005;mL blood sample from an already placed art-line or central venous line is sent for analysis of serum potassium concentration in all the immediate postoperative patients. Potassium concentration will be assayed by means of auto analysers. The central lab will not be utilised to check the potassium level as the turnaround time for the lab values is &#x0223c;3&#x02013;4&#x02005;h in our institution. The point of care values are routinely used to treat hypokalaemia. Central lab values will be obtained on a daily basis or when a critically low or high value is seen on the auto analyser testing. Replacement of potassium based on the randomised group will be made either enterally (nasogastric tube or orally) or intravenously. A nasogastric feeding tube is regularly placed in our mechanically ventilated and sedated paediatric patients. These tubes were used to administer oral potassium supplementation in these patients. In the IVPR group, potassium will be given through a central line. As per a previously established protocol and bioavailability data, repeat serum potassium will be sent 1&#x02005;h after replacement in the IVPR group and 2&#x02005;h after replacement in the EPR group. Replacement and serum level monitoring will be performed till the episode of hypokalaemia is resolved. Further patient serum electrolyte monitoring will be determined by the patient's clinical status. No additional blood sample or monitoring will be performed as part of this trial and all such tests will be determined and dictated by the patient's clinical status, management plan and PCICU protocols.</p><p>An informal data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be in place in the PCICU. The PCICU nurse manager and PCICU attending, not part of the trial, will be a part of this board.

The average of the percentages of monthly mortality in the past three years (2010:7.8%; 2011:5.2%; 2012:8.2%) is 7.1%.
