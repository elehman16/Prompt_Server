body fat or &#x02265;80&#x02005;cm waist circumference), resulting in detrimental health effects<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The high incidence of female obesity, which
may be strongly related to increased health problems and decreased life expectancy, should
be given great consideration with respect to the promotion of personal general health
attitudes and habits<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In women, obesity aggravates physical conditions and contributes to
psychological issues<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, which are influenced by negative perceptions and biased thinking
about body shape<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Specific solutions for reducing abdominal obesity include correct dietary habits, regular
exercise, behavior modification, and surgery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the effects of diet and exercise
have been proven by previous studies, it may be difficult for most people to maintain their
regular pattern. For this reason, high-frequency current therapy could be an easily
adaptable and accessible therapeutic method for reducing the degree of abdominal obesity.
High-frequency current therapy uses an alternating current of &#x02265;100,000&#x02005;Hz that converts
electrical oscillation energy into thermal energy during application<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In high-frequency current therapy, shortened conduction
time with a pulse duration of 0.001 milliseconds causes intense heating effects in a local
region without stimulating sensory and motor nerves, facilitating the body&#x02019;s consumption of
fat<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To our knowledge, the use of high-frequency current therapy has been given little attention
in managing obesity, and its efficacy is controversial. Some previous studies have failed to
provide evidence for the effectiveness of high-frequency current therapy in women with
obesity<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas more recent studies
have indicated that a high-frequency current therapy decreases female abdominal obesity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, the present study aimed to determine whether
high-frequency current therapy can be effectively used to reduce female abdominal
obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-two female volunteers were enrolled in this study. They were randomly allocated to
either the experimental group (EG) (<italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> = 12; age, 21.17 &#x000b1;
0.72&#x02005;years; weight, 63.17 &#x000b1; 7.91&#x02005;kg; height, 159.63 &#x000b1; 4.56&#x02005;cm) or the control group (CG)
(<italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10; age, 21.10 &#x000b1; 0.74&#x02005;years; weight, 68.79 &#x000b1; 11.73&#x02005;kg;
height, 161.69 &#x000b1; 5.25&#x02005;cm). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a body mass index (BMI)
of &#x02265;23&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a waist-hip circumference ratio of &#x02265;0.80<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>; (2) no past or present neurological, musculoskeletal, or
cardiopulmonary disorders that would have affected health condition; (3) no smoking and
drinking habits; and (4) no psychological problems. Pregnant women were excluded. At the
early stage of the experimental procedure, the total cohort comprised 30 subjects (15 per
group); however, 8 subjects (EG, 3; CG, 5) were dropped from the final analysis because of
failures with dietary control and a drinking habit. Before the initiation of this study, a
detailed description of the experimental procedures and their safety was given to all the
subjects, who then provided their written informed consent. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Cheongju University.</p><p>Randomized group allocation was determined by blindly drawing a card from an envelope
containing 1- or 2-marked cards. Measurements included waist circumference (WC), BMI, and
body composition (i.e., abdominal obesity rate [AOR], subcutaneous fat mass [SFM], and body
fat percentage [BFP]) and were performed before and after the 6-week intervention. All
measurements were taken three times and averaged. WC was measured during full exhalation
while the subject stood with her legs shoulder width apart. The tape measure had an accuracy
of 0.1&#x02005;cm and was placed around the waist in a line across the ends of the 12th rib of both
sides. The BMI was measured using an anthropometer (Dectro 6437DHR; Scales Galore, Brooklyn,
NY, USA) while in a standing position. Bioelectrical impedance analysis equipment with a
ground plate, 2 electrode grips, connection cables, and a display monitor (InBody 520;
Biospace, Seoul, South Korea) was used to analyze body composition data. Measurements were
taken in the standing position while positioning the foot on the footmark of the ground
plate and grasping the electrode grips.</p><p>The subjects of both groups were asked to keep a regular dietary habit during the
experimental process. A nutritionist drew up a diet plan of 2,000 to 2,500&#x02005;kcal/day across 3
meals (8 a.m., 1 p.m., and 6 p.m.) for the 6-week intervention. In addition, subjects were
asked to avoid extra activities and exercises beyond daily routine activities. For EG
subjects, high-frequency current therapy, with a frequency of 0.5 Mhz, was performed on the
abdominal region while subjects were supine using specific equipment (CWM-9200; Chungwoo
Medical, Seoul, South Korea) for 60 minutes, 3 times per week, for 6 weeks (a total of 18
sessions). High-frequency current therapy was performed in 2 phases: 2 sets of 15-minute
applications of capacitive electric transfer (CET) and resistive electric transfer (RET)
with the pulsed current option (current conduction time, 0.7 seconds; rest interval, 0.3
seconds) for the first 3 weeks, followed by a 30-minute application of the CET and RET modes
with continuous current conduction in the final 3 weeks. The intensity was individualized
within a range of 6&#x02013;7 mA to comfortably adjust the heating sensation during the
intervention. An insulated electrode and a stainless steel electrode (8&#x02005;cm in diameter) were
used for the CET and RET modes, respectively. Conductive gel (Body Rubbing Cream; SA&#x02019;COS,
Incheon, South Korea) was used to facilitate skin moisture and current conduction, and
high-frequency current therapy was delivered by making circular motions of the electrode
over the abdominal region at a moving speed of 5&#x02005;cm/s, avoiding focused pressure on
therapeutic areas.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 12.0 (IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) statistical
software. All values are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. A two-by-two analysis of
variance with one within-subject factor (pretest versus posttest) and one between-subject
factor (EG versus CG) was used to determine the main effects and interaction for each
variable. Significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Comparisons of the extent of abdominal obesity before and after the high-frequency current

changing trends of WC, AOR, SFM, and BFP between pretest and posttest differed significantly
between the groups, suggesting the effects of high-frequency current therapy in decreasing
obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study investigated whether the use of high-frequency current therapy is helpful for
lessening the amount of abdominal obesity in young women. Our findings support the use of
high-frequency current therapy to diminish abdominal obesity.</p><p>In general, most clinicians have used high-frequency current therapy to achieve beneficial
changes derived from its heating effects. The basic mechanism underlying high-frequency
current therapy relies on the principles of energy conversion. High-frequency current causes
the repeated oscillation of molecular structures, and thereby, the molecular friction
produces local heating of subcutaneous tissues<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, leading to beneficial effects in surrounding tissues. This
mechanism may also be behind the decreases we observed in obesity levels. Increased
temperature in local tissues causes the dilatation of subcutaneous vessels, facilitating the
lipolytic process<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis of these concepts, Manuskiatti et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and Sadick and Margo<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that high-frequency current therapy contributes
to the removal of cellulite or fine fat particles, which would result in a reduction in
waist and thigh circumference. Additionally, An<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a high-frequency current of 0.5&#x02005;MHz was effectively
used to reduce obesity levels, and Song et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> supported the selective use of high-frequency current therapy to
control fat levels in a local region. These studies yielded findings similar to those of the
present study.</p><p>However, as found in this study, BMI did not show a significant difference between the
groups. In general, high-frequency current therapy is easily accessible for subjects. Given
that the decomposition of visceral fat can be facilitated when the insulin concentration is
lowered by active exercise, the lack of active muscle effort may be disadvantageous for the
decrease of visceral fat. For this reason, regular exercise should be among the first
choices for controling the obesity level<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taken together, the present findings suggest that high-frequency
current therapy may be a beneficial option to be used together with active exercise for
reducing the obesity level.</p><p>Notwithstanding the positive effects of the high-frequency current therapy for abdominal
obesity, this study had several limitations that should be addressed in future studies.
First, the small sample size is a major limiting factor in the generalization of the results
to the entire population. Second, the study did not include analytic data from blood tests
showing the lipolytic components of subcutaneous fat. Finally, we controlled the subjects&#x02019;
dietary habits and activity levels during the experimental process; however, in some cases,
it might have been difficult for the subjects to strictly adhere to the diet regime, and
this may have influenced the results. Further studies are planned.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Haslam</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Obesity</article-title>. <source>Lancet</source>,
