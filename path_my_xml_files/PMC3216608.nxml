However, the mechanisms behind these relationships are not well understood. In order to investigate the neural basis underlying relationships between WM skill learning and sleep, DCS, and both sleep and DCS together, we evaluated training-retest performances in the <italic>n</italic>-back task among healthy subjects who were given either a placebo or DCS before the task training, and then followed task training sessions either with wakefulness or sleep. DCS facilitated WM capacity enhancement only occurring after a period of wakefulness, rather than sleep, indicating that WM capacity enhancement is affected by a cellular heterogeneity in synaptic plasticity between time spent awake and time spent asleep.

Administration of NMDA receptor antagonists can prohibit long-term synaptic potentiation, thus preventing skill-learning practice from translating into successful skill acquisition in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. On the other hand, the administration of NMDA receptor agonists enhances skill-learning in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, including humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. NMDA receptor-dependent glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to the formation of long-term memory, not only within the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> but also within the PFC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Thus, it is likely that NMDA receptor agonists enhance WM capacity improvements via enhancing NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the PFC. An evidence suggesting that downregulation of NMDA receptors results in decreased spatial WM performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> could also paradoxically support the notion.</p><p>In the current study, we explored delayed skill learning properties by using the <italic>n-</italic>back task<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> to examine the effect of an NMDA partial agonist, <sc>D</sc>-cycloserine (DCS), on WM capacity improvement. DCS acts at the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of NMDA glutamate receptors.

Further, we also examined whether DCS interacted with sleep-dependent WM capacity improvement.

These findings suggest that DCS does not facilitate sleep-dependent skill consolidation, but, rather, skill consolidation during wakefulness.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>First of all, any sex effects on vigilance levels, sleep lengths, WM performances, DCS effects, and interactions between WM performance and DCS effect were not observed in the current study.</p><p>A definite improvement in WM capacity was observed within 2 trials during the training session; subjects had almost reached a performance plateau by the third <italic>n</italic>-back trial. Initial acquisition of WM skill performance was not facilitated by DCS. Onur <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that DCS does not facilitate immediate learning despite potentially accelerating hippocampal activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Thus, DCS may enhance the encoding process and accelerate delayed, rather than immediate, learning.</p><p>Medication and sleep quality did not significantly affect psychomotor vigilance levels in the different treatment groups; however, we did observe various group differences in the improvement of <italic>n</italic>-back accuracy levels across training-retest sessions. Differences in groups A (0.79%) and B (1.88%) in the improvement of <italic>n</italic>-back accuracy level clearly indicate that DCS facilitates the improvement of WM capacity during a 24-h post-training interval. Additionally, differences in accuracy improvements among groups C-F (C: 0.71%, D: 0.23%, E: 0.47%, F: 0.69%) suggest that DCS had higher efficacy when followed by wakefulness than when followed by sleep. Although there is no evidence that DCS affects sleep architecture, our results clearly indicate that WM capacity improvement facilitated by DCS was not achieved via sleep modulation.</p><p>A comparison of groups B and E does not immediately explain why the 24-h effect should emerge during the second 12&#x02005;h of wakefulness, since DCS is probably no longer fully active during this period. We need to compare the results of the 2 experimental groups in which subjects first stayed awake and then slept during the diurnal (24&#x02005;h) experimental schedule with DCS or placebo administration with those of the current study. These experimental groups would greatly establish our claims, however, we previously confirmed that overnight improvements in WM capacity were observed regardless of whether time awake or time asleep occurred first<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that DCS potentially affects the skill acquisition process, with delayed onset of action only occurring after a period of wakefulness, rather than sleep. The remaining question is whether the DCS interacts with sleep to have an impact on WM capacity. The results from groups C&#x02013;F suggest that it does not. The largest improvement, observed after 24&#x02005;h in group B, may result from simple integration of separate delayed improvements from the sleep-dependent skill consolidation process (robustly reflected in group C) and the DCS-facilitated skill consolidation process (robustly reflected in group F).</p><p>The other limitation remained that although DCS does not directly facilitate immediate learning of the WM skill, there is debate over whether DCS facilitates the consolidation process of the WM skill or merely facilitates delayed performance of the WM skill. Especially in semidiurnal experimental groups, DCS could act to even retest performances due to the long half-life of DCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. If WM skill performance per se is facilitated by current enhancement of DCS binding activity of the NMDA receptor, initial training performances could be much enhanced and retest performances of the diurnal experimental groups could be less enhanced than retest performances of the semidiurnal experimental groups. Therefore, the current results suggest that DCS acts within the neuroplastic process during the delayed consolidation process that occurs in wakefulness.</p><p>Heterogenous neuroplastic processes seem to develop with WM capacity improvement during both sleep and wakefulness. During wakefulness, WM capacity improvement may have resulted from a delayed memory consolidation process driven by the cellular mechanism of long-term potentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, which could be facilitated by an NMDA agonist. However, during the sleep period, there may have been an additional delayed learning process dependent not on a given cellular long-term potentiation mechanism but on a novel mechanism by which neuroplasticity contributes to skill consolidation. A likely explanation is that sleep-dependent skill consolidation is generated via a reassembly of the cortical networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and may be independent of the synaptic-level consolidation process associated with NMDA receptor-dependent neuroplasticity. Changes in cortical activity have been observed in response to 5 weeks of WM training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These include increases in activity in the middle frontal gyrus and superior and inferior parietal cortices, which may be consequences of the reorganization of reassembly activation patterns in the connections of both intracellular<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and intracortical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> levels. Delayed learning processes during sleep and wakefulness possibly share these roles in consolidating skill over an extended period of time. Although these neuronal reorganizations in 2 different levels may not be mutually exclusive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, our results suggest the neuronal reorganization of intracellular level predominantly occurs during wakefulness while that of the intracortical level predominantly occurs during sleep. Thus, DCS is able to enhance only the neuronal reorganization of intracellular level during wakefulness. Additionally, a previous study investigating motor skill improvement suggested that qualitatively different aspects of delayed learning resulted from intervals of sleep versus wakefulness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. A similar process may occur during WM capacity improvement.</p><p>MK-801 (dizocilpine), an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, has been shown to impair the consolidation of spatial WM skill learning across several days in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. On the other hand, another NMDA antagonist, amantadine, is not known to impair simple motor skill consolidation in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However, when administered to human subjects, the NMDA antagonists caroverine and ketamine prevent delayed consolidation of visual procedural skill learning during sleep without affecting sleep architecture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. These findings seem to be restricted to each skill domain. However, when they are considered together with our current results, they suggest that the activity of the glutaminergic synapses during sleep and wakefulness could play complementary roles for skill consolidation; specifically, while consolidation of skill (including WM capacity) may occur predominantly during sleep, this process may not proceed during wakefulness until exposure to a glutaminergic receptor stimulant, such as the NMDA agonist DCS.</p><p>The prefrontal cortex is regarded as the central structure of WM processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, and is known to play a crucial role in enhancing WM performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Incremental improvements in activities of the middle frontal gyrus and superior and inferior parietal cortices by repetitive WM training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> are less specific to various stimuli that drive cognitive performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Further, repetitive training on a spatial <italic>n</italic>-back task improves not only spatial <italic>n</italic>-back performance but also auditory <italic>n</italic>-back performance, enhancing the development of general fluid intelligence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Given that WM capacity is an important factor in a wide range of cognitive abilities, including fluid intelligence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and regulation of emotions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, it is likely that the administration of NMDA agonists with WM training could facilitate potential cognitive ability by boosting the available capacity of prefrontal learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.</p><p>Although we instructed study participants to keep regular sleep-wake habits, it is possible that our results were confounded by differences in pre- or post-training sleep patterns or by potential circadian effects. However, both pre- and post-training sleep durations were similar across groups. Thus, we believe that our findings accurately reflect sleep- and wakefulness-related neural processes associated with skill learning and may therefore be helpful for developing techniques for strengthening the cognitive abilities of children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> and preventing specific cognitive decrements with aging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.

Subjects had no previous history of drug or alcohol abuse or of neurological, psychiatric, or sleep disorders, and maintained a constant sleep schedule validated by self-recorded sleep-logs. They were instructed to be drug-, alcohol-, and caffeine-free for 24&#x02005;h before and during the study period. Women in the follicular phase of their regular menstrual cycles were included in the study. All study procedures followed the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the Intramural Research Board of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>Randomized, blind, placebo-controlled procedures were applied for diurnal and semidiurnal group partition tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Random allocation of subjects to 6 different groups (groups A&#x02013;F) eliminated biases for age (F<sub>5,82</sub>  =  1.37, <italic>p</italic>  =  0.24) and sex (<italic>&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></italic>  =  2.35, <italic>p</italic>  =  0.799). Nineteen subjects were initially recruited, but 2 women were omitted because they had irregular menstrual cycles. Subjects in groups A and B were assigned to a diurnal experimental schedule, which consisted of an initial training session and a retest session. Subjects in groups C&#x02013;F were placed on semidiurnal experimental schedules, some of which (C, E) included a sleep period, and some of which (D, F) did not. We examined the general effect of DCS on the improvement of WM capacity across 24&#x02005;h by comparing groups A and B. Moreover, to examine whether DCS affects WM capacity by interacting with sleep, we compared groups C&#x02013;F.</p><p>During each test session, subjects performed a spatial <italic>n</italic>-back WM task (<italic>n</italic>  =  1&#x02013;7). All post-sleep retests were performed at least 1&#x02005;h after awakening to avoid the effect of sleep inertia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Each subject had a sequence of task rehearsals (<italic>n</italic>  =  0&#x02013;2) prior to receiving medication. Medication (100&#x02005;mg of either encapsulated DCS or a lactose placebo) was administered on an empty stomach 2&#x02005;h prior to the training session. Subjects were not able to judge whether they received DCS or placebo. Given that the time course of the plasma concentration and the plasma half-life for DCS are within 1h and 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;h, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, this timing ensured that subjects' performances (including potential delayed learning) would be affected by the drug. DCS was administered to subjects in groups B (21.1 &#x000b1; 0.34 years old; 8 females and 8 males), D (21.5 &#x000b1; 0.43 years old; 4 females and 9 males), and F (21.0 &#x000b1; 0.26 years old; 7 females and 9 males).

The <italic>n</italic>-back WM task had 7 increasing levels of difficulty (<italic>n</italic>  =  1&#x02013;7). Four large dots presented in a single horizontal row were displayed on a computer screen, indicating the 4 possible places where a stimulus could appear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The stimulus consisted of 1 of 4 dots changing color. Subjects were instructed to respond to the stimulus by using their right fingers to push 1 of 4 spatially corresponding buttons on a response box as quickly and as accurately as possible before the next stimulus appeared. Responses were to be made after a delay of <italic>n</italic> (load level) stimuli.</p><p>At each training or retest session, subjects performed 3 trials separated by 60,000&#x02005;ms of inter-trial intervals. Each trial consisted of 7 load levels. The different load levels, which were shown before stimulation began, ran in a block of 20 + <italic>n</italic> stimuli each; thus, 20 responses were obtained at each load level. Each stimulus was displayed in a randomized order for 1500&#x02005;ms with 500&#x02005;ms of inter-stimulus interval; thus, each block lasted a total of 42,500&#x02013;54,500&#x02005;ms. Subjects completed all 7 load levels in ascending order of difficulty at 15,000&#x02005;ms intervals in each trial, and repeated this sequence 3 times (trials) during each session. Performance was evaluated using the average percentage of correct responses (accuracy) at each load level. The detection threshold for a given session was defined as the maximum <italic>n</italic>-back accuracy level at which the subject's accuracy exceeded at least 80%. The maximum <italic>n</italic>-back accuracy level in the third trial was used to indicate the current WM capacity in each session.</p><p>At each training and retesting point, all subjects performed a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), which is a measure of the psychomotor vigilance level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The PVT involved pressing a button in response to the presentation of a stimulus (a red dot) on a computer screen. Several stimuli were randomly presented for 2000&#x02013;10,000&#x02005;s during a 5-min period, which resulted in a total of 30&#x02013;45 responses. By measuring the simple response time (SRT), we could count the number of lapses (response time &#x02265; 500&#x02005;ms), which were indicative of sleepiness, fatigue, and drug-induced impairments. A subjective questionnaire was also utilized to determine whether, and what type, of psychomotor side effects were caused by the DCS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistics</title><p>Three-way factorial ANOVAs were applied to detect the effects of group (A&#x02013;B), session (training-retest), and sex (women or men) on PVT performances.

Each group underwent a specific schedule consisting of an initial training session and a retest session. Subjects were administered encapsulated DCS (groups B, E, and F) or a placebo (groups A, C, and D) on an empty stomach 1.5&#x02005;h prior to the training session. Subjects in groups A and B were placed on a diurnal experimental schedule, in which they were trained at 20:00&#x02005;h and were then retested at 20:00&#x02005;h the next day (e.g., 24&#x02005;h later). Subjects in groups C&#x02013;F were placed on a semidiurnal experimental schedule. Individuals in groups C and E were trained at 20:00&#x02005;h and were retested at 08:00&#x02005;h the following day (e.g., 12&#x02005;h later) after a night of sleep. Individuals in groups D and F were trained at 08:00&#x02005;h and were retested at 20:00&#x02005;h after 12&#x02005;h of wakefulness. All subjects performed spatial <italic>n</italic>-back WM tasks (<italic>n</italic>  =  1&#x02013;7) during each test session.
