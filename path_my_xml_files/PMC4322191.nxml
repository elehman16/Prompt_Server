Compared with MF, treatment with QMF149 demonstrated a trend towards reducing the risk of serious asthma exacerbations, and a significant reduction of 29% in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. QMF149 also resulted in significant improvements in lung function, asthma symptoms and asthma control.</p><p>In this study, the HR for the risk of serious exacerbations was numerically in favour of QMF149 but was not significant (0.31; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.54, p=0.151). Based on the Wolfe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> study and event rates in the FDA LABA safety meta-analysis,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> it was predicted that the sample size of 1500 patients would result in 20 serious asthma exacerbations during this study, thereby providing 80% power to detect a threefold increase in HR with QMF149. The numbers of serious asthma exacerbations were lower than predicted in the QMF149 treatment group with a corresponding reduction in power and wider CI. However, the low event rate may be seen as indirect evidence that both treatments are effective in the prevention of serious asthma events.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those from previous studies of currently prescribed LABA/ICS products.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> To date, there has been no evidence that fixed-dose combinations of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or formoterol/budesonide,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> both of which require twice-daily administration, are associated with an increased risk of serious asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admission, intubation or death, compared with ICS therapy. However, the interpretation relating to mortality is limited to some extent by the low statistical power of the available studies for this outcome.</p><p>The primary outcome variable was time to first serious asthma exacerbation resulting in hospital admission, intubation or mortality, based on that mandated by the FDA in a series of related randomised controlled trials of LABA/ICS products currently used in the treatment of asthma.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The use of this outcome variable recognises that it is difficult to assess mortality alone as a primary outcome variable in clinical trials of asthma, largely owing to its rarity, even in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. This is well illustrated by an independent analysis of a salmeterol database, in which there were no deaths or intubations among more than 22&#x02005;000 subjects in the 63 studies of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The outcome's rationale is also based on the observation that an increased risk in hospital admission tracks with mortality risk in studies of LABA therapy and, as a result, hospital admissions can be considered an acceptable surrogate for risk of mortality.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>A further clinically important outcome was the time to first asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids. There was a clear difference between treatment groups for this end point with 17% of QMF149 patients experiencing exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids compared with 23% receiving MF. Overall, there was a 30% reduction in risk in the time to first exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids in patients receiving QMF149 compared with MF. Similarly, asthma reported as an AE (defined as asthma worsening and/or asthma exacerbation) occurred more frequently in the MF treatment group (36%) compared with the QMF149 treatment group (26%).</p><p>Lung function, assessed as change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, showed statistically significant treatment differences in favour of QMF149, ranging between 0.10&#x02005;L and 0.14&#x02005;L throughout the study period. These differences between two active treatments are within the range considered to be clinically relevant for treatments compared with placebo.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This demonstrated persistence of efficacy during the treatment period, with no evidence of bronchodilator tolerance.</p><p>Other secondary efficacy variables such as symptom-free days (morning, daytime and night-time) and rescue medication use showed statistically significant treatment differences in favour of QMF149 throughout the study. Such improvements over MF are consistent with those demonstrated with other LABA/ICS combination therapies compared with ICS used as monotherapy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Improvements in asthma control as measured with the ACQ-7 were consistently statistically significantly higher with QMF149 compared with MF. QMF149 achieved an overall improvement of &#x02212;0.49 from baseline, which is considered clinically relevant.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Clinically relevant improvements were not demonstrated in the MF treatment group.</p><p>QMF149 is comprised of two molecules with established efficacy and safety profiles. The indacaterol maleate dose, selected from dose ranging studies in asthma, results in rapid onset bronchodilation that is maintained for at least 24&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Once-daily dosing is established as an effective regimen for MF.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The use of a once-daily evening dose of 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g was based on a clinical trial programme, which demonstrated that 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g is near the top of the therapeutic dose-response curve in persistent asthma,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> that once-daily was as efficacious as twice-daily dosing<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and that evening may be superior to morning dosing.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The choice of MF as the ICS component was also based on its favourable efficacy/safety profile.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus, indacaterol maleate and MF have established efficacy when used once daily in the evening. It is possible that once-daily dosing of LABA/ICS products may lead to improved compliance<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and, thereby, efficacy compared with twice-daily regimens; however, this issue requires further study.</p><p>While the assessment of safety was based primarily on serious asthma exacerbations and exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, the trial was of sufficient duration to assess the overall safety profile of QMF149, and AEs were recorded rigorously throughout the study. In general, the incidence of AEs was similar across the treatment groups with the exception of asthma and cough. The higher incidence of cough in the QMF149 treatment group was likely due to the use of the maleate salt of indacaterol in this study. A study comparing the maleate with the acetate salt of indacaterol showed that indacaterol acetate is associated with a lower incidence of cough with no impact on the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of treatment (Novartis data on file, 2012). Future studies of QMF149 will use indacaterol acetate rather than indacaterol maleate.</p><p>In addition, based on systemic exposure comparisons for indacaterol<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and MF,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> QMF149 will be delivered via the Breezhaler device in future development, rather than the Twisthaler device marketed for MF. QMF149 delivered via the Breezhaler device is currently being evaluated as a fixed-dose combination, where a dose of indacaterol acetate 150&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/MF 160&#x02005;&#x000b5;g is comparable to indacaterol maleate 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/MF 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;g delivered via the Twisthaler device. Thus, since QMF149 150&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/160&#x02005;&#x003bc;g via the Breezhaler device with the acetate salt is expected to be clinically comparable to QMF149 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/400&#x02005;&#x003bc;g with the maleate salt via the Twisthaler device, the current study provides important data to support the safety and efficacy profile of the final product.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has shown a favourable safety/efficacy profile of QMF149 in the treatment of persistent asthma. Improvements in lung function, symptom control and rescue medication use, and reductions in risk in time to first exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, and in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, were all significantly in favour of treatment with QMF149. QMF149 treatment was also associated with a numerical, but not significant, reduction in the risk of serious asthma exacerbations. QMF149 may be a useful treatment option in adolescents and adults with asthma who qualify for treatment with a LABA/ICS combination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e247" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006131.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e249" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006131.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Jennifer Li (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) who provided additional statistical analysis and contributed to data interpretation, Motoi Hosoe (Novartis Pharma AG) who contributed to data interpretation and Mary Sayers, a professional medical writer contracted to CircleScience, an Ashfield Company, part of UDG Healthcare plc who assisted the authors in the preparation of the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RM was a principal investigator directly involved in the recruitment and care of the participants, and in data collection.
