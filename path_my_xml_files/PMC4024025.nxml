The standard titre measles vaccine (MV) seems to reduce all-cause child mortality considerably more than can be explained by prevention of measles infection. This non-specific beneficial effect of MV has been most pronounced in females <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Since the high child mortality in low-income countries is mainly caused by infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0097536-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, it is plausible that MV modulates the child&#x02019;s immune system to reduce susceptibility to unrelated infections.</p><p>Only very few studies have addressed the immunological background for the non-specific effects of MV. One study indicated that the non-measles specific cellular responses may transiently decrease within the first few weeks after MV <xref rid="pone.0097536-Ovsyannikova1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, whereas another study reported higher Th1 cytokine responses and differentially expressed cellular activation markers 6 weeks after MV <xref rid="pone.0097536-Schnorr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the possible immunological background for the sex-differential non-specific effects of MV still remains to be studied.</p><p>We conducted a randomised trial of early MV at 4.5 months of age at the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau. The primary outcome of the main trial was mortality <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Overall, in the per-protocol analysis early MV was associated with an all-cause mortality rate ratio (MRR (95% confidence interval)) of 0.71 (0.50&#x02013;1.00), strongest in females. Unexpectedly, the main trial found a significant interaction between early MV and neonatal vitamin A supplementation. Between 4.5 and 9 months of age where the trial compared measles vaccinated versus controls who had all three diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations (DTP3) as their most recent vaccination, the overall MRR between 4.5 and 9 months of age was 0.33 (0.13&#x02013;0.86) for children who had not received vitamin A, whereas there was no effect of MV for children who had received vitamin A <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Within the randomised trial we conducted a nested immunological subgroup study to investigate the overall and sex-specific effects of early MV on the responses of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17 to <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with innate agonists and recall antigens, and the plasma levels of IL-8, IL-1 Receptor antagonist (Ra), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, IL-6 and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels. We also investigated the potential modifying effect of vitamin A on the response to MV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097536.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097536.s003">Protocol S1</xref>. The main trial has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Briefly, 6,648 children who had received all three scheduled doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines were randomised at 4.5 months of age to receive an early MV (arm 1, one third of the children) or to follow the recommended vaccination schedule with MV at 9 months of age (arm 2+3, two thirds of the children). Children vaccinated at 4.5 months were re-vaccinated at 9 months of age. The vaccine used was a standard titre Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India, batch number 2360).</p><p>According to the national childhood vaccination program, normal healthy infants received oral polio vaccine at birth, 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age; BCG at birth; DTP at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Information about vaccines was recorded on a personal health card that was seen at regular visits by our field team.</p><p>At the time of the MV trial a vitamin-A-at-birth trial was on-going, where children were randomised to receive 25,000 IU vitamin A, 50,000 IU vitamin A, or placebo at birth.</p><p>The immunological subgroup study aimed to include 400 children between January and September 2006. During this period all children randomised to receive the early MV at 4.5 months of age (arm 1) and half of the children who did not receive early measles vaccine before 9 months (arm 2+3, randomly selected by block randomisation with 24 envelopes per bag) were invited to participate in the present immunological sub-study.</p><p>We had some minor deviations including 1) during the first 2 weeks of the study all children from arm 2+3 were enrolled; 2) a few children from arm 2+3 were erroneously bled in spite of randomisation to no blood sampling; 3) during short intermittent periods we did not invite all children due to limited capacity.</p><p>Children were eligible for inclusion into the immunological study until 6 months of age. Informed consent was obtained from the mother of the child by signature or fingerprint if the mother was illiterate. If the mother was not alive, the informed consent was obtained from the guardian of the child, which by tradition in Bissau usually is the grandmother. Provided written informed consent the children were assessed for enrolment. The weight, length and mid-upper-arm-circumference were measured. An axillary temperature was obtained and the mother was interviewed regarding background factors and current symptoms of her child by a field assistant. A physician examined the children. To avoid that acute illness influenced plasma biomarkers and stimulated cytokine production, children with the following characteristics were excluded from the immunological study even if they were included in the main trial: current fever or diarrhoea reported by the mother; an axillary temperature above 37.5&#x000b0;C; a respiratory rate at 60/minute or above; or current infection diagnosed by the physician.</p><p>A few children in each group were erroneously bled even though they fulfilled the exclusion criteria, because the lab technician overlooked that the symptom had been noted. We analysed all obtained blood samples for plasma biomarkers, irrespective of the child presenting with symptoms at baseline. For the analysis of the <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine production, however, we adhered to the exclusion criteria.</p><p>All children were invited back for a post-vaccination blood sample 6 weeks later. A six-week time-span between vaccination and follow-up was chosen to minimize the impact of acute direct effects of the vaccine since we attempted to study the non-specific effects of the vaccine. If not presenting at the follow-up, children were called once a week until 10 weeks post-inclusion. At follow-up a similar examination was performed, this time not excluding anyone.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Blood Sampling</title><p>Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at follow-up 6 weeks later from January 31 through October 31, 2006. Due to problems with obtaining venous blood samples and observed differences in cytokine levels between venous and capillary blood samples <xref rid="pone.0097536-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the present study only included children from whom we had a capillary sample. Prior to bleeding, the skin was wiped with an antiseptic swab. Capillary blood was obtained by finger-prick into an EDTA-coated tube and a heparinised tube, respectively. The EDTA-coated tube was kept cold until plasma separation, whereas the heparinised tube was kept at ambient temperature until stimulation. Maximum time span from bleeding to blood processing in the laboratory was 3 hours. The EDTA blood was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 minutes, and the retrieved plasma was stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. For all children a blood film was microscopically inspected for malaria parasitemia; no child had parasitemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Full Blood Cultures</title><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation assay was performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0097536-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> with minor modifications in respect to the stimulation panel. Briefly, heparinised blood was diluted 1&#x02236;10 with supplemented RPMI-1640 medium. Stimulations were LPS (1 ng/ml) [a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist], (S)-(2, 3-bis (palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl)-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-(S)-Lys4-OH, trihydrochloride (PAM3Cys) (100 ng/ml, Cayla-InvivoGen Europe, Toulouse, France) [a TLR1-2 agonist], phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) [a T cell mitogen], purified protein derivative (PPD) of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) and tetanus toxoid (TT) (1.5 Lf/ml). Since the children were BCG and DTP vaccinated prior to enrolment, stimulation with PPD and TT were expected to trigger a recall response, PHA non-specifically elicits T cell proliferative responses, while stimulations with LPS and PAM trigger the innate response via TLR-4 and TLR-1/2, respectively. Supernatants were harvested after 24 hours for LPS and after 72 hours for PHA, PPD, TT and PAM. The supernatants were stored at minus 80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measurement of Biomarkers</title><p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> samples and plasma samples were analysed in Leiden, The Netherlands and Copenhagen, Denmark, respectively, both on the Luminex platform (Luminex 100, Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA). The <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation assay was slightly modified from a previous study <xref rid="pone.0097536-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, with the following analytes (lower limit of detection (LLD) given in parenthesis): TNF-&#x003b1; (10 pg/ml), IFN-&#x003b3; (5 pg/ml), IL-5 (3 pg/ml), IL-10, IL-13 (10 pg/ml) and IL-17 (10 pg/ml) (BioSource, Camarillo, CA, USA). In plasma, TNF-&#x003b1; (5 pg/ml), IL-10 (5 pg/ml), IL-6 (7 pg/ml), MCP-1 (10 pg/ml), IL-8 (2.8 pg/ml), IL-1Ra (30 pg/ml) were measured (Fluorokine MAP Multiplex Human Cytokine Panel A, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Concentrations of suPAR (0.1 ng/ml), a marker of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0097536-Ostrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, were measured from plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (suPARnostic, ViroGates, Birker&#x000f8;d, Denmark). Measurements below the LLD were referred to as non-detectable (ND). Baseline and follow-up samples from each child were measured on the same assay plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The study was the first of its kind, making power calculations difficult. Our study was explorative and was performed to generate hypotheses rather than to test a specific hypotheses. Biomolecule distributions were summarized by geometric means (GM) and compared between the two randomization groups by geometric mean ratios (GMR). GMRs were obtained as anti-logged coefficients from linear regression on the log-concentrations. For several of the biomarkers a proportion of measurements were below the LLD of the assay. Censoring from these non-detectable (ND) measurements was handled by multiple imputations (MI) <xref rid="pone.0097536-Uh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097536-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> using <italic>mi impute chained</italic> combined with <italic>intreg</italic>. A burn-in of 5 iterations was used before 20 imputations were drawn. The final estimates were obtained from the imputed datasets by <italic>mi estimate</italic>. For distributions with &#x0003e;50% ND measurements, the proportion of detectable samples (&#x0003e;LDD) were analysed by Poisson regression resulting in proportion ratios (PR). GMRs and PRs were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A GMR or PR &#x0003e;1 may be interpreted as a positive MV effect while a GMR or PR &#x0003c;1 represents a negative MV effect.</p><p>Measurements of IL-13, IL-17 and IL-5 after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation were non-normally distributed with left-skewed tails. To analyse these outcome with an alternative model to MI and Poisson regression, a non-parametric median regression analysis was performed on the follow-up sample for the effect of MV.</p><p>For all outcomes the presence of interactions between vaccination and sex was tested. In the light of the mortality findings <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> we performed a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, examining in each sex the effects of MV depending on whether neonatal vitamin A had been given or not.</p><p>To address the potential caveat imposed by multiple comparisons, the p-values for the estimates of the MV effect on the plasma biomarker outcomes were adjusted for multiple test-procedures using the method by Holland <xref rid="pone.0097536-Newson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>All estimates were adjusted for baseline values and series of Luminex measurements.

Although this did not sustain multiple testing adjustment, indications of sex-differential effects of MV were found for plasma IL-8 and IL-1Ra; MV increased levels in females, but not in males. The <italic>post hoc</italic> stratification by vitamin A indicated that vitamin A amplified the MV effect in females, and that vitamin A shifted the effect of MV in a more pro-inflammatory direction. Additionally, stratification by symptoms at the follow-up visit indicated a differential effect of MV, with a generally positive effect of MV on <italic>in vitro</italic> inflammatory cytokine production in asymptomatic infants.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Non-specific Effects of MV</title><p>The randomised trial setting allowed us to study the immunological effect of MV compared with a control group having DTP3 as the most recent vaccination. The biomarkers affected by MV are associated with immunological defence mechanisms. MCP-1 is a chemokine that attracts a range of leukocyte subsets, particularly phagocytes. MCP-1 plays an important role in commencing the defence against bacterial infections <xref rid="pone.0097536-Baggiolini1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097536-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. IL-8 is a potent chemokine attracting neutrophils to the site of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0097536-Eckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. IL-1Ra is an antagonist to the IL-1 receptor, and thus acts as a suppressor of the IL-1 pro-inflammatory signalling cascade <xref rid="pone.0097536-Gabay1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Very few studies have assessed the non-specific immunological effects of MV. One study in Bangladeshi 6 months old infants reported that MV was associated with higher lymphocyte expression of the IL-2 receptor &#x003b1;-chain (CD25) on regulatory and activated T-cells, higher expression of the T-cell activation markers CD69 and CD71, a higher frequency of IFN-&#x003b3; responders, higher levels of IL-2, and a modest increase in IL-10 when measured 6 weeks after MV <xref rid="pone.0097536-Schnorr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, whereas another study in North American one-year-old children suggested a transient positive effect of MV on non-specific cellular Th1 cytokine responses, although this may have waned 6 weeks after MV <xref rid="pone.0097536-Ovsyannikova1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A study in Gambian 3-year-old children found that plasma IL-10, IL-2R&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2; had significantly declined two weeks after a booster MV, whereas resting <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression was not affected <xref rid="pone.0097536-NjieJobe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Sex interactions were not analysed in any of the two former studies, whereas the latter did not find any sex differences in the biomarkers investigated.</p><p>Our results suggest that MV resulted in higher plasma MCP-1 among vaccinated children; however, sex should be taken into account as MV may also increase plasma IL-8 and IL-1Ra in females but not in males. It is still an enigma how the immunomodulation of MV is induced. However, altered immunological responsiveness may be caused by epigenetic reprogramming induced by stimuli, such as vaccines. Epigenetic reprogramming of the innate response pathway has been demonstrated for BCG vaccination <xref rid="pone.0097536-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Hence, epigenetic reprogramming may be involved in the non-specific immunological effects of MV.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Immunomodulation by Vitamin A</title><p>Unexpectedly, the main trial of early MV showed that vitamin A interacted with MV. Compared with children who received placebo at birth, neonatal vitamin A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher mortality in MV-vaccinated between 4.5 months and 9 months, strongest so for males <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Even though the present study was not designed to examine the effect of vitamin A, the results suggest that MV pushed the TNF-&#x003b1;:IL-10 ratio in a pro-inflammatory direction among children who had received neonatal vitamin A. We have previously proposed that vitamin A amplifies the non-specific effects of vaccines <xref rid="pone.0097536-Benn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and we have found that vitamin A at birth is associated with increased female mortality after DTP vaccination <xref rid="pone.0097536-Benn2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097536-Benn3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and vitamin A and DTP vaccination interact on <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine production in a sex-differential manner <xref rid="pone.0097536-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, our data suggest a long-term immunomodulation by neonatal vitamin A supplementation. The effects were sustained at least up to five months after administration.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>A large number of infants enrolled in the main trial were not eligible for the immunological study due to clinical symptoms. Excluding these children, we may have missed the weakest children, who might benefit the most from MV. However, the mortality in the subgroup included in the current study did not differ from the mortality in the main trial.</p><p>Whereas the loss to follow-up was generally low, it was significantly higher among unvaccinated infants than vaccinated infants (10 versus 23, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test). One reason may be that the non-blinded design of the study could have compromised compliance particularly among control infants due to the less immediate benefit of participation in this group.</p><p>Samples were drawn 6 weeks after enrolment to minimize the direct immunological response of the MV. The non-specific effects of MV on mortality persist for years <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097536-Aaby5" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. One previous comparable, though much smaller study suggested that <italic>in vitro</italic> IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-6 responses to a mitogen decreased transiently shortly after MV, then increased to a second peak at 4 weeks followed by another decline to a level below pre-vaccination at 6 weeks <xref rid="pone.0097536-Ovsyannikova1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, a 6-week follow-up has also been used in a previous study to show immunological effects of MV <xref rid="pone.0097536-Schnorr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Some of the outcomes analysed had a significant proportion of measurements below the detection limit of the assay. This was especially true for IL-6 and IL-10 in plasma and IL-17 after <italic>in vitro</italic> PPD stimulation, where up to 80%, 60% and 50%, respectively were undetectable. The lower sensitivity for these cytokines and subsequent lower resolution of the data may have impaired the possibility to measure an effect of MV.</p><p>Analyses were not adjusted for cell subset numbers as leukocyte counts were not performed. The cytokine concentrations may depend on the amount of cells present in the blood sample, which is known to differ between individuals. However, previous studies did not find that MV caused a sustained increase in the number of leukocytes or lymphocytes 6 weeks after vaccination <xref rid="pone.0097536-Schnorr1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097536-RagerZisman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097536-Snopov1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>With its explorative design, the study was not adequately powered to support all the interaction analyses we have performed; some of the results did not sustain after conservative adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, it lends credence to our findings that the effect estimates for MV were all going in the same direction, thus making it less likely that chance mass significance be the mere explanation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found indications that females and males responded immunologically differently to an early measles vaccine at 4.5 month of age, as MV only induced plasma cytokine and receptor changes in females. Previous vitamin A supplementation amplified the pro-inflammatory <italic>in vitro</italic> responses after MV. Albeit the study was explorative and should be interpreted with caution, the study supports the results of epidemiological studies that MV has sex-differential effects on the immune system, and the effect could be modulated by previous vitamin A supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097536.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
