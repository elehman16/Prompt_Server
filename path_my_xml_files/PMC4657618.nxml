An HbA<sub>1c</sub> cutoff of 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) (positive likelihood ratio [PLR] 3.7) was identified that optimally distinguished the groups; sex-specific cutoffs were 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) for females (PLR 4.4) and 5.6% (38 mmol/mol) for males (PLR 2.1).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Identifying youth with type 2 diabetes at risk for rapid loss of glycemic control would allow more targeted therapy.

Among the primary findings of TODAY was that metformin monotherapy was inadequate for maintenance of glycemic control in almost half of participants after median time to failure of &#x0223c;11 months (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Furthermore, there were distinct sex and racial/ethnic differences in the pattern of failure overall and across treatment arms. This degree of failure on monotherapy was higher than expected from studies of adults with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and only partially prevented by the addition of rosiglitazone. Taken together, the findings suggest that type 2 diabetes among adolescents can be more rapidly progressive than in adults (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, &#x0223c;50% of TODAY participants maintained durable glycemic control regardless of treatment group. This suggests that type 2 diabetes among adolescents is a heterogeneous disorder grossly divided between those who are and are not able to maintain glycemic control on oral therapy. If so, it would be of substantial clinical importance to properly classify patients early in the course of the disease so that appropriate treatment can be planned.</p><p>In this analysis, we address the hypothesis that readily available demographic and metabolic characteristics determined early in the course of type 2 diabetes can distinguish adolescents who will display durable glycemic control from those at risk for loss of glycemic control on oral therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>TODAY Design and Primary Findings</title><p>TODAY clinical trial rationale, design, and methods have been reported in detail (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and are described briefly. Between July 2004 and February 2009, 699 youth aged 10&#x02013;17 years, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) for &#x0003c;2 years, with BMI &#x02265;85th percentile, and negative for diabetes autoantibodies, were enrolled (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). After screening to determine eligibility, subjects completed a 2- to 6-month prerandomization run-in period in which they demonstrated mastery of standard diabetes education, were weaned from nonstudy diabetes medications, demonstrated tolerance of metformin 500&#x02013;1,000 mg twice daily, maintained HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;8% (&#x0003c;64 mmol/mol) monthly for at least 2 months on metformin alone, and demonstrated adherence to study medication and visit attendance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Participants were randomized to one of three treatment arms: metformin alone, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus lifestyle program. Study baseline data were collected after run-in and before start of randomized treatment assignment. Participants attended clinic visits for medical management every 2 months in the first year and quarterly thereafter. The goal of diabetes medical management was to maintain HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels as close to the normal range as possible in order to reduce long-term diabetes complications. During the trial, the investigators and the participants were blinded to specific HbA<sub>1c</sub> values but were informed if HbA<sub>1c</sub> was <italic>1</italic>) &#x02265;8% (&#x02265;64 mmol/mol), <italic>2</italic>) 6&#x02013;8% (42&#x02013;64 mmol/mol) and increased from previous value by &#x02265;0.8% (&#x02265;8.7 mmol/mol), or <italic>3</italic>) &#x02264;6% (&#x02264;42 mmol/mol) (target). The primary objective was to compare the three treatment arms on time to treatment failure, defined as either HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% (&#x02265;64 mmol/mol) over a 6-month period or inability to wean from temporary insulin therapy within 3 months after acute metabolic decompensation.</p><p>The protocol was approved by an External Evaluation Committee convened by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health and by the institutional review boards of each participating institution. All participants provided written informed consent, and minor children confirmed assent according to local guidelines.</p><p>Materials developed and used for the TODAY standard diabetes education program and the intensive lifestyle intervention program are available to the public at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://today.bsc.gwu.edu/">https://today.bsc.gwu.edu/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Analysis Samples and Measures</title><p>Two outcome groups were defined for analysis. Group designation was assigned irrespective of original treatment arm. Group 1 participants remained in glycemic control (i.e., did not reach the primary outcome, as defined above) for at least 48 months of follow-up, and group 2 reached the primary outcome before 48 months; beyond 48 months, sample size was inadequate for analysis and data are not included.</p><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics in the analysis were age, sex, race/ethnicity (classified as non-Hispanic black [NHB], Hispanic [H], non-Hispanic white [NHW], or other), household annual income, highest education level of parents or guardians, first-degree family history of diabetes, Tanner stage (by physician examination), months since diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and presence of depressive symptoms based on the Children&#x02019;s Depression Inventory (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for participants age &#x02264;15 years or the Beck Depression Inventory (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) for participants age &#x02265;16 years.</p><p>Baseline measures were BMI, HbA<sub>1c</sub> at screening and randomization, C-peptide, and adiposity. Laboratories were performed by a central laboratory (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function were derived from the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test as follows: insulin inverse = 1/insulin<sub>min 0</sub>, and insulinogenic index = (insulin<sub>min 30</sub> &#x02212; insulin<sub>min 0</sub>)/(glucose<sub>min 30</sub> &#x02212; glucose<sub>min 0</sub>). Measures of adiposity were waist circumference and DXA measures of fat (kg) and lean (kg) body mass; in approximately one-quarter of the subjects, DXA scans were excluded owing to weight limitations (weight &#x0003e;140 kg).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Logistic regression was used to model outcome group as a function of demographic variables, baseline characteristics, and baseline measures in univariate and multivariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to identify optimal baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> cut points predictive of failure (as indicated by outcome group). The standard logistic regression model and the trapezoidal rule method were used to compute the total area under the curve (AUC) and its associated 95% CI in the overall analysis sample by sex, by race/ethnicity (NHB, H, NHW), and for the six sex-by-race/ethnicity combinations. Sensitivity and specificity were computed and the Youden index method was used to select the optimal threshold point from the ROC curve (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The Youden index [maximum (sensitivity + specificity &#x02212; 1)] maximizes the vertical distance from the line of equality to identify the point on the curve farthest from chance (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and maximizes the classification rate. The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) (sensitivity/1 &#x02212; specificity) was used to determine whether a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> cutoff usefully changed the probability of failing oral therapy; PLR &#x0003e;1 indicates the test result is associated with increased probability (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant. <italic>P</italic> values were considered exploratory and were not adjusted for multiple testing; the study was powered only for the time-to-failure primary outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>Results</title><p>The assignment of participants into the two analysis groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow of participants into the two groups analyzed based on time to study primary outcome (failure to maintain glycemic control on randomized treatment assignment).

Although addition of rosiglitazone to metformin reduced the rate of loss of glycemic control by 23% over the course of the study, the median time to glycemic failure was the same regardless of treatment assignment. Furthermore, the incidence of loss of glycemic control plateaued over time regardless of treatment assignment. Taken together, these observations suggest that there may be subsets of adolescents with type 2 diabetes characterized as those at risk of losing glycemic control rapidly, those who will maintain glycemic control for a prolonged period of time, and those who may respond to addition of a second oral agent with improved maintenance of glycemic control. In particular, the early ability to distinguish patients who maintain glycemic control from those who are going to rapidly lose glycemic control would allow clinicians to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from closer monitoring and earlier intensification of therapy while supporting a less aggressive approach for those who are likely to maintain good glycemic control on metformin alone.</p><p>To examine this question, we analyzed the effect of demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics of the participants at the time of their randomization into TODAY on the likelihood of loss of glycemic control during follow-up. In univariate analysis, NHB race/ethnicity, depressive symptoms, first-degree family history of diabetes, and lower family income were all associated with rapid loss of glycemic control, as might be expected from previous literature in adults (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Surprisingly, age, duration of diabetes, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, and lean body mass at randomization had no effect on outcome, though this may be due, in part, to the relatively narrow range of each of these measures in the TODAY cohort (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Among metabolic measures, only screening and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and insulinogenic index were associated with maintenance of glycemic control; insulin sensitivity did not differ between the groups. We did not explore screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> further because the heterogeneous nature of the screened cohort in terms of treatment modalities made generalization of findings to a clinical population difficult.</p><p>In multivariate analysis, only baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and insulinogenic index remained significant irrespective of treatment assignment. Studies in adults (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and previous studies in the TODAY cohort (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) have shown that &#x003b2;-cell function is a strong determinant of HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Therefore, HbA<sub>1c</sub> already reflects information about &#x003b2;-cell function. Although both measures were significant predictors of durable control, HbA<sub>1c</sub> is clinically more accessible than determination of insulinogenic index. Similarly, although demographic factors were shown to contribute to diabetes outcome in univariate analysis, it may be that the HbA<sub>1c</sub> value already reflects these contributions, and these factors, therefore, disappeared as significant contributors to prediction of glycemic control in multivariate analysis in this cohort. Given the limitations of our data, we can only speculate on how these factors affect HbA<sub>1c</sub>, perhaps through genetic, hormonal, nutritional, or behavioral influences on &#x003b2;-cell function. This analysis suggests that HbA<sub>1c</sub> obtained after a short course of metformin monotherapy in adolescents with type 2 diabetes can function as a simple clinical measure to predict outcome and allow more effective targeting of therapy to those at highest risk for loss of glycemic control.</p><p>The next question is whether there is a specific HbA<sub>1c</sub> cutoff value that is useful as a predictor of likely outcome. ROC analysis identified an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) as the optimal Youden cutoff for correctly categorizing an individual&#x02019;s risk for loss of glycemic control on oral therapy, with an AUC of 0.77. The optimal cutoff was similar for females, reflecting the &#x0003e;60% representation of females in the cohort, but was substantially lower for males. This cutoff is lower than the ADA-recommended treatment target of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and probably lower than the level at which most clinicians would consider addition of a second agent. At a minimum, the analysis suggests that an HbA<sub>1c</sub> cutoff of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) has low sensitivity for identifying those adolescents; a youth with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;6.5% (&#x0003e;48 mmol/mol) after a few months on metformin had a &#x0003e;70% chance of experiencing loss of glycemic control in a relatively short time on oral therapy alone. Indeed, both boys and girls with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;6.0% (&#x0003e;42 mmol/mol) had approximately double the risk for failure as individuals with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.0% (&#x0003c;42 mmol/mol). Together these data indicate that adolescents with type 2 diabetes who do not attain a non&#x02013;diabetes range HbA<sub>1c</sub> after a few months on metformin are at increased risk for losing glycemic control, and the clinicians caring for these youth should not be reassured that HbA<sub>1c</sub> is &#x0201c;in target.&#x0201d; These individuals may benefit from closer monitoring or earlier initiation of supplemental therapy, despite an HbA<sub>1c</sub> that meets current targets. For example, females with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> higher than their optimal cutoff of 6.3% (45 mmol/mol) treated with rosiglitazone and metformin had a failure rate of 52% compared with 83% for metformin alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc15-0848/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). Although the future role of rosiglitazone in the treatment of youth with type 2 diabetes remains unclear, these results point out the potential benefits of initiating combination therapy in selected patients who do not reach the optimal cutoff after a short course of metformin. Conversely, a youth with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.0% (&#x0003c;42 mmol/mol) after a few months on metformin had a better than 70% chance of remaining in control on monotherapy for at least 4 years.</p><p>These findings do not suggest that there is benefit to treating patients to a lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> than the ADA target; we did not perform an intervention trial with different targets to address this question. Rather, the analysis suggests that HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the end of a relatively short course of metformin in these adolescents may reflect the severity of the underlying disorder and may be a marker of risk. Given the association of durable control with insulinogenic index and our previous demonstration that HbA<sub>1c</sub> is strongly determined by insulin secretion in these youth (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), those who are not able to get their HbA<sub>1c</sub> into the non&#x02013;diabetes range within a few months are likely to have substantial deterioration in &#x003b2;-cell function already.</p><p>This analysis has a number of important strengths. First, although the analysis sample is composed of participants in a randomized clinical trial with rigorous eligibility criteria who remained in follow-up for at least 4 years, the demographics of the analyzed sample are comparable with demographics of the general population of youth-onset type 2 diabetes in the U.S. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Second, the participants in TODAY have been extensively characterized, allowing analysis of a broad set of demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical measures. Third, the cohort was followed longitudinally and all diabetes care was provided to the participants, allowing for analysis of causal relationships not possible in small and/or cross-sectional studies. On the other hand, despite the relatively large size of the TODAY cohort, the sample size is too small for more than exploratory analysis of sex-by-racial/ethnic subgroups. In addition, the ROC analysis yields AUC values in the range indicating fair predictive ability for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, suggesting that there are other factors involved in determining likelihood of failure that are not fully reflected in HbA<sub>1c</sub>. However, despite this limitation, HbA<sub>1c</sub> remains the strongest predictor of likelihood of success or failure on metformin monotherapy in youth with type 2 diabetes and is an easily obtained clinical measure that may provide important clinical insight.</p><p>In summary, the population of youth with type 2 diabetes is heterogeneous and consists of subsets of individuals who are more or less likely to have durable glycemic control on oral therapy. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that HbA<sub>1c</sub> after a few months of metformin monotherapy was the strongest predictor of response, likely reflecting underlying insulin secretion. Finally, these analyses indicate that adolescents with type 2 diabetes who do not attain a non&#x02013;diabetes range HbA<sub>1c</sub> after a few months on metformin are at increased risk of losing glycemic control, and the clinician caring for these youth should not be reassured with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0201c;in target.&#x0201d; These findings suggest that HbA<sub>1c</sub> obtained after a short course of metformin monotherapy in adolescents with type 2 diabetes may be a simple clinical measure to predict short- and medium-term outcome and allow better targeting of therapy to those adolescents at highest risk for loss of glycemic control. In the future, long-term follow-up of the TODAY cohort will be used to confirm and readjust our analysis and understanding of early markers for both diabetes control and diabetes-related complications and comorbidities.</p></sec>
