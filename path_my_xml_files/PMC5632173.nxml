Dalbavancin is a long-acting lipoglycopeptide with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens responsible for ABSSSI, including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), and has demonstrated activity in ABSSSI with single-dose administration. We assessed outcomes in patients with and without diabetes in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of dalbavancin for ABSSSI.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, phase 3 trial, adult patients with ABSSSI involving deeper soft tissue or requiring significant surgical intervention, defined as major abscess, cellulitis, and traumatic wound/surgical site infection were randomized 1:1 to dalbavancin as a single-dose (1500&#x000a0;mg) or as a two-dose regimen (1000&#x000a0;mg on Day 1 and 500&#x000a0;mg on Day 8). The primary endpoint was &#x02265;20% reduction in erythema at 48&#x02013;72 hours; clinical success on Days 14 and 28 was defined as improvement in lesion size and signs and symptoms. <italic>P</italic>-values were obtained using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, outcomes were compared among the subgroups of participants with and without diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 76/698 (10.9%) participants with diabetes and 622/698 (89.1%) participants without diabetes. Participants with diabetes were more likely to be older or obese, and had higher rates of cellulitis, while participants without diabetes had higher rates of abscess (Figure&#x000a0;1). At Days 14 and 28, clinical success was achieved in &#x02265;84% of participants with diabetes, and investigator assessment of cure was achieved in &#x02265;95% of participants with diabetes (Figure&#x000a0;2). Drug-related adverse events were observed in 7 (9.2%) patients with and 44 (7.1%) participants without diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p> Dalbavancin has similar rates of clinical response and success for the treatment of ABSSSI in patients with or without diabetes.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0031"/><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0032"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>M.&#x000a0;Nowak, Allergan plc: Employee, Salary.
