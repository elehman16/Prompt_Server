While clinical and public health approaches are focused on prevention or early intervention strategies, the ideal method of intervention remains unclear. No study has set out to evaluate the role of neurobiological agents in preventing depressive symptoms in older populations at risk of depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Subjects with previously reported sub-threshold depressive symptoms, aged 60 to 74 years, will be screened to participate in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with three parallel groups involving omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or sertraline hydrochloride, compared with matching placebo. Subjects will be excluded if they have current depression or suicide ideation; are taking antidepressants or any supplement containing omega-3 fatty acid; or have a prior history of stroke or other serious cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, significant psychiatric disease (other than depression) or neurodegenerative disease. The trial will consist of a 12 month treatment phase with follow-up at three months and 12 months to assess outcome events. At three months, subjects will undergo structural neuroimaging to assess whether treatment effects on depressive symptoms correlate with brain changes. Additionally, proton spectroscopy techniques will be used to capture brain-imaging markers of the biological effects of the interventions. The trial will be conducted in urban New South Wales, Australia, and will recruit a community-based sample of 450 adults. Using intention-to-treat methods, the primary endpoint is an absence of clinically relevant depression scores at 12 months between the omega-3 fatty acid and sertraline interventions and the placebo condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The current health, social and economic costs of late-life depression make prevention imperative from a public health perspective. This innovative trial aims to address the long-neglected area of prevention of depression in older adults. The interventions are targeted to the pathophysiology of disease, and regardless of the effect size of treatment, the outcomes will offer major scientific advances regarding the neurobiological action of these agents. The main results are expected to be available in 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=308413">ACTRN12610000032055</ext-link> (12 January 2010)</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-015-0762-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>OMEGA-3 fatty acid</kwd><kwd>Antidepressants</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Older adults</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric conditions of later life, with clinically relevant depressive syndromes affecting 9 to 18&#x000a0;% of the general elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Late-life depression (LLD) describes a major depressive episode occurring after the age of 60 or 65 years. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and contributes to cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Research suggests that even with optimal treatment, only 34&#x000a0;% of the LLD disease burden in the form of &#x02018;years lived with disability&#x02019; could be averted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Whilst many older adults fail to meet criteria for major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], subsyndromal depressive symptoms are clinically significant and are associated with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and an increased risk for the development of major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Longitudinal community studies show that even in those with subsyndromal depression, persistence or worsening of depressive symptoms occurs over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Importantly, both clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and epidemiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] studies show that either subsyndromal or full-threshold depressive disorders are risk factors for dementia. Even one clinically significant depressive symptom can increase an individual&#x02019;s risk of dementia by up to 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and a lifetime episode of depression increases dementia risk threefold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Importantly, epidemiological research has shown that a reduction in major depression (MD) prevalence could reduce the incidence of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease by 7.9&#x000a0;% worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and all cause dementia by up to 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The current health, social and economic costs of depression are such that, from a public health perspective, depression prevention should be seen as imperative, and with the world&#x02019;s rapidly ageing population, the development of effective prevention strategies is now critical.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The need for depression prevention trials</title><p>While the need to conduct prevention trials is widely recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the ideal method of intervention is unclear. This may partly reflect the multi-faceted nature of LLD where lifestyle, behavioural, neurotoxic (<italic>e.g.</italic> glucocorticoid), genetic (<italic>e.g.</italic> via homocysteine), vascular, glial and inflammatory mechanisms are important contributors to pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (see also below). Additionally, it appears that once the illness is established, neurobiological changes are unlikely to be reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Only one known study focusing on &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; community older people has been conducted and utilised a stepped-care approach (watchful waiting, CBT-based self-help intervention, problem-solving treatment and referral to a primary care physician for medication if required). This study demonstrated a halved incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders in older adults presenting with sub-threshold depression and anxiety (not meeting diagnostic criteria) over a period of 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and these effects were sustained at two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, in Phase 1 of the BA trial, we found positive effects of folate on cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], reinforcing strategies aimed at targeting underlying pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mechanisms underpinning brain change in depression</title><p>The mechanisms underpinning the link between LLD and poor longitudinal outcomes are not yet fully delineated, but a combination of vascular, inflammatory, illness-specific and neurodegenerative changes may be operative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In recent years, the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory mechanisms in depressive disorders has been the subject of a plethora of studies. Indeed, altered levels of antioxidants and their synthesising enzymes, high concentrations of oxidation by-products and increased pro-oxidant activity levels have been demonstrated in patients with LLD and have also been linked with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, increased inflammatory markers have been demonstrated in patients with depression and comorbid cognitive impairment, with chronic inflammation thought to play a central role in dementia pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Depressive illness appears to further contribute to brain change, particularly in the hippocampus, a key structure involved in memory and neurogenesis. The &#x02018;neurotoxic&#x02019; effects of depression may occur via down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis, neurotoxic effects of glucocorticoids, and reduced expression of neurotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Indeed, our prior work has shown direct links between reduced hippocampal size and impaired memory performance in older people with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Patients with depression have been shown to have reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a key neurotrophin relevant for hippocampal neurogenesis. The presence of depressive illness also appears detrimental to the integrity of brain structures via prolonged hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that prolonged glucocorticoid exposure resulting from HPA axis hyperactivation may lead to increased free radical production, reduced glucose transport, a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) and suppressed neurogenesis. Together, these effects, resulting from prolonged stress and hypercortisolaemia, have been posited to account for the reduction in hippocampal volume commonly associated with depression occurring across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and has been associated with memory decline in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, in order to reduce the incidence of LLD and the concomitant cognitive decline, we argue that prevention should focus on the known underlying neurobiology including reduction of vascular/inflammatory risk factors and targeting &#x02018;neuroprotection&#x02019; via promotion of neurotrophic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of relevance to this phase of our prevention study, the National Heart Foundation of Australia now recommends omega-3 fatty acid consumption for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and a plethora of studies suggest that antidepressants may offer neuroprotection, the promotion of neurotrophins and neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Omega-3 for prevention of depression and cognitive decline</title><p>Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; precursor to DHA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) may occur in a number of psychiatric conditions, including depression. While there have been some negative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], four controlled intervention studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids reduce depressive symptoms in adults with major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The size of the effect attributable to omega-3 fatty acid is unresolved due to the variability in sample size (20 to 452), measures of depression used and treatment duration (28 to 182 days), as well as the ratios of EPA and DHA.</p><p>With regard to cognitive benefits, longitudinal research suggests that whole fish consumption is protective against cognitive decline and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A recent prospective study, the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study, showed that daily omega-3 fatty acid supplements were associated with lower risk of cognitive decline in a cohort of Chinese adults aged over 55 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Positive effects on processing speed appear to be particularly pronounced. For example, over a three year time period, higher plasma omega-3 fatty acid proportions were associated with less decline in cognitive tasks mediated by processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Over a 35-day period, positive effects of EPA/DHA have been noted in both mood and reaction time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Despite this body of work focusing on the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on depressive symptoms and cognition, to date there have been no randomised controlled trials investigating whether supplementation can <italic>prevent</italic> depressive symptoms in older adults. Similarly, although animal studies show that long-term omega-3 fatty acid depletion can produce cognitive deficits in normal animals (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]), there is still uncertainty regarding the benefit of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on cognitive decline and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, given 39&#x000a0;% of Australians aged over 50 years report taking an omega-3 fatty acid supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], clinical evidence of a therapeutic benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the <italic>prevention</italic> of cognitive decline warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Potential mechanism of effect of omega-3</title><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are an integral component of cell membranes, facilitating membrane fluidity and permeability. They are necessary for brain function and development, and may have neuroprotective properties. Cell signalling and signal transduction, including serotonin and dopamine pathways, have been shown to be influenced by omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for the maintenance of cell structure and have anti-inflammatory effects; mediating and modulating acute inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies have shown that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reversed age-related impairments in long-term potentiation and depolarization-induced glutamate transmitter release (impairments thought to arise as a result of a decrease in membrane fluidity). DHA is decreased in the hippocampus of aged rats and can be restored through dietary manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In addition, omega-3 fatty acid has been demonstrated to have a direct antioxidant effect, with supplementation in ageing rats shown to enhance antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Importantly, a novel clinical study using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated that in patients with first-episode psychosis, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (2 g EPA) is associated with significant increases in glutathione (GSH), which is the brain&#x02019;s major antioxidant in comparison to treatment as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. As GSH protects dopaminergic neurons from oxidative and excitatory damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], such an increase suggests neuroprotective effects.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is generally well tolerated, is associated with few undesirable side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], has limited interaction with other medications and has been shown to improve cardiovascular and immune health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], factors that are particularly pertinent in older people. Thus, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could be a suitable and safe prevention treatment for depression and cognitive decline in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Antidepressants for the prevention of depression and cognitive decline</title><p>Evaluation of the role of antidepressants as prevention agents for depression has seen positive findings in patients with recurrent major depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], post-stroke depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. However there are no known studies in older &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; adults. Due to concerns about the unwanted effects of antidepressants, psychological interventions have been favoured to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, as it is likely that there are key bi-directional relationships between depression, cognitive changes and structural brain changes, the potential neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of antidepressants, and sertraline in particular, suggest a role for such treatments not only in the amelioration of depressive and cognitive symptoms, but also in their prevention. Of added benefit and significance, a large body of evidence suggests that antidepressants in older people are associated with reduced suicide rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sertraline as an indicated prevention intervention for depression</title><p>Sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) is a specific and potent inhibitor of serotonin re-uptake at the presynaptic terminal with a modest inhibitory effect on dopamine reuptake. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder in older adults, with a dose range of 50-200 mg daily (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]), appears to be superior to placebo and has similar efficacy to other antidepressants (from different classes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Additionally, a recent animal study showed that sertraline has a protective action against cognitive decline in an induced neurodegenerative disease model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In this study, rats treated with 3-nitropropionic acid performed poorly on follow-up assessments of memory retention and spatial navigation, whereas those concurrently treated with sertraline showed a preservation of baseline function. Due to the lack of anti-cholinergic effects as well as few interactions with other medications, sertraline is more tolerable than alternate classes of antidepressant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A number of reviews suggest that sertraline is the most suitable first choice of antidepressant in patients suffering major depression due to its balance of efficacy and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Potential neuroprotective effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors</title><p>A growing body of literature suggests that SSRIs may have both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions in the brain. Animal studies suggest that SSRIs may promote the growth of new neuronal pathways or neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Sertraline appears to increase neuronal differentiation as well as promote neuronal maturation of human hippocampal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. These effects may be related to the action of SSRIs to cause up-regulation of BDNF in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. SSRIs may owe some of their effect to anti-inflammatory actions on microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Indeed sertraline has been shown to prevent GSH (the brain&#x02019;s major antioxidant) reduction in rats with induced neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], which is of particular significance given recent work showing that this antioxidant is linked to cognitive decline in older adults at risk of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Summary and rationale for the second Beyond Ageing Project randomised controlled trial</title><p>Taken together, there is urgent need to conduct relevant prevention or early intervention trials for depression and cognitive decline in older adults, and substantial evidence indicates that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and sertraline treatment may have therapeutic potential in this regard. As we are testing two novel pharmacological prevention treatments, the comparator of choice will be a placebo condition.</p><p>As such, we aim to conduct a selective prevention trial for depressive symptoms in an established and well-characterised cohort of older &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; adults, who initially participated in the first Beyond Ageing Project (BAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The BAP Cohort is a community-based population of older adults initially aged 60 to 74 years when recruited in 2005 to 2006 from the Australian Electoral roll. At that time, participants were recruited from urban and rural sites in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, by postal mail, using address and age-range information provided by the Australian Electoral Commission. Given that voting is compulsory in Australia, this strategy provided for representative population sampling. Initially, these people were selected as being at elevated risk of major depression as evidenced by scores &#x0003e;15 on the Kessler-10 (K-10) questionnaire. The K-10 questionnaire is a self-report global measure of psychological distress and comprises ten items concerning anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced during the most recent 4-week period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The K-10 is designed for use in community samples, and is useful for detecting levels of distress that are associated with independent diagnostic measures (for example, DSM-IV) in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. A K-10 score &#x0003e;15 (moderate psychological distress) is found in 25&#x000a0;% of the aged population in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] across all age groups, and correlates with a 9.1&#x000a0;% 12 month prevalence of affective disorder.</p><p>Our rationale for the choice of participants is supported by longitudinal community studies that have demonstrated that for older people with subsyndromal depression, persistence or worsening of symptoms occurs over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, because people with depressive symptoms are prevalent in the community, selective prevention approaches are feasible. Our approach to target those &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; of depression makes efficient use of resources since cohorts of subjects with subsyndromal depression yield the highest attributable risk, the lowest numbers needed to treat and the shortest time frames for testing for beneficial effects.</p><p>Our prior randomised controlled trial (RCT) with this BAP cohort showed that mental health literacy was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and that folate supplementation was associated with lowered rates of cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].

There will be three principal occasions of measurement over the 12 month treatment period: baseline, three months, and 12 months with the primary endpoint an absence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms at 12 months. Participants in all three arms will have a brief clinical review and collect investigational products monthly for the first three months. They will be contacted via telephone at the following intervals (one, two, six, and ten weeks and then monthly to 12 months) for safety monitoring and adherence purposes. The trial has been registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12610000032055).

Participants will initially be recruited from the larger BAP cohort using a computer algorithm to identify individuals that meet eligibility criteria. For the second BAP trial, all cohort participants residing in the greater Sydney metropolitan area with an elevated risk of major depression (as evidenced by scores ranging from 16 to 29 on the K-10 at the point of screening for the first BAP trial), will be invited to participate. Given the need to attend for face-to-face clinical assessments it is not feasible to include members of the cohort that reside outside of the Sydney metropolitan area. Of the 24,352 participants in the cohort database, approximately 4,400 showed sub-threshold depressive symptoms previously and approximately 60&#x000a0;% of this subgroup were based in the greater Sydney metropolitan area. Enrichment strategies will be implemented through the Australian Electoral Commission, as per our previous methods, should our recruitment projections be inaccurate.

Several strategies will be employed to minimise bias through accidental unblinding.</p><p>As the two pharmacological treatments under investigation are different in appearance, blinding will be ensured by a double-dummy design. This will involve giving all participants two formulations: one group will receive the active omega-3 fatty acid treatment plus a placebo of the sertraline treatment; a second group will receive the opposite combination (active sertraline plus a placebo of the omega-3 fatty acid treatment), while the third group will receive a placebo version of both omega-3 fatty acid and sertraline.</p><p>Additionally, in order to protect the blinding of both participants and investigators, the active and placebo variants of each treatment will appear identical in appearance and weight to their active counterparts. As previously described, the paraffin oil capsules will also contain small amount each of EPA and DHA to ensure a consistent flavour and smell between the omega-3 fatty acid and placebo counterparts. The packaging and labelling of each active and placebo intervention will also be identical in weight, size and appearance.</p><p>Clinical outcomes will be assessed by personnel who are unaware of the participant&#x02019;s treatment allocation. The Trial Coordinator will maintain an unblinding log to record any specific personnel that may be accidentally (or deliberately) unblinded during the course of the trial, along with the date, scope and reason for doing so.</p><p>The routine collection of blood for the purpose of safety monitoring and adherence to treatment will be analysed by a central independent laboratory.

Reasons for exclusion, withdrawal or loss to follow-up will also be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Data management</title><p>All data will be entered electronically into the master trial database by suitably qualified staff, supervised by the Trial Coordinator. Data will be entered into a user-friendly Filemaker platform, and integrity will be enforced through a variety of mechanisms, including referential data rules, valid values, range checks and consistency checks. The option to choose a value from a list of valid codes will also be available when applicable. The master trial database will be held on a secure server hosted by the Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney. The trial database will be password protected, and only authorised trial personnel will have access. The database will be maintained in accordance with University of Sydney ICT policy and procedures. Upon database lock, data will be exported to a statistical software package for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Primary outcome analysis will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis. Mixed-model repeated measures analyses will be used because of the ability of this approach to include participants with missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Characteristics of the participants including sociodemographics, disability, physical activity, sleep and health and lifestyle factors will also be described by treatment group and overall at three and 12 months. Safety criteria including adverse events, laboratory parameters and withdrawals will also be analysed. The type one error will be set at 5&#x000a0;%. Descriptive statistics will include number of participants (N), mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum and, if a non-normal distribution, the median and first/third quartiles will be reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The accuracy, completeness and progress of data will be monitored continuously throughout the trial. Each CRF will have a data checklist attached, on which the assessments completed, drugs dispensed and other information will be recorded. Any missing information or illegible data will be queried with the researcher, clinician or interviewer responsible for its collection. Audits will be undertaken periodically to ensure that all data relating to informed consent, self-report questionnaires, medical and neuropsychological assessment, MRS, blood tests and dispensing, are accounted for. All original CRFs will be stored securely by trial identification number at the Trial Coordinating Centre. Following data entry into the master trial database, data will be randomly checked for accuracy and completeness and verified against source data. Approximately 5&#x000a0;% of participants will be specifically monitored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Safety and event monitoring</title><p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be established to safeguard the patients&#x02019; interests and to evaluate formally on a regular basis whether, for any reason, they would recommend that the study be modified or stopped. Two formal interim analyses are planned in accordance with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Charter. The Trial Management Committee, the collaborators, the study sponsor and all the project staff, with the exception of the unblinded statistician, will remain ignorant of the interim results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Harms</title><p>During the course of the study, participants will be assessed for adverse events (AEs) using pre-specified checklists comprising both expected (as per the Investigators&#x02019; Brochure) and unexpected adverse events. Clinician-rated assessments will be undertaken at the one and two month brief review, as well as at the three and 12 month follow-up assessment. In addition, participant self-reports will be completed at each of the same time-points. In accordance with evidence linking the use of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as sertraline, with an increased risk of hyponatraemia (low sodium concentration in blood) in elderly populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] particularly in the first few weeks of treatment, all study subjects will undergo electrolyte testing in the weeks following randomisation. In addition to these clinical and laboratory measurements, research assistants conducting safety monitoring and adherence telephone interviews at one, two, six, and ten weeks and then monthly to 12 months, will also assess for the occurrence of adverse events using the participant self-report checklist.</p><p>All AEs (including serious adverse events, or SAEs), regardless of relatedness to the investigational products, will be recorded on an adverse event form. Recording will be completed in a concise manner using standard, acceptable medical terms. Surgical interventions, which are planned prior to study enrolment, will not be considered as AEs. All AEs will be classified and graded in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Version 3.0, 2006).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Study sponsorship and organisation</title><p>The sponsor of the trial is the University of Sydney. For the purposes of the trial, EPAX 6000 TG/N (raw omega-3 fatty acid) will be supplied in-kind by Pathway International Pty Ltd and manufactured by LIPA Pharmaceuticals. LIPA Pharmaceuticals will also manufacture the matching paraffin oil capsules. Setrona&#x02122; (sertraline hydrochloride) tablets will be purchased from the Royal Adelaide Hospital Department of Pharmacy and encapsulated by Pharmaceutical Packaging Professionals Pty Ltd. Pharmaceutical Packaging Professionals will also prepare the matching microcrystalline cellulose placebo capsules, and provide packaging and labelling for all of the investigational products. The trial is supported by the Bupa Health Foundation&#x02019;s Healthy Ageing initiative, along with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, through a project grant awarded to the Brain &#x00026; Mind Research Institute. The trial is being coordinated independently of the funding bodies and suppliers of the investigational products, by the Brain &#x00026; Mind Research Institute, Sydney, Australia and overseen by the Trial Management Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Auditing</title><p>The Trial Management Committee and investigator team will allow independent monitors (for example, regulatory agencies) to visit the site and facilities where the trial will take place in order to ensure compliance with the protocol requirements at regular intervals. The sponsor may also conduct monitoring at regular intervals, depending on recruitment the rate, and as arranged between the investigator team and the sponsor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The trial will be undertaken in compliance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (revised version of Seoul, 2008), international standards of Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirements in Australia. The design and implementation of the trial has been approved by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number: 12-2009/12097). All important protocol modifications will be communicated to the Human Research Ethics Committee prior to implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>LLD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and contributes to cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that is unlikely to be reversible. Even with optimal treatment of LLD, only 34&#x000a0;% of the disease burden in the form of &#x02018;years lived with disability&#x02019; could be averted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The current health, social and economic costs of depression make prevention imperative from a public health perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. While effective treatments for depression are available, as many as 50&#x000a0;% of patients will not achieve remission with their first treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] and ultimately 20 to 30&#x000a0;% will not achieve full recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Those who do achieve full recovery remain at high risk for further episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, epidemiological data has shown that if depressive symptoms in older people were averted, the prevalence of dementia could be reduced by up to 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, prevention of this disease is of utmost importance.</p><p>This innovative trial aims to address the long-neglected area of prevention of depression in older adults, and represents an opportunity to test two novel pharmacological approaches that are particularly relevant and acceptable to this &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; cohort. The interventions are targeted to the pathophysiology of LLD, and regardless of the effect size of the intervention, the outcomes of this study will offer major scientific advances regarding the neurobiological action of these agents. Importantly, omega-3 fatty acids are a low cost and low risk prevention dietary supplement that are already widely used in the community, but have not been evaluated for their prevention capacity. As sertraline is the most widely prescribed antidepressant in general practice, findings from this trial may be directly translatable to clinical practice. Benefits are expected for depressive symptoms and cognition, and also for broader psychosocial functioning. If effective, this intervention could feasibly be delivered on a larger scale with the potential to result in significant reductions in the high healthcare utilisation and costs associated with depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment to the second BAP trial commenced in July 2011.
