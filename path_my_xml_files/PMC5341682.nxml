The infusion was stopped at loss of response to verbal commands and induction was confirmed by disappearance of eyelash reflex. The induction time was calculated from start of propofol infusion to loss of response to verbal commands and the induction dose as the amount of drug administered in that duration.

They concluded that preinduction inhalation of N<sub>2</sub>O (50%) in O<sub>2</sub> appears to be an effective and acceptable method of preoxygenating the patient and augmenting the propofol induction of anesthesia as shown in our study. This was the major concern of our study to adopt this technique.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The hemodynamic variations in both groups were also compared in our study. There was no significant change in HR at the end of infusion during induction in Group FN and FO, in contrast to our study by Singh where there was a continuous increase in HR till 10 min after induction. However, in our study, there was a significant rise in HR after intubation in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) but clinically not significant. This may be due to fall in HR by propofol which may be compensated by increased sympathetic stimulation by N<sub>2</sub>O.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The hemodynamic effects of N<sub>2</sub>O are due to its property to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system; however, it is a direct myocardial depressant, but arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and HR are unchanged or slightly elevated because of sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine release.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The study by Mckinney and Fee showed decrease in HR as the study population has average age of 70 years who have limited responsiveness of cardiovascular system toward the sympathetic stimulation.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] There was no significant change in SBP, DBP, and MAP observed after intubation, intraoperative period, and after extubation in both groups. The various studies have demonstrated reduction up to 26&#x02013;28% of SBP, 19% of DBP, and 11% of MAP after induction with propofol at a dose of 2 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, in our study, reduction in 2&#x02013;4% of HR, 9&#x02013;12% of MAP, 5&#x02013;8% of SBP, and 9&#x02013;13% of DBP were observed which were significantly less as compared to other studies. This may be due to significant reduction in induction dose of propofol by use of N<sub>2</sub>O and slower infusion (20 mg/min) of propofol. Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] observed complications such as hypotension in control (8%) and study (1%) groups but none of the patients in our study have any complications, for example, hemodynamic instability, laryngospasm, desaturation, involuntary movements, apnea, or delayed extubation.</p><p>We have studied the effects of inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O on the induction dose and time of propofol along with hemodynamic variations and any adverse effects or complications, during induction of anesthesia. However, we did not studied the acceptance or feasibility of concomitant administration of N<sub>2</sub>O with oxygen during induction of anesthesia, but none of the patients experienced any unpleasant sensation or desaturation during induction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In conclusion, the coadministration of N<sub>2</sub>O during induction of anesthesia with propofol not only reduced the induction dose of propofol but also reduced induction time significantly thereby reducing adverse effects of propofol. Hence, N<sub>2</sub>O should only be used in the induction of anesthesia in patients scheduled for elective surgeries and not to be used in patients with anticipated difficult intubation and low cardiorespiratory reserve simultaneously evaluating the risk-benefit profile for the use of N<sub>2</sub>O. The hemodynamic parameters (HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, and SpO<sub>2</sub>) remained stable without any adverse effects and complications.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanikop</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kotur</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical investigation effect of priming principle on the induction dose requirements of propofol &#x02013; A randomized clinical trial</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2006</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>283</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rasooli</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Parish</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahmoodpoor</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Moslemi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanaie</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Faghfuri</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of intramuscular ephedrine in prevention of hypotension due to propofol</article-title><source>Pak J Med Sci</source><year>2007</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>893</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hashiba</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hirota</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsuki</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of propofol on bronchoconstriction and bradycardia induced by vagal nerve stimulation</article-title><source>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</source><year>2003</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>1059</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12969095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inhaling nitrous oxide reduces the induction dose requirements of propofol</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2000</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>1213</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10781482</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duarte</surname><given-names>LT</given-names></name><name><surname>Duval Neto</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><name><surname>Mendes</surname><given-names>FF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nitrous oxide use in children</article-title><source>Rev Bras Anestesiol</source><year>2012</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>451</fpage><lpage>67</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22656690</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Macleod</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Howie</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effective concentration 50 for propofol with and without 67% nitrous oxide</article-title><source>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</source><year>1993</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>458</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8356858</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Vasconcellos</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Sneyd</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nitrous oxide: Are we still in equipoise?
