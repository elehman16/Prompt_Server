Nearly 20% of all coronary heart disease deaths can be attributed to smoking <xref rid="pone.0062311-1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-LloydJones1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Smoking, therefore, is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial infarction <xref rid="pone.0062311-Yusuf1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Cigarette smoking leads to hypoxemia and endothelial dysfunction which accelerate atherosclerotic changes, increasing smokers&#x02019; risk for CVD <xref rid="pone.0062311-FitzGerald1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a routine, inexpensive tool for assessment of CVD and CVD risk in both clinical and research settings, and ECG changes powerfully predict future CVD events <xref rid="pone.0062311-Crow1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Auer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Large, population-based studies have described a higher prevalence of smoking in subjects with ECG abnormalities and demonstrated that ECG abnormalities are associated with increased CVD events and death <xref rid="pone.0062311-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-DeBacquer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although the strong relation between smoking and CVD is well-established <xref rid="pone.0062311-Ambrose1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, there are relatively few data that prospectively described ECG changes following a smoking cessation attempt. Furthermore, most of the existing data about CVD and smoking is from older cohorts that are not representative of today&#x02019;s smokers, who tend to be more overweight, are more likely to be female, and to have lower socioeconomic status <xref rid="pone.0062311-Gepner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To our knowledge, no studies have described the prevalence of ECG abnormalities in a younger group of cigarette smokers or their associations with smoking burden. The primary aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and magnitude of resting ECG abnormalities among smokers and to explore the relation between smoking burden and ECG abnormalities. A secondary aim was to determine if successful smoking cessation reduced, or if continued smoking increased the incidence of ECG abnormalities that indicate structural or conduction system function, after three years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The institutional review board at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health approved this study.

Only subjects recruited from Madison, Wisconsin had resting ECGs obtained prior to an exercise stress test that was used to evaluate functional capacity <xref rid="pone.0062311-Asthana1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Of those participants, 541 had a resting ECG available for coding; 3 did not include a subject ID and 6 could not be coded due to tracing artifact. Similarly, of the 370 subjects at 3 years of follow up, 355 ECGs were available for coding and 1 could not be coded due to tracing artifact. The baseline clinical trial visits included measurement of anthropometric data, fasting laboratory tests, completion of validated questionnaires, interviews, and resting 12-lead ECGs. Smoking burden was evaluated by current cigarette smoking in cigarettes per day (cpd) and pack-years (current cpd * years smoked). Recent smoke exposure was measured by an exhaled CO level, which reflects smoking efficiency and recent smoke exposure. Smoking status (abstinence or continued smoking) was assessed by self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence using a smoking calendar and the timeline follow-back method, and then confirmed by exhaled CO levels of &#x0003c;10 ppm (Micro-3 Smokerlyzer, Bedfont Scientific, Williamsburg, VA) <xref rid="pone.0062311-Piper1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Electrocardiograms were reviewed by 2 independent readers (ADG, MAL) and coded according to the Minnesota Code (MC) criteria <xref rid="pone.0062311-Prineas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Any discordant results were reviewed and adjudicated by a board certified cardiologist (JHS). All ECG reviewers were blinded to smoking status. The QRS axis and intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT) were measured manually and recorded. ECG abnormalities were categorized as major or minor, using similar criteria as used by the pooling project <xref rid="pone.0062311-2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Major ECG abnormalities included major Q waves (MC 1-1, 1-2), significant ST segment depression (MC 4-1, 4-2), deep T wave inversion (MC 5-1, 5-2), complete or type II second-degree atrioventricular block (MC 6-1, 6-2), complete left or right bundle branch block, or intraventricular block (MC 7-1,7-2,7-4), atrial fibrillation/flutter (8-3), left ventricular hypertrophy (3-1) and right or left atrial enlargement (9-3, 9-6). Minor ECG abnormalities included borderline Q waves (MC 1-3), borderline ST segment depression (MC 4-3), moderate T wave inversion (MC 5-3), first-degree AV block (MC 6-3), type I second degree heart block (MC 6-2-3), incomplete bundle branch block (MC 7-3, 7-6), frequent premature beats (MC 8-1, 8-2), high voltage QRS (MC 3-1, 3-2), and axis deviation (MC 2-1, 2-2). ECGs without major or minor abnormalities were considered normal. ECG abnormalities for each subject were tallied and reported at baseline and at year 3. New ECG abnormalities were defined as ECG abnormalities at year 3 that were not present at baseline. Suppression codes, as detailed by the MC criteria, were used to eliminate incompatible codes within each ECG<xref rid="pone.0062311-Prineas1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics 20.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Means (standard deviations) and ranges were determined for the subject characteristics and smoking intensity parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062311-t001">Table 1</xref>. Two-tailed t-tests or chi-square tests were used to compare differences in anthropomorphic data, physiological data, demographics, and smoking parameters between continuing smokers and abstainers at year 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062311-t002">Table 2</xref>). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to determine associations between ECG abnormalities, at baseline and at 3 years after the target quit date, with measures of smoking burden. These models controlled for baseline age, sex, race, weight, body-mass index, glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, educational status, use of lipid-lowering medications and use of antihypertensive medications.

Only 14% of comparable CARDIA subjects were current smokers, indicating that smokers have a higher prevalence of major Q wave findings <xref rid="pone.0062311-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Indeed, in CARDIA, active smokers had a higher prevalence of major and minor Q-waves than non-smokers, though no information regarding the smoking burden of CARDIA subjects was reported <xref rid="pone.0062311-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In larger epidemiological studies that evaluated ECG abnormalities, the majority of subjects studied were one to two decades older that those in our study. In those studies, a minority of subjects were active smokers <xref rid="pone.0062311-Auer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-DeBacquer3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Machado1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-LloydJones2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> or smokers were excluded from the analyses <xref rid="pone.0062311-Vitelli1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The ECG abnormalities in younger smokers have not been well-described and are in need of further study. Considering that age is one of the strongest predictors of 10-year CVD risk <xref rid="pone.0062311-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> the age-independent association between baseline major Q-waves and smoking burden in pack-years supports the idea that increased lifetime smoking burden increases CVD risk and that increased CVD risk related to long-term smoking can be detected by the 12-lead ECG. There was no independent relationship between ECG abnormalities and cpd at baseline, however sudden cardiac death in smokers also has been associated with the overall duration of smoking, but not cpd <xref rid="pone.0062311-Wachtell1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>While there were fewer minor ECG abnormalities in those who quit smoking, we did not observe a significant difference in major or minor ECG findings at year 3. This is not unexpected since Q-waves, our most common major finding, are indicative of myocardial scar which is unlikely to resolve during our 3 year follow up period <xref rid="pone.0062311-Bolli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It is possible that the length of follow up was inadequate to detect differences in ECG progression or regression. Still, prior studies have shown that with improved blood pressure control, ECG abnormalities can regress within 2&#x02013;5 years <xref rid="pone.0062311-Bolli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-deSimone1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Longitudinal data regarding ECG changes after a quit attempt have not been described previously. Also, continuing smokers in our study were smoking significantly fewer cigarettes than they were at baseline and this group gained less weight then abstainers, which would be expected to attenuate the effects of smoking on ECG abnormalities. Additionally, there was a significant increase in use of antihypertensive medications and lipid-lowering therapy at year 3, compared to baseline. Treatment of known CVD risk factors could decrease the likelihood of developing ECG abnormalities at year 3 regardless of smoking status. For example, the prevalence of ECG abnormalities suggestive of left ventricular strain, such as T-wave inversion and LVH, slightly decreased at year 3 in both groups. This is more likely due to improvements in blood pressure rather than changes in smoking <xref rid="pone.0062311-Bolli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-deSimone1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Because this was a randomized clinical trial of smoking cessation interventions, there are no nonsmoking controls for comparison. In smoking cessation studies, it is very common for subjects who relapse to drop out or miss follow-up visits <xref rid="pone.0062311-Jorenby1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Gonzales1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In our study, 34% of subjects did not have a 3-year ECG, which is consistent with the 30&#x02013;43% one year drop-out rates reported in recent clinical trials of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies <xref rid="pone.0062311-Jorenby1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-Gonzales1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There were differences in participants that did not return for follow up with regard to age, and race which may introduce selection bias.

The three year follow up period in this study may be too short to detect progression or regression of some ECG changes <xref rid="pone.0062311-Bolli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062311-deSimone1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Finally, although ECG changes are associated with increased mortality, hard CVD outcomes including death, were not assessed in this study population.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Even in relatively young adults, major ECG abnormalities are independently associated with smoking burden. Minor ECG abnormalities were not associated with current or past smoking burden. After 3 years, quitting smoking was not associated with a decrease in ECG abnormalities; however those who abstained gained significantly more weight and continuing smokers smoked fewer cpd than at the inception of the study. Longer follow-up likely is needed to identify the effects of quitting versus continued smoking on the ECG and CVD risk.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the staff of the UW Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention and the UW Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program, as well as all of the participants in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0062311-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
