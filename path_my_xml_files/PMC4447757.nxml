Healthy male (n = 10) subjects participated in six WU protocols in a crossover randomized study design. Protocols were: passive rest (PR; 15 min of passive rest), running (Run; 5 min of running at 70% of maximum heart rate), stretching (STR; 5 min of static stretching exercise), jumping [Jump; 5 min of jumping exercises &#x02013; 3x8 countermovement jumps (CMJ) and 3x8 drop jumps from 60 cm (DJ60)], and combined (COM; protocols Run+STR+Jump combined). Immediately before and after each WU, subjects were assessed for explosive concentric-only (i.e. squat jump &#x02013; SJ), slow stretch-shortening cycle (i.e. CMJ), fast stretch-shortening cycle (i.e. DJ60) and contact time (CT) muscle performance. PR significantly reduced SJ performance (p =0.007). Run increased SJ (p =0.0001) and CMJ (p =0.002). STR increased CMJ (p =0.048). Specific WU (i.e. Jump) increased SJ (p =0.001), CMJ (p =0.028) and DJ60 (p =0.006) performance. COM increased CMJ performance (p =0.006). Jump was superior in SJ performance vs. PR (p =0.001). Jump reduced (p =0.03) CT in DJ60. In conclusion, general, specific and combined WU increase slow stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) muscle performance, but only specific WU increases fast SSC muscle performance. Therefore, to increase fast SSC performance, specific fast SSC muscle actions must be included during the WU.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>warm-up</kwd><kwd>explosive strength</kwd><kwd>plyometric exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Warm-up (WU) refers to muscle actions performed before a higher muscle demand, usually before high-intensity competitive or recreational events take place [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], traditionally involving general and specific WU exercise [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While general WU usually involves a relatively low-intensity aerobic component (e.g. submaximal running) and stretching exercises [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], specific WU involves specific-skill exercises [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One of the more important aims of WU is to increase performance [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] through increasing muscle temperature, reducing the muscle's viscous resistance (i.e. smoother contraction), or increasing the speed of nerve transmission [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Commonly, WU protocols tend to reflect the experience of individual coaches or athletes [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the effects of the WU itself have been poorly studied [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this regard, the American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) recently indicated that more controlled studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of WU protocols [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, controlled studies regarding the effects of WU on explosive performance are particularly scarce, maybe due to the unwillingness of voluntary subjects to complete a maximal effort without WU (i.e. control condition). Among the scarce studies investigating the effect of WU protocols on explosive muscular performance, conflicting results have arisen. Although some studies have shown an increase in explosive performance after general [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or specific [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or combined general and specific WU [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], others have not shown a significant effect [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Body mass and height were measured using a calibrated balance scale (HA-621 Tanita, Illinois, USA) and a stadiometer (Butterfly, Shanghai, China), respectively. All subjects were students of physical education, with no history of injury in the previous 6 months. Before the study, all subjects performed two practice sessions in which the WU and testing exercises were executed. Prior to the testing sessions, all subjects were instructed to avoid intense physical activity and not drink coffee or any energetic beverages at least 24 h before measurements. During the study period, subjects were asked to maintain their normal daily routines. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Physical Activity Sciences, University of Los Lagos. Subjects were carefully informed about the experiment procedures, as well as the possible risks and benefits associated with participation in the study, and an appropriate signed informed consent form was obtained pursuant to law before any of the tests were performed. No subject withdrew from this study as a consequence of injury or other adverse experiences.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was a randomized, single-blind crossover trial.

<italic>DJ60</italic>. Subjects performed DJs from a 60-cm high platform onto an electronic contact mat system (AXON JUMP 4.0, Bioengineering Sports, Argentina 2011) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The subjects were instructed to place their hands on their hips and step off the platform with the leading leg straight to avoid any initial upward propulsion, ensuring a drop height of 60 cm. They were instructed to jump for maximal height and minimal contact time, in order to maximize jump reactive strength [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The subjects were again instructed to leave the platform with knees and ankles fully extended and to land in a similarly extended position to ensure the validity of the test. Four basic techniques were stressed: (i) correct posture (i.e., spine erect, shoulders back) and body alignment (e.g., chest over knees) throughout the jump; (ii) jumping straight up with no excessive side-to-side or forward-backward movement; (iii) instant recoil for the concentric part of the jump. Phrases such as &#x0201c;on your toes&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;straight as a stick&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;light as a feather&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;recoil like a spring&#x0201d; were used as verbal and visualization cues during the DJs. The instructions given to the subjects were &#x0201c;jump as high as you can, with minimum ground contact time&#x0201d;. Three maximal repetitions were executed, with 30 s between repetitions. The best performance trial was used for the subsequent statistical analysis. The reactive strength (cm &#x000b7; ms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and contact time (ms) of the best trial were evaluated. Previous research from our laboratory shows high reliability for this test protocol [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Countermovement Jump</italic>. A CMJ was used in order to assess maximal jump height performance requiring slow stretch shortening cycle (SSC) action. The CMJ test was performed using an electronic contact mat system (AXON JUMP 4.0, Bioengineering Sports, Argentina 2011) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Jump height was determined using an acknowledged flight-time calculation [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During the CMJ, the subject was instructed to rest his hands on his hips, with feet and shoulders wide apart; subjects performed a downward movement, with no restriction imposed over the knee angle achieved [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], followed by a maximum effort vertical jump. All subjects were instructed to land in an upright position and to bend the knees following landing. Three maximal trials were completed, with 30 s of passive rest between them, and the best performance trial was used for the subsequent statistical analysis.</p><p>

The SJ test was performed using an electronic contact mat system (AXON JUMP 4.0, Bioengineering Sports, Argentina 2011) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Jump height was determined using an acknowledged flight-time calculation [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Our main findings showed that general WU (i.e. running, stretching), specific WU (i.e. jumping) and combined (i.e. running, stretching and jumping) WU induced a significant increase in explosive concentric-only and slow SSC muscle performance, but only specific WU induces a significant increase in fast SSC muscle performance, and this improvement in fast SSC muscle performance was achieved with a very low volume of muscle activity (i.e. less than 48 s). These results are similar to previous studies where an increase in explosive concentric-only (i.e. SJ) and slow SSC (i.e. CMJ) muscle performance was observed after general (i.e. running, stretching) and specific (i.e. jumping) WU [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, not all studies agree [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Differences between our results and previous investigations may be related to the degree of fatigue during WU. For example, during our specific (i.e. Jump) WU protocol, although we used high intensity, a low volume of muscle activity was required (i.e. less than 48 s), maximizing the probability of inducing a post-activation potentiation effect [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and reducing the chances of fatigue [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The improvement after general and specific WU activities can be explained by an increased muscle temperature, favourably affecting muscle performance by reducing the muscle's viscous resistance, which may induce a smoother contraction [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an increased speed of rate-limiting oxidative reaction and/or increased oxygen delivery to muscles [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] through greater vasodilatation [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is in addition to an increase in nerve transmission velocity, which may result in increased muscle contraction speed and reduced reaction time [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, only specific (i.e. Jump) WU induced a significant increase in fast SSC muscle performance (i.e. DJ60 reactive strength), which was achieved by means of a significant reduction in contact time. This may be explained by the fact that only high-intensity muscle activity (i.e. DJ) induced a post-activation potentiation effect, improving the muscles&#x02019; contractile performance in subsequent high-intensity fast SSC muscle actions [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This can be attributed to elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol of musculoskeletal cells [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Also of interest, a significant difference in SJ performance vs. PR was observed only after Jump WU, suggesting that specific WU may add not only to fast SSC muscle performance, but also to concentric-only explosive muscle activity. These results have important practical relevance, since many competitive sports require a combination of fast and slow SSC muscle actions to succeed.</p><p>Interestingly, in 1998 the ACSM [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] recommended the application of stretching exercises during WU protocols, but in 2011 [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] the ACSM changed their position, indicating that more controlled studies are needed. Our results show that the STR group significantly increased CMJ performance, similarly as in previous research [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because we use a short duration (i.e. 20 s) of stretching per muscle group and a low stretch intensity (i.e. avoiding the point of discomfort), and considering that a CMJ involves a slower velocity of eccentric contraction and more prolonged SSC (i.e. vs. DJ60), these factors may help explain the CMJ performance increase [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, considering that static stretching exercise may reduce muscle stiffness [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which may negatively affect SSC muscle performance [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is not surprising to find several reports where vertical jump performance and other powerful muscle actions were reduced after stretching exercises [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, our results show that the COM protocol [where stretching exercises were added to those that demonstrated a significant and positive effect on fast SSC muscle performance (i.e. jumping) and concentric-only explosive strength (i.e. jumping, running)] did not add to the explosive performance of subjects, suggesting that a negative interference effect may have occurred with static stretching in relation to fast SSC muscle performance and concentric-only explosive performance. Therefore, although we observed a significant effect of static stretching exercises on CMJ performance, we suggest that athletes apply other types of muscular activity (i.e. jumping, running) during WU before short-term powerful muscular performance activities, especially before those requiring fast SSC or concentric-only powerful muscle actions.</p><p>A novel finding in our study was the &#x0201c;limited&#x0201d; performance enhancement observed with COM, where only CMJ performance was improved, as compared to the CMJ and SJ improvement observed after Run and the CMJ, SJ and DJ60 improvement observed after Jump. In addition, the duration of COM was three times higher vs. Run, STR and Jump, resulting in a reduced efficiency in time investment with the former WU condition. Contrary to previous reports [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the combination of general and specific WU activities did not result in significant superior explosive performance compared to the application of isolated general or specific WU. This may be related to the fact that during COM, static stretching exercises were added, which (although it may positively impact CMJ performance, as our results show) may negatively impact rapid SSC and concentric-only powerful muscle performance [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Alternatively, subjects may have been fatigued after the COM protocol [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which took three times as long to complete in comparison with the other WU protocols, therefore reducing the potentially positive effect of combined general and specific WU muscle actions on explosive performance.</p><p>As expected, PR rest protocols did not induce a positive effect on explosive performance. In fact, after the PR protocol a significant reduction (-8%) in SJ performance was observed. Likely, 15 min of passive rest may have reduced muscle temperature, altering muscle spindle function [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], hence altering muscle contraction behaviour [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and potentially limiting short-term maximal effort muscle performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>General, specific and combined WU increase slow SSC muscle performance, but only specific WU increases fast SSC performance. Therefore, to increase fast SSC performance (and also slow SSC performance), we recommend that specific low-volume, high-intensity fast SSC muscle actions be included during WU before short-term maximal performance events. However, care must be taken to avoid undue combination of specific fast SSC muscle actions during WU with other exercises that may potentially reduce its positive effects (e.g. static stretching) on fast SSC performance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Appreciation is expressed for financial support from &#x0201c;Semillero de Investigaci&#x000f3;n&#x0201d; of the Universidad de Antofagasta, Chile.
