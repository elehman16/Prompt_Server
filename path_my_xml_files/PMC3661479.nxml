We assessed HDAC2 expression within the airways of smokers and subjects with COPD and effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), using immuno-histology to contrast with previous molecular methodology.</p><p>Endobronchial biopsies (ebb) from current smokers with COPD (COPD-CS; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15), ex-smokers with COPD (COPD-ES; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17), smokers with normal lung function (NS; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) and normal controls (NC; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) were immunostained for HDAC2.

There was a significant reduction in total cell numbers in the lamina propria (LP) in COPD-CS and NS (p&#x0003c;0.05). LP cellularity correlated inversely with smoking history in COPD-CS (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.8, p&#x0003c;0.003). HDAC2 expression increased markedly in NS (p&#x0003c;0.001); in contrast COPD-CS was associated with suppressed signal (p&#x0003c;0.03), while normal in COPD-ES. ICS did not affect HDAC2 cell staining.</p><p>Our findings suggest that airway HDAC2 expression is increased in the LP by smoking itself, but is reduced in COPD.

The increased expression of inflammatory genes is regulated by acetylation of core histones around which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is wound, allowing access of pro-inflammatroy transcription factors to transcription-regulatory sites. On the other hand these activated genes are switched off by at least partly by deacetylation of these histones <xref rid="pone.0064833-Barnes2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, the control of airway inflammation and response to airway oxidative stress is highly complex and many overlapping mechanisms are involved.</p><p>Airway inflammation in the airways responds <xref rid="pone.0064833-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> to therapeutic corticosteroids but only relatively poorly in COPD even though steroids have been shown to have some important specific beneficial effect clinically both in the short and long term <xref rid="pone.0064833-Chanez1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Telenga1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There is evidence that relative corticosteroids anti-inflammatory resistance in COPD may be partly due to decrease in histone deacetylase activity, and especially the type-2 enzyme (HDAC2) <xref rid="pone.0064833-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Barnes3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Though exact mechanisms are still not clearly understood, it is suggested that this may involve oxidative modulation of HDACs by nitrosylation on distinct tyrosine residues in response to tobacco smoke <xref rid="pone.0064833-Barnes2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Research regarding the role of histone acetylation and deacetylation in chronic inflammatory disease is only in its infancy, and even more so in COPD, where the picture has probably been made rather over-simplified, as indeed the degree of ICS insensitivity has been exaggerated. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used very widely in COPD clinically. However, there is a significant body of literature suggesting that expression and activity of anti-inflammatory HDAC2 are reduced in COPD lungs, airways and alveolar macrophages and becomes worse with severity of the disease <xref rid="pone.0064833-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Barnes3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The methodology that has been used in previously published investigations has largely depended on molecular ribonucleic acid (RNA) quantitation and protein analyses, which does not take into account potential differences in absolute or relative cellular profiles in airway tissues in disease <italic>versus</italic> control groups. In these situations, biases could arise, and there has been a serious lack of comprehensive biopsy studies to confirm the extent of suppressed HDAC2 expression through the use of immunostaining techniques that provide additional information on cell numbers and type within the airways of COPD <xref rid="pone.0064833-Sohal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Further rationale for using immunostaining techniques is provided by studies that clearly demonstrate that ICS affect the profile of cell populations in the airways <xref rid="pone.0064833-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Barnes4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Pauwels1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Vestbo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Hattotuwa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Gizycki1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Lapperre1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Zanini1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In order to further address the potential confounder of changes in cellularity of the airway wall when interpreting HDAC2 expression in smokers and COPD, we performed both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to test our hypothesis that the current literature is correct in terms of HDAC2 being down-regulated in the COPD airway, but that HDAC2 levels could be normalised by aggressive ICS therapy <xref rid="pone.0064833-Sohal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064833.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0064833.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>Subjects were recruited by advertisement in local newspapers and placement of posters in clinic waiting areas in the hospital, as well as on the notice boards of social and Veterans clubs.

The airway epithelium showed strong HDAC2 expression, but this was not significantly different between the groups, although COPD current smokers showed a slight decrease in average HDAC2 staining, which mirrored that found in the LP. The difference between groups, even if real (and probably confounded by a likely Type-II statistical error due to limited numbers), hardly suggests that this is a major effect with HDAC2, with more variability observed between individuals than between groups. Indeed, the main message may be that HDAC2 expression in the epithelium was pretty well preserved generally in smokers, suggesting that there is sufficient HDAC2 expression here to allow ICS to be effective in this compartment (as indeed we have shown in subsequent work, data not shown). Further, we found no change in epithelial HDAC2 staining with ICS therapy.</p><p>In the LP the data were complex but striking. We found that there was a decrease in the total number of cells in the LP in current smokers, both with normal lung function and with COPD, compared to normal controls. There has been no previous differentiation between the hyper-cellularity around the reticular basement membrane <xref rid="pone.0064833-Sohal2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Sohal3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and the hypo-cellular underlying layer. Interestingly, though, there are published micrographs from previous published studies of smokers and COPD subjects that illustrate identical changes to the one we are describing, but without formal quantitation <xref rid="pone.0064833-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Notably, normal lung function smokers also showed a decrease in total cellularity whilst the COPD-ES group had relatively normal total cellularity suggesting that smoking cessation had &#x0201c;normalised&#x0201d; this component of effects of smoking. What seems clear is that changes in airway cellularity, both in absolute and differential terms, need to be taken into account when interpreting quantitative PCR data for biopsy material, or confounding of the data and/or its interpretation is likely.</p><p>Our data for HDAC2 positive cells in the LP suggest that HDAC2 positive cells increase in both absolute and percentage terms in smoking per-se, but in contrast are decreased in current smokers with COPD. On the other hand there was an increase in HDAC2 positive cells in the lamina propria of COPD ex-smokers compared to COPD current smokers; essentially returning to normal. The data on percentage cell staining for HDAC2 in the LP are especially pertinent, as this takes into account potential confounding by changes in absolute number of cells. The general picture, however, remained much the same as for the absolute cell data. Overall, and especially given the relatively small number of individuals per group, the results quite strongly suggest that smoking itself generally stimulates anti-inflammatory HDAC2 expression, but is either modified by the COPD process or is exposing a group of individuals which responds differently to cigarette smoke without an anti-inflammatory HDAC2 response and is therefore vulnerable as a result to developing airway remodelling and fixed obstruction. Thus, there does seem a dichotomy between smokers who do or do not have COPD as suggested by Barnes et al, and our data is consistent with their suggestion that switching HDAC2 on or off may be the key to different outcome. Furthermore, ICS made no difference to percentage cell HDAC2 staining in COPD, so this is not a mechanism by which steroids offer some protection in the natural history of COPD.</p><p>Compared to the effects of ICS, quitting smoking may well have a potential for up-regulating HDAC2 at a cell level as shown by percentage increase in HDAC2 staining in the LP of COPD ex-smokers. Much of the effect seems related to change in total cell numbers but percentage cell staining also recovered compared to the actively smoking COPD group. We now need long term smoking cessation studies to confirm and tease out these findings.</p><p>The key finding of an increase in anti-inflammatory HDAC2 expression in the LP in normal lung function smokers but a decrease in those who have developed COPD, is also generally true for HDAC2 expression in the epithelium as well., although changes are smaller and would seem to be less biologically significant.</p><p>We cannot say at this stage which particular cell type(s) is decreased in the LP in smokers, or why, nor which cells are expressing HDAC2. For more information we need double staining studies for different cells in the lamina propria ie HDAC2 plus specific cell type markers. It has been suggested that in COPD there is increased cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0064833-Demedts1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Hodge1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which could perhaps be related to the finding of hypo-cellularity. Although, this is a controversial area, and is not clearly established, increased oxidative stress produced by tobacco smoke and protease&#x02013;antiprotease imbalance, and also genetic susceptibility, may contribute to increased apoptosis in COPD airways <xref rid="pone.0064833-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064833-Plataki1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In a recent study published by our group <xref rid="pone.0064833-Soltani1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> we found that there is a significant reduction in total number of vessels in the lamina propria in smoking/COPD, so decreased vascular supply might be a contributing factor to decreased cellularity in COPD airways or there may be another common underlying cause of hypo-cellularity and hypo-vascularity below the reticular basement membrane. This deserves further study.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that HDAC2 expression is increased in physiologically normal smokers but reduced in current smokers with COPD, though the latter finding is partly confounded by general decrease in cellularity in the LP. Quitting smoking may well have a real effect on up-regulating HDAC2 at a cell level, but it is not affected by ICS therapy. We need further comprehensive double-staining immunohistochemical studies to fully understand cellular changes in the LP and prospective long term smoking cessation studies to confirm these specific findings. Molecular methods, as exclusively published in the past on this topic of HDAC2 in the airways, cannot fully take account of such changes in the cellular environment<xref rid="pone.0064833-Glare1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and cannot be interpreted on simple face value. However, the proposition that HDAC2 activity is decreased in the airways in COPD does seem to be correct, with major implications for understanding the aetiology of this common disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064833.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
