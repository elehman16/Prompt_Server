Dead space volume in children because of the smaller tidal volume is more important. Anatomic dead space is age-dependent and is &#x0003e;3 ml/kg in early infancy. In adults, anatomic dead space is 2.2 ml/kg. Furthermore, airway closure and the formation of atelectasis are important contributors of gas exchange impairment during general anesthesia. Use external tools such as breathing airway filter can be affected on increasing gas exchange in this region and any external breathing airways instruments such as anesthesia machine and anesthesia breathing circuit can increase dead space and affect the value of dead space to tidal volume ratio.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Filters are designed to prevent microbial contamination of patient&#x02019; respiratory system.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, add filters may imbalance anatomic dead space and reinforce the impact of reduced CO<sub>2</sub> removal.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Rising of the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO<sub>2</sub>) 10 min after filter insertion when compared with PETCO<sub>2</sub> before intubation was significant in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>It is notable that the difference between PaCO<sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of filter significantly associated with weight and age.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Current airway technology had more developing in the World.

Filters increase arterial blood CO<sub>2</sub> tension and PETCO<sub>2</sub> and can be increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation, but some studies are demonstrated that increasing respiratory rate and tidal volume can decrease the PaCO<sub>2</sub> and PETCO<sub>2</sub> level, too.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the previous study, increasing of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) and also increasing of airway pressure remained controversial. Moreover, the effect of changing respiratory rate and tidal volume for correction of increasing ETCO<sub>2</sub> during anesthesia were not studied.</p><p>Then, the aim of this study was evaluation the effect of changing in tidal volume and respiratory rate on preventing the increase of ETCO<sub>2</sub> during inferior abdominal surgery with using of breathing airway filters in infants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized clinical trial study with a control group which was done during 2014&#x02013;2015 at AL Zahra Medical Center and Emam Hossin Pediatric Hospital Center in Isfahan. After approval of the ethical committee, 101 infants between 6 months and 2-year (6&#x02013;15 kg), with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status Classes I and II who were a candidate for inferior abdominal surgery presented for eligibility of our study and 96 of them agreed to participate in this single-blinded clinical trial study. All pediatric parents signed the consent form. Exclusion criteria included; previous heart diseases, respiratory and metabolic diseases history, needs for open chest surgery or any problem for difficulty in anesthesia.</p><p>With assuming at least 1.1 standard deviation (SD) for tidal volume in the control group and 0.8 for a significant difference between the control and the study groups, it was calculated that thirty patients in each group would require to achieve 80% power at 5% type I error.</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="JRMS-21-115-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Eligible patients were divided into three 32-member groups, using random allocation method.</p><p>The method of fluid therapy before surgery and fasting time was the same in the three groups. Premedication was induced with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg intravenously (Aburaihan, Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran). After transferring the child to the operating room, monitoring was done for the basic information (including respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure). General anesthesia induced after preoxygenation and by using, 5 mg/kg of sodium thiopental (Exipental, Exir Pharmaceutical Co., Rasht, Iran), 0.01 mg/kg atropine (Aburaihan, Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran) 0.5 mg/kg atracurium (Aburaihan, Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran), and 1 &#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl (Caspian Tamin, Pharmaceutical Co., Rasht, Iran) intravenously. Then intubation procedure performed. Maintenance of anesthesia was obtained with 50% of O<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>O and isoflurane1.5%.</p><p>All patients were observed for 10 min after tracheal intubation, and then filter was added to the respiratory system of the patient. We had three groups in our study; in first groups filter was added and patient observed only for PETCO<sub>2</sub> level during operation, in the second group after filter installation only respiratory rates was increased until PETCO<sub>2</sub> level became &#x02264;35 mmHg and in the third group, after filter installation, only tidal volume had been increased until PETCO<sub>2</sub> level became &#x02264;35 mmHg. We monitored every infant continuously, and if the PETCO<sub>2</sub> in all three groups increased to 50 mmHg and above, we removed filter and increased ventilation and excluded the subject from the study.</p><p>Basic values such as peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), tidal volume, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and PETCO<sub>2</sub> level had been evaluated after intubation, 10 min after intubation and 10 min after filter insertion.</p><p>Also surgery time, sedation time: (time that patients had been sedated), recovery time: (time that patients was arrived to the recovery room until the patients had been discharged of recovery room according to ALDERET score 9/10), and extubating time: (time between anesthesia vapor discontinued and extubation of the trachea) had been evaluated.</p><p>Data were collected, edited, and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 14 software.</p><p>Chi-square was used for descriptive analysis such as sex distribution and endotracheal tube size. ANOVA was used for comparison of demographic data such as age, duration of surgery, recovery time, and sedation time. Mean changes of tidal volume, respiratory rate, PETCO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate, and PIP were also analyzed by ANOVA. We used mean &#x000b1; SD for quantitative data and qualitative data; we used frequency and percent.
