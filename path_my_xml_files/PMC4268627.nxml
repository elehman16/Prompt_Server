It is probably the most devastating of all wounds, and, it imposes a serious burden on physical, mental, and socioeconomic conditions of the victim. It is estimated that, annually, about 11 million people over the world and 1 million people in India suffer from burn injuries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] According to a recent Indian study, mortality as high as 40.3% among 2499 burn patients was reported.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Infection is a major problem for burn injuries as it delays the normal process of wound healing by prolonging the inflammatory phase of the immune response. Accumulation of dead tissue on the wound bed serves as rich nutrient source for bacteria, which, coupled with immunosuppression and exhaustion of body's protein reserve enhances the chance of bacterial infection.</p><p>Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) has been the standard topical antimicrobial for burn wounds; however, it has some adverse effects such as argyria, leucopenia, hepatic, and renal toxicity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus it demands a new therapy options for better burn wound management. Metallic silver holds a unique position as a strong antimicrobial agent to which resistance is not encountered. The advent of nanotechnology has permitted conversion of metallic silver into its fine nanoparticle form. These nano-sized silver particles are more effective than its pure form against microbial organisms and holds the promise of making topical silver therapy more effective and better tolerated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Hence, we have conducted this study to compare the clinical efficacy of compound silver (SSD) and nano-sized metallic silver (nano-crystalline: AgNP) among 2&#x000b0; burn wounds management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Our study population comprised burn victims who were treated in a Burn Unit of a Tertiary Care Hospital at Kolkata, India. Period of study was from January 2011 to August 2012. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients during the study.</p><p>For the purpose of sample size calculation, the difference in duration of treatment for complete wound healing was considered as primary outcome measure. It was calculated that 64 subjects would be required per group in order to detect a difference of 5 days in this parameter with 80% power and 5% probability of type I error. This calculation assumed a standard deviation of 10 days for the complete wound healing parameter. From our earlier experience, 20% of subjects admitted to our burn unit are expected not to survive. Therefore, adjusting for dropouts, the recruitment target was kept at 80 subjects per group.</p><p>During this period, 106 patients aged between 5 and 60 years with 2&#x000b0; burn injury and 20&#x02013;60% total body surface area (TBSA) involvement were recruited from among 244 screened. Patients with superficial (1&#x000b0;) or full-thickness (3&#x000b0;) burn injury, pregnancy, and significant co-morbidities such as preexisting cardiac disease, renal disease or diabetes were excluded.</p><p>The study was designed as an open-label, prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Simple randomization sequence was generated by computer software. After allocation of patients in two different groups, SSD and AgNP gel were administered topically on every alternate day in respective group. Totally, 163 subjects were randomized of whom data were analyzed for 54 patients treated with 1% SSD cream and 52 patients treated with AgNP gel. The assessment period was 4 weeks for each type of treatment. However, time taken for complete wound healing was also recorded.</p><p>Since the time required for complete wound healing is directly proportional to the extent of TBSA and depth of tissue injury involved, all patients in both treatment groups were divided into two groups that is, (i). 20&#x02013;40% TBSA, (ii). 41&#x02013;60% TBSA involvement groups; each of which were further sub-divided according to the depth of tissue injury as 2&#x000b0; superficial and 2&#x000b0; deep-dermal burns. Of 52 patients, 31 (59.62%) 2&#x000b0; deep-dermal cases from AgNP group and 27 (50%) 2&#x000b0; deep-dermal cases out of 54 on SSD were studied for the assessment of wound healing.</p><p>Condition of all ulcers/wounds was assessed at weekly intervals by examining: &#x0201c;(i) Edge of the ulcer/wound; (ii) Type of necrotic tissue present inside the ulcer/wound; (iii) Amount of necrotic tissue present inside the ulcer/wound; (iv) Color of skin surrounding the ulcer/wound; (v) Type of granulation tissue and its amount present inside the ulcer/wound; (vi) Amount of wound healing by means of epithelization of the ulcer/wound&#x0201d; &#x02013; following photographic wound assessment tool (PWAT).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Besides various parameters in PWAT, (vii) Type of exudate inside the ulcer/wound; (viii) Amount of exudate inside the ulcer/wound; were also taken as determinants of burn wound healing, because, exudate increases the wound bio-burden and increases the need for dressing change, which, in turn, may delay wound healing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These were, therefore, taken into account as well. The eight determinants of wound healing are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Assessors assigned a score between &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;4&#x0201d; for each determinant; the total score for each wound was calculated by summing up the scores assigned to the various determinants. Lesser score implied better wound condition. Percentage of improvement was calculated by applying the following formula: (initial score &#x02212; final score)/initial score &#x000d7; 100. The outcome of treatment was categorized on the basis of percentage improvement as poor (0&#x02013;25%), moderate (26&#x02013;50%), good (51&#x02013;75%), or excellent (76&#x02013;100%).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Determinants of burn wound assessment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JBCP-6-29-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Silver sulfadiazine 1% cream was purchased under the trade name of DISILVA Cream Diamond Drugs Pvt.

In the case of superficial burns, when epidermis is destroyed leaving dermis and its elements intact, the skin virtually restores its epidermal cover within 7&#x02013;14 days without any complication. However, in 2&#x000b0; burn, only a part of dermis remains viable, and wounds take several weeks to heal. The healing process may be retarded by disintegrative necrosis of the upper dermis which is susceptible to bacterial infection. As a deep-dermal burn heals slowly, the chance for infection is more prolonged than superficial burns. In the addition, formation of necrotic slough provides a rich source of nutrition that enhances bacterial growth.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>A number of silver compounds with antimicrobials activity are used prophylactically to prevent infective complications in burn wounds. Among them, mafenide acetate 11.2% cream (e.g., sulfamylon) is one of the oldest effective topical antimicrobial agents; it has broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, with some antifungal properties and has good penetration through the eschar. But, mafenide cream is toxic to epithelial cells and fibroblasts and it can cause an allergic skin rash and being a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, it can also cause metabolic acidosis, so it is not preferred as a first-line antimicrobials ointment for burn wounds. Unlike mafenide or silver nitrate, SSD does not hinder epithelialization, although it does hamper contraction of fibroblasts. Furthermore, SSD is painless on application, has high patient acceptance, and is easy to use with or without dressing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Thus, SSD is widely used and has been considered as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; topical treatment for burn wounds and, therefore, it was selected as the active comparator in our study. However, it is not the ideal topical antimicrobial, because deep-dermal wounds usually heal slowly and there is suspicion that SSD may delay the process further,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and bacterial resistance to SSD has also been reported.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The sticky nature of the preparation can make the periodic dressing change process painful. Leukopenia, hepatic, and renal toxicity have also been documented following prolonged application of SSD.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Thus there is a need to continue the search for a superior antimicrobial with desirable effects on burn wound healing.</p><p>In recent years, with the advent of nanotechnology, pure form of silver can now be utilized as a topical treatment for burn wounds. The nanometer-sized particles are metastable in nature and thus more reactive than bulk form.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The high surface to volume ratio of the nanoparticles is another advantage as it allows the particles to remain effective even at a very low concentration. Thus minimizes the chance for tissue toxicity, if any. Several studies have reported a broad spectrum antibacterial as well as antifungal properties of nano-crystalline silver.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The mechanism may involve disruption of bacterial cell wall, blocking of DNA replication and deactivation of vital enzymes of bacterial respiratory system. Thus, nano-crystalline silver can be an effective barrier against microbial invasion and significantly decrease the risk of infection.</p><p>In addition to the superior antimicrobial action, AgNP has potential antiinflammatory effects, less tissue toxicity, analgesic property and faster wound healing by achieving moist condition under a scab and there is already evidence to suggest that AgNP formulations can achieve better wound outcome than conventional silver preparations, and this may be in ways beyond just excellent antimicrobial action.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Our results suggest that significantly faster and improved wound healing can be achieved by topical application of nano-crystalline silver (AgNP) as compared to conventional SSD. This is particularly true of 2&#x000b0; deep-dermal wounds. However, complete wound healing time extends beyond 4 weeks and generally requires 6&#x02013;8 weeks or even more. This is in agreement with earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] No adverse effects were encountered, and there was no instance of argyria.</p><p>To conclude, nano-crystalline silver (AgNP) can be an effective and superior alternative to SSD in the management of burn wounds, particularly 2&#x000b0; deep-dermal burns. Healing can be expected, in general, in 6&#x02013;8 weeks time, depending upon the extent of body surface involvement.
