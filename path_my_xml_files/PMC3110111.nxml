which mental and physical exercise may slow cognitive decline in adults with early signs of cognitive impairment is unknown. This article provides the rationale and methodology of the first trial to investigate the isolated and combined effects of cognitive training (CT) and progressive resistance training (PRT) on general cognitive function and functional independence in older adults with early cognitive impairment: Study of Mental and Regular Training (SMART). Our secondary aim is to quantify the differential adaptations to these interventions in terms of brain morphology and function, cardiovascular and metabolic function, exercise capacity, psychological state and body composition, to identify the potential mechanisms of benefit and broader health status effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>SMART is a double-blind randomized, double sham-controlled trial. One hundred and thirty-two community-dwelling volunteers will be recruited. Primary inclusion criteria are: at risk for cognitive decline as defined by neuropsychology assessment, low physical activity levels, stable disease, and age over 55 years. The two active interventions are computerized CT and whole body, high intensity PRT. The two sham interventions are educational videos and seated calisthenics. Participants are randomized into 1 of 4 supervised training groups (2 d/wk &#x000d7; 6 mo) in a fully factorial design. Primary outcomes measured at baseline, 6, and 18 months are the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), neuropsychological test scores, and Bayer Informant Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (B-IADLs). Secondary outcomes are psychological well-being, quality of life, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal function, body composition, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and anabolic/neurotrophic hormones, and brain morphology and function via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (fMRS).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>SMART will provide a novel evaluation of the immediate and long term benefits of CT, PRT, and combined CT and PRT on global cognitive function and brain morphology, as well as potential underlying mechanisms of adaptation in older adults at risk of further cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=83075">ANZCTRN12608000489392</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>With a forecast 100 million persons with dementia by 2050, this disorder presents a major challenge to sufferers, their caregivers, and the health care system, and delay of disease onset and progression is amongst the most pressing challenges for medical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A five-year delay in dementia onset and progression could halve disease prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and would have a significant impact on disease burden. The efficacy of pharmacological treatments to date have been limited to symptom control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and have not been effective in reducing disease onset, and so non-pharmacological preventative interventions are of great interest.</p><p>There is strong evidence from cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies that participation in mentally and physically stimulating activities is associated with decreased dementia prevalence and/or incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Experimental trials indicate that cognitive training can significantly improve performance in healthy adults on a range of cognitive tasks, with an average moderate effect size (ES) of 0.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; and that exercise interventions of as little as one week of aerobic exercise can result in improved memory, attention, and reaction time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Sustained improvements, particularly in executive function, have been shown after aerobic training (ES = 0.41), combined aerobic and resistance training (ES = 0.59), and resistance training alone (ES = 0.53), even after exercise was withdrawn in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Two studies to directly compare single and combined physical and mental exercise found effect sizes across a range of cognitive outcomes to be much larger in the combined condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both of these studies had design flaws, including very small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and high dropout rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], limiting conclusions. Therefore, a robustly designed trial is required to investigate the comparative benefits of isolated and combined physical and mental training.</p><p>The mechanisms of benefit from physical and mental interventions are not clear, it has been postulated that physical and mental activity may therefore have potential to stimulate plasticity of the brain and possibly reduce dementia onset. Animal studies have demonstrated a range of positive neurobiological outcomes, including decreased inflammatory cytokines, decreased cortisol response to stressors, increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) into the brain, increased cerebral blood flow and angiogenesis, and increased hippocampal volume, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurogenesis, and synaptic density after memory-enhancing cognitive and exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Human data are more limited, but observations of responses to training have included increased blood flow, aerobic capacity, and region brain volume after behavioural and aerobic training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and improved brain chemistry using magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) in our pilot work with cognitive training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There are fewer human data available on the possible cognitive-enhancing mechanisms of resistance training, with findings of no changes in BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and increases in IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Animal and human exercise trials indicate that exercise may improve brain function via two pathways; directly through the induction and regulation of growth factors (e.g., BDNF, IGF-1), and/or indirectly via the modulation of systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, rigorous clinical trials investigating the central and peripheral synergistic benefits of exercise for improved brain function are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Consequently the Study of Mental Activity and Regime Training trial (SMART) was designed and implemented to examine the isolated and combined benefits of cognitive training and resistance training, and to provide novel, comprehensive data on possible proposed links between cognitive improvement and brain and whole-body-adaptation to resistance and cognitive training.</p><p>Most cognitive and exercise training trials have targeted healthy, cognitively intact adults. The most vulnerable individuals at highest risk for cognitive decline, however, are those with early cognitive impairment and co-morbid diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (i.e. metabolic syndrome). We are therefore deliberately excluding high functioning volunteers and targeting a highly clinically relevant population, with evidence of early cognitive impairment and various cardiovascular risk factors. These individuals may not be capable of the moderate or high intensity aerobic training that has been shown to be effective in animal and human trials. Resistance training, which has a larger effect size in the literature (0.53) than isolated aerobic training (0.41), and comparable to combined aerobic/resistance training (0.59), may be a more realistic exercise option in this cohort, as it is more feasible in elders with frailty and mobility impairment, thus having the potential for long-term adherence. We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and others have shown that resistance training results in many beneficial adaptations in older adults that may be relevant to the mechanisms underlying its putative cognitive benefits. These adaptations (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), many of which will be studied in this proposal (particularly changes in fitness, inflammation, and body composition) would not be anticipated after exposure to cognitive training alone, consequently the SMART trial will enable investigation of the efficacy of combining these two distinctly different training paradigms.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Theoretical model of mechanisms linkage between progressive resistance training, cognitive training, and cognitive and functional outcomes</bold>.

In addition to the selection of general cognitive, functional, physical, mood symptoms and quality of life outcome measures will also be assessed to identify the extent of transfer of benefits of our interventions.</p><sec><title>Objectives and Hypothesis</title><p>The primary objective of the SMART trial is <italic>to determine whether cognitive, physical or combined cognitive and physical training can prevent or slow cognitive and functional decline in vulnerable older adults at high risk of dementia</italic>.

Six months of supervised cognitive training (CT) will significantly improve cognitive function, as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and independence of function as assessed by the Bayer Informant -Activities of Daily Living (BIADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] at both 6- and 18- month follow-up, relative to a sham training control condition.</p><p>2. Six months of supervised high intensity progressive resistance training (PRT) will significantly improve cognitive function, as assessed by the ADAS-Cog, and independence of function as assessed by the Bayer Informant -Activities of Daily Living (BIADL), at both 6- and 18-month follow-up, relative to a sham training control condition.</p><p>3. The combination of CT and PRT will be significantly superior to either intervention in isolation for cognitive and functional benefits.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Hypotheses</title><p>1. All active training interventions will improve brain morphology and biochemistry compared to the sham control condition, as defined by: increased hippocampal volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) by MRI scanning; positive localised Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) brain changes (z-score relative change); decreased whole brain volume of White Matter Hyper-intensities (WMHs) (mm<sup>3</sup>); and lead to beneficial hippocampal and posterior cingulate MRS metabolite changes (% increase in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in phosphocreatine metabolites).</p><p>2. All active training interventions will improve secondary cognitive outcomes, in the domains of attention, memory, fluency, and executive function, relative to the sham control condition, and combined training will be superior to either single intervention.</p><p>3. All active training interventions will maintain global clinical impression scores, as defined by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, relative to the sham control condition.</p><p>4. PRT exercise will preferentially decrease inflammatory markers, insulin resistance, and central adiposity and increase fitness (strength and aerobic capacity), muscle mass, and functional mobility, compared to either cognitive or sham control condition.</p><p>5. Cognitive and physical training will produce positive effects on psychological health and quality of life above and beyond the non-specific effects seen after sham control condition.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>The SMART trial is a longitudinal double-blind, sham training-controlled, randomized clinical trial adhering precisely to CONSORT guidelines <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org">http://www.consort-statement.org</ext-link> for the conduct and reporting of clinical trials, as extended to non-pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The assumptions are as follows: our meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and review of published RCTs in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reveal Effect Sizes (ES) for a range of cognitive outcomes of approximately 0.60 for cognitive training, 0.59 for aerobic/resistance training, and 0.53 for resistance training, compared to 0.15 for control groups. However, as we are enrolling a cohort with early cognitive impairment, we anticipate a decline of approximately this magnitude (ES = 0.15) over 12 months in our sample, so that the sham control condition would merely offset that decline (ES = 0.0). Thus, we have conservatively powered the study to show an ES of 0.53 for the main effects of both CT and PRT vs. control (n rounded up to 30/group &#x000d7; 4 = 120 required for 4-cell factorial design).</p><p>The only two published studies of <italic>combined mental and physical training </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed average ES = 0.94 for combined training compared to mental training alone and ES = 1.27 for combined training compared to exercise training alone. Therefore, we have ample power (99.7%) to find a difference of this magnitude between our combined training (n = 30) and isolated training groups (n = 30). Reported dropout from drug trials in MCI is 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] however our experience in fully supervised training of older adults with frailty/chronic disease dropout averages 10-15% over 12 months. Therefore, we will inflate sample size needs for approximately10% drop out rate to account for anticipated attrition (n = 132), and we will recalculate these sample size needs in interim analysis after the first 50 participants have completed 6 months intervention and revise ES and sample size needs if required.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening procedure</title><p>Potential participants undergo initial telephone interview and screening using the 13-item modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], inclusion score between 21-30/39 to exclude high cognitively functioning individuals.

In order to take advantage of the enhanced attention and learning exhibited after an acute bout of exercise in both animal and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but not enhance adaptation to sham cognitive training, PRT will proceed CT, and will follow sham CT.</p><p>Within each small group (maximum 10) participants follow the program tailored to their individual functioning level, with constant oversight by trainers. Make-up sessions are allowed for participants who miss CT and PRT sessions to achieve as close to 52 (26 &#x000d7; 2) sessions as possible within the 26 week intervention period. Each training group will have 1-2 trainers present at the session. The background of the trainers is in exercise physiology or physiotherapy, and the specific techniques of CT and PRT to be administered are learned from the investigators of this study (NG, MV, MFS).</p><p>Throughout the 18- month trial participants are provided with log books to document their social and recreational activities per day and are called weekly for telephone administration of a health status checklist. At the completion of the 6- month intervention participants are not given ongoing access to the training or advice as to what to do. Following assessments at 6 and 18 months participants receive a token reward (movie tickets or store voucher) for their participation.</p><sec><title>Cognitive Training Intervention (+ Sham physical)</title><p>Cognitive training (CT) intervention involves computer-based multimodal and multi-domain exercises targeting memory, executive function, attention and speed of information processing. The training uses the COGPACK program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], developed for neuro-rehabilitation and used in a previous research trial with MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A total set of 14 exercises have been selected including six tasks of visual and verbal explicit memory ('Reading', 'Memory for names', 'Memory for shopping list', 'Memory for forms', 'Memory for route', 'Memory for traffic signs'), four tasks of executive function ('Anagrams', 'Sequence', 'Logic blocks', 'Logic') and four attention and speed tasks ('Reaction', 'Connect' UFOs' and 'Search'). The training schedule was pre programmed with 4 exercises being administered at each 45-minute training session. Training sessions are completed in a group setting with up to 10 computer work stations, and simple touch screens to avoid training difficulties in the computer-na&#x000ef;ve.</p></sec><sec><title>Progressive Resistance Training (+ Sham cognitive)</title><p>Progressive resistance training (PRT) is supervised by experienced research assistants (exercise physiologists and physiotherapists) in a medically-supervised clinic (University of Sydney Health Sciences) at a ratio of 1 trainer for 4-5 subjects. The specifics of the high intensity training intervention are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Participants are progressed continuously throughout the 6-month intervention, guided by daily ratings of perceived exertion (15-18 on the Borg Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and 1RM's every 3 weeks to maintain intensity at 3% from 80 to 92% of current maximum capacity). Maximization of potential cognitive- enhancing effects of the PRT is supported by introduction of novel exercise after every 8 sessions and encouraging visualisation, counting out loud, and imagery of the muscle repetitions contracting during rest intervals.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Progressive Resistance Training Methodology</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Exercise</th><th align="left">Equipment</th><th align="left">Frequency</th><th align="left">Volume</th><th align="left">Intensity progression</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Routine</td><td align="left">Seated Chest press</td><td align="left">Digital K400 Keiser pneumatic resistance machines (Keiser Sports health Equipments, Inc.

For each time point, brain structure is assessed using a T1-weighted whole brain scan (sequence: T1TFE; TR/TE: 6.39/2.9 ms; slice thickness 1.0 mm without gap; field of view: 256 &#x000d7; 256; resolution 1 &#x000d7; 1 mm) and a T2 FLAIR scan (sequence: TIR; resolution: 0.488 &#x000d7; 0.488 &#x000d7; 3.5 mm; TR/TE = 10,000/110 ms). <sup>1</sup>H-MRS follows in two volumes of interest: left hippocampus (20 mm M/L, 15 mm D/V, 30 mm A/P, oriented along the hippocampus) and posterior cingulate grey matter (20 mm M/L, 20 mm D/V, 20 mm A/P) using the PRESS sequence (TE/TR = 30/2000 ms, 1024 points, 256 averages).

However, we acknowledge the potential bias of any method of imputation [last observation carried forward (LOCF), mean of group, expectation maximization algorithm (EM)] or restriction to observed cases (complete case analysis). Therefore, we will make all attempts to retrieve data from dropouts by obtaining final measures regardless of intervention participation or compliance, and will use the EM method for data missing at random. In addition, we will compare characteristics of dropouts to completers and perform secondary sensitivity analyses (completers, and per-protocol analyses) to examine potential for dropouts and imputation to bias the results.</p><p>Mixed modelling of 6- and 18-month outcomes, adjusted for baseline values and any potential confounders identified will be constructed to test our primary and secondary hypotheses. We will test for main effects of CT and PRT, as well as for the interaction term (CT &#x000d7; PRT) to identify isolated and combined training arm significance and effects sizes. Relationships of interest and risk factors for changes in cognitive function and other secondary outcomes will be analysed with simple and multivariate linear and logistic regression models as appropriate. Weighted mean differences, 95% Confidence Intervals and Effect Sizes will be calculated for all outcomes, and clinical meaningfulness will be assessed in light of available data on the expected annual rates of change in this cohort for all known primary and secondary outcome variables.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We originally estimated the need for a sample size 10% larger than our expected effect size required (n = 132). With our retention rate of &#x0003e;90% to date our recruitment target remains appropriate 120/.90 = 133. Thus, we have recruited 80/133, 60% of our planned cohort to date. Compliance with training sessions to date has been high for all groups with median compliance ranging from 78.44% for sham physical/CT to 100% for PRT/CT. Furthermore there has been one adverse event reported thus far (one rotator cuff injury managed conservatively) in PRT group, and no adverse events during assessments, CT, or sham interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>Recruitment of subjects has been challenging, with less than 4% of contacts recruited, and 12 telephone screening interviews required for each subject enrolled. However, the most common reasons for ineligibility have been lack of cognitive impairment, or being too physically active, rather than medical exclusions, attesting to the potential generalizability of this volunteer sample to typical older adults with multiple stable chronic illnesses and mild cognitive impairment.</p><p>Our primary outcomes of global cognitive status and functional independence are anticipated in 2012. This information will provide novel and robust evidence for the efficacy of cognitive and strength training on cognition and functional status in at risk older adults. This study conforms to all CONSORT criteria for the reporting of RCTs, making it relatively unique in the field to date. Furthermore, the SMART trial will provide valuable information on the persistence of training benefits after cessation of training at 18 months. Recording participant social and recreational activities will also enable SMART to examine the impact of training post intervention on leisure activity, and control against potential confounding effects of participants independently pursuing physical exercise and mental activities.</p><p>Our secondary outcomes will enable the first comprehensive investigation of the relative and combined benefits of physical and cognitive training on brain morphology and function, anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, quality of life, body composition, cardiovascular risk profile, aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness, and metabolic health. These outcomes will not only provide evidence of the potentially broad benefits of the SMART interventions in this cohort, but also clarify the hypothesized mechanisms contributing to any observed cognitive outcomes.</p><p>In summary, SMART will test a non-pharmacological preventative intervention that targets older adults at high risk of cognitive decline. By implementing a regime of physical and mental exercise, we aim to empower the individual, contribute to their physical, cognitive and psychological health, and ultimately improve quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest.
