There is a theoretical basis for ameliorating the immune response with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is supported by empirical evidence of a beneficial response following its use in the treatment of viral and autoimmune encephalitis. In immune-mediated encephalitis, IVIG is often used after a delay (by weeks in some cases), while diagnosis is confirmed. Wider use of IVIG in infectious encephalitis and earlier use in immune-mediated encephalitis could improve outcomes for these conditions. We describe the protocol for the first ever randomised control trial of IVIG treatment for children with all-cause encephalitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>308 children (6&#x02005;months to 16&#x02005;years) with a diagnosis of acute/subacute encephalitis will be recruited in &#x0223c;30 UK hospitals and randomised to receive 2 doses (1&#x02005;g/kg/dose) of either IVIG or matching placebo, in addition to standard treatment. Recruitment will be over a 42-month period and follow-up of each participant will be for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome is &#x02018;good recovery&#x02019; (score of 2 or lower on the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended&#x02014;paediatric version), at 12&#x02005;months after randomisation. Additional secondary neurological measures will be collected at 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks after discharge from acute care and at 6 and 12&#x02005;months after randomisation. Safety, radiological, other autoimmune and tertiary outcomes will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has been approved by the UK National Research Ethics committee (South Central&#x02014;Oxford A; REC 14/SC/1416). Current protocol: V4.0 (10/03/2016). The findings will be presented at national and international meetings and conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration numbers</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02308982?term=nct02308982&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02308982</ext-link>, EudraCT201400299735 and ISRCTN15791925; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADEM</kwd><kwd>autoimmune</kwd><kwd>encephalitides</kwd><kwd>immune-mediated</kwd><kwd>GOSE-Peds</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001922</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/212/15</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of early intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment in encephalitis from any cause in children, aiming to recruit a large sample size (N=308) across 30 hospitals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outcome measures will use robust validated and internationally accepted assessment tools and all trial data will be assessed by blinded investigators.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The trial is expected to provide data on the role of IVIG in reducing poor outcomes following encephalitis from any cause, which would impact on care pathways and individual patient decisions within the health services community, in the UK and internationally and will also inform on health and social care costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expected recruitment has been based on the reported UK incidence of encephalitis and a high and consistent recruitment rate is required across all centres due to the low disease incidence.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Infections, usually viral, are the most common cause of acute encephalitis, where the cause is identified. Immune-mediated forms of encephalitis, usually characterised by the detection of neuronal antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have been described, although the proportion is not yet clear.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

Encephalitis also imposes a substantial economic and resource burden on healthcare services. A review of encephalitis admissions to paediatric intensive care units showed an average length of stay of 4.3&#x02005;days, with 75% of children requiring ventilation, and some requiring cardiovascular support (17%) and renal dialysis (6.5%).(Unpublished observations. Iro MA. A population based observational study of childhood encephalitis in children admitted to paediatric intensive care units in England and Wales). A UK study of encephalitis hospitalisations reported a mean length of stay of 34&#x02005;days and a cost to the National Health Service of &#x0003e;&#x000a3;40 million/year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Notwithstanding the aetiology, the common pathophysiological process in infectious and autoimmune encephalitis is brain inflammation. There is evidence that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has a beneficial role in encephalitis from its therapeutic and prophylactic use in enteroviral encephalitis in the immunocompromised and in outbreaks of enterovirus-71 infections in Asia,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> as well as other infectious causes of encephalitis.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Acute immune treatment, including IVIG, also appears to benefit adults and children with autoimmune encephalitis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated IVIG efficacy in a number of neurological conditions that share similar underlying inflammatory mechanisms to encephalitis even if different aetiologies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> IVIG appears to inhibit complement binding, neutralise pathogenic cytokines, downregulate antibody production and modulate phagocytosis and T-cell function.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>In clinical practice, the use of IVIG in encephalitis varies. In the immune-mediated forms of encephalitis, IVIG is often used after a period of delay (by weeks in some cases), while the diagnosis is being confirmed. In other cases, IVIG is used as a last treatment option, usually after several days from hospital admission, where clinical improvement is slow. This delay may limit its benefit due to the brain inflammation, which has already occurred. The variation in practice is due to a lack of class 1 evidence to support the use of IVIG in encephalitis and it is currently unknown whether the wider use of IVIG in infectious encephalitis and earlier use in immune-mediated encephalitis could alter the outcome of this group of conditions. There is therefore the need to fill this evidence gap.</p><p>At present, there are no robust controlled trials in children to inform on the optimal treatment of encephalitis. Given the available evidence of possible beneficial role of IVIG, it is therefore important to undertake a trial to investigate the effect of IVIG for all children presenting with encephalitis, and optimise the use of this expensive and limited resource.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Trial objectives and design</title><p>The <italic>I</italic>mmuno<italic>g</italic>lobuli<italic>N i</italic>n the <italic>T</italic>reatment of <italic>E</italic>ncephalitis (IgNiTE) trial is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm, RCT that will evaluate whether early treatment with IVIG provides benefit for children with a diagnosis of encephalitis, when compared with standard therapy alone.

The GOS-E Peds is a modified version of the GOSE, a gold standard for measuring traumatic brain injury outcome in adults. The GOS-E Peds provides a developmentally appropriate structured interview necessary to evaluate children across different age groups, and it provides a valid measure of outcome in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents. Its use has been validated and found to be sensitive to severity of injury and to recovery over time, at least 6&#x02005;months after brain injury and has been suggested as useful in guiding treatment in the early phases of recovery from brain injury.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A strong correlation is also seen with parent report of functional outcomes and also with most performance-based cognitive tests for younger and older children. A 6-month assessment has also been chosen (see secondary objectives) as this has the advantage of improved trial retention, and earlier impact assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Secondary and tertiary outcomes</title><p>These are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012356TB1">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012356TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Secondary and tertiary outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data collection time point</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome measure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><italic>Secondary outcomes</italic></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Clinical and neurological</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;During hospital inpatient stay</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The sample size calculation is based on the assumption that detection of at least 20% difference from 43% in the &#x02018;good recovery&#x02019; rate (ie, GOS-E-Peds score 2 or lower) by 12&#x02005;months after randomisation is likely to be clinically significant. This is similar to a large observational study on autoimmune encephalitis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Based on this assumption, a total of 308 participants (154 per group), which takes into account an attrition rate of &#x0223c;10%, will provide 90% power and 5% level of significance for a two-sided test.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Recruitment plan</title><p>A flow chart showing the process of patient recruitment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012356F1">figure 1</xref>.

Only if consent for this is granted will a member of the trial team contact the family. A member of the trial team will check the patient's eligibility with the parent/guardian/legal representative, after which they will be provided with the participant information sheet (PIS), if the patient is eligible, and given sufficient time to read this and make a decision regarding participation in the trial. The investigator must obtain informed consent and assent (where applicable and obtainable) before the patient undergoes any trial procedure(s). Once appropriate consent and assent (where applicable and obtainable) have been obtained, the patient will be enrolled to the trial by assigning them a participant number using the next available number from the prepopulated enrolment log.</p><p>To maximise achievability of the sample size, we have included mostly tertiary paediatric units that are well placed to recruit rapidly a high number of participants. Potential barriers to recruitment will be identified during the pilot phase of the trial, and close support will be provided to sites with recruitment difficulties. A robust system will be put in place to monitor recruitment to ensure that this is on target. A contingency plan will also be put in place to allow for opening of additional sites in the unlikely event of a less than expected recruitment. A &#x02018;Screening log&#x02019; of all screened patients will be kept and will include patients with a diagnosis of encephalitis but are not eligible, eligible patients who refuse to be approached or may not be suitable to be approached, as well as those for whom consent was declined. The reason(s) why a patient is not enrolled will be clearly documented in the screening log, including reasons for declined consent, where this is provided.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Randomisation</title><p>After eligibility is confirmed and consent (and assent where applicable) obtained, enrolled participants will be randomised as soon as possible to allow early administration of the trial treatment in line with the protocol. Randomisation will be performed using a fully validated online randomisation system developed by the Primary Care and Vaccines Collaborative Clinical Trials Unit, University of Oxford, and during working hours when the trial treatment are available. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control group. Only trained research staff with appropriate access and who are on the IgNiTE trial delegation log will be able to randomise patients. The incidence of encephalitis is higher in infants and some forms of encephalitis are more prevalent in certain age groups. In addition, as part of standard care, patients with inflammatory encephalopathy may receive steroid treatment, which may have a beneficial effect. Therefore, to ensure balance between the trial groups, and account for steroid use as confounding variable, randomisation will be stratified by age group n=5 (&#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;4, 5&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;14 and 15+ years), and steroid use (yes/no) at the time of enrolment, and using randomly varying block sizes. A computer-generated randomisation code at the time of randomisation will ensure concealment of allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Withdrawal from trial treatment</title><p>The participant will be discontinued from the trial treatment at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason including:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ineligibility (either arising during the trial or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening),</p></list-item><list-item><p>significant protocol deviation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>significant non-compliance with treatment regimen or trial requirements,</p></list-item><list-item><p>an adverse event (AE) which requires discontinuation of the trial treatment or results in inability to continue to comply with trial procedures,</p></list-item><list-item><p>disease progression which requires discontinuation of the trial treatment or results in inability to continue to comply with trial procedures.</p></list-item></list></p><p>A participant may also voluntarily withdraw from the trial treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE, or for other reasons if they wish.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Blinding</title><p>IgNiTE is a double-blind trial and a rigid blinding process will be in place throughout the trial to ensure validity of the data collected. Participants and their parents/guardians/legal representatives as well as all research staff involved in any aspect of the trial conduct, including recruitment, administration of trial treatment, carrying out trial assessments, data collection and entry, sample and statistical analyses, will be blinded to treatment allocation throughout the entire trial period. There will be separate monitors for blinded and non-blinded data. The active treatment and placebo will be visually identical (packaged and labelled in the same manner) and administered at the same dose and infusion rate to maintain blinding. To be able to manage trial treatment stock effectively and minimise wastage, the clinical trials pharmacists at each recruiting site who are independent of the trial will be non-blinded. The tear off section of the label will inform the dispensing pharmacist of the true nature of the contents (IVIG or placebo). At dispending, this section of the label will be removed to maintain blinding.</p><p>Unblinding of treatment allocation will occur only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment received is absolutely essential for further management of the participant. Unblinding will be performed via the online randomisation system. The decision to unblind a participant's treatment allocation will be solely that of the site investigator. Only individuals given access to unblind will be able to do this and will include the site pharmacist, principal investigator and coinvestigators. Where there is a problem with Sortition, unblinding will be available via either the site pharmacist (during work hours) or a non-blinded staff member in Oxford (out of hours) who is independent of the trial, both of whom will have secure access to the master randomisation list for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Trial data will be collected by delegated research staff with appropriate training using two methods: (1) a paper-data capture form and (2) an electronic case report form (CRF), OpenClinica which is a password-protected, web-based database with accountability records that is stored on a secure sever within the UK.

No further data will be collected. Data collected up until the point of withdrawal from the trial will be analysed unless the parent/participant decides against this. If a participant is withdrawn due to an AE, the investigator will follow this up until it resolves or stabilises. All participants who are withdrawn from trial treatment (see the Withdrawal from trial treatment section) will remain in the trial and followed up as per the trial protocol, but will not have any invasive procedures performed. The trial data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; therefore, all withdrawals, either from the trial or from the trial treatment, will be reported and included in the data analyses. All protocol deviations will also be reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Study data</title><sec id="s2o1"><title>Data management</title><p>Data management will be via the OpenClinica database. All relevant data recorded elsewhere (see data collection methods) that are required to achieve the trial objectives will be transferred on to the OpenClinica database from where they can be downloaded for analysis. To maintain a high-quality standard of data entry, the database will be tested and validated prior to use. In addition, research staff will receive appropriate level training on data collection and entry and there will be regular monitoring of trial data throughout the trial. Furthermore, prior to data analysis, the database will be locked for cleaning to ensure that data are complete and reliable. Research staff at the various recruiting sites will be contacted to provide information on any missing data and to clarify any errors identified. All trial documents will be retained and stored securely in accordance with GCP after the completion or discontinuation of the trial for 3&#x02005;years after the youngest participant turns 18&#x02005;years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary statistical analysis will be carried out on the basis of ITT. After randomisation, participants will be analysed according to their allocated treatment group irrespective of what treatment they actually receive. However, a further modified ITT analysis will be performed excluding participants found to be ineligible in retrospect.</p><p>Data analysis will be performed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures, that is, to incorporate all outcome data collected during the 12&#x02005;months follow-up, in order to apply the ITT principle as far as possible and to account for potential biases arising from loss to follow-up. The model will include treatment group, time, treatment-by-time interaction and baseline covariates. An unstructured correlation matrix will be used to model the within-participant error correlation structure. An appropriate contrast will be specified to test for treatment efficacy between randomised groups at 12&#x02005;months. Various sensitivity analyses will be performed using other imputation methods, as well as analysis of 12-month data cross-sectionally, to test whether the results are robust to different assumptions about the missing data. The primary ITT analysis will account for steroid use before randomisation as a covariate. As required, the impact of posthospitalisation course including the use of concomitant and/or different immune treatments and period of neurorehabilitation on the primary outcome will be investigated in an exploratory analysis.</p><p>The results from the trial will be prepared as comparative summary statistics (difference in response rate or means) with 95% CIs. All the tests will be performed at a 5% two-sided significance level. A full detailed analysis plan (including plans for any interim analysis, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis) will be prepared and finalised before the first interim analysis.</p><sec id="s2p1"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy end point in this trial is &#x02018;good recovery&#x02019;, defined by GOS-E-Peds score 2 or lower, at 12&#x02005;months from randomisation. This will be analysed using a generalised linear mixed effect model, using data collected at discharge, 6 and 12&#x02005;months from randomisation. An interaction between time and randomised group will be fitted to allow estimation of treatment effect at each time point. The model will adjust for baseline values and other stratification factors (eg, age and steroid treatment at the time of randomisation).</p></sec><sec id="s2p2"><title>Secondary and tertiary analyses</title><p>As far as possible, we will use similar method for secondary and tertiary continuous outcomes collected at multiple time points or analysis of covariance for those collected at 12&#x02005;months only, adjusting for baseline measures (if collected) and any stratification variables. Otherwise, an equivalent non-parametric method will be used for outcomes that violate the normal distribution assumption. A log-binomial regression will be performed on binary outcomes with similar adjustment of baseline covariates. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact test will be used to analyse AEs and non-adherence.</p><p>Reporting of the trial findings will be in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>Analysis for the DSMC will be performed in accordance with the DSMC Charter. No interim efficacy analysis will be performed. Interim reports containing safety data, along with any other analyses that the committee may request, will be sent to the DSMC in strict confidence. Close monitoring to assess practical aspects of delivering the trial interventions and recruitment will also be undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial patients, monitoring the accumulating data and making recommendations to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) on whether the trial should continue as planned. The DSMC will comprise of a clinical chair, clinicians and a statistician, all of whom will be independent of the trial, the sponsor and funders. The role of the TSC is to provide overall supervision for the IgNiTE trial on behalf of the Trial Sponsor and the Trial Funder and to ensure that the IgNiTE trial is conducted according to the guidelines for GCP, Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and all relevant regulations and local policies. The TSC will comprise an independent chair, the chief investigator (CI), paediatricians and patient representatives. In discharging its safety role, the TSC will work in conjunction with DSMC for the IgNiTE trial. DSMC and TSC will meet prior to trial start and 6&#x02005;months thereafter. Increased frequency of meetings will be arranged depending on the requirements of the trial, DSMC and TSC recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s2s"><title>Stopping guidelines</title><p>This trial may be suspended or prematurely terminated by the sponsor, CI, regulatory authority or funder if there is sufficient reason to think that the safety of participants is affected by the trial procedures. Written notification, documenting the reason for trial suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to the investigator, funders and regulatory authorities. If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the CI will promptly inform the REC, MHRA and CSL Behring and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.</p></sec><sec id="s2t"><title>Harms</title><p>International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) definitions are used for AEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), adverse reactions (ARs), serious AEs (SAEs), serious adverse reactions (SARs) and suspected unexpected SARs (SUSARs). IVIG has a well-established side-effect profile. All participants will be monitored for (1) AESIs (includes anaphylaxis, haemolysis, new-onset seizure or abnormal movements not thought to be due to the encephalitis illness, thromboembolism, aseptic meningitis unrelated to the encephalitis illness, acute renal failure and any other medically significant events as determined by the investigator), in the first 5&#x02005;days following receipt of trial treatment, (2) SAEs up to 6&#x02005;months after randomisation, or up to 12&#x02005;months after randomisation where the event is judged directly related to the trial treatment and (3) deaths up to 12&#x02005;months after randomisation.</p><p>Monitoring and reporting of AEs will be performed by the site PI and research team, and will be recorded on the data capture form and uploaded to the eCRF (OpenClinica). The nature and severity of each AE, and the relationship to trial treatment will be documented. The expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the SmPC for Privigen or Human Albumin Solution. AESIs and SAEs will be reported to the CI and CSL Behring within 24 hours of the research staff becoming aware. The CI will notify the DSMC of all AESIs and SAEs. This will be expedited (within 24 hours of the CI becoming aware), for all AESIs and for all SAEs that are judged related to the trial treatment. Those that are judged to be unrelated to the trial treatment do not require expedited reporting to the DSMC.</p><p>The CI will report all relevant information about a suspected unexpected adverse reaction (SUSAR) that occurs during the course of the trial to the MHRA, CSL Behring, the relevant ethics committee and the DSMC. For fatal and life-threatening SUSARS, this will be performed no later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor or delegate is first aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information will be reported within 8 calendar days of the initial report. All other SUSARs will be reported within 15 calendar days. The CI or delegate will also inform all principal investigators concerned of relevant information about SARs that could adversely affect the safety of participants.</p><p>A summary list of all SAEs (including those unrelated to the trial treatment), AESIs and SUSARs will be provided in a safety report to the DSMC, which will be submitted at regular interval as specified in the DSMC Charter. In addition, a strict data sheet will be kept which will include the randomisation code aligned to the batch number of assigned IVIG product and in order to maintain a link between the participant and the batch of the product.</p></sec><sec id="s2u"><title>Pregnancy</title><p>Although not AEs, pregnancies are reportable events. Should a participant become pregnant during the trial, the trial treatment will be discontinued. Any pregnancy occurring during the clinical trial will be reported to the CI and CSL Behring within 24&#x02005;hours of the investigator becoming aware and will be followed up for an outcome, which will be recorded. If a congenital abnormality or birth defect is identified, this would fall within the definition of an SAE and will be reported as such.</p></sec><sec id="s2v"><title>Auditing</title><p>Regular monitoring by the trial sponsor or delegate will ensure compliance with GCP. The investigator sites will provide direct access to all trial-related source data/documents and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor and inspection by local and regulatory authorities. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source documents. Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The Quality Assurance manager will also maintain an internal audit programme, which will supplement the external monitoring process to ensure that systems relating to trial conduct, data recording, analysis and reporting are functional are in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The audit programme also includes laboratory activities taking into consideration the MHRA and EMA guidelines for GCP in the laboratory. The Sponsor may carry out audit to ensure compliance with the protocol, GCP and appropriate regulations. GCP inspections may also be undertaken by the MHRA to ensure compliance with protocol and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical and safety considerations</title><p>This trial has been approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (NRES) committee (South Central&#x02014;Oxford A; REC 14/SC/1416).

Parents/guardians/legal representatives or patients, where appropriate (ie, if the patient has capacity), will be allowed sufficient time to consider the information in the PIS, to seek independent advice and to consider participation in the trial. Informed consent (patients aged 16&#x02005;years and above) and assent (patients below 16&#x02005;years) will be obtained by trained research staff using an appropriately signed and dated informed consent/assent form, before any trial-specific procedures are performed. Given that children with encephalitis will be unwell and may be confused during the acute illness, it is likely that eligible patients would be unable to provide consent/assent prior to enrolment. Therefore, for patients aged 16&#x02005;years and above, informed consent will be obtained from their parent/guardian/legal representative. Once capacity is regained, appropriate consent/assent will be sought from all participants at follow-up time points and if this is not granted, they will be withdrawn from the trial. Participants who previously provided assent but turn 16&#x02005;years while still in the trial will be required to provide consent for ongoing participation in the trial and will be withdrawn if this is not granted.</p><p>Parents/guardians/legally authorised representatives/participants may be approached about a separate, ethically approved, Biobank study and asked if they would like to consent to this study using a separate consent form.
