Hence it is of great importance that the results are reliable and reproducible. However, artifacts related to abdominal activity frequently affect the accuracy. This is due to the fact that the two most commonly used radiopharmaceuticals: Tc99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (sestamibi) and Tc-99m tetrofosmin are both excreted by the hepatobilliary system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref></p><p>Due to the fact that the heart lies on the diaphragm just above the left lobe of the liver and in the vicinity of the bowel, attenuation and scattered radioactivity from these organs can interfere with both visual and quantitative interpretation and cause artifacts during reconstruction of SPECT images, especially in the inferior and infero-septal walls of the left ventricle. This is most commonly associated with rest or pharmacological stress studies in which the hepatic uptake is most marked, and it is also seen more frequently in women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref></p><p>Since the introduction of sestamibi, it has been recommended that a fatty meal be given to reduce interference from liver and gall bladder activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> The recent procedure guidelines adopted by the British Cardiac Society, however, state that the value of a fatty meal is uncertain and may be counter-productive if there is gastro&#x02013;duodenal reflux, or if the tracer reaches the transverse colon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref></p><p>Various proposals have been made to reduce extra-cardiac activity and its unwanted effects, with mixed results.

The rationale behind the use of erythromycin is the following. Erythromycin has been shown to increase gastric emptying, possibly by mimicking the effect of motilin after binding to the antral and duodenal motilin receptors. This leads to strong phase 3 contractions of the interdigestive motor complex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref> In addition, some studies have suggested that erythromycin stimulates gall bladder motility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>In our study, we sought to determine whether taking oral erythromycin prior to SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging with Tc99m-sestamibi would reduce the amount of interfering extra-cardiac activity and improve image quality and patient management.

The initial myocardial uptake of sestamibi is related to regional myocardial blood flow and is dependent on a mitochondrial-derived membrane electrochemical gradient. Sestamibi is predominantly excreted by the hepatobilliary system. Unfortunately, this mechanism of excretion is frequently the source of artifacts due to abdominal activity, which affects both observer interpretation and reconstruction. Various proposals have been made to overcome this problem in order to improve diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>Recently, a prospective, randomised trial with 86 patients and 82 controls was conducted to evaluate the use of metoclopramide.

Therefore the aim was to conclusively determine whether metoclopramide was useful in reducing artifacts related to abdominal activity in myocardial perfusion SPECT. In this study metoclopramide showed neither a qualitative nor quantitative impact on abdominal activity in myocardial perfusion imaging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref></p><p>The use of metoclopramide is based on the rationale that it is a prokinetic drug, which should enhance gastric clearance of Tc99m MIBI. However, a recent study failed to demonstrate any effect of metoclopramide on interfering extra-cardiac activity.</p><p>A study done recently by Cherng et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref> concluded that diluted lemon juice accelerated the transit of tetrofosmin through the liver parenchyma, leading to improved image quality on myocardial perfusion SPECT images. Prior to this, various studies had been done in order to evaluate the effects of water, milk, milkshakes, and fatty meals on imaging time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The rationale behind these protocols is the following:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02022; Clearance of activity located in the gall bladder and hepatic duct into the duodenum and bowel may be stimulated by fatty meals, milkshakes and intravenous cholecystokinin.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; Water and sandwiches have been used to fill the stomach and push the bowel away from the myocardium, thus exerting a volume effect. In addition, peristaltic gastric motility may be stimulated by oral consumption following pre-injection fasting, and the upper gastro-intestinal tract activity may therefore be diluted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref></p></list-item></list><p>A study by Peace and Lloyd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> evaluated the effect of imaging time, the radiopharmaceutical used, and full-fat milk or water on interfering extra-cardiac activity in myocardial SPECT in 260 patient acquisitions. The following conclusions were made from this study:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02022; The quantitative results indicated that oral administration of full-fat milk or water made no significant difference to extracardiac activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; There was no significant difference between tetrofosmin and sestamibi at any point.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; Delayed imaging significantly reduced extra-cardiac activity interfering with observer interpretation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; More importantly, however, was the development of a method to quantify the myocardial-to-extra-cardiac activity ratio, which correlated significantly with observer interpretation of myocardial perfusion studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Other studies performed</title><p>Boz <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> investigated the volume effect of the stomach in patients undergoing a same-day exercise&#x02013;rest protocol. After the rest study, patients were given either 200 ml of water and a sandwich or were fasted and imaged again within 30 mins. Quantitative and observer analysis showed significantly reduced activity inferior to the left ventricle in the meal group due to an expanded stomach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref></p><p>Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref> studied the effect of a milkshake taken either immediately after injection or just before imaging. An early drink decreased gallbladder activity, but had no effect on the liver parenchyma at 15 and 110 min. Patients drinking a milkshake just prior to imaging showed a prompt 26% reduction of activity inferior to the myocardium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref></p><p>Van Dongen and van Rijk qualitatively investigated the effects of administering 450 ml of water 10 mins before imaging and/or 150 ml of whole milk 10 mins after injection. Visual analysis showed significantly fewer patients with interfering activity when a milk-only protocol was used, compared with water only or no drink, for images reconstructed by FBP. A combined milk-and-water protocol showed the least number of studies with interfering activity, compared with water-only and milk-only protocols.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref></p><p>Most recently, Hara <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref> reported on the use of soda water (given in the form of a carbonated soft drink) in conjunction with adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging and in the Monzen position. (This is a body-positioning manoeuvre to increase the distance between the heart and the intestine by raising the left arm and curving the trunk slightly to the right.) According to their report, a carbonated beverage distended the stomach with gas and lessened artifacts from intestinal radiotracer activity. Additional benefits included the faster clearance of gas and a smaller amount of fluid needed to distend the stomach, which is especially desirable in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref></p><p>Interfering extra-cardiac activity therefore remains a significant problem and a limitation to accurate interpretation of myocardial perfusion imaging. In our study, interfering extra-cardiac activity was present overall in 54% of the stress images and 48% of the rest images, when the results were combined from all three observers for both groups. Almost all the stress studies were performed with Persantin, confirming once again the higher incidence of interfering activity on pharmacological stress studies.</p><p>In our Nuclear Medicine Department, the use of diluted lemon juice has replaced the former protocol of bread and milk. Lemon juice was perceived to reduce the amount of interfering activity significantly, although the effects of the two protocols were never formally compared. When evaluating the qualitative results of this study, lemon juice appeared to be superior in reducing the amount of interfering activity, with all three observers reporting less interference in the lemon juice group. However, this was not found to be statistically significant. The superiority of lemon juice in this setting might be explained solely on the basis of a much larger volume of fluid consumed, which might have led to stomach distension.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>The experimental design was sub-optimal, with individuals being exposed to the same intervention during both parts of the study (stress and rest). A better design might have been to expose individuals to both interventions on different days. However, the inherent differences in interfering activity on stress and rest studies (even in the absence of any intervention) present a diagnostic dilemma.</p><p>A third and even a fourth comparison group would have been helpful in validating the results with one group serving as a control (receiving no intervention) and the other receiving milk and bread (according to our previous protocol). However, considering the decrease in the amount of interfering activity perceived with the use of lemon juice, the addition of the latter two groups were considered to be unethical.</p><p>Upon final statistical analysis, the study appeared to be slightly underpowered, which could have resulted in a type II error. There were suspected errors during the randomisation process, which might have resulted in the higher incidence of dyslipidaemia in the erythromycin group. The calculation method of the MYO:EXT ratio as described by Peace and Lloyd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> could not be replicated exactly due to differences in acquisition parameters as well as the software used for image processing.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, the use of diluted lemon juice appeared to be beneficial in reducing interfering extra-cardiac activity in MPI studies where sestamibi was used. Furthermore, erythromycin should be considered as an alternative to lemon juice where patients find it more acceptable and in particular when taking into account the low cost and the low incidence of adverse effects.</p><p>Our secondary aim was to validate the method as described by Peace and Lloyd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> to quantify the amount of interfering extracardiac activity (MYO:EXT). A Xeleris workstation was used to select the raw anterior projection data and to create ROIs in a manner similar to the one described. The mean MYO:EXT value calculated in stress studies with interference was 1.12 compared to a value of 1.22 in stress studies without interference. Although these values correlated with the qualitative evaluation, in that scans without interference resulted in a higher value, the difference between these values was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.057).</p><p>The mean value determined on the rest images with interference was 1.08 and without interference it was 1.24. Here, a strong and statistically significant relationship was determined (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002). These results suggest that the use of the MYO:EXT in quantifying the amount of interfering extra-cardiac activity might be valuable. However, it seems likely that further confirmatory studies will be needed and that the quest for the reduction of interfering extra-cardiac activity continues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The difference between the effect of erythromycin and lemon juice on interfering extra-cardiac activity appears statistically insignificant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.36), and taking into account the better acceptability of erythromycin, this could be considered a suitable alternative to lemon juice. Furthermore, the use of the MYO:EXT ratio seems promising in our setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Sr Cecilia Corbett and the rest of the nursing staff and radiographers at the Nuclear Medicine Department of the Steve Biko Academic Hospital for the practical implementation of this study.
