exercise therapy on the recovery of hand function and the quality of life in chronic
stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 16 patients with chronic stroke were
selected and divided into two groups. Group I (n = 8) received task-oriented exercise
therapy and Group II (n = 8) received cognitive exercise therapy. This study was conducted
for eight weeks. Upper limb function was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA)
and manual function test (MFT); activities of daily living were assessed using the motor
activity log (MAL); and the quality of life was assessed using the stroke impact scale
(SIS). The pre- and post-intervention results of these tests were analyzed. [Results]
There were significant differences in all areas of upper limb function, activities of
daily living, and quality of life between the two groups. There were significant
differences between the two groups in the post-intervention upper limb function and
quality of life. [Conclusion] Application of cognitive exercise therapy was found to
effect functional recovery in stroke patients. Future research should focus on application
of cognitive exercise therapy in diverse populations, and assess its clinical
utilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Cognitive exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Upper extremity disorder, among the different neurological disabilities of stroke patients,
is the most common sequela, and according to the report by Rodgers<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, 85% of patients after the onset of a stroke experience
damaged upper limb function. The function of the upper extremities plays an important role
in the sophisticated task performance of activities of daily living<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and it is closely related to participation in social
activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; therefore, changes in upper
extremity function greatly affect patients&#x02019; quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a therapeutic approach to reduce the non-utilization of
the upper extremities and develop their functional movement is required<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent research has shown that the cognitive and physical areas have a close
relationship<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, but what is greatly
emphasized traditionally in neurological rehabilitation is mostly motor system, and
perceptual-cognitive perspectives of functions tend to be disregarded<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Perception-cognition includes attention. Such a loss of
attention decreases the technicality of dual tasks about stroke patients&#x02019; arm movements due
to reductions in autonomy of motor control and disorders in the motor mechanism of the
pyramidal tract<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Page et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that imagining and
imitating motions had positive effects on treatment because of performances based on past
experiences. Kim<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed there are
stages of attentive perceptions, memories, emotions, and behaviors between sensory input and
motor output process-regulating motor execution, and brain damage destroys each stage.
Furthermore, a specific rehabilitation therapeutic approach has yet not been developed for
each process. However, cognitive exercise treatment can support such content.</p><p>Cognitive exercise treatment has been presented by Carlo Perfetti of Italy, who introduced
a theory of the learning process based on Anokhin&#x02019;s theory of self-regulation of a
conditioned reflex. Cognitive exercise treatment is a motor learning model that emphasizes
high-level cognitive function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and
occurs through the integration of perception-cognition-activity processes, such as motor
regulation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Activation of the brain&#x02019;s
cognitive process, which represents perception, memory, attention, language, and decision,
is the core of the training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Jung<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported there were significant
differences in stroke patients&#x02019; speeds in stretching, quick reaction, and cognition of
distance between before and after cognitive motor treatment, and there was a synergetic
effect when cognitive-perceptual training was conducted together<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. When compared with traditional treatment, performance
improved in training with cognitive strategies, and exercise image protocol as a specific
cognitive strategy method was able to improve the mobility of stroke patients and their
upper limb function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive
rehabilitation, dual task training, training using computer games, and cognitive or
motor-cognitive interventions, such as virtual reality, might strengthen physical
functions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are diverse therapeutic approaches for stroke patients&#x02019; functional recovery, but
research on the effectiveness of cognitive exercise treatment approaches is still lacking.
Accordingly, this study intended to compare a task-oriented exercise treatment group and a
cognitive exercise treatment group to examine how such treatment methods affected the
paretic side upper extremity&#x02019;s functional recovery and patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study involved 16 chronic stroke patients. The criteria for subject selection are as
follows: Those who were diagnosed with hemiplegia resulting from a stroke and whose onset

allocate randomly subjects to either Group I (n = 8) or Group II (n = 8). Task-oriented
exercise treatment and cognitive exercise treatment methods in this study were used by
modifying the method by Lee<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Group I
conducted range of motion exercise of the shoulder joints and task-oriented exercise
treatment training, which involved moving the distal area after stabilizing the proximal
area, such as receiving manual therapy, moving and piling cups, putting up and down a
pegboard, moving a small ball, leafing through a book, threading beads, putting in rings,
putting coins in a coin bank, and writing letters.</p><p>Group II conducted cognitive tasks using spatial and tactile senses. They conducted
spatial tasks using tabulate, which was divided into three sections, bogen with markings,
and bridge of 12&#x000a2; arc with markings as tasks, which required identification using sensory
modes centered on distance, direction, form, and kinesthetic senses.</p><p>Tabulate allowed the therapist to adjust the degree of upper limb joints according to the
degree of perceiving the form by moving the fingers according to the shape of the panel
with the patient&#x02019;s eyes closed.</p><p>Bogen was used to determine and identify exercise range precisely, have the patient
perceive differences between fingers and the wrist, and for the therapist to move the
wrist and fingers so the patient identified the joint angle with the eyes closed.</p><p>Bridge was used to connect the thumbs with the surface of the bridge, thereby demanding
tactile identification or kinesthetic sensing by moving without contacting, thereby having
the patient recognize pronation and supination movements of the forearms. Finally, the
patient moved the upper limbs, as well as was asked about movement and directionality of
the joints for the joint angle perception training.</p><p>As tasks that required identification using sensory modes, such as pressure, weight,
tactile sense, and friction, sponge, tactile panel, and platform tactile tasks, were
conducted, the patient sat in a proper position with the eyes closed and the patient&#x02019;s
shoulder joint or elbow joint covered with a sponge. The therapist had the patient compare
differences between pressure sensations of the paretic and non-paretic side. The patient
was also asked to differentiate between the sponge hardness.</p><p>Diverse tactile panels with different qualities and shapes were prepared, and the patient
perceived differences in the surface quality by moving the fingers.</p><p>A platform was used for the identification of the wrist joint exercise. When the subject
was able to adjust the platform, different weights were attached and the subject was asked
to identify on which side a weight was hung. The patient was asked to identify differences
between several different weights. The patient was also asked to identify the height of a
stick placed below a platform or to identify the hardness of different cushions.</p><p>Training of the two groups was conducted five times per week, 60&#x02005;min each time for eight
weeks. Changes in upper limb functions were examined with the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA)
and manual function test (MFT). The FMA used only the upper limb assessment items. With a
three-point scale, when the patient was unable to perform, zero points were given, when
the patient was able to partially perform, one point was given, and when the patient was
completely able to perform, three points were given, with 66 points representing a perfect
score<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. MFT is comprised of an
exercise of the upper limbs (four items), figuring out (two items), and finger
manipulation (two items), and the score ranges from zero to 32 points<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the evaluation of daily living activities, the
motor activity log (MAL) was used. The MAL is classified into the quality of movement
(QOM) regarding whether the paretic side upper limb is qualitatively well used and
regarding the amount of use (AOU) on whether it is quantitatively used much. Such QOM and
AOU scores were on a six-point scale from zero point to five points and they may be
expressed in total scores by adding the scores of each item<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. To assess quality of life, the stroke impact scale (SIS) was
used. The SIS is composed of 60 questions: 59 questions (eight items) and one question
measuring the subject&#x02019;s stroke recovery degree. The score is given from one point at the
minimum to five points at the maximum. The item related to recovery after a stroke is
composed of zero points at the minimum to 100 points at the maximum<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. All assessments were carried out before and after
training.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test,
Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, and t-test were conducted for normality tests of the variables of the
subjects and their general characteristics. A paired t-test was used to analyze changes
within each group after training. An independent t-test was performed to examine changes
between the groups after training. A statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; =
0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The FMA and MFT, representing changes in upper limb functions, the MAL, representing

patients with hemiplegia after a stroke<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Miyamoto et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> noted the purpose of the exercise was an appropriate intervention
within the cognitive process of motor learning, such as perception, attention, memory,
visual sense, and language. Stimulating the physical and mental functions of a patient
together directly affects reorganization of the brain after damage<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and in the rehabilitation of patients whose brains were
damaged, cognitive and kinematic aspects should be considered<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study applied cognitive exercise treatment to
stroke patients, thereby examining its effects on upper limb function recovery and quality
of life, as well as proposing it as a strategy for treatment.</p><p>The FMA and MFT were performed to measure the effects on upper extremity functions, and
there were statistically significant differences between the two groups and a statistically
significant improvement after the experiment in both Group I and Group II. There was great
change in Group II, which showed that cognitive exercise therapy was effective for improving
paretic side upper limb functions.</p><p>Okita et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> observed the score of the
MFS, a 100-point conversion score of the MFT, improved by 44 points after cognitive exercise
treatment of the upper extremities, noting cognitive exercise therapy for the upper limbs
was an effective approach to promote the recovery of hemiplegic patients&#x02019; upper limb
functions. Miyaguchi and Okita<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> applied
upper limb cognitive exercise therapy to patients whose Brunnstrom stage was three and
achieved remarkable improvements in MFS scores, which was consistent with the result of the
present study.</p><p>Jung<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the speed of stretching,
quick reaction, and increase in distance activated cognitive processes to perceive precise
movements and inhibited abnormal elements into proper movements. Morioka et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that during spatial task
performance, a part of cognitive exercise therapy for healthy people, blow flow amounts in
the premotor cortex for motor learning and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex taking
charge of occupational memory function significantly increased. Such a result plays an
important role in adjusting muscular activity and movement, as well as learning and
remembering exercise techniques<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, cognitive task training, which applies contact and spatial tasks, may be more
effective for the recovery of abnormal motor functions.</p><p>A difference between cognitive exercise therapy and other treatment strategies is the
former places importance on changes in cognitive processes through internal observations.
Movement, language, attention, image, and learning aspects are determined together,
analyzing qualitative and quantitative elements. Motor function recovery is related to
cognitive processes of the brain and the quality of recovery depends on whether such
cognitive elements have been realized<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding changes to upper
extremity use frequency of the paretic side and in qualitative utilization according to the
result of measuring MAL during the performance of daily activities. Qualitative changes in
paretic side upper limb utilization amount and movement within each group showed significant
differences, with more changes in Group II.</p><p>Bang et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that motor
learning of the upper limbs improved stroke patients&#x02019; activities of daily living<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. There was a greater change in Group II
than in Group I, because by developing the ability to organize factors for spatial,
temporal, and intensity degrees in the exercise order necessary for interaction between the
body and the environment<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>, exercise
patterns of the paretic side qualitatively improved<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> and participation degree of daily life of the paretic upper limb
has enhanced.</p><p>Changes to quality of life in the two groups were measured using the SIS and there were
significant differences between the two groups. In addition, there were statistically
significant differences within each group after the experiment. Ahn et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that performance ability of the
paretic upper limb highly correlated with patients&#x02019; activities of daily living and quality
of life. Bae<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that decreases in
abnormal motor functions improved the degree of satisfaction with life, which is consistent
with the present study result. A high significance level in Group II suggests that
activation of diverse cognitive processes in patients allowed them to pay attention to their
body and express themselves, which positively affected their subjective thoughts about
physical and functional recovery by obtaining information on their movements and feelings
through internal observations.</p><p>The limitation of this study is it was conducted for a short treatment period of eight
weeks and post-evaluation to determine whether the effect of treatment continued was carried
out. In addition, the number of subjects was small and therefore, generalizing the outcome
of this study to stroke patients as a whole is difficult. Most previous studies are
case-based studies and it was not possible to compare the statistical significances of the
results. Moreover, materials to prove subjective changes patients feel themselves through
their actual movements to examine treatment effects of cognitive exercise therapy are
lacking.</p><p>The theory of cognitive exercise treatment will be able to be utilized to analyze patients&#x02019;
conditions from different viewpoints from existing treatment methods. Miyamoto et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> observed the effects of cognitive exercise
therapy as an innovative approach to promote hemiplegic patients&#x02019; motor recovery were
