Subjects were matched following a maximal effort (1-repetition maximum [1-RM]) bench press test, then were randomly assigned into a band CAT group or a chain CAT group. The athletes were under the direct supervision of a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) while they participated in a 5-week training phase that including bench-pressing twice per week. The 5-week band CAT or chain CAT phase was part of the larger 14-week off-season training program and occurred during weeks 6&#x02013;10. The athletes were experienced lifters who were familiar with the resistance training exercises included in the program and the maximal strength tests that were administered during the testing sessions. Upper body strength was measured by 1-RM bench press testing &#x0201c;pre&#x0201d; (week 5 of 14) and &#x0201c;post&#x0201d; (week 11 of 14) intervention.

None of the men had participated in band CAT or chain CAT training before this study. All were medically cleared for Intercollegiate Athletic participation and completed a medical history form; all had the risks and benefits explained to them beforehand and signed an institutionally approved consent form to participate. The George Mason University Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects approved all study procedures. Sustaining a musculoskeletal injury of the upper body or spine that prevented sports participation within 6 months prior to the study was grounds for exclusion from the study. Prior to strength testing, body height (Seca Stadiometer; Seca GmBH, Hamburg, Germany), and body mass and body composition (Tanita BC-418; Tanita Corporation of America Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA) were determined. Subjects were instructed to refrain from upper body exercise for 48 hours prior to each training or testing session. In an effort to maintain consistency across testing conditions, each subject was asked to consume his own identical diet for 24 hours prior to the pre- and posttesting sessions and to consume nothing but water (as needed) for 2 hours prior to the two testing sessions. Training and testing sessions for all subjects were conducted under the supervision of a CSCS, during the off-season training period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><sec><title>1-RM maximum strength</title><p>For evaluation, 1-RM bench press testing was conducted twice, to determine upper body strength. Pretesting occurred 1 week before the start of the 5-week band CAT or chain CAT program, in what was week 5 of the 14-week off-season training program. Posttesting took place following completion of the 5-week training phase, in what was week 11 of the 14-week off-season training program. Before beginning testing, the athletes completed a specific dynamic flexibility warm-up, which they were familiar with from off-season strength and conditioning training. Next, athletes completed a supervised (by the CSCS) warm-up before testing, to ensure that the intervention exercises were performed correctly. Standard weight lifting power racks (Power Lift<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Conner Athletic Products, Inc., Jefferson, IA, USA) were used for the 1-RM tests. The athletes took a timed rest of 3 minutes between maximal attempts. Weight was increased based upon the performance of the previous attempt, and the athlete continued to perform maximal effort attempts until failure or until it was determined the lifting form was compromised. After two failures, testing was stopped, and the best lift was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Off-season strength and conditioning training program</title><p>The athletes followed a 5-week band CAT or chain CAT bench press training phase that was included as part of the larger 14-week off-season strength and conditioning program designed and implemented by the CSCS who was assigned to baseball. Each group (ie, the band CAT and chain CAT groups) followed the same &#x0201c;periodized&#x0201d;, strength training program. All the athlete participants trained together as a team, in the varsity weight room during the baseball off-season (September&#x02013;December). Specifically, the athletes performed two whole-body lifting sessions, separated by 48 hours, per week for a total of 10 sessions over the 5-week training phase. Training sessions occurred at the same time and on the same days each week. To remain in the off-season program, the athletes were required to make up any missed workouts under the direction of their CSCS within 1 week of being absent. No workouts were missed during the 5-week band CAT or chain CAT training phase. Athletes were asked to notify their CSCS immediately of any concerns, discomfort, pain, or injury related to the training methods. No such issues were raised.</p><p>Weight selection for the weekly workouts was based upon percentages from pretesting. Bench pressing occurred during both weekly lifting sessions. Day 1 (CAT maximal effort day) incorporated the periodized protocol for the bench press based on the previously determined 1-RM bench press, and the training intensities ranged from 43%&#x02013;97% 1-RM. The training intensity for day 2 (band CAT or chain CAT) remained at 50% 1-RM for the 5-week phase. All subjects completed a total of five CAT maximal-effort and five band CAT or chain CAT bench press workouts during the training period. On both days, verbal instructions were given following the eccentric phase of each bench press repetition &#x0201c;to move the weight as fast as possible&#x0201d;. Following the warm-up, the workout exercise order progressed from larger muscle groups to smaller muscle groups.

A similar procedure was followed for the band CAT training, with bands attached whose maximal resistance when extended, plus the barbell, represented a total load of each individual subject&#x02019;s 50% 1-RM. The amount of band resistance was determined according to the equipment company&#x02019;s specifications. Both band CAT and chain CAT groups performed nine sets of three repetitions at 50% 1-RM, with instructions to move the weight as quickly as possible. The bar grips consisted of close grip (hands 14 inches apart) for sets 1&#x02013;3, midgrip (hands 19 inches apart) for sets 4&#x02013;6, and wide grip (hands 24 inches apart) for sets 7&#x02013;9.

A consistent goal of strength and conditioning professionals is to maximize results in minimum time;<xref rid="b24-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> therefore, they may find it beneficial to have athletes train using CAT in conjunction with AR for designated phases of the off-season strength and conditioning program. However, caution should be exercised in setting specific expectations for strength gains. Improvement may vary across sport, level of athlete, and length of the training phase. Further research is necessary to compare these training methods in more detail.</p><p>Resistance training is an accepted part of off-season training for baseball, with the primary goals being muscle strengthening<xref rid="b2-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and injury prevention.<xref rid="b25-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Shoulder injuries are common in baseball, due to the high volume of throwing, and while the bench press is generally considered to be an optimal exercise for developing upper body musculature, it has been reported to increase stress on the shoulder, particularly at the end of the eccentric phase.<xref rid="b26-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Performing the bench press with weighted chains is thought to minimize stress, due to the variable resistance throughout the range of motion.<xref rid="b8-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b16-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Published research<xref rid="b8-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> as well as publications from the popular press<xref rid="b16-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> caution against the risk of increased soreness when training with elastic bands. While soreness was not measured in the current study, athletes were instructed to report pain, injury, or increased soreness to the investigator. Neither the band CAT nor the chain CAT groups reported any incidence of the aforementioned symptoms.</p><p>We acknowledge some study limitations. First, the 24 collegiate baseball athletes had &#x02265;1 year of formal collegiate strength training experience. Published research has shown that strength gains are affected by the type of training program and previous training experience.<xref rid="b12-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b23-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b28-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Future study that addresses the relationship between training experience and upper body strength in connection with AR and CAT training methods is warranted. Second, the absence of a control group poses a limitation. Findings from previous AR training studies established significant upper body strength gains with elastic bands compared with plate-loaded barbells,<xref rid="b10-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b28-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> yet in other studies, weighted chains failed to produce a greater strength gain than either elastic band<xref rid="b11-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or plate-loaded barbell training.<xref rid="b8-oajsm-5-183" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Due to the limited number of trained baseball athletes available (ie, 24), a conscious decision was made to include only the two intervention groups &#x02013; band CAT and chain CAT. Having a larger sample size would have been more conducive to the inclusion of a control group. Finally, the AR-CAT training was included as a 5-week training phase within the off-season strength and conditioning program as a whole, and the subjects were trained baseball athletes who were following sport-specific training regimens and involved in regular activities with definite neuromuscular demands. Thus, results may vary in untrained individuals or in athletes from other sports. Future research is needed to examine what role the training volume and intensities of other program exercises used in conjunction with CAT and AR methods may play in the upper body strength adaptations. Additionally, future examination of muscle activity patterns across these training methods may help to ascertain potential mechanisms of adaptation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The
