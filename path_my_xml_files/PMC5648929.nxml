Exercise therapy has been advocated an effective treatment for chronic low back pain. However, there is lack of consensus on the best exercise treatment and numerous studies are underway. Conclusive studies are lacking especially in this part of the world. Thisstudy was designed to compare the effectiveness of specific stabilization exercises with routine physical therapy exerciseprovided in patients with nonspecific chronic mechanical low back pain.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This is single blinded randomized control trial that was conducted at the department of physical therapy Orthopedic and Spine Institute, Johar Town, Lahore in which 120 subjects with nonspecific chronic low back pain participated. Subjects with the age between 20 to 60 years and primary complaint of chronic low back pain were recruited after giving an informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups A &#x00026; B which were treated with core stabilization exercise and routine physical therapy exercise respectively. TENS and ultrasound were given as therapeutic modalities to both treatment groups. Outcomes of the treatment were recorded using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pretreatment, at 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> week post treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The results of this study illustrate that clinical and therapeutic effects of core stabilization exercise program over the period of six weeks are more effective in terms of reduction in pain, compared to routine physical therapy exercise for similar duration. This study found significant reduction in pain across the two groups at 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> week of treatment with p value less than 0.05.

Transversusabdominis (TrA), lumbar multifidi, and other paraspinal, abdominal, diaphragmatic, and pelvic musculature are targeted in core stabilization exercises. Different studies have reported delayed activation of TrA with respect to erector spinae with significant atrophy of multifidus in subjects with chronic low back pain.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Though there is lack of data regarding the prevalence of different musculoskeletal disorders in Pakistan, low back pain is a significant complaint with which the patients consult their physical therapist or other health care professionals. Since exercise is the main stay of treatment of low back pain prescribed by physical therapist, it is important to determine the type of exercise that is most specific and targeted in management of low back pain. The main objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of specific stabilization exercises with routine physical therapy provided in patients with nonspecific chronic mechanical low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was a single blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the outpatient department of Orthopedics and Spine Institute, Johar Town, Lahore.

The sample was recruited using a non-probability sampling technique. Patients with nonspecific chronic mechanical low back pain, with age between 20-60 years, both male and female gender were included in the study. Patients with disc pathology and radicular pain, acute low back pain, history of spinal fracture or spinal surgery, spondylolisthesis, any systemic disease or TB of spine were excluded from the study.

A detailed musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine was performed before the start of treatment. Pretreatment reading for pain was noted.

An expert physical therapist with more than 10 years clinical experience helped the patients in performing either core stabilization exercise (Group-A) or routine physical therapy exercise (Group-B). The session with the physical therapist usually lasted for up to 40 minutes with 5-10 minutes rest interval. All the subjects in both groups were treated with one treatment session per week for up to six weeks. Patients were reminded for their routine appointment one-day prior using telephonic call. Post treatment readings of pain were recorded at end of 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> treatment week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). All the subjects were managed with the base line treatment of therapeutic ultrasound (3MH for ten minutes at 50% intensity) and TENS (Continuous mode for 10 minutes) at lumbar spine as a baseline treatment in both groups. Furthermore, all the patients were also instructed to do same exercise twice a week at home by the help of printed handouts given by the physical therapist and were asked to refrain from heavy intensity physical work during the course of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS for Windows software, version 20.

A pilot randomized controlled trail conducted by Areeudomwong et al. measured the effect of 10 weeks core stabilization program on pain presentation pattern, disability and activation of trunk muscles in subjects with clinical instability of the lumbar spine. The subjects in the control group were treated with stretching of the trunk muscles and hydro collator therapy. Results of their study indicated decreases in pain and disability in both treatment groups similar to the findings of this study. However, the improvement in the activation ratio of transversusabdominus and internal oblique relative to rectus abdominus muscle was found in the subjects that were treated with core stabilization exercise.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It has been hypothesized that core stabilization exercise enhance the ability of the segmental muscles that result in improved function and decreased pain in subject with chronic nonspecific low back pain.</p><p>Subjects allocated to core stabilization group demonstrated a decrease in pain. These findings were also reported in similar studies by Koumantakis and O&#x02019;Sullivan of chronic low back pain,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> O&#x02019;Sullivan<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> signified that abdominal drawing in maneuver (ADIM) helps in integration of muscles into a task by providing a powerful biofeedback. Similar findings were also reported in another study in which ADIM aided in stabilization of the lumbar spinal segments during functional task performing in healthy subjects.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In this study core stabilization exercises also significantly reduced pain in subjects with low back pain.</p><p>A study conducted by Costa et al.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> also established the superiority of motor control exercises over electrotherapeutic modalities used to treat chronic nonspecific low back pain. Subjects in treatment group were treated specific exercises targeting the activation of the transversusabdominus and multifidus. When appropriate control was developed subjects were progressed to more complex functional task targeting the activation of the core muscles. Control group was treated with detuned short wave diathermy and placebo ultrasound therapy for 20 minutes over 8 treatment session for 12 week. Results showed significant reduction in pain measured on NPRS and disability measured on Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire across the two groups but this reduction was clinically more significant in treatment group compared to control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Core stabilization exercise is more effective than routine physical therapy
