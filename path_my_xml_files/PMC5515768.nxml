Standing balance impairment is associated with a lower quality of life in elderly people, stroke patients, and Parkinson's disease patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore, in a rehabilitation setting, it is important to implement interventions aimed at maintaining and improving this ability.</p><p>Several studies have stressed the need for standing balance ability intervention (e.g., exercise interventions<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>) that exists above the threshold of consciousness (i.e., supraliminal). The existing methods of exercise intervention aimed at standing balance ability originally targeted highly motivated and/or well-functioning patients who were able to respond to supraliminal stimulation (including elderly people) (e.g., inclusion criteria: &#x0201c;requiring no walking aid or using a single-point stick only.&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>] Therefore, it is possible that patients (including elderly people) who were unable to respond to supraliminal stimulation with low motivation to exercise and/or low body function will not adapt to conscious balance exercise. Conversely, subliminal stimulation is an intervention method that may stimulate such patients to participate in standing balance exercises. Subliminal stimulation promotes a desired message in an image at a speed unrecognizable by humans,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> which may affect the standing balance ability of humans unconsciously. If this method involving subliminal stimulation creates willingness to exercise in participants by them simply watching a video, this may be a significant step in the promotion of exercise intervention among patients (and elderly people) who are unable to respond to supraliminal stimulation with low motivation and/or low physical function. However, studies that focus on standing balance ability interventions that are delivered on a subconscious level (i.e., subliminal) are rare. One meta-analysis study reported that information presented subconsciously could influence behavior.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, this intervention may be effective in more than just standing balance. Another study reported that healthy participants who were subliminally primed with the concept of exertion combined with positive supraliminal reward words showed stronger performance on a handgrip activity than those who were only subliminally primed.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In addition, a study reported that subliminal priming, when combined with a supraliminal reward (e.g., nice and great) in the form of a subconsciously visible positive stimulus, significantly increased the handgrip force level of maximum voluntary contraction in healthy individuals.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> These results suggested that the intervention that combined subliminal priming with words of encouragement as a supraliminal reward improved exercise performance compared with the intervention with subliminal priming alone. Although, as mentioned above, many studies have investigated the effects of interventions with or without supraliminal rewards, they did not investigate how to supply a reward (supraliminal or subliminal) more effectively. Therefore, it is still unclear whether subliminal or supraliminal reward is more effective in improving standing balance ability when priming stimuli are delivered subconsciously. We hypothesized that subliminal rewards are better than supraliminal rewards considering that the evidence indicates that information presented subconsciously can influence behavior more than information presented consciously can.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of subliminal priming-plus-subliminal reward stimuli and subliminal priming-plus-supraliminal reward stimuli on the standing balance ability of healthy young adults to determine a more efficient intervention method encouraging participation among patients (and elderly people) with low motivation and/or body function.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This was a single-blind (outcome assessor), parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Japan. The allocation ratio was randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the experimental group (subliminal priming-plus-subliminal reward) or the control group (subliminal priming-plus-supraliminal reward). This study was approved by the ethics committee of Kibi International University (15&#x02013;54), and the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02705092).

This study followed CONSORT reporting guidelines.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from Kibi International University, Takahashi, Okayama, Japan, between February 2016 and March 2016. Inclusion criteria were the absence of health-related issues and age of 18 to 24 years. The exclusion criterion was the presence of a physical impairment that hindered performance of daily activities. Participants completed demographic questionnaires (age, sex, height, and exercise habits [presence or absence]) before the intervention. Outcomes were measured at the baseline and immediately after the intervention protocol. We expected an effect size (Cohen d) of 0.80 for the primary outcome. At a power level of 0.80 and an alpha level of 0.05, we calculated the sample size per group using G&#x02217;Power.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Assuming equally sized groups, we needed a sample size of 26 per group. We anticipated no loss to follow-up because all measurements were performed on the same day. Therefore, we aimed for a sample size of 26 per group.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups using computer-generated lists of random numbers via the randomly permuted block method. Baseline and postintervention assessments were performed by outcome assessors who were not involved in the intervention. Throughout the trial, outcome assessors remained blinded to the group status of the participants. Details of group allocation were concealed from participants until the end of the trial. Because of different characteristics of intervention, participants were not blinded to the intervention. The intervention researcher was not blinded to the group status.

The primary measure is the difference (in centimeter) between the initial and final hand position in the horizontal plane. The forward reach ability increased in proportion to the increase in the FRT value.

On analyzing the primary outcome, contrary to our hypothesis that subliminal reward stimuli would show significantly better improvements on FRT than supraliminal reward stimuli, our results suggested that while both interventions were effective, the supraliminal reward stimuli were actually more effective. A previous study suggested that they have a positive influence on behavior, even if the reward is subliminally primed.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> In fact, FRT values improved both before and after the intervention in the experimental group. In other words, our results were consistent with those of the previous research.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> However, the control group demonstrated greater improvement than the experiment group. Therefore, supraliminal reward can be considered to be more effective than subliminal reward. Furthermore, although the intervention duration in this study was short (approximately 2&#x0200a;minutes in a day only), it was effective. A further positive effect may be achieved by increasing the number and duration of interventions. Therefore, in addition to other balance practices, regarding the combination of rewards that are presented consciously as shown in the present study, rewards that are presented unconsciously might allow a more efficient approach.</p><p>In the secondary outcome, static standing balance in the experimental group (subliminal priming with subliminal reward) did not improve significantly compared with that in the control group (subliminal priming with supraliminal reward). In fact, neither intervention was effective for improving static standing balance from the baseline to immediately after intervention. Although the exact reasons are unknown because this study did not examine this problem, we believe that there is a possibility that the factors influencing the measurement of OLST could not be controlled. For example, 1 study reported that OLST times were significantly shorter when participants had their mouths open than when they were closed.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Participants in our study were not specifically instructed to have their mouth open or closed during OLST. Therefore, there may have been a large error in the measurement of OLST. Furthermore, the standard deviation is large in the OLST of this study, and there is a possibility that there was a strong influence of individual differences. Therefore, there is a possibility that selecting OLST as an outcome was not optimal.</p><p>As mentioned above, in the present study, we did not collect additional outcomes on the mechanism. Therefore, the mechanism of differences between methods of giving reward in this study was inferred from previous studies.</p><p>Reward is the enhanced feeling of pleasure, which is the difference between predictive reward and actual reward (i.e., reward prediction error).<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In other words, because the reward is dependent on consciousness, it is possible to predict reward. Therefore, the effect of subliminal reward stimuli at a subconscious level on reward prediction error is relatively less than that of supraliminal reward stimuli that exist above the threshold of consciousness. In a previous study, it has been suggested that encouragement induces an improvement in walking speed in stroke patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>Therefore, in rehabilitation settings, we suggest that therapists should present the reward in a manner in which it can be consciously recognized by patients. However, all these opinions are only speculative because the additional outcome of guessing a reward mechanism was not investigated in this study.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. First, we used a sample of convenience from 1 university, which may not be representative of the entire population of healthy university students. Further studies with random sampling and multi-institutional joint research are needed. Second, this study did not include elderly and disabled participants. Therefore, our results cannot be directly applied to the elderly and disabled populations. Further studies are needed that target elderly and disabled participants needing rehabilitation. Finally, this study only investigated the immediate results of subliminal priming with reward stimuli. Therefore, we cannot make inferences regarding the long-term effects of this method.
