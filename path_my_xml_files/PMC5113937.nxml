This study aimed to manage some lower GI-NMS in a group of patients with PD. A total of 40 patients (17 males, 23 females; mean age 76.05&#x000b1;2.09 years) were randomly selected for this study. Patients were confirmed to have PD (modified Hoehn&#x02013;Yars scale: 2.075&#x000b1;0.4) who had undergone levodopa or dopamine agonist treatment. In the non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-Quest), regarding GI complaints, the following were recorded: abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation of mild-to-moderate severity. Laboratory studies, abdominal ultrasound, and upper and lower digestive endoscopies were performed to rule out organic issues. All patients increased their water intake to 2 L/d and alimentary fiber to 20&#x02013;25 g/d. Twenty patients received trimebutine 200 mg three times daily half an hour before meals. The other 20 patients received probiotics (60 mg per-tablet of two lactic bacteria: <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic>), 2&#x000d7;/d, 1 hour after meals for 3 months along with the reassessment of GI complaints. Our results demonstrated that there were significant statistical differences in all assessed symptoms in the first group: 1.55&#x000b1;0.51 vs 0.6&#x000b1;0.5 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) for abdominal pain; 1.6&#x000b1;0.5 vs 0.45&#x000b1;0.51 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) for bloating; and 1.5&#x000b1;0.51 vs 0.85&#x000b1;0.67 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0014) for constipation with incomplete defecation. The second group displayed statistical differences only for abdominal pain 1.45&#x000b1;0.51 vs 1.05&#x000b1;0.69 (<italic>P</italic>=0.00432) and bloating 1.4&#x000b1;0.5 vs 0.3&#x000b1;0.47 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). For constipation with incomplete defecation, there was a slight improvement. Thus, there was no significant statistical difference: 1.35&#x000b1;0.49 vs 1.15&#x000b1;0.49 (<italic>P</italic>=0.2040). In conclusion, lower GI-NMS are frequently present, isolated or associated with other autonomic issues, even before the diagnosis of PD. Treatment with probiotics could improve abdominal pain and bloating as much as with trimebutine, but less for constipation with incomplete evacuation, where trimebutine showed better results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>PD</kwd><kwd>lower GI-NMS</kwd><kwd>probiotics</kwd><kwd>prokinetics</kwd><kwd>trimebutine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), as a common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by motor issues like tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykinesia, and also by various types of nonmotor symptoms (NMS).<xref rid="b1-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>NMS may show at any stage of the disease.

This was such that in both groups, patients recorded symptoms that existed before the neurological diagnosis (75% in the first group versus 85% in the second group).

After completing the therapy, the same situation was recorded: ie, no statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed.</p><p>The presence of other autonomic NMS like dysphagia, nausea, urinary urgency, nocturia, orthostatic hypotension, and excessive sweating at the time of PD diagnosis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cia-11-1601">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>It is clearly seen that nausea and dysphagia were very frequently associated with NMS. About 75% of patients from the first group and 70% of patients from the second group had nausea. Dysphagia was recorded in 50% of the patients from the first group and in 40% of the patients from the second group. The other symptoms such as urinary urgency, nocturia, orthostatic hypotension, and excessive sweating were present in less than 35% of all the patients.</p><p>At the beginning of the study, some patients exhibited many different autonomic NMS associated with GI symptoms, which are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-11-1601">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-cia-11-1601">5</xref>.</p><p>The other NMS associated with GI complaints were present at different ranges: 20%&#x02013;25% of the patients had more than one autonomic complaint, 15%&#x02013;25% had more than two complaints, and 10% had more than three complaints. In the first group, there was one patient with four more autonomic issues.</p><p>From the point of view of therapeutic results, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-cia-11-1601">Figure 6</xref>, we can easily observe that the first group showed statistically significant differences in all assessed symptoms. Thus, this shows good improvement after therapy.</p><p>Abdominal pain was significantly alleviated. In addition, scoring severity was improved, with the complaint intensity decreasing from 1.55&#x000b1;0.51 to 0.6&#x000b1;0.5 points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).</p><p>The next symptom assessed was bloating.

After administering prokinetics, we recorded an important decrease to 0.85&#x000b1;0.67 points (<italic>P</italic>=0.0014).</p><p>Results observed in the second group (treated with probiotics), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-cia-11-1601">Figure 7</xref>, showed statistical differences only for abdominal pain: 1.45&#x000b1;0.51 points vs 1.05&#x000b1;0.69 points (<italic>P</italic>=0.00432).

Thus, the outcome for this symptom is very promising.</p><p>However, for incomplete defecation, there was no statistically significant difference: 1.35&#x000b1;0.49 points vs 1.15&#x000b1;0.49 points (<italic>P</italic>=0.2040).</p><p>Concerning the first group, there was no correlation between patient age and PD scoring <italic>r</italic>=0.02785 (<italic>P</italic>=0.7835 not statistically significant), between PD scoring and duration of disease <italic>r</italic>=0.9842 (<italic>P</italic>=0.33 not statistically significant), and between the onset of the disease and the intensity of the constipation with incomplete evacuation <italic>r</italic>=0.0078 (<italic>P</italic>=0.878).</p><p>Similar results were seen in the second group: age and PD scoring: <italic>r</italic>=0.01848 (<italic>P</italic>=0.9099), PD scoring and duration of disease: <italic>r</italic>=0.1609 (<italic>P</italic>=0.3213), and the onset of the disease and the intensity of the constipation with incomplete evacuation: <italic>r</italic>=0.0056 (<italic>P</italic>=0.73).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of NMS in patients with PD has gained a greater awareness in recent years.<xref rid="b8-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> GI-NMS when assessed could be very frequent and has been estimated in some studies at the range of 75% in advanced PD patients.<xref rid="b9-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Lower GI symptoms such as constipation are very frequent in patients with PD. However, in some authors&#x02019; opinions, they are likely to worsen with advancing age. Some studies reported a possible increase of constipation severity related to PD severity and duration.<xref rid="b10-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Our results did not confirm a clear correlation between the duration and the severity of PD with severity of constipation. This is probably because we had no cases of advanced or severe PD.</p><p>In addition, a number of papers reported an increased incidence of other NMS, either an autonomic or a neuropsychiatric domain issue.<xref rid="b11-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In this study, we did observe that many patients exhibited other kinds of NMS at the time of PD diagnosis, with the most frequent being nausea and dysphagia. Other symptoms like urinary urgency, nocturia, orthostatic hypotension, and excessive sweating were only recorded sporadically. Almost half the patients also experienced other associated autonomic disorders.</p><p>Even if constipation is probably the most common nonmotor GI symptom with about half of PD patients experiencing it, there is no consensus of opinion regarding this matter. However, there are authors advocating that some of the symptoms such as sialorrhea and constipation may occur at later stages of the disease as opposed to major symptoms like orthostatic hypotension, which is one of the earlier signs or symptoms.<xref rid="b13-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In contrast to the general view, we consider the fact that constipation can predate the motor onset of PD. In addition, some evidence has shown that men who have bowel movements less than once daily compared with two or more times daily have a four times higher risk of PD after a mean time of 10 years.<xref rid="b14-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In our study, the patient&#x02019;s history clearly showed that constipation was present in both groups. This was seen in the vast majority long before the diagnosis of PD. It is possible that the severity of constipation can increase with the advancement of severity and duration of PD. Eventually, it increases, leading to complications such as pseudo-obstruction and megacolon. Drugs used for PD, including the anticholinergics, can also exacerbate constipation. Autonomic symptoms may be due to the abnormal deposition of &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates in a number of key autonomic regulatory areas (namely, the hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus, intermediate reticular zone of the medulla, locus coeruleus, and raphe), preganglionic parasympathetic, and also in the paravertebral autonomic ganglia autonomic ganglia, which could directly cause symptoms. Nevertheless, it should be noted that antiparkinsonian medications might also play a role. Dopaminergic receptors are widely distributed throughout both the central and peripheral autonomic nervous systems. In addition, dopamine lowers systemic blood pressure by decreasing catecholamine release and reducing gastric migrating motor complex and gastric motility; however, it may increase colonic motor activity.<xref rid="b16-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>At this point, while the evolution of motor symptoms has been well characterized, an understanding of GI-NMS is still not so clear. From a clinical point of view, there is also an important heterogeneity among patients; little is yet known about the NMS progression.<xref rid="b17-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>This matter is also complicated by the fact that the dopaminergic treatment used for the motor symptoms of PD can cause or worsen a number of NMS, including orthostatic hypotension, nausea, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, or impulsive&#x02013;compulsive NMS behaviors.<xref rid="b18-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Therefore, the changes that underlie the NMS still remain unclear and are not treated effectively with dopamine-based drug therapies.<xref rid="b19-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Concerning the management of GI-NMS, there is not much information that has been made available. Apart from a well-balanced diet with plenty of fiber (in the range of 20&#x02013;35 g daily) and fluid intake, macrogol can be used to treat constipation.<xref rid="b20-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Therefore, one of the questions that was raised regarding macrogol is: Could this compound that acts as an osmotic substance be taken as a long-standing therapy? What about GI side effects like augmentation of bloating and borborygmus that already exist, and sometimes more abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting?</p><p>There are some studies advocating the good results after prokinetics, like domperidone in mitigating dyspepsia, which is secondary to gastric motility disorders; however, no sustainable data have been recorded regarding the effects of prokinetics on intestinal motility disorders as NMS in PD patients.<xref rid="b22-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Although it is possible that there are nonmotor GI complaints in PD patients and functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), we did not apply Rome III criteria for the assessment of functional constipation because this classification has its own limitations.<xref rid="b23-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>We considered that NMS-Quest with its section dedicated to constipation description would be more appropriate in the evaluation of cases with neurological conditions. Considering the fact that this study was designed for PD patients who are having minor GI symptoms, we made the decision to use some drugs and nutritional supplements that are already used for symptom management in patients with IBS.</p><p>In a meta-analysis published in 2007, the significant treatment benefit in favor of prokinetic agents, including trimebutine, in patients with functional dyspepsia was clearly highlighted.<xref rid="b24-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Trimebutine is a therapeutic agent prescribed mostly in patients with functional dyspepsia, IBS, chronic constipation, and other functional GI disorders. This is due to its effect on the regulation of the motility of the digestive system acting on the GI tract via 1) an agonist effect on peripheral mu, kappa, and delta opiate receptors and 2) releasing of GI peptides such as motilin and the modulation of the release of other peptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin, and glucagon. Trimebutine accelerates gastric emptying, induces premature phase III of the migrating motor complex in the intestine, and modulates the contractile activity of the colon.<xref rid="b25-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>We were also encouraged by our previous data, where we studied some upper GI-NMS in patients with PD and dyspeptic complaints, with promising outcome seen in patients treated with trimebutine.<xref rid="b26-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>This study showed promising results of prokinetics like trimebutine in the management of some mild-to-moderate lower GI-NMS like constipation, bloating, and abdominal pain.</p><p>Recent data presented an interesting hypothesis regarding the brain&#x02013;gut axis that could be modulated by the gut microbiota via immunological, neuroendocrine, and direct neural mechanisms.<xref rid="b27-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In this review, there are authors suggesting that gut microbiota could be a potential biomarker for the predictability of motor PD phenotype.<xref rid="b28-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> So far, gut microbiota has been studied more as a pathogenic pathway related to PD or as a possible biomarker for particular phenotypes in PD, and less as a potential target for therapeutic purpose.</p><p>At this point, we are aware of the existence of one pilot study using probiotics as a single strain. <italic>L. casei Shirota</italic>, from fermented milk, addressed the management of constipation in PD patients and significantly improved stool consistency and bowel habits.<xref rid="b29-cia-11-1601" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In this regard, using probiotics to rebalance a dysregulated gut microbiome in patients with PD seemed to be reasonable. Our experience with probiotics was very encouraging, as it showed good results in mitigating some GI symptoms like bloating and abdominal pain.</p><p>It would be very interesting also, to assess the characteristics of each individual&#x02019;s microbiome before and after long-term usage of probiotics, to observe if those changes could interfere with other symptoms and signs that characterize PD.</p><p>It could be possible that association of prokinetics with probiotics is much more beneficial to a certain category of patients. It is hard to anticipate and evaluate if this schedule of treatment would be satisfactory enough in improving more severe lower GI-NMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has limitations related to the relatively small cohort of patients with PD and lower GI-NMS. Another aspect that could also be considered as a limitation is the fact that we enrolled only patients with mild-to-moderate severity of the GI-NMS. This experience should be extended to attempt managing more severe lower GI complaints in PD patients, and should ideally be addressed in further discussions and debates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of our results, lower GI-NMS are frequently present, alone or associated with other autonomic issues. Thus, many of them were recorded long before the diagnosis of PD. The treatment with trimebutine showed promising results in alleviating all assessed symptoms.
