In addition, many Muslim women use a thick type of SN during menses due to the religious requirement that even disposable SNs be washed before disposal. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the physiological and psychological responses to wearing SNs of different thicknesses during menstruation and non-menstruation phases at rest and during physical activity/exercise among Muslim women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eighteen Muslim females were randomly assigned to wear an ultra slim type (US, thin) or a maxi type (MT, thick) SN on two different occasions (i.e., during non-menses and menses). Each subject tested both types of SN. Upon arriving at the laboratory, each subject was equipped with an ambulatory electrocardiograph and rested in a seated position for 10&#x000a0;min. She was then given either an US or MT SN, put it in place, and rested in a seated position for 10&#x000a0;min. Each subject then walked at 3&#x000a0;km/h for 10&#x000a0;min, sat resting for 10&#x000a0;min, and then walked at 5&#x000a0;km/h for another 10&#x000a0;min. At the end of each 10-min stage, subjects marked their feelings of discomfort on the visual analog scale (VAS). Perceived exertion during exercise was evaluated using the Borg scale. Heart rate and low frequency-to-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) of heart rate variability were continuously recorded during rest and exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During both the non-menses and menses trials, VAS and LF/HF were significantly lower in subjects using the US SN compared to the MT SN. These results indicate that when wearing the US SN, subjects were more comfortable and did not increase sympathetic activities. Meanwhile, perceived exertion during exercise had no significant difference between US and MT although the means of the scores for US tended to be lower than those of MT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study (VAS and LF/HF) indicate that wearing an US SN induces less physiological and psychological stress compared to wearing a MT SN. Thus, use of the former will empower women to live their lives with vitality during menses.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Comfort</kwd><kwd>Menstruation</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Sanitary napkin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Female menstruation is associated with significant unpleasant symptoms, which can be physical, behavioral, and emotional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, reducing mental stress during the menstruation period is an important quality of life issue for women. Wearing a sanitary napkin (SN) is believed to influence mental stress responses of women during daily living activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although mental stress is a psychological response, it affects several physiological processes in the human body. Generally, the human sensory receptors respond to physical stimuli, such as touch and pain, and trigger physiological changes in the body as interpreted by the autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The parasympathetic nervous system is suppressed and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This causes physiological secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which leads to vasoconstriction of blood vessels, increased muscle tension, and changes in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In the past, researchers have used HRV to measure mental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In particular, the high frequency (HF) band (0.15 to 0.4&#x000a0;Hz) in frequency-domain analysis has been regarded as the marker of parasympathetic (vagal) activity, and the low frequency (LF) band (0.04 to 0.15&#x000a0;Hz) has been regarded as the marker of sympathovagal interaction, especially sympathetic activity. Consequently, the LF-to-HF (LF/HF) ratio represents the sympathovagal balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HRV in response to stress differs between genders, and women&#x02019;s neuroendocrine responses are often unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have used different types of SNs as the physical stimuli and measured physiological responses to their use in order to find ways to improve the quality of life of women during menses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, Park and Watanuki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that, although the use of SNs increased physiological loading, their use did not result in significant effects on the LF and HF components or the LF/HF ratio of HRV at 20, 30, and 40&#x000a0;min after application compared to during the 10&#x000a0;min resting state. In a laboratory-based experiment, application of different types of SN had different physiological and psychological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mechanical stimulation by SNs with higher roughness (frictional coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.312) increased SNS activities and brain arousal compared to SNs with lower roughness (frictional coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.142) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Researchers who focused on physiological changes caused by application of SNs of different thicknesses over the menstrual cycle reported that women felt more comfortable using thin type SNs compared to thick type SNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thin type SNs caused less mechanical stimulation and did not increase the SNS activities compared to the thick type SN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Muslim females prefer to use the thick type SN due to cultural and religious practices, as SNs must be washed before disposal. This is based on tradition passed down for generations as in the older days there were no napkins and many used old cloths as napkins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, many believe that if used SNs are not washed before being thrown away, one risks being afflicted with hysteria and disturbances and is unhygienic. Research on the psychological and physiological changes that occur in women when wearing SNs of different thicknesses is limited and, to our knowledge, there have been no studies on the effect of wearing SNs during exercise/physical activity among Muslim women. Therefore, the goal of this study was to measure the physiological and psychological responses to wearing SNs of different thicknesses during menstruation and non-menstruation phases at rest and during physical activity/exercise among Muslim women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Unmarried Muslim females were solicited from the Institute to participate in this study.

Subjects were required to complete two phases of the experiment: Experiment I was the non-menses phase and Experiment II was the menses phase. The menses phase represented a more complex situation than the non-menses phase because of menstrual pain, worries about leakage, and so on. Thus, to evaluate the effect of SNs on the subject&#x02019;s comfort, experiments were executed during the non-menses phase. For each experiment, subjects had to complete two visits, one using the US SN and the other using the MT SN (assigned in a randomized order). For Experiment I, subjects completed the first and second visits on two continuous days, whereas for Experiment II the visits took place in two different months, with the gap between the first and second visit being no more than 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Upon arrival in the laboratory for Experiment I, subjects were required to fill out a pre-questionnaire to identify the type of SN used regularly during their heavy flow menses days. Subjects were then equipped with an ambulatory electrocardiogram monitor (Active Tracer, Model: AC-301A, Japan) with electrodes placed on three sites on the chest, and they rested in a seated position for 10&#x000a0;min. Subjects were then given either an US or MT SN (given in a randomized order, and subject were blinded to the type of SN given), they were asked to put it in place, and they again rested in a seated position for 10&#x000a0;min. Subjects then walked at 3&#x000a0;km/h on a treadmill for 10&#x000a0;min, sat resting for 10&#x000a0;min, and then continued walking briskly at 5&#x000a0;km/h on a treadmill for another 10&#x000a0;min (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At the end of each 10-min stage, subjects were asked to mark their feelings of discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) as described by Scott and Huskisson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For the treadmill stage, immediately upon completing the 10&#x000a0;min of walking, subjects were required to point immediately on the printed 10-point Borg scale to record their level of perceived exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. HRV was recorded continuously during rest and exercise by the electrocardiogram monitor, and the frequency of the R-R interval was analyzed by the MemCalc method using MemCalc/Tarawa software. From the analysis, the LF/HF ratio was calculated. The data collected during minutes 5 to 8 of each stage were used for the analysis. On the second visit (the following day), subjects repeated the same protocols while wearing the other SN type.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow of the project design.</bold> VAS&#x02009;=&#x02009;visual analog scale for determination of feeling of discomfort; ECG&#x02009;=&#x02009;electrocardiogram, which was continuously monitored.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1880-6805-33-28-1"/></fig><p>Upon arrival at the laboratory for Experiment II, subjects were given an US SN, asked to put it in place, and rested in the seated position for 10&#x000a0;min.

The subjects completed this experiment during the second and third days after the onset of menstruation, and the average value of both days was used in the data analysis. If a subject was randomly assigned to use the MT SN on the first menses visit (second and third day of menstruation), she was given the US SN on her second menses visit (second and third day of menstruation), and vice versa.

In contrast, another study reported that only 38% of Japanese women use a thick type SN during their heavy flow menstruation days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>As was found in the Japanese study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], wearing SNs of different thicknesses elucidated different physiological and psychological responses in Malaysian women. Compared to subjects wearing the MT SN, those wearing the US SN showed decreased percentage changes of the LF/HF ratio and lower relative VAS scores. Thus, wearing the US SN did not increase SNS activities, and the subjects using this type of SN felt more comfortable (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results indicate that wearing the US SN reduced physiological and psychological stress in the subjects, especially during menstruation, even though they had previously been used to using thick type SNs.</p><p>Regarding perceived exertion (as measured using the Borg scale), a previous study reported that a feeling of comfort and the Borg scale exhibited an inverse relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In our study, although there were no significant differences between US and MT, the means of scores tended to be lower when wearing the US SN compared to the MT SN (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In addition, 72% of the subjects reported feeling more active when wearing the US SN compared to the MT SN in the post-questionnaire (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Feeling more comfortable when wearing the US SN might have caused the subjects to feel more active or experience less physical fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the connection between the use of the different SN types and physical activity remains unclear. Hence, future studies should objectively measure whether wearing an US SN decreases physical fatigue or improves exercise performance; the answer will better explain the relationship between US SNs and physical activity. Furthermore, it appears that the use of US SNs will allow women to be more active and manage their stress during menstruation, thereby increasing their quality of life.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>One of the limitations of this study was that serum levels of ovarian hormones (estradiol and progesterone) and thyroid hormones were not measured. Concentrations of these hormones change during different phases of the menstrual cycle and differ among subjects. Further, they can modulate HRV and the related autonomic nervous system. Additionally, the subjects were assumed to be in good mental and physical health, but they did not undergo a medical examination. These factors should be taken into account in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The physiological and psychological differences (LF/HF ratio and VAS) between subjects wearing the US SN and the MT SN exhibited a consistent trend in both Experiments I and II (i.e., the ratio was lower in those using the US SN). This finding illustrates that the US SN is more comfortable to wear than the MT SN, and comfort is an important factor that could eliminate physiological and psychological stress and unpleasant symptoms during menstruation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; HF: High frequency; HRV: Heart rate variability; LF: Low frequency; MT: Maxi type; SN: Sanitary napkin; SNS: Sympathetic nervous system; US: Ultra slim; VAS: Visual analog scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RS, MA, and AMCM designed the study.
