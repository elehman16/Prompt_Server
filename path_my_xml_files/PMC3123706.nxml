This subsequent, 26-week, open-label, uncontrolled assessment period evaluated the safety and efficacy of (i) continued exenatide once-weekly treatment and (ii) switching from sitagliptin or pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Randomised oral medications were discontinued and all patients received exenatide once-weekly. Of the 364 patients [original baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.5 &#x000b1; 1.1% (70 mmol/mol), fasting plasma glucose 9.0 &#x000b1; 2.5 mmol/l, weight 88 &#x000b1; 20 kg) who continued into the open-label period, 319 patients (88%) completed 52 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Evaluable patients who received only exenatide once-weekly demonstrated significant 52-week improvements (least square mean &#x000b1; <sc>se</sc>) in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;1.6 &#x000b1; 0.1%), fasting plasma glucose (&#x02212;1.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 mmol/l) and weight (&#x02212;1.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 kg). Evaluable patients who switched from sitagliptin to exenatide once-weekly demonstrated significant incremental improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;0.3 &#x000b1; 0.1%), fasting plasma glucose (&#x02212;0.7 &#x000b1; 0.2 mmol/l) and weight (&#x02212;1.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 kg). Patients who switched from pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly maintained HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose improvements (week 52: &#x02212;1.6 &#x000b1; 0.1%, &#x02212;1.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 mmol/l), with significant weight reduction (&#x02212;3.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 kg). Exenatide once-weekly was generally well tolerated and adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. Nausea was the most frequent adverse event in this assessment period (intent-to-treat: exenatide once-weekly-only 5%; sitagliptin &#x02192; exenatide once-weekly 11%; pioglitazone &#x02192; exenatide once-weekly 10%).

In the DURATION-2 double-blind, double-dummy trial, three reasonable choices of add-on therapy were directly compared in patients with Type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. After 26 weeks of treatment, once-weekly dosing with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide resulted in superior improvements in glycaemic control and body weight compared with maximum approved doses of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin, and the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>In the subsequent, open-label phase of the DURATION-2 trial, all patients received exenatide once-weekly. Rather than adding another medication, as is common in clinical practice, patients who originally received daily sitagliptin or pioglitazone discontinued their respective oral treatment to assess incremental changes in glycaemic control and body weight after switching to once-weekly administration of exenatide. Patients originally randomised to exenatide once-weekly continued treatment and discontinued oral placebo. In this open-label extension period, all patients continued metformin background therapy, and patients and investigators remained blinded to original treatment. This trial was designed to evaluate the glycaemic and non-glycaemic (body weight, blood pressure, fasting lipids, markers of cardiovascular risk) changes in patients: (i) treated with exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks; (ii) who switched from daily inhibition of DPP-4 (which elicits an approximately twofold increase in circulating postprandial GLP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]) to a therapy that results in continuous exposure to greater concentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide; and (iii) who switched from daily peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-&#x003b3;) stimulation with pioglitazone, which increases insulin sensitivity, but is also often associated with increased body weight, to a therapy that augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion and is associated with weight loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Design overview</title><p>DURATION-2, a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center clinical trial conducted in the USA, India and Mexico was designed as a two-stage trial. In the first phase, the efficacy and safety of 26 weeks of treatment with exenatide once-weekly were compared with maximum approved doses of sitagliptin or pioglitazone in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. In this second, open-label phase, randomised oral medications were discontinued and all patients received exenatide once-weekly.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and interventions</title><p>Eligible patients were male and non-pregnant female patients, at least 18 years of age, with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, but otherwise healthy and treated with a stable regimen of metformin for a minimum of 2 months prior to screening. Additional inclusion criteria included HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7.1&#x02013;11.0% (54&#x02013;97 mmol/mol) and BMI 25&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Patients (<italic>n</italic> = 514) were originally randomised to one of three treatment groups by UBC Clinical Technologies (San Francisco, CA, USA) via an interactive voice response system: exenatide once-weekly (2 mg) subcutaneous injection (self-administered) plus placebo once daily in the morning capsule, sitagliptin (100 mg) once daily in the morning plus placebo once-weekly injection, or pioglitazone (45 mg) once daily in the morning plus placebo once-weekly injection. All patients, the study-site staff, the investigator and the sponsor were blinded to the identity of study medication during the double-blind treatment period. Randomization was stratified according to country and screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> stratum [&#x0003c; 9% (&#x0003c; 75 mmol/mol), &#x02265; 9% (&#x02265; 75 mmol/mol)]. In the second, open-label phase of DURATION-2, randomised oral medications were discontinued and all patients received 2 mg exenatide once-weekly treatment; patients and investigators were not notified of original treatment. A common clinical protocol was approved for each site by the appropriate Ethical Review Board. Patients provided written informed consent prior to participation. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1946), including the current Seoul revision (2008), and consistent with Good Clinical Practice and applicable laws and regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Study endpoints included change from baseline to weeks 26 and 52, and change from week 26 to week 52, in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, patients achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets of &#x0003c; 7.0% (&#x0003c; 53 mmol/mol) and &#x02264; 6.5% (&#x02264; 48 mmol/mol), change in fasting plasma glucose (target &#x02264; 7 mmol/l), body weight, fasting lipids, fasting insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular risk markers (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), safety and tolerability. Plasma and urine analytes and HbA<sub>1c</sub> were quantitated by Quintiles Laboratories (Marietta, GA, USA; Mumbai, India; and Singapore) using standard methods. All other measures were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as those occurring for the first time or worsening after the first dose of exenatide once-weekly during the open-label period. Hypoglycaemia was categorized as major or minor. Major hypoglycaemia was defined as being associated with (i) a loss of consciousness, seizure or coma, which resolved after administration of glucagon or glucose or (ii) severe impairment in consciousness or behaviour that required third-party assistance to resolve and a glucose value of &#x0003c; 3 mmol/l. Minor hypoglycaemia was defined as a report of symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and a glucose value of &#x0003c; 3 mmol/l prior to treatment of the episode.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The open-label intent-to-treat population used for all safety analyses consisted of all subjects who completed the 26-week double-blinded treatment period and they received one dose of open-label once-weekly exenatide at a timepoint after week 26.

sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Glycaemic control and body weight</title><p>Exenatide once-weekly elicits continuous exposure to therapeutic concentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, which acts to increase glucose-dependent insulin section, decrease inappropriate elevations in postprandial glucagon, increase satiety and slow gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. The continuous exenatide exposure achieved with exenatide once-weekly has been shown to result in a significantly greater fasting plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction, with similar weight reduction, compared with the twice daily exenatide formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. In the current study, patients who continued exenatide once-weekly treatment for a total of 52 weeks maintained the improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose observed during the first 26 weeks of treatment (52-week improvements: &#x02212;1.6% and &#x02212;1.8 mmol/l) and exhibited a significant improvement from original baseline in body weight (&#x02212;1.8 kg). Similar 52-week improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose and weight have previously been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>].</p><p>DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide) elicit effects through the GLP-1 pathway; however, distinct differences exist in the mechanism of action of these compounds. Namely, inhibition of the DPP-4 leads to a two- to threefold elevation of endogenous GLP-1, while administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists results in higher plasma concentrations of agents that bind directly to the GLP-1 receptor. In a short-term trial by DeFronzo <italic>et al</italic>. comparing exenatide twice daily with sitagliptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], the postprandial circulating concentration of exenatide, which has similar potency to GLP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>], was approximately fourfold greater than the increase in postprandial GLP-1 achieved with sitagliptin (15 p<sc>m</sc>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]). The greater circulating GLP-1 receptor agonist concentration observed with exenatide twice daily in the study by DeFronzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>] was associated with greater postprandial glucose control and body weight reduction, and similar fasting plasma glucose improvement, compared with sitagliptin. The exenatide molecule in the sustained release (once-weekly) formulation used in the present study and twice daily formulation are identical, and the primary mechanism for the enhanced efficacy of exenatide once-weekly compared with sitagliptin during the first 26 weeks of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>] was likely due to the continuous exposure to therapeutic concentrations of exenatide (&#x0223c;70 p<sc>m</sc>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]) achieved with once-weekly exenatide. Thus, the significant improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose and body weight observed in the present study after switching from sitagliptin to exenatide once-weekly may be attributable to the continuous exposure to higher circulating concentrations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide.</p><p>Pioglitazone, which exerts its anti-hyperglycaemic effects primarily through decreasing insulin resistance, resulted in a significantly smaller HbA<sub>1c</sub> improvement and similar fasting plasma glucose improvement compared with patients treated with exenatide once-weekly in the first phase of this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. In the cohort of these patients who completed 52 weeks of treatment, exenatide once-weekly maintained HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose improvements; however, weight significantly decreased to a value similar to that observed prior to pioglitazone treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Markers of cardiovascular risk</title><p>Consistent with a previous study of exenatide once-weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], patients who received exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks maintained significant systolic blood pressure improvement (&#x0223c;3 mmHg). Systolic blood pressure was not significantly changed in patients originally randomised to sitagliptin during the initial 26-week period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]; however, switching to exenatide once-weekly was associated with significantly reduced systolic blood pressure. Of note, the improvement in systolic blood pressure was greater in patients with abnormal (&#x02265; 130 mmHg) systolic blood pressure.</p><p>In contrast to a previous assessment of exenatide once-weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], a significant 52-week improvement in HDL cholesterol, but not total cholesterol and triglycerides, was observed. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, as the baseline values for these lipid variables were comparable. The first phase of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>] confirmed the well-established effects of pioglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>] to decrease triglycerides and increase total and HDL cholesterol. Treatment with exenatide once-weekly in these patients increased triglycerides and decreased LDL and HDL, such that these lipids were not significantly changed from original baseline. While a significant change in total cholesterol was not observed in patients treated with exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks, switching to exenatide once-weekly from either sitagliptin or pioglitazone was associated with a significant improvement in total cholesterol.</p><p>Overall, treatment with exenatide once-weekly for 52 weeks, or switching to exenatide once-weekly from sitagliptin, was associated with favourable 52-week changes in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Patients who switched from pioglitazone exhibited a significant decrease in B-type natriuretic peptide, and increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, such that these markers were not significantly changed from original baseline; the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio significantly improved from original baseline. It should be noted that the low mean baseline values of these markers make clinical interpretations difficult. Although the mechanism responsible for these improvements cannot be elucidated from this study, it has been demonstrated that improvements in microalbuminuria are associated with improvements in systolic blood pressure and HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]; B-type natriuretic peptide is also interrelated with renal and vascular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. The differential effects by which exenatide increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to original baseline values in pioglitazone-treated patients, but was associated with overall high-sensitivity C-reactive protein improvements in the other two cohorts are unclear but may be related to the similar differences in HDL cholesterol change between these treatment arms (HDL cholesterol has been suggested to be the primary lipid associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Further studies are warranted to elucidate the effects of exenatide once-weekly on these cardiovascular risk markers, particularly in patients with abnormal values.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>As in previous trials with exenatide, mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were the primary adverse events. Of note, patients who received exenatide once-weekly during the initial 26-week treatment period experienced a lower rate of nausea compared with patients who switched (5 vs. 10&#x02013;11%), presumably because of prior exenatide exposure. Consistent with the glucose-dependent nature of enhanced insulin secretion with exenatide, there were no episodes of major hypoglycaemia throughout the study. Overall, 16 patients (4%) withdrew during this period as a result of an adverse event or loss of glucose control.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Conclusion</title><p>The open-label, uncontrolled, study design limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study period; however, it should be noted that, in this phase of the study, neither the patients nor the investigators were informed of original treatment assignment (exenatide once-weekly, sitagliptin or pioglitazone) during the initial 26-week treatment period. The 52-week improvements in glycaemic control and body weight associated with exenatide once-weekly-only treatment were similar to those previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. The improvements in glycaemic control, body weight and systolic blood pressure observed following the switch from sitagliptin to exenatide once-weekly were consistent with continuous exposure to higher pharmacological concentrations of a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Furthermore, the maintenance of glycaemic control and accompanying weight reduction observed following the switch from pioglitazone to exenatide once-weekly may be of particular clinical significance for some patients. Of note, exenatide once-weekly has also demonstrated greater improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight compared with titrated insulin glargine, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia but with a greater incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Thus, exenatide once-weekly has been demonstrated to elicit greater HbA<sub>1c</sub> improvement when directly compared with three agents that are commonly used after metformin (sitagliptin, pioglitazone, insulin glargine). The current findings suggest that exenatide once-weekly may also be a suitable treatment alternative in patients with Type 2 diabetes on a background of metformin who are not currently achieving adequate glycaemic control with a DPP-4 inhibitor, or in whom thiazolidinedione-related body weight gain is a concern.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the DURATION-2 Study Group and their staff for their excellent work in the conduct, reporting and quality control of the study; the study patients for their participation; Leigh MacConell, Lisa Porter, Larry Shen, and Jenny Han for assistance with study design and data interpretation; Alkermes for development and manufacture of the extended release exenatide formulation.
