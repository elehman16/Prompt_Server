Symptoms (eg, chronic cough, dyspnea) are associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We evaluated the impact of arformoterol on HRQoL in COPD patients, measured by St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Post hoc growth mixture model (GMM) analysis examined symptom response profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We examined data from a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-month safety trial of twice-daily nebulized arformoterol 15 &#x000b5;g (n=420) versus placebo (n=421). COPD severity was assessed by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) status. GMM analysis identified previously unknown patient subgroups and examined the heterogeneity in response to SGRQ Symptoms scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SGRQ Total score improved by 4.24 points with arformoterol and 2.02 points with placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.006). Significantly greater improvements occurred for arformoterol versus placebo in SGRQ Symptoms (6.34 vs 4.25, <italic>P</italic>=0.031) and Impacts (3.91 vs 0.97, <italic>P</italic>=0.001) scores, but not in Activity score (3.57 vs 1.75, <italic>P</italic>=0.057). GMM identified responders and nonresponders based on the SGRQ Symptoms score. End-of-study mean difference in SGRQ Symptoms scores between these latent classes was 20.7 points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; 95% confidence interval: 17.6&#x02013;23.9). Compared with nonresponders, responders were more likely current smokers (55.52% vs 44.02%, <italic>P</italic>=0.0021) and had more severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]: 1.16 vs 1.23 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.0419), more exacerbations (0.96 vs 0.69, <italic>P</italic>=0.0018), and worse mean SGRQ Total (59.81 vs 40.57, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), Clinical COPD Questionnaire (3.29 vs 2.05, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (3.13 vs 2.75, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) scores. Arformoterol-receiving responders exhibited significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.09 vs 0.008, <italic>P</italic>=0.03) and fewer hospitalizations (0.13 vs 0.24, <italic>P</italic>=0.02) than those receiving placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, arformoterol treatment significantly improved HRQoL reflected by SGRQ. For the analysis performed on these data, arformoterol may be particularly effective in improving lung function and reducing hospitalizations among patients who are unable to quit smoking or present with more severe symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire</kwd><kwd>growth mixture model</kwd><kwd>HRQoL</kwd><kwd>long-acting beta agonist</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>COPD and other chronic lower respiratory diseases are now the third leading cause of death in the US with 14.8 million people diagnosed with COPD and 12 million estimated to be living with COPD who remain undiagnosed.<xref rid="b1-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The economic burden of COPD is significant, with projected direct and indirect costs of up to $49.9 billion annually in the US;<xref rid="b2-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> indirect costs account for $20.5 billion of this Total, which include additional burden on patients and employers due to lost productivity and on individuals as a result of absenteeism, Activity limitation, and disability.<xref rid="b4-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Measures of airflow obstruction (eg, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]) have traditionally been used to assess the severity of COPD.

An additional objective was to identify unknown patient subgroups (latent classes) using the GMM methods. The authors hypothesized that patients would show greater improvement in SGRQ scores with arformoterol treatment compared with placebo and that the GMM analysis would reveal responders and nonresponders with distinct characteristics.

The SGRQ is a validated measure that consists of 50 items that combine to produce a Total score and three domain scores: Symptoms (frequency and severity), Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), and Impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease). SGRQ scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment), reflecting health status over the previous 4 weeks. A 4-point change in mean SGRQ Total score is considered to be clinically meaningful.</p></sec><sec><title>SGRQ outcomes</title><p>SGRQ outcomes were analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs) that included terms for treatment, baseline smoking status, baseline SGRQ score, baseline SGRQ-by-visit interaction, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction. The mean change at each visit was based on the least-square means (LSMs) from the MMRMs. The difference in clinically significant change between arformoterol and placebo was assessed using logistic regressions that included terms for treatment, baseline smoking status, and baseline SGRQ Total score. At each visit, logistic regressions were performed using the observed cases. The last available SGRQ measure for each individual was used for the end point comparison. To characterize the relationship between changes in SGRQ and FEV<sub>1</sub>, we examined change from baseline to end point in SGRQ Total score for subgroups defined by percentage change in FEV<sub>1</sub>. For all analyses, the two-tailed significance level was set to <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>GMM analysis</title><p>A GMM analysis was conducted to examine the heterogeneity in response to SGRQ Symptoms scores across the four assessment points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) while controlling for key risk factors (age and smoking status) at baseline. SGRQ Symptoms scores were analyzed in the post hoc GMM analysis because symptoms are most proximal to treatment and thus most likely to show a direct relationship with treatment.</p><p>Given large variability in SGRQ Symptoms scores, we hypothesized that there may be subgroups with differential response profiles. The GMM analysis was used to determine whether latent classes (previously unknown or unspecified subgroups) exist in the trial data; subgroup membership was not known a priori but was inferred from the differential patterns of change in data. The heterogeneity of the overall data was treated as being made up of several homogeneous subgroups or classes, each of which was meaningfully different from other classes. Therefore, each post hoc-identified subgroup of patients had distinct SGRQ symptom response profiles. In addition, other characteristics of patients belonging to these latent classes were also evaluated. Stull and Houghton<xref rid="b19-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> had provided a detailed description of the GMM methodology.</p><p>In the present analyses, GMMs examined the heterogeneity within each treatment arm, controlling for age and smoking status, to see if subgroups of differential responders (eg, responders and nonresponders) could be identified. The best model fit was determined by testing different models specified with different numbers of latent classes. Model fit was evaluated using visual examination and empirical indices: Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample size-adjusted BIC, and accuracy of latent class assignment using posterior probabilities (entropy). Smaller values of BIC and sample size-adjusted BIC indicate a better model performance and are preferred when choosing the number of latent classes.<xref rid="b25-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although there is no conventional level for the threshold value for entropy, values closer to 1 indicate greater accuracy of latent class assignment. In addition, visual inspection of the latent class trajectories provided insight into the homogeneity of the trajectories within each latent class, as well as the differences between the latent classes. Fit statistics, visual inspection, and descriptive statistics for each latent class were used to determine the number of latent classes and whether the identified classes were clinically meaningful.</p><p>Patients were assigned to a single latent class based on the final model&#x02019;s posterior probabilities.<xref rid="b25-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Differences between latent class subgroups were explored. Bivariate comparisons between latent classes of responders, using one-way analyses of variance and chi-square tests, compared the following baseline variables: FEV<sub>1</sub>, number of exacerbations, SGRQ Total score, CCQ score, and MMRC Dyspnea Scale score.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines.

The arformoterol and placebo responders demonstrated comparable improvements in symptoms (&#x02212;10.3 vs &#x02212;7.2, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) and a similar mean number of exacerbations (0.55 vs 0.69, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-13-499">Figure 4</xref>). However, the arformoterol-treated responders exhibited significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.09 vs 0.008 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.03) and significantly fewer hospitalizations (0.13 vs 0.24, <italic>P</italic>=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-13-499">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this analysis of patient-reported outcomes from a large safety study, COPD patients treated with arformoterol reported significant improvement in HRQoL as measured by the SGRQ Total score as well as the Symptoms and Impacts domain scores. In addition, while not significantly different between groups, a higher proportion of patients in the arformoterol group than in the placebo group met the criterion for the minimal clinically important difference of 4% (&#x02265;&#x02212;4 units) on these scores.</p><p>The HRQoL improvements reported here are consistent with a previous study of COPD patients treated with arfor-moterol.<xref rid="b15-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although the previous trial was of shorter duration (12 weeks), Baumgartner et al reported mean SGRQ Total score changes from baseline to week 6 of &#x02212;2.6 and &#x02212;3.6 for patients treated with arformoterol 15 and 25 &#x000b5;g twice daily, respectively, and &#x02212;1.2 in the placebo group.<xref rid="b15-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In both arformoterol groups, the greatest improvements were observed in the Symptoms domain of the SGRQ. The current study found a similar pattern of results. The greatest improvement was in the Symptoms domain, with a mean change from baseline of &#x02212;6.33 in the arformoterol group and &#x02212;4.25 in the placebo group at trial end.</p><p>At the end of the present study, 42.7% of patients treated with arformoterol achieved at least a 4-point improvement in SGRQ Total score (minimal clinically important difference) versus 37.3% of patients treated with placebo. The improvement in SGRQ Total score at 12 months (&#x02212;2.2 vs placebo) is consistent with the mean improvement in SGRQ Total score (&#x02212;2.3 vs placebo) reported in a review of 26 randomized controlled trials that compared LABAs with placebo in the treatment of COPD.<xref rid="b26-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The trials from this review had a large range for observation periods; reports were as early as 3 months to as long as 3 years. However, the majority of the results described were after 6 months.</p><p>Our analysis also showed greater improvements on the Impacts domain of the SGRQ in patients treated with arformoterol compared with patients treated with placebo. While improvements were observed in Activity score in the arformoterol group compared with the placebo group, the difference did not reach statistical significance. This could potentially be explained by the generally older population (&#x02265;63 years old) in this study and the long smoking history of the patients (30+ years in 80% of patients), with approximately half of patients reported to be current smokers.</p><p>The exploratory GMM analyses conducted as part of this post hoc study efficiently identified differential responders on the SGRQ Symptoms domain within all patient responses over time, revealing two distinct and internally homogeneous cohorts. The groups identified in these GMM analyses were labeled as responders and nonresponders due to their different observed patterns of symptom improvement. GMM analyses do not require establishing an a priori threshold for &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d;, and they eliminate the need to try different cut-points on outcomes variables to identify differential responders, which results in multiplicity and violates assumptions of independence of tests.</p><p>The responders and nonresponders differed on multiple important baseline variables. The responder group could be characterized as experiencing greater initial COPD severity that had a greater impact on HRQoL. In addition, the responder group was represented by a significantly higher percentage of current smokers and GOLD status D patients and exhibited significantly higher CCQ and MMRC scores compared with nonresponders.</p><p>Among the symptom responders, arformoterol-treated patients had greater improvements in lung function and fewer hospitalizations than placebo-treated patients. Hospitalizations represent a worse clinical outcome for patients and make up the largest portion of the direct treatment costs of COPD. Reducing symptoms and hospital admissions could help improve patients&#x02019; outcomes and quality of life while reducing the direct and indirect economic burden of COPD. Treating patients who have a baseline profile similar to the responders with arformoterol could help reduce symptoms and reduce hospitalizations, but more research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.</p><p>Stull et al<xref rid="b22-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> conducted a GMM analysis across three studies of indacaterol, one 12-month study and two 6-month studies. The 12-month study resulted in three latent class assignments, while the two 6-month studies resulted in two latent class assignments (nonresponder and responder) similar to the present study. While the findings in the present study are generally consistent with those reported by Stull et al, there were some important differences between the studies with regard to baseline SGRQ Symptoms domain scores. In the report by Stull et al, the responder groups in the two 6-month studies were less symptomatic than the non-responder groups at baseline (SGRQ Symptoms score: 50.5 and 48.3 vs 73.7 and 79.3, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for both). In the present study, the inverse was found. In the present study, the responder group was more symptomatic than the nonresponder group at baseline (75.4 vs 46.0, respectively). One could speculate that the different pattern of GMM results across the current study and the indacaterol study suggests that arformoterol may be more effective among patients with a more severe baseline profile and indacaterol may be more effective among those with less severe symptoms, but head-to-head studies are needed to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p><p>Our study adds to the present knowledge of COPD management, highlighting the importance of assessing health status in addition to lung function to obtain a more accurate evaluation of patient outcome and treatment. In addition, identifying and characterizing differential responders may potentially help to better assess treatment effects.</p><p>Our study has several limitations, which include the fact that there were a meaningful number of treatment discontinuations during the 12-month study. In addition, concomitant medication treatments were allowed (consistent with usual clinical care), which could cloud the assessment of treatment effect. Study findings may not be generalizable to a broader population, partly due to exclusion of some patients based on background LABA/inhaled corticosteroid therapy. However, the consistency of the findings with other studies of the effect of LABAs on the SGRQ lends strength to the conclusions.</p><p>The post hoc GMM analysis has inherent limitations. Because it was an exploratory analysis of a single trial, there was no way to confirm the presence of the same number and characteristics of latent classes in a second study. Thus, we relied on the fit statistics and visual examination of the latent classes. GMMs become a powerful tool when they can be used in more than one study to explore and confirm the results. A second limitation is that the SGRQ Symptoms domain as a stand-alone subscale is not validated. However, this domain assesses patients&#x02019; symptom experience and is more likely to demonstrate a direct relationship with treatment.<xref rid="b19-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b22-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although not a limitation of the method, a note of caution is in order: use of this methodology requires a robust understanding of latent growth modeling and structural growth modeling to identify nuances of the model design and interpret outputs for possible issues.<xref rid="b19-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The findings reported here may add information to those reported by Stull et al<xref rid="b22-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and serve as a partial foundation from which confirmatory analyses or clinical trials could be used.<xref rid="b19-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b22-copd-13-499" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, having partially replicated previous findings supports our confidence in these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In these analyses of data from a large placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with COPD, improvements in arformoterol-treated patients were observed for the SGRQ Total score as well as the Symptoms and Impacts domain scores. Based on the GMM results, we identified two underlying subgroups that determined pattern of symptoms change: responders who at baseline were more impaired in FEV<sub>1</sub> (mean: 1.16 vs 1.23 L, <italic>P</italic>=0.042) and demonstrated more limitations based on SGRQ scores (mean: 59.81 vs 40.57, Symptoms score 75.43 vs 45.97, Impacts score 46.13 vs 27.43, and Activity score 74.54 vs 59.56, all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) compared with nonresponders. Treatment with arformoterol appeared to decrease hospitalizations and increase FEV<sub>1</sub> for patients with more severe symptoms at baseline who were unable to quit smoking. More research is needed to better understand and optimize treatment for patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Data sharing statement</title><p>The datasets during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was funded by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
