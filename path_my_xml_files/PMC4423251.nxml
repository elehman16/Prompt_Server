<bold>Background and study aims:</bold> There are two types of endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) endoscope, the radial scanning (RS) and the curved linear array (CL). The
type of EUS endoscope used at a first intent depends on local expertise, local
habits and sometimes on how the examination is reimbursed. In Japan, RS is
mainly used for observation, whereas CL is primarily used for histopathological
diagnosis and treatment. We compared the imaging capabilities of RS and CL in
evaluating the pancreaticobiliary region, a study which has not been performed
previously.</p><p>Patients and methods: This prospective and randomized trial included 200 patients
undergoing endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreaticobiliary region by RS
(n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;99) or CL (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;101). The primary end point was the basal imaging capability
of each technique. Eleven pancreaticobiliary areas were assessed and scored
(range, 0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;2). Endoscopists evaluated each criterion, and a transcriber
recorded the decisions in real time.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> The mean imaging scores in the RS and CL groups were 18.39 and
19.62, respectively (significantly higher in CL, 95&#x0200a;%CI: 0.82&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;1.64). Although
no significant difference in imaging capability for the pancreatic head, body,
or tail was observed between CL and RS, the imaging capability of CL for the
pancreatic head&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;body transition region was superior to that of RS. Although no
significant difference in imaging capability for the middle and inferior bile
duct or the cystic duct was observed between CL and RS, the imaging capability
of RS for the major duodenal papilla and gallbladder was superior to that of CL.
For the area from the hepatic portal region to the superior bile duct, the
imaging capability of CL was superior. In the delineation of the branch area of
the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, CL was also superior to RS.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> The non-inferiority of the overall imaging capability of CL
to that of RS was demonstrated. CL was superior in the delineation of the
pancreatic head &#x02013; body transition region, the area from the hepatic portal
region to the superior bile duct, and the vascular bifurcation, whereas RS was
superior in the delineation of the major duodenal papilla and gallbladder. Thus,
for detailed evaluations of specific areas, the choice of scope should probably
be considered.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has become established for the identification of small lesions in the pancreaticobiliary region and for the detailed examination required for qualitative evaluation and differential diagnosis <xref rid="JR028-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="JR028-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, and curved linear array endoscopic ultrasonography (CL-EUS) has been widely adopted. Many centers only have one endoscope, and CL provides the possibility of performing diagnosis, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and different kinds of therapy. In addition, shortening the duration of the examination and avoiding changing endoscopes are also important issues in western countries. However, in Japan, because of concerns over tumor seeding <xref rid="JR028-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> caused by tumor puncture and procedural accidents, endoscopic imaging diagnostic capabilities have been prioritized over histological analysis, and radial scanning endoscopic ultrasonography (RS-EUS) is more widely used. Since the Japanese National Health Insurance program began reimbursing the technical fee for diagnostic EUS&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;FNA in Japan in April 2010, CL-EUS examinations and techniques have rapidly become more popular. Consequently, the number of cases in which an RS scope must be replaced by a CL scope for FNA has increased. If imaging capability does not differ between RS and CL, screening can be completed with one EUS scope. Although there are studies on the basic imaging capability of RS <xref rid="JR028-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, no study has compared the differences in imaging capabilities between RS and CL for lesions in the pancreaticobiliary region.</p><p>We conducted a prospective non-inferiority study comparing the imaging capabilities of CL and RS to investigate the suitability of CL as the standard for EUS examination in the pancreaticobiliary region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group study conducted at the Gastroenterology Center of Teine-Keijinkai Hospital. Consecutive cases requiring EUS examination, who had any biliopancreatic abnormality on ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT) between May and December 2011, were included. Exclusion criteria were (1) a history of surgical treatment for upper gastrointestinal or pancreaticobiliary disease; (2) suspected intestinal obstruction/stenosis; (3) lack of patient consent; (4) serious complications and unstable vital signs; and (5) judgment by attending endoscopists that examination would be unsafe. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Teine-Keijinkai Hospital, and informed, written consent was obtained from the patients. This trial was also registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000007578, www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index/htm).</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>The EU-ME1 endoscopic ultrasound center (Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was used along with the GF-UE260-AL5 RS scope (Olympus Medical Systems) and the GF-UCT240 or UCT260 CL scopes (Olympus Medical Systems). EUS images were in standard B-mode, and the frequency for both RS and CL was set at 6&#x0200a;MHz which is the default setting for EUS and is generally used at our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical protocol</title><p>A third-party individual, who was different from the endoscopist performing the EUS, used biased-coin randomization to allocate cases to the groups. The patients were blinded about the scope used but the endoscopists were informed immediately before the examination. The patients were placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and the antispasmodic agent scopolamine butyl bromide (20&#x0200a;mg) was administered intramuscularly. If scopolamine was contraindicated (patients aged &#x02265;&#x0200a;65 years or those with heart disease, prostate disease, or glaucoma), 1 unit of glucagon was administered intramuscularly. Although, there is not enough evidence with regard to the use and administration methods of antispasmodic agents, we believe they are useful based on our observation of organs especially from the duodenum to the papilla. In addition, they are effective for a relatively long period of time, especially after intramuscular injection. For these reasons, they are administered routinely in our clinical practice. The sedative diazepam (5&#x0200a;mg) and the analgesic pethidine hydrochloride (35&#x0200a;mg) were administered intravenously, with additional doses of both being administered depending on patient consciousness levels. Forty minutes into the examination, if the images obtained using the chosen scope were considered insufficient, the scope was changed to the other type and the target area was reevaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions and outcome measures</title><p>The primary end point was the basic imaging capability to evaluate the pancreaticobiliary region. Eleven areas were assessed and each was assigned one of three scores: 0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;2 points. The summation of the 11 items was defined as the primary end point (imaging capability for observational index). &#x0200a;<xref rid="TB028-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows score definitions. &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; was assigned when imaging was impossible for all organs. &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; were allocated according to standards determined for each imaged area. For the pancreas, &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; was assigned when the target organ was clearly visualized using imaging markers in each region and their positions relative to the pancreas were identified. The markers in each area and their relative positions were selected based on reports from the standard imaging techniques. The details are as follows <xref rid="JR028-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

Although JSBS classifies the middle bile duct (Bm) and superior bile duct (Bs) as the upper and lower halves of the common bile duct segment from the convergence of the left and right bile ducts to the superior margin of the pancreas, we defined Bm as the common bile duct segment from the superior margin of the pancreas to the proximal right hepatic artery, and Bs as the common bile duct segment from the proximal right hepatic artery to the convergence of the left and right hepatic ducts.

These five items were compared between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Operators and evaluators</title><p>The endoscopists who performed EUS were 10 pancreaticobiliary endoscopy specialists and met all of the following essential criteria: &#x02265;&#x0200a;8 years of endoscopy experience, &#x02265;&#x0200a;100 EUS examinations/year, an &#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;200 each of RS-EUS and CL-EUS examinations performed for more than 3 years. In addition, endoscopists who had performed &#x02265;&#x0200a;500 RS-EUS examinations or &#x02265;&#x0200a;250 CL-EUS examinations were classified as supervisors, and the other endoscopists were classified as experts. While there were four supervisors at our institution, examinations were always performed in the presence of at least one supervisor. On that basis, the endoscopists evaluated each criterion during the examinations, and a transcriber recorded their decisions in real time. Both the operators and supervisors evaluated all images. If they disagreed on the evaluation, the decisions made by the supervisors were given priority.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis</title><p>A non-inferiority design was used in this study. The non-inferiority margin for the CL group in comparison with the RS group was 5&#x0200a;% (1.1 points for 11 items) of the total points (22 points for 11 items). When calculating the difference in mean points between RS and CL groups, a lower limit of more than &#x02212;5&#x0200a;% of the total points for the 95&#x0200a;% confidence interval (CI) was considered to confirm the non-inferiority of the CL group. <italic>P</italic> values for the difference in the mean points between RS and CL groups were calculated by <italic>t</italic> test. We expected that the likelihood of each item being two points was 0.8 and that of each item being zero points was 0.2 for the sample size calculation. Its expectation and variance were estimated to be 1.6 and 0.64, respectively. They were multiplied by the item total of 11 and the square root calculated, giving an estimated standard deviation of the total points of 2.65 for both groups. Similarly, the expectation of the total points was 17.6.&#x0200a;Under these conditions, to maintain a one-sided type I error of 2.5&#x0200a;% with a statistical power of &#x0003e;&#x0200a;80&#x0200a;%, a sample size of &#x0003e;&#x0200a;92 cases per group is needed. Because we expected that a few cases would be excluded for some reason, 100 cases per group were enrolled. Despite the primary hypothesis of non-inferiority, the superiority of CL could be stated without any adjustment of the type I error, if a significant difference was observed.</p><p>For additional detailed analysis, we compared the proportions of achievement of two points in both groups for each of the 11 items using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. If the proportions in the groups were 80&#x0200a;% vs. 60&#x0200a;%, the statistical power was 84&#x0200a;% for each analysis.</p><p>Usual inter- or intra-rater reliability of the scores used for the primary end point was difficult to perform because repetitive examinations for the same patients were not possible. Instead, we calculated coefficients of variation (CVs) for the scores stratified by experts and supervisors. The CV in this study can be interpreted as the consistency or stability of the observation among various patients. Since we basically investigated imaging capability in healthy regions, the scores should not be widely dispersed, apart from in patients with anatomical variations. In addition, we performed subgroup analysis according to the level of experience of the endosonographers as defined above. To control the potential for residual confounding of the primary end point evaluation, we performed multivariate analysis using general linear models adjusted by the level of experience and the chief purpose of the observation (background diseases).</p><p>For other analyses, <italic>t</italic> tests were used for continuous values, whereas chi-square tests, Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests, or Mann&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;Whitney tests were used as required for discrete values.

Using the RS scope, the experts performed 47 examinations, and the supervisors performed 52 examinations.

<xref rid="JR028-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. There are two types of scope, i.&#x0200a;e. RS and CL. The advantages and disadvantages of each scope have previously been outlined on the basis of differences in the methods <xref rid="JR028-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The wide 360&#x000b0; scanning range of RS makes it easy to grasp relationships with surrounding organs and blood vessels, and it is comparatively easy to visualize imaging in alignment with the organ axis. However, its greatest disadvantage is that it cannot extract tissue samples. In contrast, although CL can collect tissue samples, its scanning range is narrow (180&#x000b0;), and it is difficult to align with the organ axis <xref rid="JR028-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="JR028-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. EUS-FNA using a CL scope has been established as a useful examination technique not only in the West but also in Japan. However, only a few studies have compared the capacities of RS and CL to diagnose lesions in some specific organs such as the pancreas and esophagus <xref rid="JR028-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="JR028-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="JR028-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Moreover, no studies have compared the basic imaging capability of these methods in the pancreaticobiliary region. Therefore, the application of each scope for evaluating these lesions remains unclear. At our hospital, EUS has always played an important role in the pancreaticobiliary region <xref rid="JR028-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, not only as a scanning technique for qualitative and differential diagnoses but also as an examination used when blood biochemical examinations find abnormal levels of pancreatic or hepatobiliary enzymes, and for identifying minute lesions when a small abnormality is found in the region by another imaging examination. In addition, sub-screening EUS examination (as preoperative examination for laparoscopic cholecystectomy) has been actively performed.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated imaging capability in the pancreaticobiliary region after selecting 11 evaluation items. The overall score for all 11 items was significantly higher in the CL group.&#x0200a;However, when regions that are not primarily observed by RS, i.&#x0200a;e. Bs&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;Bp, SMA, and CA, were excluded, the RS scores increased for the remaining eight items. In addition, when only vasculature evaluation is required after excluding SMA and CA, the remaining nine items exhibited nearly identical scores in both groups. The discrepancy between our non-inferiority hypothesis and the results could be explained by the marked superiority of CL for Bs&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;Bp and SMA and the standard deviations being smaller than assumed. From these results, it can be concluded that, although imaging capability varied depending on the target area, there was no difference between groups for basic evaluation of the pancreaticobiliary region, excluding vasculature evaluation.</p><p>Assessment of imaging capability in each area revealed that CL was superior for Bs&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;Bp, Phb, and the branch areas of CA and SMA. Hara et al. reported the usefulness of CL for Bp imaging <xref rid="JR028-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and our study verified those findings. In contrast, for imaging of the major duodenal papilla and the gallbladder as well as long-axis visualization of the bile duct, CL was inferior. This may have been because of the differences in scope characteristics. For duodenal examination, because the tip of the scope is positioned in a relatively narrow space, the range of motion for the hard tip part is limited. To visualize the duodenal muscularis propria by CL, the ultrasound scanning surface must be perfectly parallel to the muscularis propria, but in reality, this is difficult to achieve. Therefore, it was inferred that it would be easier to visualize the muscularis propria by RS.&#x0200a;Although both scopes can visualize the proximal part of the papilla to some degree, CL was inferior for capturing images of the common bile and pancreatic ducts penetrating the duodenal muscularis propria. On the basis of the above results and because a detailed diagnosis of extent, including infiltration of the duodenal muscularis propria, is necessary, it appears that RS should be chosen over CL to perform an endoscopic papillectomy of papillary neoplasms.</p><p>Both scopes were able to visualize the middle and lower bile duct (Bmi) to the same degree. The benefit of the CL scope is its ability to visualize the upper bile duct (Bs), which is a characteristic feature of EUS.&#x0200a;However, the RS scope is superior with regard to visualization of long-axis views of two or more segments (Bmi), and images can sometimes be easily recognized on the same screen. Lesion sites ranging from Bi to Bm may also be easily recognized.</p><p>With regard to gallbladder visualizing capability, CL was inferior. However, the detection rates were both low (RS, 47&#x0200a;%; CL, 13&#x0200a;%). This is because there was no landmark that could be used to visualize the gallbladder fundus, and two points based on the obtained long-axis views of the gallbladder were used to define the gallbladder fundus in this study. Further examination of zero-point gallbladder images found that the detection rates for RS and CL were 0.0&#x0200a;% and 0.9&#x0200a;%, with no significant difference between the groups. These results indicate that a series of short-axis views was possible with both scopes. When observing the gallbladder by EUS, however, we should assess the gallbladder fundus carefully because there is no landmark to define this region, as described above.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the secondary end points of lesion imaging and new lesion imaging between the groups. However, examination time, overall sedative dose, and scope change rate tended to be greater for CL. One reason for this may be that when observing pancreatic head and bile duct lesions by CL, the scope is often pushed into the duodenal bulb.</p><p>The limitations of this study include its single-center nature and the lack of assessment of the diagnostic capability. In the future, we aim to determine which scope would be more effective for detecting lesions, determining tumor extent, and making qualitative and differential diagnoses of tumors at each site.</p><p>This study has a large bias in some points, and this bias is not easily resolved. When this study was launched, we were concerned that the results might be biased by the differences in experience of each endoscopist operating the RS and CL scopes. Because RS-EUS has been widely used in Japan, it is undeniable that the number of cases that endoscopists have experienced differs between RS and CL. However, the CL scope is also widely adopted in Japan, so endoscopists&#x02019; skills operating the CL scope have improved. At our hospital, we have performed 700&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;800 RS-EUS examinations/year since 1997 and &#x02265;&#x0200a;150&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;200 CL-EUS examinations/year since 2006.&#x0200a;Our endoscopists have acquired sufficient experience to perform the assessments of imaging capabilities in this study. Furthermore, examinations by both RS and CL were always performed in the presence of supervisors. As such, we believe that there was no difference in experience which would substantially affect the results of this study. In fact, the overall scores in the CL group exceeded those in the RS group, and the imaging capability scores for each area were comparable between groups.</p><p>In conclusion, our result demonstrated the superiority of the overall imaging capability of CL for the pancreaticobiliary region compared with RS.&#x0200a;CL was superior in delineating the pancreatic head&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;body transition region, the area from the hepatic portal region to the superior bile duct, and the vascular bifurcation, whereas RS was superior in delineating the major duodenal papilla and the long axis of the bile duct/gallbladder. Thus, scope selection should probably consider the purpose of examination and the target area.</p><table-wrap id="TB028-8"><label><bold>Supplementary Table&#x0200a;S1</bold></label><caption><title>Coefficients of variation for the scores used for primary end point.</title></caption><table rules="all"><col width="10*"/><col width="15*"/><col width="15*"/><col width="26*"/><col width="26*"/><thead><tr><td colspan="2"/><td>Overall, %</td><td>Excluding SMA, CA, %</td><td>Excluding Bsp, SMA, CA, %</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">RS</td><td valign="top" align="left">Expert</td><td valign="top" align="left">8.0</td><td valign="top" align="left">5.7</td><td valign="top" align="left">6.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td valign="top" align="left">Supervisor </td><td valign="top" align="left">10.5</td><td valign="top" align="left">8.5</td><td valign="top" align="left">9.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td valign="top" align="left">Total</td><td valign="top" align="left">9.4</td><td valign="top" align="left">7.3</td><td valign="top" align="left">8.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">CL</td><td valign="top" align="left">Expert</td><td valign="top" align="left">5.4</td><td valign="top" align="left">6.5</td><td valign="top" align="left">6.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td valign="top" align="left">Supervisor</td><td valign="top" align="left">6.1</td><td valign="top" align="left">7.6</td><td valign="top" align="left">7.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td valign="top" align="left">Total</td><td valign="top" align="left">5.8</td><td valign="top" align="left">7.2</td><td valign="top" align="left">7.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SMA, superior mesenteric artery; CA, celiac artery; Bsp, from the superior bile duct to the hepatic portal region; Expert: RS&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;500 and CL&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;250, Supervisor: RS&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;500 and CL&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;250.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="TB028-9"><label><bold>Supplementary Table&#x0200a;S2&#x0200a;a</bold></label><caption><title>Stratified analysis and multivariate analysis with general linear models. <bold>Model 1</bold> Stratified analysis.</title></caption><table rules="all"><col width="12*"/><col width="12*"/><col width="18*"/><col width="12*"/><col width="12*"/><col width="10*"/><thead><tr><td rowspan="2">Strata</td><td rowspan="2">Comparison</td><td rowspan="2">Difference in the score<break/>(11 items)</td><td colspan="2">95&#x0200a;%CI</td><td rowspan="2">
