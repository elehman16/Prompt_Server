<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Research has demonstrated that one-third of all dementias are attributable to VCI.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> More specifically, the proportion of vascular dementia attributable to small-vessel disease ranges from 36 to 67%.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The worldwide economic burden of dementia is increasing at an unprecedented rate. In 2015, a 35% increase led to a worldwide annual estimate of 818 billion US dollars. The worldwide costs of dementia are expected to exceed 1 trillion US dollars by 2018.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Notably, vascular dementia has among the highest annual direct costs and highest hospitalisation-related costs compared with other dementias such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The average annual cost per patient with VCI was $33&#x02005;740,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> compared with a variable range of $1500&#x02013;$91&#x02005;000 for Alzheimer's disease. The costs per VCI admission were &#x0223c;$9545 with the average number of admissions increasing through the progression of the disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Epidemiological data suggest that modification of vascular risk factors may be beneficial in slowing the progression of VCI.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> Hence, aerobic-based exercise training is one promising approach to delay the progression of VCI by reducing key vascular risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. What remains unknown is whether aerobic-based exercise training as an intervention strategy compared with &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; for individuals with mild SIVCI is a cost-effective strategy. Until now, the simultaneous impact of healthcare costs and consequences remains unknown. It is an essential next step to provide an estimate of the costs and consequences (ie, health gains or losses) related to the aerobic training (AT) intervention, given that this type of intervention could be delivered at a population level and thus have an immense impact.</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a concurrent economic evaluation with individual level data on cost and effectiveness outcomes collected during a proof-of-concept single-blinded randomised controlled trial&#x02014;the Promotion Of the Mind Through Exercise (PROMoTE) trial.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Our primary objective was to determine the incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratio (incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) of thrice weekly AT compared with usual care among individuals with mild SIVCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of economic evaluation</title><p>This cost&#x02013;utility analysis was conducted concurrently with a 6-month proof-of-concept single-blinded randomised controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up study (ie, 6&#x02005;months postintervention).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The details of the PROMoTE trial were previously reported.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Measurements were made at three times: baseline, end of the intervention period (6&#x02005;months postrandomisation) and 6-month postintervention (ie, 12&#x02005;months postrandomisation). Of 440 individuals screened for eligibility, 70 were deemed eligible for this economic evaluation. This economic evaluation used a Canadian healthcare system perspective, and a 6-month (ie, trial completion) and a 12-month (ie, 6-month postintervention) time horizon for the primary economic evaluation assessing the efficiency of the thrice weekly progressive AT and usual care plus education compared with the usual care plus education (CON; comparator) group. Participants in the CON group received usual care as well as monthly educational materials about VCI and healthy diet. However, no specific information regarding physical activity was provided. Briefly, usual care included whatever healthcare services a patient with mild SIVCI would usually receive in their clinical care. The main outcome for the cost&#x02013;utility analysis was the incremental cost per QALY gained. We obtained approval for this study from the University of British Columbia Clinical Ethics Review Board (H13-00715).</p><p>We previously described study design, participant recruitment, randomisation, demographics, methods and results of the PROMoTE trial.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We recruited participants from the University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for AD and related disorders, the Vancouver General Hospital Stroke Prevention Clinic and specialised geriatric clinics in Metro Vancouver, BC. Recruitment occurred between December 2009 and April 2014 with randomisation occurring on an ongoing basis. The assessors were blinded to the participants' group allocation. The primary outcome measures for the PROMoTE study were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the Executive Interview (EXIT-25<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and the Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study&#x02014;Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Secondary outcome measures included executive functions, cardiovascular capacity, physical activity level, physiological markers and health-related quality of life. We included 70 community dwelling older adults who were diagnosed with SIVCI,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which requires the presence of cognitive syndrome<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and small vessel ischaemic disease.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Other inclusion criteria included: (1) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> score &#x0003c;26 at screening; (2) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> score of &#x02265;20 at screening; (3) community-dwelling; (4) live in Metro Vancouver; (5) had a caregiver, family member or friend who interacted with him/her on a weekly basis; (6) sufficient ability to read, write and speak English; (7) acceptable visual and auditory acuity to complete psychometric tests; (8) stable on a fixed dose of cognitive medications that is not expected to change during the 6-month intervention period; (9) provided a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the individual (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial; (10) able to walk independently and (11) in sufficient health to participate in the study&#x02019;s aerobic-based exercise training programme.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Costs</title><p>We tracked healthcare resource usage prospectively. Our primary method used cost diaries where participants were asked to fill out a monthly diary detailing any health resource usage. We also telephoned participants every 3&#x02005;months using a health resource usage questionnaire. For individuals who did not fill out their calendars, the health resource usage questionnaire was the primary mode of healthcare resource usage data collection. For participants who missed the 3-month follow-up telephone call and who did not return their calendar, they were asked to recall their healthcare resource usage over the 6-month intervention period. We also collected healthcare resource usage for the 6-month follow-up period postintervention. We analyse these end points separately (ie, trial completion at 6&#x02005;months and follow-up completion at 1&#x02005;year). The healthcare resource usage questionnaire included the following categories: any visits to healthcare professionals (including general practitioners, specialists, physiotherapists, etc); all visits, admissions or procedures carried out in a hospital and laboratory and diagnostic tests. We calculated the costs of delivering the thrice weekly AT intervention and the CON group. Our base case analysis considered the costs of all healthcare resource use. Research protocol-driven costs were excluded from our analysis.</p><p>A unit cost was assigned for each component of healthcare resource usage. Costs for admission to hospital were based on the fully allocated cost model of a tertiary care hospital, Vancouver General Hospital. We based costs on fee for service rates from the British Columbia Medical Services Plan 2013 price list for all healthcare professional-related costs. Unit costs for specialised services (ie, physiotherapy, chiropractic or naturopathic medicine) were taken from the BC Association website for each specialty. We inflated costs to 2015 Canadian dollars using the consumer price index reported by Statistics Canada. Given that our analytic time horizon was &#x02264;12&#x02005;months, discounting was not applied.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Effectiveness outcome</title><p>Briefly, we assessed health status using the EQ-5D-3L.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The EQ-5D-3L is a short five-item multiple choice questionnaire that measures an individual's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status according to the following five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Each domain has three possible options: no problems, some problems or severe problems. The EQ-5D-3L health state utility values (HSUVs) at each time point are bounded from &#x02212;0.54 to 1.00 where a score of &#x0003c;0 is indicative of a health state worse than death. The HSUVs represent values that individuals within society assign&#x02013;&#x02013;these are Canadian societal values for given health states.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>We administered the EQ-5D-3L at baseline, trial completion and at the 6-month follow-up period to patients and a patient proxy (ie, see below under &#x02018;Caregiver&#x02019;). From these data points, we calculated the total QALYs lost or gained at 6 (trial completion) and 12 (follow-up completion) months for the two experimental groups. We used multiple linear regression to calculate the incremental QALYs based on patient and proxy ratings for each participant adjusted for the baseline utility score. Baseline utility scores are often imbalanced between treatment arms. Given that a patient's utility score at baseline is most often highly correlated with that individual's QALYs over the study period, failure to control for this imbalance can lead to a misleading ICER. As such, we followed the recommendations of Manca and Palmer<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> using multiple linear regression to control for imbalances in baseline utility scores between the two treatment groups. All statistical analyses were carried out using STATA V.10.0.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Caregiver (proxy)</title><p>The caregivers had to be able to read, write and speak English in which the questionnaires were provided with acceptable visual and auditory acuity.

For the 6-month follow-up period, 19% of participants had incomplete 6-month follow-up health resource usage data and 19% had incomplete 6-month follow-up EQ-5D-3L data. The reasons for missing data included: drop out, participant burden and administration error. We calculated the cost and effectiveness estimates for available cases (dropping observations with missing values), complete case sets and an imputed data set.</p><p>We examined the pattern of missing data using the STATA code: &#x02018;mvpatterns&#x02019;. Missing data appeared to be missing at random, and therefore, we imputed missing data using Bayesian analyses following recommendations,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in which all baseline study variables (including treatment assignment) were used to create 40 imputed data sets; parameter estimates and SEs were pooled across the 40 data sets. For multiple imputation, we used the &#x02018;mi imput mvn&#x02019; procedure in STATA. The imputed data are reported as our base case analysis.

Briefly, the incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratio provides an index of the cost per QALY gained at intervention completion (ie, 6&#x02005;months) and cost per QALY gained at 6-month postintervention (ie, 12&#x02005;months). The incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratio is the ratio between the difference in total mean costs between the AT and the CON groups and the difference in the mean QALY gained between the AT and the CON groups.<disp-formula id="BMJOPEN2016014387M1"><label>1</label><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016014387eq1.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula></p><p>Nested imputation and nonparametric bootstrapping were used to model uncertainty around the estimates for costs and effectiveness. For each of the 40 cycles, we imputed missing values and bootstrapped the complete data set. For each cycle of imputation and bootstrapping, we calculated the total healthcare resource use cost and QALYs according to group allocation. The results of each cycle of imputation for participants were averaged in each of the two participant groups. The contribution of each cost item in relation to the total healthcare resource use was estimated for each group. Plots of the cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated based on 5000 iterations of nested imputation/bootstrapping using Fiellers' method to generate 95% confidence ellipses for the joint distribution of cost and effectiveness outcomes.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>The differences in mean costs and health outcomes in each group were expressed by reporting the incremental cost per QALY (ie, the incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratio).

We observed a trend towards improvement in the adjusted incremental QALYs determined from the EQ-5D-3L (by patients and proxies) for the AT group compared with the usual care plus education group at trial completion and 6-month follow-up. Importantly, AT is an alternative to resistance training and is accessible to older adults with mild SIVCI. Further, the delivery of a walking programme on an individual basis requires a low financial investment (ie, the cost of walking poles) by an individual. As such, the results of this economic evaluation represent a substantive contribution to the evidence base on how to efficiently minimise cognitive decline among those with mild SIVCI.</p><p>The findings of this study build on previous research demonstrated that AT has significant and beneficial effects on overall health-related quality of life and quality of life more broadly.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The overall incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratios were not significantly different regardless of whether QALYs were ascertained from patient-reported or proxy-reported health status using the EQ-5D-3L suggesting that for this population, use of patient or proxy ratings should not alter healthcare decision-making. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves confirm that AT is the preferred treatment option for a wide range of plausible willingness to pay thresholds.</p><p>From both our sensitivity analyses, we found that all analyses supported the conclusions that AT resulted in clinically important gains in QALYs. However, our imputed case analysis demonstrated that the intervention was not cost-saving, while the complete case analysis demonstrated that the intervention was cost-saving. One potential explanation for this was that the complete case analysis may better reflect the per protocol findings (ie, those that had greater adherence to the trial).</p><p>The time horizon of our study was limited to the duration of the intervention (ie, 6&#x02005;months) and the follow-up period (ie, 12&#x02005;months). The number of randomised controlled trials of exercise conducted in populations at high risk for dementia is accumulating.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> One study demonstrated that resistance training post a 6-month (frequency of two to three times weekly) intervention significantly improved global cognitive function while maintaining executive and global benefits for at least 18&#x02005;months postintervention.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> However, the number of randomised controlled trials of exercise among individuals diagnosed with SIVCI remains low.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Given that cardiovascular risk factors play a primary role in the onset and progression of VCI, examining the cost-effectiveness of AT is a logical starting place. In adults with mild VCI, 6 months of thrice weekly progressive AT improved cognitive function, relative to CON.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Previous research that AT in older adults has longer term health benefits that we hypothesise would be applicable to adults with mild SIVCI benefit of the intervention may be ideally captured by a longer time horizon.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Further, the sample size of our study was small. As such, there was wide variability in the cost estimates and outliers (ie, &#x000b1;3 SDs from the mean) had a stronger impact than would be expected in a larger sample. However, we did not have any reason to remove any health resource usage outliers in our intention to treat analysis. The health resource usage questionnaire may be subject to recall bias, thus causing potential underestimation of costs. To minimise recall bias, participants were provided with a monthly diary to track and report their healthcare resource usage. Given that cost underestimation may have occurred in both groups, we do not estimate any impact on the incremental cost&#x02013;utility ratio given that this was a randomised controlled trial.</p><p>A key strength of our study is that it deals with a largely understudied yet important population. Importantly, this population actually may represent an ideal target population for intervention given that individuals have not yet crossed the dementia threshold. Hence, it is important to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness and efficiency of targeted interventions. Given that even mildly impaired cognition may impede an individual's ability to self-assess their HRQoL we also used a patient-proxy (ie, caregiver) assessment of the patient&#x02019;s health status.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In this study, we found that the use of the patient or the proxy did not significantly alter our findings. In all instances, we observed a significant increase in QALYs at 6 and 12&#x02005;months regardless of the rater. This is a useful observation because it suggests that among individuals with VCI, the rater should not result in changes in healthcare decision-making. Finally, a highly relevant strength of this study is that the intervention is widely accessible and relatively easy to implement for any community dwelling older adult who is able to walk. The low cost required by an individual to start walking is also appealing from an implementation perspective.</p><p>Our proof-of-concept findings suggest that this exercise (ie, AT) therapy delivered over a span of 6&#x02005;months holds promise for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life in older adults with mild VCI. While our findings suggest that this intervention is not cost-saving, it appears to be cost-effective depending on a decision maker&#x02019;s willingness to pay.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the PROMoTE study participants.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TL-A and JCD had full access to all the data in the study, take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis and involved in study concept and design.
