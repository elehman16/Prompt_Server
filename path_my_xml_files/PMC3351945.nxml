The intraoperative blood loss can be reduced by using mainly blunt tissue dissection as far as possible, reduction of tissue trauma, local hypothermia and pharmacological influence on the body's blood coagulation mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, the postoperative blood loss is influenced by the effectiveness and durability of the body's own hemostasis, external tissue compression, and particularly by the method of wound drainage. In 1954, the French surgeons Redon, Jost and Torque evacuated glass bottles to promote drainage of wound secretion after surgery. This was the beginning of the era of postoperative suction drains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The idea behind wound drainage is an optimized balance of secretion and accumulation of blood and the internal adaptation and stabilization of wounds. Over the years, the drainage technique developed with various modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Aiming to avoid postoperative complications and to provide additional positive effects on wound healing, the postoperative secretion drainage using Redon drains is now a standard method for European Orthopaedic-Trauma surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, there are serious numbers of complications possibly caused by wound drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>One major disadvantage is the risk for retrograde wound contamination with bacteria. Other reasons are the cytoadhesive properties of polymeric drainage systems, increased postoperative blood loss caused by the contact of the drains with tissue surfaces. There are also arguments of injured vessels and impairment of wound healing through foreign body reaction as well as the release of toxic plasticizers, especially when using drainage made of polyvinyl chloride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Concomitantly, numerous studies have addressed the positive effects of a drainage free surgical technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These results show that wound drainage can be waived for certain surgical procedures without the risk of impaired wound healing. the question is whether the prophylactic use of suction drains for the patient really is an important procedure to prevent complications or whether it increases the risk for postoperative blood loss and wound infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another cause of increased blood loss in arthroplasty can be an imbalance in the hemostasis system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. tissue injury induces the release of proteolytic substances which increase fibrinolysis, leading to a relative lack of endogenous proteinase inhibitors like <bold>a</bold>-antiplasmin and <bold>a</bold>-macroglobulin. the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin (trasylol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Bayer, Germany) interrupts this mechanism, as it interferes in regulating the mechanisms of bleeding and thereby may reduce perioperative blood loss. Aprotinin, a kallikrein inactivator, was discovered in 1930. It was isolated in 1936 as a trypsin inhibitor by Kunitz and northrop from bovine tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. these results have been confirmed by many studies showing that aprotinin is able to inhibit a variety of proteinases. Royston and co-workers showed that high doses of aprotinin during cardiac surgery significantly reduced blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Although this effect was achieved through an inhibition of fibrinolysis, there was no increased rate of thrombosis. these results triggered a growing interest in aprotinin and led to a number of studies in cardiac-, vascular-, liverand in orthopedic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The investigation of our study was whether there is a need for suction wound drainage in cement less hip replacement im comparison of wound compression. on the other hand, we sought to analyze whether an intraoperative administration of proteinase inhibitors like aprotinin may lead to a reduction of the perioperative blood loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients, materials and methods</title><p>In a prospective randomized study, patients older than 18 years undergoing elective implantation of cement less arthroplasty of the hip due to manifest coxarthrosis were included (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The objective of operative drainage is to avoid the loss of blood and wound fluid. Yet, these can be a potential breeding ground for bacteria or inhibit adequate wound healing. In recent years, the routine use of wound drainage was questioned due to a lack of data on the benefit of the drainage of blood or secretions on wound healing. Moreover, several publications suggest that wound drainage can result in an increased hemoglobin drop with a higher rate of blood transfusions, especially in endoprosthetic surgery of the knee or hip joint. In a retrospective study of 364 patients with a hip prosthesis implantation, Hallstrom and Steele compared wound drainage with wound compression and found a significant higher difference in blood loss for the drainage group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Ritter et al. demonstrated that total hip replacement with drainage increased transfusion volume on an average of 95 ml of blood per patient as compared to total hip replacement without drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, no increased transfusion requirements were documented after implantation of knee replacement. A retrospective study by Reilly et al. for knee replacement revealed a significant decline in hemoglobin and a significantly higher transfusion rate in patients with wound drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the blood loss in the suction drainage group was about 500 ml per patient higher than in the compression group. It has to be noted that the blood loss via the drains, underwent a degree of dilution by serous tissue fluid. Determination of hematocrit in the defect is a more accurate detection for blood loss. With regard to systemic hemoglobin, no statistically significant difference between the drainage and compression groups was evident and no hemoglobin decline was found in any group postoperatively. The higher blood loss rate of the drainage group did not translate into hemoglobin decreases. However, this rather reflects the behavior of the hos-</p><p>pital transfusion rules than the actual blood loss. In not drained wounds more ecchymoses occur. Hallstrom and Steele reported a hematoma rate in the undrained wounds of 11.4% versus 2.3% in drained wounds and Holt et al. describe 69% versus 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, secondary hematomas have been described after removal of drains. Werner et al. attributes this to the destruction of vascular structures, which are attracted to the vacuum in the lumen of the drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Kirschner, Wolter and Tittel et. al. showed that the drains under "high vacuum" conditions (about 80 kPa) are just of short time use, since the lumen of the drainage tube is quickly occluded by aspirated tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Parker suggests that the hematoma rate is not affected by drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Even in our study we found a hemato-seroma one week after the removal of the drainage tube.</p><p>An additional parameter for measuring the total postoperative blood loss was ultrasound examination of the wound area, which allows a reasonable estimate of any fluid collection. In our study we did not find hematoma as frequently in the compression group as compared to the drainage group.</p><p>Bacteria show a high affinity to polymeric materials. In fact, they produce a biofilm that firmly adheres to the plastic structure. Herein, drains serve as a kind of an entry into the wound area, representing a potential risk factor for an increased postoperative infection rate, which we could not find in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This reflects the ambivalence between sensible drainage of wound secretion and potential risk of infection which asks for appropriate hygiene when changing wound dressings and limited duration of drainage therapy. Willett et al. found a colonization of the wound fluid at the free end of the drainage tube in 6% of patients (n = 120) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Also Knapp et al. reported a contamination of 14.4% of all drainage tubes, while the aspirated wound fluid was infected in only 7.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. With regard to the incidence of wound infections in drained and non-drained wounds no significant difference was found in our study. This result correlates with the literature, stating that the perioperative infection risk and wound healing are not affected by dropping the existence of postoperative wound drainage. With sufficient postoperative tissue compression and venous thrombosis prophylaxis (thus increasing venous return and hemostasis) unimpeded wound healing can be expected. This mechanical way of hemostasis counteracts the formation of hematomas, thus making a contribution to an undisturbed wound healing. The compression of the wound increases the local pressure gradient in the tissue and causes a redistribution of water as an anti-edematous effect. However, compression may cause serious complications. Shall et al. conducted that a too tight compression may aggravate chronic arterial occlusive disease up to ischemia, resulting in pain and eventually irreparable tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Similarly, a localized compression such as a drastic pressure bandage may cause venous stasis, which paradoxically increases the risk of straight bleeding and thromboembolic complications. A correct bandaging technique should achieve a uniformly increasing pressure gradient from proximal to distal on the extremity, resulting in prophylaxis</p><p>of thrombosis, hemostasis and prevention of edema. In our study, we used <italic>ProThera-Huftorthesen </italic>(PolyMedics, Peer Belgium), which were individually adapted preoperatively to patients' proximal thigh.</p><p>Only once the brace had to be removed because of pain and a loose fit after 24 hours. In comparison to winding compression bandages, the procedure was perceived by patients as comfortable and gave stabilizing. Even in the absence of drainage therapy, there was no increase in the rate of hematoma. Additionally, there was a reduction of postoperative blood loss.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the effect of aprotinin on perioperative blood loss. Recent research results from cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery, a described reduction in perioperative blood loss due to aprotinin medication has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The antifibrinolytic effect of aprotinin raises the question of favoring intravascular thrombosis. In formal testing, no significantly increased rates of thrombosis have been shown. One explanation for this is that aprotinin causes a stabilization of the platelet membranes. This results in inhibition of thromboxan release and platelet aggregation which counteracts clot formation.</p><p>The desired hemostasis by aprotinin is therefore not associated with increased thrombogenesis and does not increase the thromboembolic risk. This concept is in line with our study, as we did not find any evidence of any aprotinin induced increase thrombotic events. However, it is important to note that only clinically manifest thromboses were recorded, a targeted search, with the help of a venography was not performed routinely.</p><p>Murkin et al. investigated in several studies the impact and side effects of aprotinin in surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. With bilateral implantation of hip joint prostheses or hip arthrodeses the average blood loss was reduced by Trasylol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>from 2098 ml to 1498 ml, without increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis. Also Samama and Leche et al. obtained in their studies a similar result regarding the influence of aprotinin in orthopedic surgery a similar result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Similarly Jeserschek et al. could show in a prospective randomized study a significant reduction of blood loss after administration of high dose aprotonin when performing hip and knee replacements and excisions of soft tissue sarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, Kasper et al. didn't find a reduction in blood loss by aprotinin medication in arthroplasties of the hip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our own study provided a similar result, since with aprotinin treatment the overall blood loss was not affected. The difference in total blood loss between Trasylol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>and placebo groups was clinically insignificant and without statistical significance. Aprotinin had no discernible effect on the amount of transfused blood.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite the possibility of a modest reduction in the risk of massive bleeding, the strong and consistent negative mortality trend associated with apro tinin, as compared with the lysine analogues, precludes its use in high-risk cardiac surgery. Following the results of the "BART trial" the manufacturer has withdrawn Trasylol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>from the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Even in our study two patients developed severe allergic side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that the blood loss in hip surgery is not reduced by the use of aprotinin.
