These children are usually dependent on parents or guardians for carrying out daily activities including oral care.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dental care is the most common unmet need of these disabled children.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Oral health and dental care of the disabled has generally been poorer than that of the general population.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Studies have shown that blind children have poor oral hygiene, gingivitis, and periodontal diseases.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Dental instruction programs targeting these groups must be developed as they need to gain oral health knowledge and learn oral hygiene practices.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The school system is found to be a conducive environment for teaching preventive oral health practices and promoting oral health for such a disadvantaged population.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] There are nearly 268 blind schools in India, which can be targeted for providing oral health education (OHE) based on the principles of active involvement and reinforcement.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Blind children depend much more on sound, speech, and touch to orient them to a situation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Modification of OHE using alternative teaching aids such as the use of OHE booklet in Braille and oral health talk (OHT) can be used for teaching these children. A few previously conducted studies have focused only on improving oral hygiene skills[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and not on improving their oral health knowledge.</p><p>Hence, a study was conducted with an aim to assess the effect of OHE in the form of Braille and combination of Braille and OHT on oral health knowledge, oral hygiene practices, and status of 12&#x02013;17 years old visually impaired school girls in Pune city.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A comparative, intervention study was conducted from July 2014 to September 2014 among 12&#x02013;17 years old visually impaired school girls studying in a residential school in Pune city, with a total strength of 120 girls. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review and Ethics Committee (2014-14/26) before commencing the study. Necessary permission from the school principal and written informed consent from the parents/local guardians and assent from the girls was obtained.</p><p>An OHE booklet and questionnaire was standardized in English and then translated in Marathi and retranslated in English (Cronbach alpha: 0.86), was typed in Marathi Braille, and a pilot was tested among 30 girls to check for content validity of the OHE bookle, the questionnaire, and feasibility of the study.</p><p>The selected residential blind school runs in two sessions, i.e., morning and afternoon, with 60 girls in each session. All the girls from each session in the age group of 12&#x02013;17 years who were trained to read Braille, irrespective of the degree of visual impairment, were selected for the study whereas girls whose parents/guardians who did not give informed consent and who had any systemic diseases were excluded from the study.</p><p>The sessions were allocated to the two groups by lottery method.</p><p>

</p><p>The data was collected using a specially designed proforma and a structured questionnaire. The proforma included sociodemographic details, pervious medical and dental history, and questions on oral hygiene practices. The Braille-typed, Marathi-translated, structured questionnaire was self-administered and included 10 questions concerning oral health knowledge.</p><p>At baseline before imparting OHE, demographic details and oral hygiene practices were recorded. Assessment of oral health knowledge using the questionnaire and oral hygiene status using Simplified Oral Hygiene Index[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was performed at the baseline and at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> week by a trained and calibrated investigator.</p><p>OHE was provided by dialectic method on a group level by the principle investigator in Marathi language. OHE to both the groups in different forms was given at 0, 2, and 4-week intervals. The study participants in Group A read the OHEn booklet typed in Braille for a period of 20 minutes, whereas in Group B, a 20 minutes pre-validated OHT based on the booklet was delivered by the investigator along with simultaneous reading of the OHE booklet in Braille.</p><p>Evaluation was done at the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> week to assess the changes in knowledge scores, practices, and in simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S) scores in Group A as compared to Group B from the baseline. Right answer for oral hygiene knowledge was given as a score of 1, and wrong answer was scored 0. The mean knowledge score for each group was calculated by summing up the scores of all 10 knowledge questions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0.

The effects of blindness are many, but one of the most common is the inability of the individual to maintain oral health.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] OHE regarding maintenance of oral hygiene is more important to establish good oral routines and knowledge early in life in these children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Improving knowledge and teaching oral hygiene practices to these children require special approaches such as the introduction of OHE booklets typed in Braille and a continuous reinforcement in the form of OHT and patience. The effectiveness of the use of OHE booklet in Braille and OHT on improving the oral health knowledge and oral hygiene practices and status was assessed in this study.</p><p>Adolescents are in particular need of preventive programs as they are prone to have high levels of plaque.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Their oral hygiene practices are based on short-term rewards so as to improve appearance and social attractiveness; therefore, 12&#x02013;17 years old visually impaired school girls were selected for the present study.</p><p>Most of the oral hygiene practices such as the use of toothbrush for cleaning of teeth, mouth rinsing after every meal, and tongue cleaning showed a significant improvement in both the groups at the end of the study. A significant increase in knowledge score was seen in Group B as compared to Group A. It was observed that the knowledge gained was translated into better oral hygiene status and practices.</p><p>A significant improvement was seen among the study participants of Group B as compared to Group A in the use of toothbrush for cleaning of teeth (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). All the study participants from both the group used toothpaste throughout the study for cleaning their teeth. This was in contrast to the study conducted by Yalcinkaya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Hebbal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] where no statistically significant difference was found between the use of toothbrush for cleaning of teeth before and after health education. This might be because of continuous reinforcement in the form of OHT and reading in Braille where the importance of using a toothbrush was emphasized.</p><p>The difference between the methods used for cleaning teeth was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between the two groups at the end of 6 weeks. This may be because the method of brushing was explained orally to the study participants and no personal training was given to them regarding the method of brushing their teeth by holding their hand and using dentoform models.</p><p>The frequency of tooth brushing increased from once to twice daily in both the groups. This study was similar to the study conducted by Hebbal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] where there was a statistically significant difference in frequency of brushing teeth twice daily before and after OHE. This might be due to continuous reinforcement in the form of OHT that emphasized the importance of brushing twice daily.</p><p>A significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) was seen within both the groups at the end of 6 weeks in mouth rinsing after every meal as well as the tongue cleaning practice. The significant increase in the mouth rinsing and tongue cleaning practice may be because of the personal attention given to the children and explaining the importance of mouth rinsing and tongue cleaning practice in maintaining good oral hygiene through continuous reinforcement for 6 weeks given at biweekly interval.</p><p>The intragroup difference for the mean knowledge scores was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at 6<sup>th</sup> week follow-up for both the groups, whereas in the intergroup comparison, the mean knowledge score of Group B was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) as compared to Group A at the 6<sup>th</sup> week follow up. This increase in knowledge scores in Group B as compared to Group A may be because biweekly reinforcement in the form Braille and OHT was provided as well as the language used for explaining the subject was very simple. Moreover, there was a personal human touch of a dentist teaching.</p><p>The intragroup and intergroup evaluation of the OHI-S scores did not show any significant difference in both the groups at the end of the study. This was in contrast to the study conducted by Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] where a decrease in OHI-S in both groups at all time intervals was seen at the end of 12 months. This difference in our study may be because the CI-S was not statistically significant in both the groups as oral prophylaxis was not done at the start of the study and the act of tooth brushing was not supervised. The role of other factors such as technique of tooth brushing, reduced motor skills, and reduced concern about their appearance can also be considered. Furthermore, obtaining help from guardians was not considered, which might have an impact on oral hygiene status of both groups.</p><p>The strengths of the study were that for the first time an OHE booklet typed in braille was used to deliver OHE to the blind girls. In addition, the questionnaire used was typed in braille so that the study participants can read the questions themselves and answer them to avoid any kind of information bias.</p><p>The limitation of the study was that the two groups selected were from the same school due to which carry-over effect could have occurred. This study was conducted in a residential girl's school for a short duration. Further studies involving both the genders, wide age range, and long duration, wherein school personnel and teachers can be involved, are suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, the awareness of oral health among school children was found to be low at the start of the study. OHE in both forms; Braille and combination of Braille and OHT, were instrumental in improving the oral health knowledge, oral hygiene status, and practices of 12&#x02013;17 years old school children. The increase in knowledge regarding oral health was also translated as better oral hygiene status and practices.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and
