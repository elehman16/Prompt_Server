In some situations, where spinal anesthesia (SA) is contraindicated, general anesthesia (GA) will be preferred. Endotracheal intubation by rapid sequence induction is usually preferred in pregnant patients due to airway edema and risk of aspiration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In obstetric patients, the enlarged breasts, weight gain, and airway edema make intubation difficult. There is also high chances of intubation failure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] During laryngoscopy and intubation, there is profound stimulation of adrenergic system resulting in increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure, myocardial oxygen demand, and arrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] As a result, there may be increased chances for myocardial ischemia and cerebral hemorrhage in the perioperative period. Hence, there is a need of finding some alternative to secure the airway without any adverse effects on the patient.</p><p>The advent of supraglottic airway devices (SGADs) to secure the airway has reduced these ill effects by lying outside the vocal cords and providing adequate ventilation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] I-gel is a newer SGAD with noninflatable soft cuff which fits very well into laryngeal inlet and creates tight seal. It does not need laryngoscopy and can be used for both spontaneous and controlled ventilation. A nasogastric tube can be placed through the gastric port of I-gel thereby avoiding insufflation of stomach and regurgitation of gastric contents. Furthermore, insertion and maintenance of anesthesia were easier with I-gel when compared with other SGAD.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The soft cuff of I-gel fits well with patient's airway anatomy and produces very little trauma to the airway.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are not many studies on I-gel use during CS. Hence, we undertook this study to compare the insertion characteristics, hemodynamic disturbances, and airway-related complications between I-gel and endotracheal tube (ETT) in patients undergoing elective CS under GA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After getting Institutional Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent, 80 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class II parturient patients, aged between 20 and 30 years who were undergoing elective CS under GA, were enrolled for the study. Patients&#x02019; refusal, difficult airway, multiple pregnancy, cardiac and respiratory diseases, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, and other medical or surgical complications were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a double-blinded fashion using computer-generated random number code: Group I (<italic>n</italic> = 40)-GA with I-gel and Group E (<italic>n</italic> = 40)-GA with ETT.</p><p>A night before and on the morning of surgery, patients were given tablet ranitidine 150 mg and tablet ondansetron 4 mg. Overnight fasting was ensured. In the operation room, an intravenous access was secured with an 18-gauge cannula, and all standard noninvasive ASA monitors were attached (electrocardiograph, blood pressure, pulse oximeter, temperature probe, and end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>]). GA was induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg, injection fentanyl1 mcg/kg, and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. Rapid sequence induction was followed in all the patients. The airway was secured with either ETT or I-gel as per the randomized group. Insertion of the airway devices was performed by an experienced anesthetist who was blinded to the study. Anesthesia was maintained with 1%&#x02013;1.5% isoflurane and injection vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg). The tidal volume and respiratory rate were adjusted to achieve ETCO<sub>2</sub> between 32 and 40 mmHg. All the patients in Group I were inserted with 12 Fr nasogastric tube. Application of fundal pressure was restricted to avoid regurgitation which can lead to aspiration. Injection fentanyl 1 mcg/kg and injection oxytocin 20 units in 500 ml Ringer lactate solution were given over 15&#x02013;20 min after the delivery of baby. After surgery, reversal of neuromuscular blockade was done with injection neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and injection glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg). Once patient was fully awake, the airway devices were removed without suction. Airway devices were then checked for any blood stain, vomitus, or bile. The gastric aspirate was checked by testing the cuff for pH with litmus paper. A pH of &#x0003c;2.5 was considered to be gastric aspiration, and X-ray of the chest was planned postoperatively.</p><p>The following observations were made by another anesthetist who was also blinded for the study groups: (1) Ease of insertion: (a) easy &#x02013; Inserted at first attempt within 40 s, (b) difficult &#x02013; Inserted at more than one attempt, and (c) failed &#x02013; Could not be inserted after two attempts; (2) Insertion time &#x02013; time duration between insertion of device and appearance of square wave in capnogram; (3) Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR every 2 min for 10 min after insertion and removal of airway devices; (4) Any episode of hypoxia (SPO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%); and (5) Postoperative complications: (a) blood stain on device, (b) gastric aspiration, (c) sore throat, (d) regurgitation, (e) dysphagia, (f) laryngospasm, and (g) nausea and vomiting.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on the previous study,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the mean time taken for insertion of I gel is 11.12 s; we anticipated insertion time to be around 11 &#x000b1; 2 s. Hence, sample size of &#x0003e;32 was required to achieve 85% of power and significant level of 5%. Hence, sample size of 40 was taken per group to avoid any loss of cases during the study. Continuous variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and qualitative data were expressed as numbers (<italic>n</italic>) and percentages (%). Unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-test was used to evaluate age, weight, and insertion time. Chi-square test or Fisher's test was used to compare the other qualitative parameters between the groups. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 16.0; SPSS Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the variables. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The demographic profile and duration of surgery were comparable in both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Usually, regional anesthesia is preferred over GA for CS. However, in some circumstances, GA becomes the choice.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Sympathetic stimulation, failed intubation, and risk of aspiration are the unanticipated adverse effects of intubation during GA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The need for ideal and safe alternative to the ETT made the emergence of SGAD in securing the airway in controlled ventilation. Among various SGADs, I-gel is more ideal due to soft consistency, easier to insert, noninflatable cuff, and leak-free airway.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Since the role of I-gel in pregnant patients is unexplored, we commenced this study to compare the hemodynamic response and postoperative complications of I-gel GA with standard ETT GA.</p><p>In our study, the insertion of I-gel had no difficult or failure rates whereas ETT tube had incidence of eight difficult intubation. This may be attributed to the ease of insertion and requirement of less manipulation of oro-pharyngo-tracheal axis and no cuff inflation in I-gel. Therefore, time taken for securing an airway with I-gel (10.3 &#x000b1; 2.4 s) is rapid in most of the patients in our study. These results were similar to the findings of the study by Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] where the I-gel was compared with ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) for GA in general surgery and orthopedic cases. Usually, obstetric patients have more risk of difficult intubation when compared with general surgery cases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] We also had 20% difficult intubation rates in Group E. These findings were also observed in the study by Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Study by Han <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has showed that the SGAD was effective and safe for elective CS under GA. Our study also showed the use of I-gel in parturients for GA was safe with minimal side effects. Saini <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared PLMA with ETT in elective CS patients. They found that the insertion of PLMA is easier than ETT and the postoperative sore throat incidence was less in PLMA group. We also obtained similar results by using I-gel in obstetric patients undergoing elective CS.</p><p>In elective CS under GA, ETT is no way inferior to other SGAD. However, when considering the hazards of sympathetic stimulation during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, we are in the need of identifying a suitable alternative to ETT. The same was observed in our study, where all the patients in Group E had significant rise in MAP and HR when compared with Group I. Our study results on hemodynamic response are similar to previous study by Ismail <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] where the use of I-gel for GA has provided minimal changes in HR, MAP, and intraocular pressure in comparison with other airway devices in patients undergoing ophthalmic procedures.</p><p>Chauhan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Jadhav <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared the use of I-gel and PLMA in patients undergoing general surgery cases. They found that incidence of sore throat, blood stain on the device, and dysphagia were significantly less with I-gel when compared with PLMA. However, in our study, the incidence of sore throat alone was significantly less in I-gel group whereas the other complications were not significant. This shows the ETT also has less side effect profile in comparison with PLMA.</p><p>Literatures have shown that incidence of postextubation sore throat, mucociliary dysfunction, laryngeal edema, and hoarseness of voice were less with the use of SGAD when compared with ET tube.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Furthermore, SGAD with an inflatable cuff has the potential to cause tissue distortion, venous compression, and nerve injury. Trauma during insertion, multiple insertion attempts, cuff volume, and pressure exerted by the cuff against the pharyngeal mucosa have all been implicated for postoperative complications.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Ease of insertion, proper anatomic fit, no manipulations to adjust the device, absence of inflating cuff, and presence of gastric port for stomach deflation were the reasons for less incidence of postoperative complications in I-gel group in our study.</p><p>Although our study favors the use of I-gel in CS, it has certain limitations. Larger number of patients would have added better strength to our results. Neonatal outcome was not measured in our study. Although ETT is more effective in providing adequate airway seal, we have not tested the airway leak pressure in I-gel.</p><p>The overall outcome of our study adds evidence and strength to the previous studies by Berger <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Badheka <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which suggested that I-gel is likely to be a superior choice in obstetric anesthesia because of easier insertion, fewer insertion attempts, less traumatic and minimal hemodynamic fluctuations.</p><p>In future, research studies comparing I-gel and newer intubating LMA devices should be carried out so that an effective alternative to ETT can be safely provided in obstetric patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>It can be concluded that considering ease of insertion, lesser hemodynamic disturbances, and very low incidence of airway complications, I-gel is found to be a better alternative to ETT in patients undergoing elective CS under GA.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Financial support from Department Research Funds and drugs from pharmaceutical companies were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brinbach</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Browne</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anaesthesia for obstetrics</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2010</year><edition>7th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Churchill Livingstone</publisher-name><fpage>2203</fpage><lpage>25</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Life-saving or ineffective?
