However, most evidence indicates that a substantial proportion of preschool aged children do not meet the widely accepted World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>) of at least 60&#x000a0;min of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hnatiuk et al., 2014</xref>), but rather spend most of their waking hours engaged in sedentary behavior (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2004</xref>). Insufficient MVPA levels and high amounts of sedentary time are associated with high systolic blood pressure (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Vale et al., 2015</xref>), poor motor skills (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Iivonen et al., 2013</xref>) and low cardiorespiratory fitness (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Burgi et al., 2011</xref>) in preschool children. Moreover, both lack of MVPA and high sedentary time are implicated in the etiology of childhood obesity (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Troiano and Flegal, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 1999</xref>) and children tend to carry this excessive adiposity into adulthood (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Pavon et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Rey-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to health outcomes, physical activity (PA) level is related to academic and cognitive function later in life (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Sibley and J.L., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although many children have healthy and active lifestyles, there seems to be a group of children with a very low PA level, low fitness level, and obesity: factors which influence one another, leading to a vicious cycle (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Pietilainen et al., 2008</xref>). This is especially worrying because it is known that, as with being overweight, PA level often tracks from childhood into adulthood (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Biddle et al., 2010</xref>). The Framingham Children's Study showed that less physically active children gained more body fat mass than more active children, and that higher levels of PA in early childhood decreased the amount of body fat mass gained in early adolescence (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). Given that children's PA levels track from early childhood into adulthood and that overweight is difficult to treat once it has developed, increasing these children's PA levels and reducing sedentary time early on may alter their activity trajectory. Thereby increasing the likelihood that they will be physically active and physically fit during the rest of their childhood and into youth and adulthood (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Hallal et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Preschool age might be a critical period to intervene because PA and sedentary behavior seems to be established at this age (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Janz et al., 2005</xref>). Many studies have reported on PA levels using accelerometers, but a thorough description of the PA pattern using the full range of the accelerometer, that is PA level hour by hour, sedentary bouts and breaks in sedentary time, in this age group is lacking in the current literature (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Trost, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Mattocks et al., 2008</xref>). This information may facilitate the identification of intervention opportunities and potentially highlight critical windows through which to intervene. Furthermore, sound knowledge on modifiable PA correlates in young children (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hinkley et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Duch et al., 2013</xref>) and correlates related to preschool have been gained. These include the size of indoor areas, vegetation on playgrounds, and number of staff per child (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Olesen et al., 2013</xref>). Focusing on the above-mentioned and other modifiable correlates, would be recommended in order to develop effective interventions. However, these studies cannot fully explain why the PA level varies between children within the same preschool and, hence, exposed to the same environment. Therefore, in addition to identifying modifiable correlates of PA in preschool children, it is imperative to examine the PA level and pattern of those who are least active, and thereby at the highest risk of future health problems, in order to develop interventions which are tailor-made for this important target group. Lastly, there are no large-scale studies in Norway which objectively measure the PA level and pattern in children during their stay at the preschool, where these children spend most of the week (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Statistics Norway, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above-mentioned considerations, the first aim of this study was to describe the PA pattern during a week-long stay in a preschool in all children born in 2011 (either three or four-year-olds) attending public preschools in a municipality in Norway. The second aim was to describe the PA level and pattern of the children who are the least physically active.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>The data presented in this paper are the baseline results from the &#x0201c;Active Kindergarten &#x02013; Active Children&#x0201d; (AK-AC) study. The AK-AC study was designed as a two-arm, randomized by preschool (kindergarten in Norway), evaluative controlled trial with the overarching aim of increasing the children's PA level.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>All children attending Sandefjord municipality public preschools and born in 2011 (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;130) were invited to participate in the study. Participants were then asked to wear an accelerometer upon arrival at their preschool on Monday morning, until the end of the preschool day, for five consecutive days. Three to four year old children were chosen in order to target the oldest children still in preschool, for the purposes of facilitating one-year follow-up measurements. Parents of a total of 116 children (89%) signed the informed consent form. The Regional Committee for Medical &#x00026; Health Research Ethics found the research project to be outside the remit of the Act on Medical and Health Research; therefore, the study could be implemented without its approval. Approval from the Norwegian centre for research data was not needed because we did not collect personal information.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Measurements</title><p>The measurements were conducted in the autumn of 2015. Free-living PA was assessed using ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X&#x000a0;+ accelerometers (ActiGraph, LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA). These are seismic instruments which continuously measure acceleration. Raw data from these instruments are referred to as &#x0201c;counts&#x0201d;, which are the sum of acceleration in a given time period. Accelerometers are small and non-invasive and provide a valid estimate of overall PA, which includes frequency, intensity and duration of PA, and steps (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Tudor-Locke and Myers, 2001</xref>). The participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on the left hip during their stay at the preschool for five consecutive days (Monday morning to Friday afternoon in week 39). The staff attached the named monitors to the children every morning when they arrived at the preschool and removed it at the end of each day. In order to ensure compliance with wearing the monitor, the staff were also instructed to make sure the monitor was fastened properly at all times and in the right position. The epoch length (sample interval) was set to 15&#x000a0;s (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cliff et al., 2009</xref>). In the analysis of accelerometer data, epoch periods with a value of zero for 60&#x000a0;min (with allowance for two exceptions above zero) or longer were interpreted as &#x0201c;accelerometer not worn&#x0201d; and removed from the analyses (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). PA data were included if the participant had accumulated a minimum of 6&#x000a0;h of activity data per day for at least two days. Accelerometer data were processed and analyzed using ActiLife version 6 from Actigraph. The minutes spent in various levels of PA intensity were calculated according to the cut-offs set by <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Butte et al. (2014)</xref>, in which sedentary behavior (sedentary time) was defined as &#x02264;&#x000a0;239 counts, light intensity PA was defined as 240 to 2119 counts, moderate intensity PA was defined as 2120 to 4449 counts, and any amount above 4450 was considered vigorous or very vigorous intensity PA (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Butte et al., 2014</xref>). A sedentary bout was defined as a registration period during which the child had no more than 239 counts/15&#x000a0;s for 10 consecutive min or more, and a sedentary break as an activity registration of above 239 counts following a sedentary bout. One hundred and eleven participants had valid accelerometer recordings (95.7%); five children had fewer than two valid days of recordings. Of the 111 participants with valid recordings, five had two days of recordings, 12 had three days, and 94 wore the monitor for four or five days. The mean (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation (SD)) wearing time was 8.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;h&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>.</p><p>The staff in each unit completed a written log for every clock hour documenting the children's location, applying a four-level scale denoting 0&#x02013;25%, 26&#x02013;50%, 51&#x02013;75%, and 76&#x02013;100% regarding indoor- and outdoor-time (a child can be inside or outside for a full clock hour, but can also be, to a various degree, inside and outside in one clock hour). The staff also wrote down the time spent for each meal and registered temperature and weather conditions during the five measurement days. These variables, which included indoor- and outdoor-time, meals, temperature and weather conditions, were logged because they could potentially, to various degrees, influence and explain variations in PA level throughout the day and week in general, and between children.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows, version 21, IBM, Inc., Chicago, USA).

A univariate general linear model was used when adjusting for wear time, gender, age, and preschool in relevant analysis. The least physically active 25% of children and the most physically active 25% were defined by 25% lowest and highest total counts per min (CPM), respectively. When analyzing differences between the least and most active, adjustments were made for gender and age.

Fifty-seven percent of the children were girls. During their time in preschool, the children spent 54% in sedentary, 33% in light, 9% in moderate, and 2% in vigorous intensity activity. Sixty percent of the children had at least 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA on Monday and Friday, while only 26% of the children reached this level on Tuesday.

On an individual level, the children's PA level indoors correlated with their PA level outdoors (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01).<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Indoor and outdoor physical activity level for the least physically active 25% of children (Q1) through to the 25% most physically active (Q4) 25% of children; CPM, counts per minute.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>On average, the 111 children accumulated almost 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day during the measured week at the preschool, however the PA level varied significantly among the children, and between weekdays. Except for the first hour, the 25% least physically active children were less active throughout the whole day compared to the other children, and only a small number achieved the recommended level of daily MVPA on any of the weekdays. Furthermore, the least active cohort took significantly fewer steps per day and spent considerably more time pursuing sedentary behaviors. Sedentary bouts, defined as physical inactivity periods lasting for &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;min, were not longer for the 25% least active than for the other children, but they did have more of these bouts during the day. The most active quartile had 80&#x000a0;min more of light-, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA each day compared to the least active children. Finally, the least active children differed from the pattern of children in the other three activity-quartiles as they were not more physically active outdoors than indoors. As previously reported in several other studies (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brasholt et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Dolinsky et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Byun et al., 2011</xref>), boys had a higher PA level than girls and spent less time in a sedentary state. However, while girls were less active compared to the boys in total, they were just as active as boys when they were outside.</p><p>Almost 60% of the children reached the recommended level of 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day in the current study. The PA level was considerably lower on Tuesday, which can probably be explained by heavy rain that day. A study of 426 five and six year olds, enrolled in 42 randomly selected preschools in Denmark, found that rainy days were negatively associated with MVPA (&#x02212;&#x000a0;2.2 percentage points; 9&#x000a0;min in MVPA) (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Olesen et al., 2013</xref>). In Sandefjord, the average number of days with precipitation &#x02265;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;mm is 100&#x02013;125&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Tveito and Laursen, 2001</xref>) and is an unavoidable barrier for PA which should be planned for by staff; for example, by ensuring that children engage in indoor physical activities on these days. In the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood, 39% of the 253 children included reached 60&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brasholt et al., 2013</xref>), which is lower than that found in the current study, but higher than in other studies, which have reported prevalence from 3 to 14% (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fisher and Montgomery, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fisher et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Specker and Binkley, 2003</xref>). In a review including 40 studies on preschool children aged 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years, the percentage of time spent in MVPA ranged from 1.7 to 41.2% (from 13&#x000a0;min to 5.4&#x000a0;h per day) (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hnatiuk et al., 2014</xref>). Compared to the children in the current study, who spent 11% of the day in MVPA, most of the children studied in the review by <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hnatiuk et al. (2014)</xref> were less active. The studies reporting high PA levels using accelerometers have set lower cut-off points for classifying MVPA and may, therefore, have overestimated the time spent in MVPA (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hnatiuk et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the differences between studies may be real or may be merely a result of cut-off points for PA intensities not being uniformly established (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Trost, 2007</xref>). In addition to intensity thresholds, length of EPOCH chosen (i.e. 15&#x000a0;s vs 1&#x000a0;min), type and placement of accelerometer could influence the results (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Mattocks et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Colley et al., 2014</xref>). Because of these methodological issues, comparing time spent in different intensities between studies should be conducted with great caution. Norwegian preschool children may, however, be truly more physically active during their stay at preschool compared to children in other countries because they spend most of their time outdoors (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Moser and Martinsen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>When comparing results across studies, the same methodological issues apply to the sedentary variable. A review including 31 studies using accelerometers in preschool children found that the amount of sedentary time ranged from 23 to 95% of waking hours, and that results were largely dependent on the methods used (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hnatiuk et al., 2014</xref>). Over a 13-hour waking day, this would equate to between 2.9 and 12.4&#x000a0;h. The median amount of time spent sedentary in this review was 77% (approx. 10&#x000a0;h), which is much higher than that found in the current study (54%); however, the children in the AK-AC study removed the accelerometer when they left the preschool in the afternoon. They may have accumulated more sedentary time if they had worn the monitor for the whole day; however, this would not necessarily have affected the percentage of sedentary time.</p><p>The 25% least active children in the current study had half the PA level of the most active quartile and were less active than what was found in obese preschool children in Switzerland (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Niederer et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, they took approximately 3000 fewer steps per day compared to the most active quartile, spent 80 more min pursuing sedentary behaviors each day, were consistently less active than the other children throughout the whole preschool day, and had longer sedentary bouts. Children are usually most active when they are outdoors (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Raustorp et al., 2012</xref>), where there is more space for movement, a greater number of PA opportunities, and less rules, compared to indoors. Surprisingly, this was not the case for the least active children in the present study. The assumed qualities of the outdoor environment did not seem to affect these children's PA level for unknown reasons. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the difference between PA level indoors and outdoors in sedentary children.</p><p>The differences in PA level and pattern between the activity quartiles are probably not explained by gender or age, these variables were controlled in the analysis. Unfortunately, no data on the children or their parents were available which may have described potentially relevant background information about the children and their families. It is known from previous studies that children from low-income households and children who spend less time outdoors achieve lower MVPA (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Dolinsky et al., 2011</xref>), and that children in the highest tertile of BMI are less active as compared with those in the lowest tertile (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brasholt et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that the least active children in the current study were heavier and therefore not able to move as much, had a motoric delay, had fewer or no PA role models, or simply had more interest in activities which are more sedentary in nature. Factors within the preschool setting are most likely not the most relevant factor for explaining the different PA levels and patterns in this study because the activity levels of the children were equally distributed between the different preschools. Hence, both active and inactive children were attending the same preschool and most likely exposed to the same structural and environmental PA facilitators and barriers. However, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Byun et al. (2011)</xref> found different correlates for PA among American preschool boys and girls (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Byun et al., 2011</xref>); for example, athletic coordination was associated with sedentary behavior in girls but not in boys, and PA equipment was associated with sedentary behavior in boys but not in girls. This may also be the case for the &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; children in the current study. Another influencing factor may be that the built environment, available toys, and playground equipment did not stimulate and trigger these children to the same degree.</p><p>If a child's PA level is formed during preschool age, and PA level tracks from childhood to adulthood, then this needs to be taken seriously. It is probably more feasible to change behavior in childhood than in adulthood, and it is more economical to prevent lifestyle related diseases than to treat them. Many of these children are likely to become insufficiently active as adults and thereby increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2002</xref>), type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Jeon et al., 2007</xref>) and increased mortality rates (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Arem et al., 2015</xref>). The very low PA levels in many of these children may even be harmful and already have consequences at this young age. Even though hard endpoints, such as non-communicable diseases, are not present at such an early age, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Pavon et al. (2013)</xref> found in a study on 1016 children between 2 and 6&#x000a0;years old that the odds ratio for CVD risk was elevated in the least active quintile of PA (OR: 2.58) compared with the most active quintile (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Pavon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A strength of the current study is that almost all of the children born in 2011 who were in the preschool on the first measurement day agreed to wear an accelerometer. This was especially important in this study because the least physically active individuals tend not to volunteer for studies of this nature. A limitation of this study is lack of additional data on the children or their parents to characterize these children (i.e. socio-economic status, ethnicity, weight). Furthermore, the reason for the low PA level and different PA pattern displayed by the least active children is not known. Some of these children could have been suffering from minor illnesses, had injuries, or other reasons which may have explained their low PA levels. Lastly, because the children removed the accelerometer at the end of the preschool day, comparing the results of this study with others is somewhat problematic. However, an average wear time of 8&#x000a0;h is comparable to most other studies.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In general, the children in the 11 public Norwegian preschools were quite physically active throughout the preschool week, but the large variation between the children with respect to both MVPA and sedentary time was a significant finding. The very low PA level and high amount of sedentary time of the least active quartile found in this study is a cause for concern, since this may influence both current and future health. Findings such as longer sedentary bouts, less activity throughout the entire day, and not being more active outdoors than indoors, may be useful information for tailoring interventions focused on this important target group of physically inactive children. The possibility that some children may prefer activities which are more sedentary in nature should be taken into account. However, to assist in combatting the obesity epidemic and contribute to avoiding the wide range of potentially negative cognitive and socio-emotional consequences which could be the consequences of a lack of PA, new and innovative interventions must be developed and proven. In order to develop and succeed with new and innovative interventions, more information also needs to be known about who the least active children are and what needs and interests these children might have with regard to physical activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adamo</surname><given-names>K.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Papadakis</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dojeiji</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Using path analysis to understand parents' perceptions of their children's weight, physical activity and eating habits in the Champlain region of Ontario</article-title><source>Paediatr.
