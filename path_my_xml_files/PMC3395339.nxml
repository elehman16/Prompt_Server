The aim of the European project Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines was to establish guidelines to combat impaired driving under the influence of drugs and/or medication. Because in party circuits, amphetamine appears to be frequently used in combination with high doses of alcohol, the present study concerned the effects of a relatively high dose of alcohol in combination with dexamphetamine on driving performance. The effects of alcohol on driving performance are well documented, and impaired performance has been evidenced for blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) as low as 0.3&#x02030;, while higher BAC values are associated with sedation and consequently lowered vigilance, impaired lane keeping and risk-taking behaviour (e.g. Moskowitz and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1986</xref>). The effects of dexamphetamine on driving performance appear to be less clear. Epidemiological data indicated that use of methamphetamine, which is twice as potent as dexamphetamine, was associated with drifting out of lane, erratic driving, weaving, speeding, drifting off the road, increased risk taking and high-speed collisions (Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>; Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). With regard to the effects on risk-taking behaviour, some studies have reported decreases in impulsive behaviours following acute doses of 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine (de Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>) and others have shown increases in impulsive behaviours (Hurst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1967</xref>; Evenden and Ryan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>). Concerning cognitive performance, De Wit et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>) found that 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine improved performance on measures of vigilance and memory, and decreased several forms of impulsive behaviour. These findings suggest that low doses of dexamphetamine may improve driving ability, although results of studies of lower oral doses dexamphetamine (e.g. 10&#x000a0;mg) are equivocal and subject to inter-individual variability (Newhouse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1989</xref>; Mills et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2001</xref>; Holdstock and de Wit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>).</p><p>Data concerning the effects of the combination of dexamphetamine and alcohol on driving ability are scarce and ambiguous. On a theoretical basis, it may be expected that dexamphetamine may reduce sedation and impairment of vigilance caused by alcohol, but may potentiate risk-taking behaviour and impaired judgement.</p><p>Moderate to higher doses of alcohol may potentiate some adverse effects of dexamphetamine, particularly increase of heart rate and blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia risk (Higgins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1988</xref>; Mendelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1995</xref>; Ghuran and Nolan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Therefore, it was decided that in the present study, the lowest relevant dose of dexamphetamine (10&#x000a0;mg) was to be used in combination with 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine, 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol, and the combination of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine and 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol on simulated driving behaviour and cognitive functioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen subjects participated in the study. All participants were infrequent recreational users of alcohol and amphetamine-like substances, had a driving licence and had at least 2&#x000a0;years of driving experience. Participants were medically screened and familiarized in the driving simulator. Subjects were paid for their participation, and all participants signed an informed consent form. The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for dexamphetamine using a randomized crossover repeated measures design. The experimental study conditions were (1) 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine (DEX), (2) 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol + matching placebo for dexamphetamine (ALC), (3) 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine + 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol (DEX+ALC), and (4) matching placebo for dexamphetamine (PLA). The washout period between the study conditions was 7&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>One week before the first trial day, the subjects have been trained to perform the driving task in the simulator and the cognitive tasks. Subjects were instructed to abstain from alcohol and/or psychoactive drugs in the 24&#x000a0;h prior to each trial day and to use no more than two caffeinated drinks from 12&#x000a0;h prior to each test session. After arrival on each of the 4 trial days, subjects were screened for alcohol in breath (Dr&#x000e4;ger Alcotest 6510), drugs in urine (Triage&#x000ae; 8) and pH of urine. Subjects were questioned about sleep quality and length, health, abstinence from alcohol/drugs and number of caffeinated drinks within 12&#x000a0;h prior to the test session.</p><p>All study sessions were performed between 1400 and 2200 hours, and each subject was assessed at the same time of day, in order to standardize for circadian influences. Participants drove the TNO driving simulator, consisting of a BMW 316 car mock-up with original controls linked to a dedicated graphics computer. Participants had a 180&#x000b0; screen, interactive traffic, sound and a hexapod moving base. The validity to use this driving simulator for studies concerning cognitive aspects of driving behaviour has been established in subjects with various degrees of hypoglycemia (Stork et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). All scenarios for the driving simulator were developed by the University of Groningen (Veldstra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). The simulated drive had a duration of 50&#x000a0;min and included urban, rural and highway driving with various traffic densities. Critical events were included at random locations. At the start of the ride, participants were instructed to drive as they would normally do unless instructed otherwise. To reduce predictability of critical events, four parallel scenarios were used.</p><p>The <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine is estimated to be 2.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5&#x000a0;h after ingestion (de Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>). Because it was pursued that the <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> would cover the 50-min simulated driving test, the best time for the simulated ride was considered to be approximately 2&#x000a0;h after ingestion of dexamphetamine. Time of ingestion of dexamphetamine was then defined as <italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. The BAC has been titrated to be 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg at <italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120&#x000a0;min, administered in three gifts according to the method described in De Wit et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>). All study treatments were taken with orange juice. Each trial day tests were performed at the following experimental times:<def-list><def-item><term><italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120&#x02013;170</term><def><p>simulated driving test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;180&#x02013;200</term><def><p>cognitive tasks, subjective ratings</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;240&#x02013;260</term><def><p>cognitive tasks, subjective ratings</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;300</term><def><p>end of study sessions</p></def></def-item></def-list></p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Driving performance measures</title><p>During the simulated ride, performance has been assessed by measuring skills at a strategical level (speed), manoeuvring level (gap acceptance, car following, reaction to traffic light and critical situations) and control level (lateral and longitudinal control). A calibration study using the identical scenario has been performed by Veldstra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). The driving scenario included the following features.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Road tracking task</title><p>In this part, participants drove on a 5.9-km straight road with a speed limit of 80&#x000a0;km/h and on a 4.8-km straight rural motorway where the speed limit was100 km/h. The drive is monotonous, and the participant is asked to drive as she/he would normally do (no specific instruction). Performance is assessed by measuring the standard deviation of the lateral position (SDLP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Car following</title><p>The participant had to respond to the speed changes of a lead car. Performance was measured by assessing distance headway, which was calculated as the distance between the follow car and the lead car (bumper to bumper) and time headway (THW) calculated as the time interval between the two cars. Furthermore, average, SD, and minimum of time to collision (TTC), speed and lateral position were measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Gap acceptance</title><p>Gap acceptance measures the driver&#x02019;s ability to safely traverse a crossing. The parameters included to assess risk taking are size of the accepted gap in seconds and the distance to the car approaching the driver while traversing the crossing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Violating traffic regulations</title><p>The violations that were assessed in the virtual driving environment included violating the posted speed limit, failing to give right of way, overtaking via the emergency lane and running a red light.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Reaction to unexpected events</title><p>Three scenarios were used to measure reactions to unexpected events: a car failing to give way, a car suddenly pulling out of a car park and cars suddenly coming to a standstill on the motorway. How the driver handles these situations was assessed by measuring the deceleration and the minimal TTC (Van der Horst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Driving on the motorway</title><p>Speed and headway are considered as general indicators of driving style that have been linked to accident risk when driving on a motorway with traffic. Headway choice is measured as an indication of risky driving. The participants are faced with several scenarios: first, the participants have to filter into traffic to get onto the motorway, and second, they are driving on the motorway with normal density traffic for 15&#x000a0;km when suddenly the traffic comes to a standstill, from this point on the participants are driving in congested traffic for 10&#x000a0;km, the last 5&#x000a0;km is normal driving again until the participants finally leave the motorway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Normal highway driving</title><p>The participant has to drive in normal traffic density on a two-lane motorway with a 120-km/h speed limit. Some other (virtual) traffic participants are programmed to keep to the exact posted speed limit, some drive below or above the posted speed to simulate the natural situation. How the subjects deal with this situation is assessed by measuring the number of times they change lanes and the mean and minimal THW the participant holds to other traffic participants. These above measures have been shown to be sensitive to the effects of sedative drugs (Brookhuis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cognitive performance and subjective ratings</title><p>In addition to the above-mentioned primary outcome variables, variables addressing vigilance and (divided) attention were assessed in order to evaluate the effects of alcohol and/or amphetamine. In that context, subjects performed five cognitive tasks: (1) the critical tracking task (CTT, Jex et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1966</xref>) measuring the ability to control a displayed error signal in a first-order compensatory tracking task; (2) divided attention task (DAT, Moskowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1973</xref>), assessing the ability to divide attention between two tasks; (3) the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT, Loh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>), assessing the reaction time to a visual stimulus; (4) the VigTrack, a dual-task measuring vigilance performance under the continuous load of a compensatory tracking task (Valk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1997</xref>) and (5) the selective attention task from the usual field of view test (UFOV, Ball and Owsley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>). The sequence of the different tasks was balanced over the subjects to minimize order effects. After the simulator ride, subjects completed the following subjective ratings: the Profile of Mood States (POMS, de Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>), Rating Scale Mental Effort (Zijlstra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1993</xref>), Driving Quality Scale (Brookhuis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1985</xref>), and the nine-point Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS, Reyner and Horne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted by means of Statistica Data Analysis Software (StatSoft&#x000ae;). Treatment effects were investigated with repeated measures ANOVA. If the analysis of variance indicated a condition effect, comparisons between conditions means of the parameters were performed using planned comparison or Tukey HSD tests. Equivalence testing of drug effects was based on difference scores from placebo (within group) relative to the alcohol criterion (i.e. equivalence to a BAC of 0.8&#x000a0;mg/ml).</p><p>Relationships between different variables and methods were investigated by using correlational computations (Pearson product&#x02013;moment or Spearman Rank correlation coefficients). In all statistical tests performed, a significance level of 0.05 was used.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen subjects were enrolled in the study.

We found that mean BAC levels between 0.9&#x02030; and 0.6&#x02030; alcohol significantly impaired road tracking performance, which is in agreement with literature and replicates earlier demonstration of alcohol-induced impairment of road tracking performance in actual, on-the-road driving test scenarios (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Louwerens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1987</xref>; Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2000</xref>). The mean differences in SDLP between the alcohol and placebo conditions found in the present study are considered to be relevant in the context of traffic safety (4.9&#x000a0;cm). Co-administration of dexamphetamine did not significantly change the impairing effect of alcohol as evidenced by the lack of statistical interaction between dexamphetamine and alcohol. Equivalence testing demonstrated that the 95%CI of the change in road tracking performance (i.e. SDLP) after combined use of dexamphetamine and alcohol included both the 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol criterion as well as the placebo reference (zero). It is therefore considered that the clinical relevance of the combined effects of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine and 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg alcohol is ambiguous, which means that some individuals may show impairment whereas others may not.</p><p>Accepted gap time and distance were significantly shorter when subjects had used alcohol or the combination of dexamphetamine with alcohol. Shorter accepted gap time and distance may be interpreted as indications of increased risk taking caused by alcohol. Such interpretation is supported by data evidencing that alcohol increases impulsive behaviour (de Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>). There was no difference between the effects of alcohol alone or alcohol + amphetamine.</p><p>Although the addition of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine appeared to reduce some impairing effects of alcohol, these effects were not significant. These findings indicate that addition of 10&#x000a0;mg amphetamine may not mitigate the effects of a relatively high dose of alcohol. We found only a few indications for increased risk taking associated with the combination of dexamphetamine and alcohol. The lack of evidence of increased risk taking associated with dexamphetamine may be explained by the fact that due to medical considerations, in the present study, a relatively low dose (10&#x000a0;mg) of dexamphetamine was used instead of higher doses which are known to cause risk-taking behaviour and impaired judgement (Simons and Valk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>). Doses of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine are used in the US Air Force to improve performance of fatigued pilots (Emonson and Vanderbeek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1995</xref>) and are known to reduce the effects of fatigue and sleep deprivation without adverse effects such as stimulating risk-taking behaviour (Caldwell and Caldwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>). Therefore it is hypothesized that a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine might have been too low to cause significant anti-sedative effects, impaired judgement and stimulation of risk-taking behaviour.</p><p>It was found that participants using 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine alone caused the least number of collisions and less passing of red traffic lights, and showed the best performance on the divided attention and vigilance tasks. Participants using dexamphetamine alone felt less fatigued, more energetic, more cheerful, less depressed and more clear headed than in any other condition.</p><p>The stimulatory effects of dexamphetamine on human performance have been widely acknowledged, and beneficial effects on road tracking have been described (Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>; Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>). However, previous research has also demonstrated that stimulant drugs such as amphetamine can improve tracking performance, impulse control and reaction time, while impairing working memory and movement perception (Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Lamers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>; Silber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>). Therefore, it should be considered that although dexamphetamine may improve some aspects of driving performance, it might have detrimental effects in other performance domains that are relevant to traffic safety.</p><p>It is known that in the &#x02018;party circuit&#x02019; (e.g. dance parties), the amphetamine doses that are used in combination with alcohol may be much higher than the dose used in the present study. Moreover, the effects of the combination of alcohol and amphetamine used during dance parties may be potentiated by sleep deprivation. Our findings have shown that co-administration of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine did not significantly change the impairing effect of alcohol. Moreover, red light running and collisions, both highly dangerous driving acts, were observed significantly more frequent in the alcohol condition as well as in the alcohol + dexamphetamine condition compared to the other conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Risk scenarios and measures employed in the present study were very sensitive to the effects of alcohol alone and to the combination of alcohol and dexamphetamine. These measures demonstrated that during simulated driving, single doses of alcohol (0.8&#x000a0;g/kg body weight) impaired road tracking and increased risk-taking behaviours, indicated by shorter gap acceptance time and distance and an increase of red light crossings and number of collisions, and impaired tracking, attention and reaction time during a 3-h period after drinking when BACs declined from 0.9 to 0.2&#x000a0;mg/ml. These alcoholic impairments were not affected by the co-administration of 10&#x000a0;mg dexamphetamine, indicating that the stimulatory effects of dexamphetamine were not sufficient to overcome the impairing effects of alcohol on skills related to driving. The lack of mitigating effects of dexamphetamine on alcohol-induced performance impairment may be of particular importance in terms of road safety issues. The findings of the present study justify the conclusion that individuals using alcohol, or the combination of dexamphetamine with alcohol, should not be allowed to participate in traffic.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are greatly indebted to Janet Veldstra and Karel Brookhuis, University of Groningen, who made their driving scenario and their alcohol calibration study available for us.
