Its role as rescue medication in acute asthma attack is undetermined. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of arformoterol with salbutamol nebulization, a study was conducted among 50 patients with acute non-severe asthma. Patients were randomly assigned to group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 25) who received three doses of salbutamol and arformoterol nebulization, respectively, at 20-min intervals. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured at the baseline and 5 min after each dose. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The mean PEFR significantly increased in both these groups when compared with the baseline. The increases in the PEFR in two groups were similar after the third dose. The adverse effects in both these groups were minor. Arformoterol was as effective and safe as salbutamol in acute non-severe asthma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute asthma</kwd><kwd>arformoterol</kwd><kwd>bronchodilator</kwd><kwd>relief medication</kwd><kwd>salbutamol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-acting beta-2 agonists such as salmeterol and formoterol are important controller medications in the maintenance therapy of chronic stable asthma, used as an add-on drug to inhaled corticosteroid.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] However, their usefulness in the management of acute attacks of asthma has recently been recognized,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and they are approved for use as reliever medication in Europe.</p><p>Short-acting &#x003b2;2 agonists are the preferred drugs as the initial bronchodilator for acute asthma because of their rapid onset of action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, due to short duration of action they require frequent administration.</p><p>Formoterol is a unique bronchodilator having rapid onset and long duration of action with a favorable safety profile. So it can be an ideal alternative to short-acting &#x003b2;2 agonists in the management of acute asthma exacerbation by providing rapid bronchodilatation and reducing the need for frequent administration.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) age &#x0003e; 18 years; (b) British Thoracic Society definition of acute non-severe asthma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]; and (c) ability to perform forced expiratory maneuver. The following patients were excluded from the study: (a) patients presenting with acute severe/acute life-threatening/near-fatal asthma; (b) patients with a previous diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); (c) history of hypersensitivity to &#x003b2;2 agonists; and (d) pregnant or lactating women. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p><p>The age, sex, duration of asthma symptoms, and present controller medications were recorded. The pulse rate, respiratory rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> (measured with Fingertip Pulse Oximeter, model 6500, Nidek Medical, Kolkata, India) were also recorded at the time of initial assessment. Baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured with a peak flow meter (Peak Flow Master, Cipla Ltd., Mumbai, India).</p><p>Patients were then assigned by random number allocation to either of the two groups, that is, salbutamol or arformoterol group according to the medication given to them.</p><p>In the salbutamol group, 5-mg salbutamol respules were administered through oxygen driven (6 L/min) nebulizer (Pulmo mist II nebuliser, Nidek Medical, Kolkata, India) at 20-min intervals for 1 h amounting to a total of 15 mg. In the arformoterol group, total 45 &#x003bc;g of the drug was administered as 15 &#x003bc;g respules every 20 min through the same nebulizer. The drugs were administered in a double-blind manner. To eliminate the effects of other drugs on the treatment outcome, systemic corticosteroid was added only after administration of third dose of the drug.</p><p>PEFR was also measured 5 min after each dose. At each time, best of the three PEFR measurements was recorded. The patients were followed up for the next 6 h following the third dose. They were asked to report any adverse effect noted by them.</p><p>Differences in mean PEFR between the two groups were analyzed by unpaired t-test. One-sample test was used to compare PEFR before and after each dose of the drug to determine whether there was significant improvement in either group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Among 50 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria, 25 patients received salbutamol and 25 patients received arformoterol therapy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic profile and baseline PEFR of these patients.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the patients (<italic>n</italic> = 50) receiving salbutamol and arformoterol therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-43-463-g001"/></table-wrap><p>From the table, it is evident that the demographic profile and baseline PEFR in the two groups were comparable.</p><p>In both the groups, PEFR showed significant increase over the baseline values and the increase was evident after each dose of the drug.

Improvement in PEFR was demonstrated in both the groups and following each dose of the drugs. The absolute increase in the PEFR after the first and the second dose were more with arformoterol than with salbutamol, but the increase in the PEFR after the third dose was similar with these two drugs.</p><p>Relatively, hydrophilic drugs such as salbutamol have a rapid onset of action due to their ability to reach the &#x003b2;2 receptor from the aqueous phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Formoterol is a moderately lipophilic drug, about 300 times more than salbutamol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The aqueous portion rapidly activates the &#x003b2;2 receptor, whereas the lipophilic portion is taken up into the cell membrane from which it diffuses slowly to stimulate &#x003b2;2 receptor over a prolonged period. This accounts for rapid on set along with long duration of action of formoterol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Our study has also proved that arformoterol has a rapid onset of action.</p><p>Several studies have shown the efficacy of formoterol in acute non-severe asthma, acute severe asthma, exercise induced bronchospasm, childhood asthma, and COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Most of the studies have used formoterol with terbuhaler,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] aerolizer,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] or metered dose inhaler.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] However, studies using formoterol nebulization are lacking. Although few studies have shown clinically significant improvement in lung function (FEV1) with formoterol when compared with salbutamol,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] most studies have shown a comparable efficacy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Safety of formoterol is also well documented even at high doses in patients with asthma and COPD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Although it is a long-acting drug, systemic effects with formoterol are as short as salbutamol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In few studies, the impact of high-dose formoterol on heart rate, blood pressure, serum potassium, electrocardiogram changes, and arterial blood gas were assessed which showed identical changes comparable with salbutamol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] We did not study these parameters but evaluated only the side effects reported by the patients. The side effects were very few, non-severe, and comparable between these two drugs. Dryness of mouth was the most reported side effect of formoterol inhalation in one study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] but we found oral irritation and headache as common side effects.</p><p>Our study has few limitations. The sample size is relatively small which limits our ability to detect small but potentially significant differences. This study is restricted to patients of acute non-severe asthma only; efficacy and tolerability of arformoterol in other acute settings such as acute severe asthma and acute exacerbation of COPD are yet to be explored. The side effect profile studied by us was only on the basis of the self-reported symptoms of the patients, and objective assessment and laboratory abnormalities were not assessed. We also did not follow the patients after discharge; so long-term efficacy and safety were not studied. Further studies are thus needed to clarify the efficacy, actual dose, dose frequency, cost-effectiveness, and long-term safety of arformoterol in acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD with different levels of severity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bateman</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>Hurd</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Barnes</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousquet</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Drazen</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitz Gerald</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global strategy for asthma management and prevention.
