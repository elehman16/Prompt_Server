Introduction</title><p>A recent international consensus defines physical frailty as a major &#x0201c;medical syndrome with many causes and contributing factors that is characterised by a reduction in strength, resistance and physiological function that increases individual vulnerability leading to the development of greater dependence and/or death&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Frailty is an important predictor of adverse outcomes in elderly people, such as death (up to 45% a year), institutionalisation, falls, mobility decline, increased disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADL/IADL) and hospitalisation, and those with pre-frailty have an increased risk of becoming frail within 3 years [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Institutionalised older adults are a heterogeneous population in terms of disability rates, multi-morbidity, quality of life and vulnerability. Interventions in this population should be individualised, and the detection and treatment of frailty could be of use in preventing disability, mobility decline, falls and mortality [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Frailty is a state of extreme vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors that expose the individual to a higher risk of negative health-related outcomes. It may represent a transitional phase between successful ageing and disability, and a condition to target for restoring robustness in the individual at risk. Given its syndromic nature, targeting frailty requires a comprehensive approach. Identifying frailty as a target in order to implement preventive interventions against age-related conditions is pivotal, and so every effort should be made by healthcare authorities to maximise efforts in this field by balancing priorities, needs, and resources. Raising awareness about frailty and age-related conditions in the population is important for effective prevention, and should lead to the promotion of lifelong healthy behaviour and lifestyles [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>By observing the major role played by technology in our modern-day society, we may ask the following question: to what extent does technology relate to frailty or, put another way, which technological resources are used to deal with frailty? To respond to this question, we decided to conduct a review in order to ascertain the state of the art from January 2005 to December 2015. The following conclusions were drawn from this state of the art:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The application of technological solutions in health care is a field that is constantly expanding and about which there are great expectations both on the part of users and healthcare professionals and carers, despite the reticence existing in this area known as a technology gap [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is of the utmost importance to continue working to reduce the gap existing between technology, frail elderly persons, healthcare professionals and carers by bringing together the different views about technology and thus stimulate dialogue, an increased awareness and knowledge about the respective fields in order to engage in collaboration on projects that may reduce costs and improve health and quality of life [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>The last decade has seen a rapid increase in research into the use of technology in the elderly population [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Exercise via interactive video games&#x02014;known as exergames&#x02014;is being increasingly used to increase physical activity, thus improving health and the physical function in elderly persons [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The concept of the exergame may be defined as the use of a video game that incorporates physical activity into the game, leading to an improvement in motivation and adherence to participation in that physical activity [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Exergames may have basic advantages over traditional exercise, as they easily enable specific tasks to be performed via a range of difficulty levels. This in turn enables the user to start at a suitably challenging level and then to gradually progress in terms of level of difficulty, based on individual performance in real time [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, commercial games that are easily available are mainly designed for entertainment and recreational purposes for younger users with more complex interaction and interface. Exergaming technology is therefore now less of a feasible option for many elderly people [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and, furthermore, games available on the market are mainly designed for enjoyment and are not based on basic exercising principles. For games to be effective, users need to make movements with specific features during the game that may be deemed relevant for the function being trained.</p><p>As a physiotherapist, the first author of this article designed the contents of the game to help elderly persons improve their physical capacity and their state of health and independence in the activities they carry out in their daily life via the game in which they take part. The aim is therefore to reduce frailty risk or, if frailty already existed, to improve the extent to which it is in evidence.</p><p>In addition to overcoming the technological barrier existing between elderly persons and the use of technological devices, the aim is also to ensure that the game has extra appeal over those already existing such as Wii sport (bowling, tennis, boxing) and Wii fit [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in which the scenarios and movements are unique. The extra appeal offered by FRED is that the user passes through different scenarios in which they carry out a range of activities with a specific objective in mind or within a main activity.</p><p>The ultimate goal is for the users to be the protagonist, for them to like the game, and for them to find it appealing so as to become more involved in the exercise and pursue it further [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>An attempt is made to validate the FRED game via the feasibility pilot study that is described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-14-01439"><title>2.

The Game</title><p>The FRED game was designed as a type of exergame [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in which the first author of this article, who is a physiotherapist, designed the contents of the game while at the same time taking into account both specific movements for developing physical exercise and the devising of different scenarios in which these movements could be developed [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These scenarios are developed in a logical order to ensure that the individuals who perform them find a meaning to the activity. Each movement is designed by taking into account both biomechanical and neuromotor parameters and evidence features of sufficient extent to be recognised by the Kinect sensor [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>FRED is a game that has been developed using a 3D unity motor, and needs a Kinect game controller connected to a computer and a screen or TV.</p><p><bold>Description of the FRED game:</bold> The game consists of various scenarios. Each scenario represents one or more steps in a simplified process to produce txakoli [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The user starts to carry out the different activities which, as well as being remote controlled and in order, correspond to a specific movement of the upper and/or lower extremity. Apart from the physical activity, the game requires attention, coordination of movement, balance, accuracy and spatial orientation.</p><p>The Kinect sensor detects and records the time and ranges of movement, which are both previously defined. A positive score is given for successfully-completed exercises the final score is shown at the end of each phase [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The movements made in the game FRED are not based on degree but more on being a functional movement. For this reason, the basic parameters were given to the software architect for each movement to get the objective in each scenario. After that, the software architect built the algorithm. Finally, the movement was tested to verify that the goal was reached in each scenario.</p><p>The algorithm is built taking in to account the different segments and points that correspond to different joints, muscles and bones.</p><p>Kinect does a reading of what is in front of the camera and recognizes the body of who is playing. Once this is done, it divides the body parts into joints, that is, connecting points related to the body joints to generate a skeleton.</p><p>Below is a description of the game scenarios that have been developed for the feasibility study. These scenarios are distributed into three phases with a total 20 min duration. On completion of each phase, the player has the chance to rate the effort made using the simplified Borg scale [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Depending on their rating, they will either be able to continue immediately, or after doing some abdominal-diaphragmatic exercises for a period of time that depends on the effort rating. Otherwise, they may abandon the activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01439-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In sequential order, we have:</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Part 1</p><p><bold>Scenario 1:</bold> In which the player walks on a path towards a farmhouse along which they have to avoid different obstacles: stones, streams (by crossing bridges, tree trunks and branches).</p><p>The specific movements to be made in Scenario 1 are lateral movements; bending down and getting up (flexion-extension of trunk, hip, knees and ankles); alternate lifting of the legs while supporting bodyweight and maintaining balance; alternate lifting of the arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01439-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>These specific movements also require attention, coordination of movement, balance, accuracy and spatial orientation.</p><p><bold>Scenario 2:</bold> At the end of the path, while covering the last few metres before reaching the farmhouse, the player has to avoid an obstacle while at the same time picking an apple.

Within the general framework, 85% (17 of the 20 patients) of subjects from the study group showed some type of improvement in terms of their SPPB results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01439-f013">Figure 13</xref>).</p><p>Below is a description of the SPPB scores of the subjects from the tests conducted in the first week and after three weeks, according to SPPB result intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01439-f014">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p>Considering the evolution of SPPB results and the marked intervals, we note that three subjects from the control group dropped from the interval (7, 10) to the one immediately below, whereas all the subjects from the interval (4, 6) in the study group moved up to higher intervals (three subjects to the interval (7, 10) and three subjects to the interval (10, 12)). Additionally, nine subjects from the interval (7, 10) moved up to the interval (10,12).</p><p>It was not necessary to compare SPPB results with regard to age or gender as the effect of these variables was minimised by having a homogenous sample of subjects in the control and study groups.</p><p>After three weeks, all control group subjects&#x02019; relative risk of obtaining an SPPB result below 10 is 2.5 times greater than that for all of the study group subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01439-f015">Figure 15</xref>). The relative risk according to age of the control group (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimate) for two strata (&#x0003c;85 and &#x02265;85 years) is 2.53 greater than for the study group under the same conditions, while the relative risk according to gender of the control group is 2.52 times greater than for the study group, also under the same conditions.</p><p>It was noted that the relative risk of all subjects from the control group in comparison to the study group was nearly identical to the relative risks according to age and gender, whereby these variables were not considered distortion factors (these are known as confusion variables in statistics). This was due to the homogenous nature evidenced by the control and study groups in terms of age and gender.</p><p>It was not necessary to compare SPPB results with regard to age or gender as the effect of these variables was minimised by the fact of having a homogenous sample of subjects in the control and study groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-ijerph-14-01439"><title>3.3.

Discussion</title><p>The results obtained are discussed in this section by contrasting them with those of other authors who have worked on related themes.</p><p>Our findings support the hypothesis that FRED, an ad hoc designed exergame, significantly reduced the presence and severity of frailty risk in a sample of sedentary elders [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], thus potentially modifying their risk profile.</p><p>Our results, consistent with previous evidence, suggest that elders with higher risk profiles may still benefit from preventive strategies and should not a priori be excluded from interventions to prevent disability.</p><p>Cesari el al. [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] conducted a study in which the physical activity programme included aerobics (walking), strength, flexibility and balance training which were undertaken in three phases over a 12-month period: adoption (weeks 1&#x02013;8), transition (weeks 9&#x02013;24) and maintenance (week 25 to month 12). The results suggested that regular physical activity may reduce frailty, especially in individuals at greater risk of disability. Future studies should be aimed at testing the possible benefits produced by multi-domain interventions in frailty.</p><p>Gin&#x000e9;-Garriga et al. [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] conducted a study with a combination of functional balance and lower-body, strength-based exercises over a 12-week period, referred to as the functional circuit training program (FCT). This involved setting aside one day per week for balance training and another day for lower-body strength-based exercises lasting 15 min each. The results suggested that the functional circuit training program (FCT) is effective in improving self-reported measures of fear of falling and health status in a group of physically frail individuals.</p><p>Clegg et al. [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] compared the effectiveness of the HOPE (Home-based Older People&#x02019;s Exercise) programme with usual care via a blind pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) over a 12-month period, completing 15 min of the programme three times per day, five days per week. The results suggested that the HOPE programme trial provided preliminary evidence that the deterioration in mobility experienced by older people with frailty may be reduced through a 12 week exercise intervention.</p><p>The above studies [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] combined different types of physical activity and were performed over longer periods of time and at greater weekly frequency than the physical activity in our study using the FRED game. Although they manage to reduce frailty, they require far more time to do so, and none of them considers exercising by using an exergame. Therefore, the degree of frailty can be reduced in less time using the FRED game because after using the FRED game during only 3 weeks the results confirmed the fact that 60% of subjects from the study group (12 of the 20 patients) no longer evidenced frailty risk when the third week was over. Within the general framework, 85% (17 of the 20 patients) of subjects from the study group showed some type of improvement.</p><p>The study conducted by Daniel et al. [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] uses the exergame as a physical activity to be carried out in order to reduce frailty. In this case, they use the Nintendo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Wii&#x02122; console with general games designed for all. These include bowling, tennis and boxing. They then compare them to seated exercise and a control group. They carried out 45 min exercise sessions three times per week for 15 weeks. The results suggested that all the differences reflected improved physical functional status in the seated exercise or Wii-fit groups compared to the control group. Wii games are varied and interactive&#x02014;some games are individual (downhill skiing or skateboarding) and other games are interactive, involving multiple players (tennis, bowling or boxing). They could therefore offer home-based participants greater variety (and potentially increased engagement) than a standard seated exercise protocol. The FRED game differs from the above study because it managed to reduce the degree of frailty in a fifth of the time (three weeks as opposed to 15), including sessions of less than half the duration (20 min as opposed to 45 min). Consequently, the degree of frailty can be reduced in less time using the FRED game.</p><p>The study conducted by Van Diest et al. [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used the exergame for unsupervised balance training at home&#x02014;a virtual ice skater for 30 min, three times per week for six weeks. The pilot study showed that unsupervised home-based exergaming is feasible in community-dwelling older adults, but also that participants do not benefit equally from the programme, thereby emphasizing the need for more personalized exergame training programmes. This conclusion without doubt highlights the ad hoc feature of FRED in terms of the design and compilation of exercises.</p><p>Bieryla KA [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] used the Xbox Kinect&#x02122; to improve balance in elderly people. The results showed an improvement in terms of the balance tests carried out. However, no improvements were evidenced in the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, which the author did not expect given that use of the Kinect&#x02122; compels participants to move more than other game systems.</p><p>Scheer et al. [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] assessed the effects of using Nintendo Wii, Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect&#x02122; on heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure when competing against a computer or human opponent in young adults. The resulting data for oxygen consumption was used to compare the Nintendo Wii, Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect&#x02122; games using moderate health guidelines to promote physical activity.</p><p>O&#x02019;Donovan et al. [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] considered comparing energy expenditure when playing in individual and multi-player mode using Xbox Kinect&#x02122; and Wii&#x02122; consoles. They concluded that energy expenditure and heart rate increased when playing with the Xbox Kinect&#x02122; console in multi-player mode.</p><p>Holmes et al. [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-01439" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] sought to determine training exercise intensity using the Xbox Kinect&#x02122; in adults over the age of 18 who had been diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis (CF), an illness in which physical exercise forms a very important part of therapy. They concluded that training with the Xbox Kinect &#x02122; represents a high-intensity exercise for adults with CF and may be considered a suitable alternative to conventional types of exercise.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-14-01439"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>After carrying out the analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that the FRED game has been shown to have a major impact on the short physical performance battery (SPPB) results obtained by subjects. The improvement in SPPB results means that the risk of evidencing frailty was reduced after nine sessions (three weeks of 20 minutes physical activity performed three times a week).</p><p>Furthermore, it was shown to have a major motivating impact owing to the fact that 100% compliance was obtained, because the 20 subjects took part in all the sessions. Adherence to the game was confirmed because 100% of subjects responded affirmatively to the relevant questions from the third until the ninth session.</p><p>In view of the excellent results, we are considering carrying out a two- to six-week phase pilot study, including the Barthel questionnaire, physiological variables (biofeedback), a questionnaire about state of health and a further questionnaire about the use of software.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are very grateful, on one hand, for the support Emankor has given us of this article, having partially funded the costs of FRED software development as well as testing with real users with the grant provided by BEAZ (Bizkaiko Enpresa eta Aurrerapen Zentrua) from Provincial Council of Bizkaia.
