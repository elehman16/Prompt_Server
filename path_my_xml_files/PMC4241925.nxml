There were no significant interaction effects for RPE, energy expenditure, blood lactic acid and catecholamine concentration, but these variables were slightly lower in water than on land.

Thus, the aquatic exercise has been extensively utilized for the purpose of rehabilitation related to various sports injuries, including the disease prevention in terms of health care.</p><p>Recently, the previous studies related to most of the aquatic exercise have represented the interest in the effective aspect of exercises as a part of health, rehabilitation, treatment, and general conditioning exercise program of the general public [<xref rid="b1-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas, they have not presented the correct prescription criterion of aquatic exercises. Since the mid-1990s, the early studies have conducted the research for the respiratory circulation and metabolic response at the time of the exercise walking on the aquatic treadmill by the development of an aquatic treadmill equipment [<xref rid="b5-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="b9-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but various physiological responses of the exercise intensity for the aquatic walking comparing with the landed treadmill walking exercise is not clearly known.</p><p>The aquatic treadmill running is just as effective as the landed treadmill running for the aerobic conditioning of healthy individuals [<xref rid="b10-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have suggested that the relationship between the heart rate obtained in the gradual walk test in the ground and maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) can be used to prescribe the exercise intensity of aquatic walking exercise, and also, the heart rate and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) have suggested as an effective indicator for the exercise prescription while the aquatic walking in the same way as the land-based walking [<xref rid="b12-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, recently, Phillips <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b13-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have suggested that as the results testing the gradual exercise load using the landed and aquatic treadmill targeting obese women, because the maximal physiological responses of the underwater running is different in comparison with the landed treadmill walking, the criteria of VO<sub>2</sub>max obtained from the landed treadmill is not recommended for the aquatic exercise inspection. Thus, the aquatic treadmill exercise has been typically used for aerobic training for rehabilitation period, but the evaluation for whether it can be brought the cardiorespiratory stress corresponding to the ground exercise is unclear. Migita <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b14-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have compared the reaction of circulation respiratory system of a middle-aged man during treadmill walking and flowmill walking. They have reported that the correlations between the heart rate and oxygen uptake at the time of two type of exercise walking are similarly appeared, and they have proposed that approximately twice speed is required in the general treadmill in order to obtain the identical level of the physiological effort. Also, in the study of Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="b12-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], they have set up the intensity of the walking exercises on the general treadmill of 40, 60, 80 m/min, and the aquatic treadmill of 20, 30, 40 m/min, using the same speed application principle. However, it is considered that the intensity of their general treadmill walking is slightly low for the effects of exercise capable obtaining by that actual general public conducts the aerobic exercise as a walking exercise of low intensity. In other words, if considering that the most appropriate walking speed is 50&#x0223c;100 m/min (1.9&#x0223c;3.7 mph) [<xref rid="b15-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the walking exercise applied by Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] belongs to the exercise of low intensity. In addition, according to the report of LeMasurier &#x00026; Guy [<xref rid="b16-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], ACSM recommends the walking of moderate intensity 80 m/min corresponding to 3.3 METs, and in the case of the U.S. public health and sanitation, the physical activity of moderate intensity of the brisk walking corresponding to 3.0-6.0 METs is recommended. Thus, in general, comparing and evaluating the speed of 50 m/min of the aquatic treadmill walking corresponding to 100 m/min which is the power walking speed of the moderate intensity on the landed treadmill should become an important consideration for the setting of the recommendation exercise intensity for water-walking. In other words, whether the application principle of the landed and aquatic walking speed proposed in previous studies is also applied at the same rate in a moderate-intensity speed as well as a low-intensity, also, whether their physiological reactions is identical in the moderate-intensity when applying the speed difference of 1/2 times, will enable the method approach for the prescription of aquatic walking exercise. In this study, the authors intend to evaluate the difference between the heart rate and RPE indicating the exercise intensity by applying the speed principle of water-walking proposed in previous studies, and to investigate the possibility of the prescription of exercise intensity based on the landed treadmill walking speed for the setting of intensity of the medium intensity-aquatic walking exercise by comparing the momentum through the stress index and the measurement of energy expenditure of blood lactic acid, and catecholamine, etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Research object</title><p>The subjects of this study have not conducted a regular walking exercise for recent six months, but nine healthy male college students who have the basic physical strength were selected.

Each subject wears a swimming suit after arriving at H Institute of Sports Medicine, and carried out the aquatic treadmill walking exercise after taking a rest for 10 minutes to maintain the pulse rate in the stable state. The exercise performance order is determined by the design method for cross over study, and nine subjects are divided into A group (n = 5) and B group (n = 4) in order to exclude the effect of the measurement sequence, and they carry out the Landed treadmill walking (LTW) and the Aquatic treadmill walking (ATW) while changing the measurement sequence at intervals of one week.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise method</title><sec><title>Experimental procedure and setting of exercise intensity</title><p>The land-based walking was performed on the general treadmill (Quinton, Sensormedics, USA). In general, the most appropriate walking speed is 50&#x0223c;100 m/min (1.9&#x0223c;3.7 mph), and because the power walking is the speed of 80&#x0223c;107.2 m/min [<xref rid="b15-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the protocol of the landed treadmill walking exercise in this study was performed for total 30 minutes at the speed of 100 m/min which is corresponded to the power walking of moderate intensity, and the gradient of the treadmill was fixed to 0%.</p><p>On the other hand, the water-walking was performed on the aquatic treadmill (Aquaciser II, Ferno Ille Co., Ltd., USA) capable of adjusting the belt speed up to 216 m/min (8 mph). Each subject was performed the walking at the speed of 50 m/min corresponded to 1/2 times of the landed treadmill speed for the same time as the landed treadmill. The shaking of the subject&#x02019;s arms was allowed in order to maintain balance during walking in water, and the gradient of the treadmill is 0%, and the depth of water was applied to bottom of each subject&#x02019;s the xiphoid process of the pit of the stomach side. According to previous studies, they have reported that the walking exercise at water temperature of 30&#x02103; lays minimal burden on the heart, and the circulation ability become smooth, and the needed temperature control requirement for the heart regulatory is least.

As the result conducting the walking exercise for 30 minutes applying the speed of 50 m/min corresponded to 1/2 times of 100m/min which is the recommended speed of the landed walking in the aquatic walking speed, all variables showed the significant change according to the exercise time, and the change of the heart rate for the walking speed of two type showed the change of high heart rate during the landed walking in comparison with the aquatic walking by showing the significant interaction effect between groups. On the other hand, it showed that because the change in RPE did not show the significant difference between groups, the walking exercises of two types have the identical RPE. These results are shown that the application principle of 1/2 times speed determining the aquatic walking speed based on the landed walking speed is not matched in the change of the heart rate and RPE that evaluate the exercise intensity.</p><p>The heart rate and RPE are an important index that sets the exercise intensity and commonly used for the exercise prescription. It has been reported that the heart rate and VO<sub>2</sub>, and the heart rate and RPE show the clear linear relationship according to the increase of speed during the aquatic walking like as the landed walking [<xref rid="b5-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, many studies have suggested that the heart rate and RPE are the effective criteria to prescribe the aquatic walking exercise [<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, it is considered that during the walking exercises of two types, the change in the heart rate unlike the change in RPE has the tendency somewhat underestimated upon application of 1/2 times speed ratio. Because the exercise intensity conducted in this study showed to correspond to 59%HRmax in the aquatic walking, and to 66%HRmax in the landed walking, it is considered that the exercise intensity corresponded to the same heart rate in the case that applies the speed of 50% or more in comparison with the landed walking will be possible.</p><p>In addition, the current result in comparison with the result of Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that the aquatic treadmill walking of 50 m/min has corresponded to 75%HRmax, 5.2 MET, and 12~15 RPE represents lower exercise intensity as 59% (range, 51~65%) HRmax, and 11.8RPE. It has been known that this difference is influenced by various factors, such as the type of aquatic walking (treadmill vs. flowmill walking), water temperature, and water level [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and it is shown that in particular, because both groups were not reached to 13 RPE which is the criteria of moderate intensity during the treadmill walking for 30 minutes, it is the results of the low intensity exercise. The power walking for 30 minutes of the landed treadmill of 100 m/min speed is the recommended speed of moderate intensity for the general adult, but because the young college students who are the subjects in this study have higher physical strength in comparison with the general adults, it is considered that is felt as relatively the exercise intensity of low intensity.</p><p>The buoyancy and resistance of water have an effect to make of relatively high energy consumption despite of little movement of the lower joints [<xref rid="b1-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For this reason, the walking or jogging in water may be prescribed as the effective exercise to the subjects, such as the middle-aged, elderly person, and to the subjects who feel the burden for the weight bearing. The change in the energy expenditure compared in this study was not represented statistically the significant difference between the groups, but it showed that it is corresponded with the results of previous studies suggested that approximately the aquatic walking speed is corresponded to 1/2 times of the landed walking speed to obtain the same level of energy expenditure [<xref rid="b12-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is analyzed that in the case that increases the walking speed in water unlike the land, because the resistance effect of water becomes larger than the buoyancy by the body fat or the depth of water, it shows higher energy expenditure of about twice than the landed walking. Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b11-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have described that the buoyancy has an effect that decreases a lot the energy expenditure than the resistance of water for the movement during low-intensity walking of 20m/min unlike the aquatic walking speed of 30m/min and 40m/min. Thus, it is considered that the aquatic walking of the moderate intensity conducting in this study unlike the aquatic walking of low-intensity shows the same energy expenditure if applying 1/2 times of the landed walking speed.</p><p>Shono <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have reported that during the aquatic walking of 50 m/min, it showed relatively high blood lactate concentration of 2.4 mmol/L in comparison with the period of rest and other low-intensity walking speed (20, 30, 40m/min), and most of subjects are reached to the lactate threshold at the speed of 50 m/min. In this study, the blood lactic acid concentration of both groups showed the significant increase till 10 minutes after starting exercise and then showed the significance decrease after 15 minutes, and it represented the similar trend of change without the difference between groups. However, it is considered that because the blood lactate concentration in the aquatic and landed walking showed lower concentration than the previous study [<xref rid="b20-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed 2.02 and 2.58 mmol/L, respectively, during the aquatic walking in comparison with the landed walking, it was not reached to the lactate threshold.</p><p>It has been known that the epinephrine and norepinephrine called the catecholamine hormones have increased secretion by the need, such as the increase of the heart rate during exercise and the demand increase for energy source. Fujishima and Shimizu [<xref rid="b6-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have reported that the underwater exercise in the various environment of the water temperature represents high numerical value of epinephrine in comparison with the landed exercise, and Shin [<xref rid="b4-jenb-18-2-197" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has reported that as the results conducting the landed and aquatic treadmill exercises for 60 minutes that are consisted of the walking for 30 minutes of moderate intensity level and jogging for 30 minutes based on the same heart rate, both epinephrine and norepinephrine showed the significant increase after exercising in the aquatic exercise group. It may be explained that in the case of exercise performing in water, it results from the reason that the energy expenditure caused by the loss of body heat by the resistance, conduction and convection of water than the exercise performing on the land is high.</p><p>In this study, the epinephrine showed the significant increase after two types of walking exercise, whereas, the norepinephrine showed the trend of increase, but statistically significant difference was not shown. In addition, the interaction effect between the groups according to time did not represent, and the same hormonal change against the speed application principle of 1/2 times was shown. Furthermore, it is considered that generally, the aquatic treadmill exercise shows lower numerical value than the landed treadmill exercise, and when considering that the correlation between the heart rate and these hormones is high, it is corresponded to the results of the aquatic treadmill that show the change in the relatively low heart rate in this study. In other words, it is considered that because the exercise intensity of the aquatic treadmill exercise is somewhat low, the change in these hormones also shows higher numerical value in the landed treadmill exercise.</p><p>If synthesizing above results, all variables, except for heart rate did not show the statistically significant difference between groups, but most of physiological indexes show high level in the landed treadmill walking exercise than the aquatic treadmill walking exercise. It is considered that if the speed of aquatic treadmill of moderate intensity is applied to 1/2 times of the landed treadmill speed, the aquatic walking exercise requires lower physiological needs than the landed treadmill walking exercise. However, in this study, because somewhat little subjects to explain the speed application principle of the aquatic treadmill walking exercise of the moderate intensity or more were used as materials, and also there is the limitation that the healthy young college students of the twenties were the subjects, a variety of subjects, that is, the protocol development of the water-walking exercise for the purpose of the health and rehabilitation of the middle-aged or elderly is essential.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded
