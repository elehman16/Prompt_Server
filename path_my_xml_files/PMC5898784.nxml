It may develop into chronic postsurgical pain if have not been controlled in the initial stages. Postoperative pain after abdominal surgery is influenced by various factors including pathophysiological changes and subjective feelings of patients. The safe and effective analgesia method for postoperative pain may influence the outcome of patients after major abdominal surgery. Even restricted by different factors, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) is still the most commonly used analgesic method.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Opioids are the most commonly used analgesics in PCIA. An increase in the dosage of a single drug may improve the postoperative pain; however, the adverse reactions also increase, such as neusea, vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist with &#x003b1;-1: &#x003b1;-2 specificity of 1:1620, has hypnotic, sedative, analgesic, and antianxiey actions, but does not cause respiratory depression. Research<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> has shown that dexmedetomidine regulates the analgesic actions at the spinal cord level or above by different mechanisms. Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine can enhance the analgesic effect of opioids and reduce opioid requirements in the perioperative period. However, it still lacks large sample and multicenter clinical trials to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine on patients after abdominal operation. This prospective, randomized controlled, blinded, multicenter clinical study was designed to demonstrate the safety and validity of PCIA with dexmedetomidine on patients after abdominal operation and provide a reliable basis for pain management.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Research Agreements</title><p>This multicenter clinical study was completed by Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University and other 8 clinical centers, all approved by the bioethics committees and registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number ChiCTR-IPR-16007889), and all the patients have signed informed consents.

Intraoperation, the bispectral index was applied while anesthesia was given to obtain the appropriate anesthesia depth and controlled between 40 and 60. Loading dose of sufentanil (0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg) was given 30 minutes before completion of the operation. Residual muscle relaxant effect was antagonized by neostigmine and atropine after the surgery. Ondansetron 8 mg or azasetron 10 mg was used before the abdominal cavity was closed to prevent nausea and vomiting. PCIA pump initiated after tracheal extubation with conscious sedation according to different groups. Administration mode: maintenance dose+patient-controlled analgesia dose, lock time as described. Patients were admitted to general wards after 1 hour in postanesthesia care unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Hemodynamics parameters (SBP, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, HR), percutaneous oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were recorded when patients entered the operative room, before the start-up of analgesic pump and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 hours after the start-up of analgesic pump. Total pressing times and effective pressing times of analgesic pump were recorded within 24 hours after the operation. Pain scores and sedation scores were recorded at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after operation. The VAS was applied for the evaluation of postoperative pain at rest and movement. Observer&#x02019;s assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scores were performed for the evaluation of sedation. The consumption of sufentanil during 24 hours after surgery was recorded. The levels of patient satisfaction regarding degree of pain relief were recorded at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, including very satisfied, satisfied, adequately satisfied, and dissatisfied. The type, dosage and usage times of rescue drugs were recorded at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The dosage and usage times of vasoactive agents, anal exhaust time after operation and other adverse events such as nausea scores, vomiting scores, dry mouth, shivering, delirium, and pruritus were also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>According to the published literature<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>about sample size estimation, primary literature, and the results of meta-analysis, the sample size was calculated.

In contrast, high-dose systemic dexmedetomidine inhibits the locus coeruleus, perhaps leading to sedation, and also directly activates &#x003b1;2- adreneoceptors on the spinal glial neurons to induce outward potassium currents that hyperpolarize and inhibit the cells producing analgesia by a different mechanism. Many studies show that intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine before, during or after operation reduces the postoperative consumption of opioids in PCIA,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which confirms the analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine. Peng et al<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> demonstrates in a meta-analysis that PCIA with dexmedetomidine (200 to 500 &#x003bc;g, not used before or during operation) reduces the consumption of opioids such as sufentanil, fentanyl, and morphine.</p><p>In most clinical trials, weight or weight index are considered as an important determinant index for drug doses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, we find an interesting result that low-weight patients need more analgesic drugs while obese patients have lower VAS scores, which may be due to redistribution, or the phenomenon that individual drugs can be distributed to organs with greater blood flow first, then to organs with the lesser blood flow, but more fat soluble tissues. This is merely a guess, which needs a large sample of clinical trials to confirm.</p><p>Age, anxiety, and depression are important risk factors, which have significant effects on the level of postoperative pain in patients undergoing abdominal operation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Excluding sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, or above potential risk cases, the main consideration of cases selecting is more representative, but the actual ages of patients were 45 to 60 years old, this is mainly related to the predilection age of patients with liver, stomach, intestines, and other tumor patients, there is no difference in age between the 2 groups. Patients with mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression were excluded in the study to avoid the effect of mental state on the results.</p><p>Although minimally invasive surgery is a trend for the treatment of abdominal surgery disease in clinic, both the cases undergoing laparoscopic-assisted abdominal operation (the length of incision was 6&#x0223c;8 cm) or open surgery were representative. Considering the different degrees of pain for these patients, the patients randomly assigned into groups. There were no significant differences in the operation type between these 2 groups. The concentration of dexmedetomidine and sufentanil is 2 and 1 &#x003bc;g/mL in patient-controlled analgesia, the equivalent of 0.05&#x0223c;0.09 and 0.025&#x0223c;0.045 &#x003bc;g.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for background dose. More, the same starting dose could avoid excessive analgesia and interference with the experimental results.</p><p>The application of dexmedetomidine in PCIA in patients after abdominal operation reduced the consumption of sufentanil, PCIA pressing times, and effective pressing times of analgesic pump, and the results were in accordance with reported literatures about application of dexmedetomidine in PCIA.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The analgesia pump capacity was 100 mL, for most patients, it cannot last for 48 hours, hence the total consumption of sufentanil in postoperative 48 hours was not analyzed. Instead, we assessed pain intensity in postoperative 48 hours. The results indicated that peak response of pain intensity at 2, 4, 8 hours and relieved at 24 hours after operation, VASr and VASm below 4 scores in both groups at 48 hours, and there was no significant difference between the groups. VASm is more meaningful for early mobilization and recovery than VASr. Even though there was a small but positive effect on pain scores, other important outcomes such as reduced consumption of sufentanil, reduced effective pressing times, and reduced side effects were seen. So we think this difference of VAS between the groups still has clinical value.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine produces sedative effect in Sprague-Dawley rats when applied in a concentration higher than 1 &#x003bc;g/kg (equivalent of 0.16 &#x003bc;g/kg in adults). In this study there was no significant difference in the OAA/S scores between the 2 groups, which is in accordance with the reported literatures.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is possible that the small dose of dexmedetomidine does not produce a very strong sedative effect, which may be related to the awakening sedation of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Compared with group C, incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly decreased in group D. This might be related to the reduced dose of sufentanil. Previous studies have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine causes dose-dependent sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The large dose of dexmedetomidine leads to the decrease of HR and BP by decreasing plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Al-Zaben et al<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> reported that dexmedetomidine-related bradycardia was found in 6.67% of the patients in their study. Wu et al<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> found that dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjuvant could cause bradycardia but no severe hypotension. Other researches<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> showed that incidence of these side effects were increased in the patients that receive dexmedetomidine &#x0003e;0.7 &#x003bc;g.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

Although it is not statistically significant, much more attention should be paid to the potential risk of severe bradycardia caused by dexmedetomidine and the high sensitivity to sufentanil among some patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Compared with sufentanil PCIA alone, the combination of dexmedetomidine and sufentanil for PCIA after abdominal operation could reduce sufentanil consumption, decrease VAS scores, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting, improve patient satisfaction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Professor Xinming Wu, MD, Department of anesthesiology, Peking university first hospital, Beijing, P.R.
