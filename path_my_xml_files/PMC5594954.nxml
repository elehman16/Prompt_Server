The overall prevalence of tobacco uses in the country among men in 2010 was 19.8%, decreasing to 18.7% in 2015.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Moreover, according to the WHO (2010), the overall prevalence of tobacco consumption (current and daily) among 15&#x02013;64 years old Iranians has been 12%: 22% among males and only 1% among females.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The prevalence of smoking in Iran calls for comprehensive tobacco cessation programs designed and implemented by health professionals. During a routine care, health professionals can effectively promote quit rate.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Dental professionals are in a unique position to promote smoking cessation since they have the opportunity for regular interaction with their patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Based on information available, from 5% to 10% of successful cessation cases can be resulted from cessation activities in dental centers.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The five-step protocol known as &#x0201c;5 As&#x0201d; provides a useful framework for general practitioners to provide their patients with effective cessation counseling. The protocol comprised five steps of asking about tobacco use, advising cessation, assessing willingness to quit, assisting the patient in making a quit attempt, and arranging follow-up to prevent relapse.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Evidence indicates that implementing the &#x0201c;5 As&#x0201d; protocol provides promotion in tobacco cessation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, lack of training and knowledge on integrating tobacco cessation counseling (TCC) in practice has led to self-reported incompetency by health professionals.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have revealed gaps in health professionals&#x02019; education regarding TCC.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, dental practitioners in Iran seem not to receive sufficient training on TCC since no comprehensive course on the subject exists in the undergraduate national dental curriculum. To address this shortcoming, recently some studies have been done to investigate the efficacy of such programs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] An important factor in successfulness of a training program is the method of education. Problem-based learning (PBL) as an active learning approach would develop adult learning skills through its self-direction and problem-solving nature as well as clinical reasoning, teamwork, and interpersonal communication characteristics; as all of these skills lead to lifelong learning and better preparation of students for their professional careers.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] On the other hand, role play (RP) is another active learning method that promotes students learning by doing the skills they need to apply in clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two educational methods to teach TCC in dental practice for senior dental students in two dental schools in Tehran, Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study subjects and interventions</title><p>The research project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. In this interventional study conducted in 2013, the study population comprised senior dental students of the two oldest governmental dental schools of Iran, located in Tehran, the capital of the country. Of these students (<italic>n</italic> = 116), those students attending community dentistry course at the time of the study (<italic>n</italic> = 93) were asked to participate in the study if they want. As an extra activity in community dentistry course, a program on TCC with the same structure and instructors (three faculty members from the two schools) was designed to be delivered through two educational methods of RP and PBL.</p><p>First, all the participants in each school participated in the first session that was a 2&#x02013;3-h lecture about the effects of tobacco on oral health and TCC process. At the end of the first session, the students in each school were randomly divided into two groups: RP and PBL. Three scenarios were distributed among members of each group. Each group then formed three small groups (3&#x02013;6 students) to work on the scenarios. In each scenario, the patient was in a different stage of quit (ready to quit, thinking about quit and resistance to quit).</p><p>In RP group the students were asked to design a play representing a conversation between dentist and patient according to existent scenarios for the next session. In the second session after 1 week, each scenario was performed in 10&#x02013;15 min by two students, and at the end of each play, the performance and its strengths and weakness were discussed by the students and instructor.</p><p>In PBL group the students were asked to discuss, search and study the questions in every scenario. The students presented their work in the next session after 1 week. Discussion on their presentation was done by students and facilitated by the instructor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Questionnaire</title><p>Before the first session, and at the end of the second session, the students were asked to fill in an anonymous questionnaire. In addition to age, gender, and marital status, the questionnaire requested information on the following items:</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Knowledge</title><p>The students were asked to react to six statements on the stages of TCC in a five-points Likert scale from strongly disagree to agree strongly. The students&#x02019; answers were scored from 1 to 5. By summing up the scores for six questions, the knowledge score for each student (possible range from 6 to 30) was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Attitude</title><p>Ten questions assessed students&#x02019; attitude toward barriers against TCC in dental practice through a five-point Likert scale from least important to most important. Scoring the answers and calculating attitude score (possible range from 10 to 50) was done as described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Skill</title><p>In this part, three patient paper cases were presented to the students. Each case represented a patient in a certain stage of tobacco cessation. The cases were almost similar to the ones the students worked on during their training, with some extra questions. Based on the student's answers, skill scores of the students (possible range from 0 to 27) was calculated as described above.</p><p>The students were asked to write a unique code at the top of their both pre- and post-test questionnaires. This code was used to assess individual changes throughout the study.</p><p>Two experts in community oral health and one expert in TCC assessed the validity of knowledge part of the questionnaire. Reliability of knowledge questions was evaluated and approved by performing a test-retest procedure on 15 students. Kappa coefficient calculated to be from 75% to 95% in different questions. Attitude and skill questions were extracted from previous studies[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with approved validity and reliability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were entered into SPSS software, version 22 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The results indicated that both methods improved knowledge, attitude, and skill of the students at short-term follow-up with no significant difference between the two methods.</p><p>Data collection tool in the present study was a questionnaire benefiting from a previously designed valid and reliable questionnaire[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and being tested for validity and reliability of its new part. A Likert scale was used to measure the result of knowledge and attitude section, which provided a wider range of responses. The specific code of each participant made an assessment of individual change possible. On the other hand, using self-administered questionnaires might lead to imprecise measurements of students&#x02019; performance, and it is possible that students complete the questionnaires based on social desirability. In this case, results would be an optimistic estimate of the real situation.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, our study did not explore the long-term impact of training on knowledge, attitude, and skill of students. Moreover, this study focused on the self-reported practice of the students, which might be different from their performance in real life situation. We had a 30% attrition rate from pre- to post-test occasion due to unknown reasons. However, almost similar attrition rate between the two study groups can show that the attrition has not been related to the interventions.</p><p>Similar studies that were carried out about training TCC with RP method indicated that this method is effective in improving knowledge, attitude, and skill's scores.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] We could not find any similar studies about TCC using PBL method.</p><p>In this study, mean knowledge scores of participants significantly increased after training in both RP and PBL group. In a similar study by Walsh <italic>et al</italic>. with standardized patients, a significant increase in objective knowledge about TCC was reported,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which is consistent with our findings. Walsh <italic>et al</italic>. study was conducted on a groups of dentists and residents, and the lectures on general health hazards of smoking were given by cancer specialists, whereas the present study was conducted on dental students and lectures were given by oral health specialists who, compared to cancer specialists, had a more comprehensive knowledge about the periodontal tissues and smoking-related oral lesions as well as precancerous and cancerous lesions. Thus, they could provide students with greater knowledge in this respect. In another study in the US by Vendrell Rankin <italic>et al</italic>., a lecture method in a continuing dental education course improved knowledge, attitude, and skills of dentists in TCC at 6-month follow-up.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Regarding attitude toward tobacco cessation in dentistry, the students reported a lack of knowledge and confidence in conducting TCC as the most important barrier to TCC. In a similar study, Ebne <italic>et al</italic>., reported patient's resistance and lack of supportive organizations in developing tobacco cessation as the most important barriers to TCC from the students&#x02019; point of view.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a UK study, dentists indicated that lack of time and training facilities for TCC was the most important barriers.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The average score of students in attitude section significantly increased after training in both RP and PBL group. In a similar study on dental students, training on the subject along with providing practice opportunities, improved student's attitude.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Another study on dental and dental hygienist students reported that virtual training through CD-ROM was able to improve students&#x02019; knowledge and attitude.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The average score of students in skill section was significantly increased after training in both RP and PBL group. Cornuz <italic>et al</italic>., in 2002 evaluated the efficacy and the outcome of smoking cessation counseling training program for internal medicine residents using standardized patients.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The training program on smoking cessation could significantly improve the quality of physicians&#x02019; counseling. It also increased smokers&#x02019; motivation to quit and rates of abstinence from smoking among patients during the 1-year follow-up.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, Ebne <italic>et al</italic>. using standardized patients in training TCC on dental students reported improvement in skills and self-confidence of students.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The standard patient method also was used by Foley <italic>et al</italic>. in 2006 on medical students. They reported positive educational results and emphasized on the important role of standardized patients in improving the quality of smoking cessation counseling offered by students.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results suggested that TCC training through both RP and PBL method leads to improvement in knowledge, attitude, and skills of dental students in the short-term evaluation.
