The primary causes of POR remain elusive and oxidative stress was proposed as one of the important contributors. It has been suggested that focus on the specific subpopulations within heterogeneous group of poor responders could assist in evaluating optimal management strategies for these patients.

Despite impressive advances in the field, many women exhibit inadequate response to gonadotrophins, referred to as &#x02018;poor or low responders&#x02019; and have higher odds of cycle cancellation, fewer oocytes at retrieval, lower oocyte quality and reduced number of embryos for transfer. Collectively, this results in serial failure of the ART cycles and is frustrating for both patients and their caregivers. The exact incidence of the condition is hard to establish owing to variable definitions in literature with the estimates ranging from 5.6 to 35.1% of ART cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Multiple interventions have been proposed to improve reproductive outcomes in women with poor ovarian response (POR), but the randomized intervention studies and meta-analyses of these studies reveal conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, the evidence-based therapeutic strategies to improve ovarian response and reproductive outcomes in women with POR are lacking, and treating clinicians often offer empirical treatments with little clinical evidence to support their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been increasingly acknowledged that the available ovarian reserve tests are not reliable to predict pregnancy after assisted conception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We do not have universally accepted tests to predict response to treatment, which is of important value for counseling couples regarding their treatment pathways and for setting patients&#x02019; expectations.</p><p id="Par6">It has been proposed that a heterogeneity of the included population is the main barrier in evaluating the interventions and the factors that guide prognosis for POR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An internationally-agreed consensus on the definition of POR reached by an ESHRE Campus Workshop held in Bologna in 2010 suggests that at least 2 out of 3 features must be present: (1) advanced maternal age or any other risk factor for POR; (2) previous POR; (3) abnormal ovarian reserve test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This uniform definition, however, implies that POR constitutes heterogeneous group of women with respect to age, previous reproductive experience and ovarian reserve tests that may have different response to the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While age-dependent decline in ovarian reserve and oocyte quality accounts for poor response in older women, an underlying etiology for its occurrence earlier in life is less clear. It is possible that younger women with compromised ovarian reserve represent a&#x000a0;distinct subpopulation within POR group,&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;their&#x000a0;fertility prognosis&#x000a0;may differ from that of older women with low ovarian reserve markers&#x000a0;or from similar age&#x000a0;women with adequate ovarian reserve parameters but&#x000a0;suboptimal&#x000a0;response to ovarian stimulation&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p id="Par7">Taking the above considerations into account, the recently established POSEIDON group (Patient-Oriented Strategies Encompassing Individualize Oocyte Number) proposed a new stratification of women with POR undergoing ART treatments, which includes 4 subgroups based on women&#x02019;s age, ovarian reserve parameters and previous response to ovarian stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The POSEIDON concept introduces personalized medicine approach to the POR population and is expected to be more effective in identifying the subsets of patients who could benefit from specific interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The physiology of poor ovarian response is not fully understood and the molecular events underlying POR remain unknown. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the most investigated possible mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mitochondria are the most abundant organelles in oocytes and early embryos that generate approximately 90% of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the end products of oxygen metabolism, and convert ROS into an inactive state via antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Higher levels of ROS accumulating in mitochondria during multiple physiological conditions contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and increase in oxidative stress. This, in turn, leads to oxidative damage to DNA and other intra-cellular aberrations, which are similar to the age-related changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, improving mitochondrial function by supplementing antioxidants has been proposed as one of the important strategies to enhance reproductive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a lipid-soluble coenzyme and is an essential component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. CoQ10 is primarily involved in electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CoQ10 acts as an antioxidant by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation, thus is capable of strengthening endogenous antioxidant system within a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CoQ10 supplementation has been shown to improve cardiovascular function and male fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Reduced concentrations of CoQ10 in plasma have been associated with hypogonadism and altered levels of other steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Decrease in CoQ10 level is commonly observed in individuals in late 30th and appears to co-occur with the age-related decline in fertility and increased rate of embryo aneuploidy, suggesting a contribution of the reduced expression of CoQ10 to ovarian ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Several animal studies have demonstrated that CoQ10 protects ovarian reserve, counteracts physiological ovarian ageing by restoring mitochondrial function and increases the rate of embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the clinical setting, CoQ10 supplementation led to better response to ovulation induction and decreased odds of fetal aneuploidy in 35&#x02013;43-year-old women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To date, however, no study has investigated whether CoQ10 pretreatment could improve the ART treatment outcomes in young subpopulation of poor responders in a randomized setting.</p><p id="Par10">On the above evidence, this study focused on investigating the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on response to ovarian stimulation in the group of young women with diminished ovarian reserve, corresponding to the Poseidon&#x02019;s stratification group 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We hypothesized that increased oxidative stress has a prominent effect on premature decline of ovarian function in these women, which could be amenable to anti-oxidant therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and randomization</title><p id="Par11">This was a prospective randomized controlled study, conducted at the Reproductive Medical Center of the Peking University Third Hospital, a tertiary university hospital and a center of excellence in Reproductive Medicine in China.

In women with positive pregnancy test, luteal support was continued until 8&#x000a0;weeks gestation. The protocols used for FET utilized either natural cycle or artificial estradiol and progesterone endometrium priming in normo-ovulatory and oligo-ovulatory women, respectively. In natural cycle, ovulation was tracked with transvaginal ultrasound and urine LH kit. Oral dydrogesterone (Duphaston, 20&#x000a0;mg daily for 7&#x000a0;days; Abbott Biologicals B.V.) was commenced for luteal phase support 3&#x000a0;days after LH surge on the day of embryo transfer until 8&#x000a0;weeks gestation. In artificial FET protocol, oral estradiol valerate (Progynova 6&#x000a0;mg/day, Schering, Berlin, Germany) was initiated on the third day of the menstrual cycle and endometrial thickness was monitored with transvaginal ultrasonography.

Small randomized placebo-controlled study in 24 participants (10 women in CoQ10 and 14 in placebo group) have demonstrated higher peak concentration of E2, increased number of high quality cleavage embryos, and a trend towards decreased aneuploidy and higher clinical pregnancy rate after 60&#x000a0;days treatment with 600&#x000a0;mg CoQ10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the study was underpowered and failed to demonstrate significant difference in clinical outcomes between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another randomized controlled study in 101 young women with PCOS demonstrated that addition of CoQ10 in a dose of 180&#x000a0;mg during ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate improved ovarian response in clomiphene-resistant women and resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Retrospective analysis in 797 IUI and 253 IVF cycles in women older than 36&#x02013;37&#x000a0;years revealed that addition of 600&#x000a0;mg CoQ10 to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) over the period longer than 1&#x000a0;month resulted in lower dose of gonadotrophins and higher number of mature follicles than in women treated with DHEA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The authors did not demonstrate significant difference in the embryological or clinical outcomes, and the comparisons with untreated controls were not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The plausible effect of CoQ10 on reproductive function is attributed to its effect on the antioxidative capacity and energy production in the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. CoQ10, the only synthesized lipid soluble antioxidant in humans, is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, serving an important antioxidant function both in mitochondria and in lipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. ROS-induced DNA damage in ovary leads to genomic instability, mutations and apoptosis of oocytes, and is thought to be ameliorated by an antioxidant activity of CoQ10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. CoQ10 has been also shown to improve mitochondrial function and restore energy production by mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction in oocytes results in decreased oxidative phosphorylation and suboptimal levels of mitochondria-generated ATP, which has been strongly associated with poor reproductive performance, including diminished ovarian reserve, poor oocyte quality, abnormal fertilization and deranged preimplantation embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Energy production by mitochondria is important for steroid hormone biosynthesis, oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that CoQ10 supplemented in aged animal model has improved mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial ATP production and mitotic spindle orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Treatment with CoQ10 increased the number of ovulated oocytes and reduced ROS in oocytes to the levels observed in young animals, indicating this is an effective strategy to reverse the effect of reproductive ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In humans, levels of CoQ10 in the follicular fluid positively correlated with oocyte maturation, embryo grade and pregnancy rate in women undergoing ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. While oocyte appears to be the main target of CoQ10, it remains unclear whether anti-oxidant treatment also improves uterine environment. We did not demonstrate any differences in endometrial thickness, but there were no data to confidently comment on the effect of CoQ10 in intra-uterine milieu.</p><p id="Par35">CoQ10 has been also associated with improved ovarian reserve. In rodents, CoQ10 administration reversed ovarian toxicity of cisplatin, leading to increase in the serum AMH concentrations, improved AMH-positive follicle count and lower number of atretic follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Exposure to CoQ10 restored ovarian reserve in mice with induced accelerated oocyte loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Currently, however, there is relative paucity of information concerning the exact mechanism by which CoQ10 influences ovarian reserve in humans and it is difficult to conclude whether CoQ10 rescues follicles from apoptosis or enhances primordial follicle activation. In this study there was significant decrease in baseline FSH levels after 60&#x000a0;days of CoQ10 administration. It is possible that a change in FSH levels could also have occurred without CoQ10 treatment over a period of two-three months, but this seems unlikely considering that previous study in 287 infertile men showed 14% decline in FSH levels after 3&#x000a0;months of CoQ10 supplementation with continuing decrease throughout 12&#x000a0;months therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, we did not observe improvement in other ovarian reserve markers, namely AMH and AFC and such discrepancy between our and animal studies could be explained by different treatment protocols and variation in physiological parameters between species. In rodents, 8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks of CoQ10 exposure corresponds to about &#x000bc; of the life span, which is considerably longer interval in relation to a&#x000a0;reproductive cycle when&#x000a0;compared to analogous treatment period in humans. It has been supposed that two months exposure to CoQ10 could improve energy production in the ovary but might not be long enough to restore prolonged effect of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It should be noted that it takes about three months for a primordial follicle to reach the preovulatory stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. AMH is predominantly produced upon transition from the primordial to primary follicles when they are&#x000a0;recruited from the dormant pool and represents early stages of growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, short duration of CoQ10 administration is likely to influence late events of follicle maturation but may not be sufficient to improve follicle recruitment evidenced by AMH levels. Indeed, the study that reported significant increase in antral follicles in CoQ10, included women who were treated with CoQ10 for&#x000a0;an average of 8.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The optimal timing, duration and dose of CoQ10 supplementation remain unclear. In this study, the duration of treatment was selected arbitrary based on previous study in IVF population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It could be argued that CoQ10 treatment implies a delay in initiation of ART cycle and thus longer pretreatment period may be less acceptable to the patients. It has been demonstrated that CoQ10 is well tolerated and safe for healthy adults at intake of up to 900&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We were guided by previous experience in selecting the dose of CoQ10, although this was rather intuitive choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The main strength of this study is that it focused on a specific phenotype within a broad heterogeneous group of women with POR. All the participants shared similar demographic and clinical characteristics and had comparable pre-treatment markers of ovarian activity. In addition, we utilized an unbiased randomization process and applied the similar laboratory and clinical protocols to all the participants.</p><p id="Par38">The important limitation of our study was its small sample size and we were unable to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes. Live birth is an ultimate outcome of infertility treatment and is more appropriate estimate for patient counseling. The POSEIDON group has recently suggested that the number of oocytes needed to obtain at least one euploid embryo per patient is a more practical treatment endpoint for the studies in women with POR and helps to define the short-term goals for management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In adopting this approach, we chose the number of high quality embryos as a primary outcome measure and calculated the sample size accordingly. High drop-out rate in the study group due to CoQ10 discontinuation was additional limiting factor that should be considered in future studies. In line with the reported by others, CoQ10 administration did not cause any adverse reactions or side effects in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], but all women who discontinued treatment reported difficulty to comply with the CoQ10 regime requiring three times a day administration. Finally, in this study we did not evaluate the levels of oxidative stress markers before or after treatment and did not assess the influence of other lifestyle factors that may pose women at higher risk. A threshold effect of CoQ10 may vary on individual level due to interference with other environmental exposures leading to oxidative stress and this should be considered in the design of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">In summary, pretreatment with CoQ10 increases ovarian response to stimulation and improves oocyte and embryo quality in young low prognosis patients with diminished ovarian reserve. There is a possible beneficial effect on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, but this needs to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled studies. Further work is required to establish the optimal length, timing and dosage of treatment and to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CoQ10 supplementation in other subgroups of low prognosis women with POR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank the women who participated in the study.
