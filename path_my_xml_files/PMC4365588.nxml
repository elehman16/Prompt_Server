At the 2-year time point, all the patients were analyzed and it was found that those who had undergone a prior surgery experienced similar benefits from their spinal surgery as those who had not had a prior surgery.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> No information exists, however, on the long-term benefits of fusion and arthroplasty on this specific (prior surgery) patient population.</p><p>The long-term clinical benefits of spinal fusion have been discussed in multiple reports.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Long-term arthroplasty results have also been the subject of several publications<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>; however, the information included in these reports represents level IV data as none of the studies were based on multicenter, randomized controlled cases. Recently, the 5-year results from the artificial disc versus interbody fusion study were compiled, providing long-term efficacy data&#x02014;for both fusion and arthroplasty&#x02014;from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Our study of the 5-year results provides a unique opportunity to understand the long-term impact of both fusion and arthroplasty on specific patient populations, such as patients with prior surgery as well as patients with prior discectomy.</p><p>In this study, both the arthroplasty and fusion patient populations were subdivided based on the patients&#x02019; history of prior surgery or prior discectomy. The prior surgery patient subgroups were compared to the subgroups without prior surgery or discectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Study Design and Surgical Technique</title><p>Between May 2000 and April 2002, 375 patients were randomized for treatment by either anterior lumbar fusion with the interbody fusion system and iliac crest autograft or total disc replacement with the artificial disc as part of a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, FDA-approved IDE study conducted at 14 investigational sites across the United States. At the completion of the 2-year study, a new investigation was initiated to further collect data from this study, up to the 5-year time point. All 14 sites were invited to participate; however, 6 sites declined continuation, reducing the number of available patients by 90. A total of 160 patients presented for their 5-year follow-up: 43 interbody fusion patients, 90 randomized arthroplasty cases, and 27 non-randomized (training) arthroplasty cases. Randomized cases only are included in this analysis. Patients were subdivided by prior surgery history as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. Prior surgery was not an exclusion criterion for the IDE study, as long as it was defined as prior decompressions via discectomy or laminotomy/foraminotomy without fusion. Prior decompression with fusion, on the other hand, was listed as an exclusion criterion. Patients in this study, therefore, do not include cases with prior fusion surgery. Of the 90 arthroplasty patients, 37 had prior surgery of which 21 had prior discectomy. Of the 43 fusion patients, 12 had prior surgery of which 6 had prior discectomy. The groups are defined as arthroplasty prior surgery group (ASG) and fusion prior surgery (excluding prior fusion) group (FSG); arthroplasty prior discectomy group (ADG) and fusion prior discectomy group (FDG); and arthroplasty no prior surgery group (ANG) and fusion no prior surgery group (FNG).

Only randomized cases were included herein. Overall, arthroplasty patients with prior surgery or prior discectomy experienced clinical outcomes that were similar to those experienced by arthroplasty patients without prior surgery or prior discectomy. However, fusion patients who had undergone prior surgery or prior discectomy experienced smaller pain and disability improvements (as measured by VAS and ODI) compared to fusion patients without prior surgery or prior discectomy.</p><p>In all subgroups, average differences in outcomes at the 5-year time point exceeded the minimum clinically important differences (MCID) established for VAS (18&#x02013;19mm) and ODI (10 points).<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In the arthroplasty group, VAS improvements were twice the MCID for all subgroups, while ODI improvements were twice the MCID for the ANG and ASG subgroups but not the ADG. In the fusion group, VAS and ODI improvements were twice the MCID for the FNG but not for the FSG and FDG subgroups, in which VAS and ODI improvements barely reached the MCID threshold.</p><p>The return to work percentage was also greater in the arthroplasty group than in the fusion group. This finding was already apparent in the overall IDE 5-year follow-up,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> which showed a statistically greater percentage of arthroplasty patients returning to work versus fusion patients. In our current analyses, while statistical significances were not shown, fusion patients with prior discectomy and prior surgery experienced the lowest rates of return to work. In comparison, arthroplasty patients with prior surgery had the greatest rate of return to work.</p><p>Despite the small sample size in the fusion prior surgery and fusion prior discectomy group, these results may further question whether such procedures (eg, decompressions with laminotomy/foraminotomy or discectomy) should be considered contraindications for subsequent fusion procedures with BAK and iliac crest autograft.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the unequal distribution of patients across the groups analyzed, the loss of patients to follow-up and the subsequent small sample sizes at the 5-year time point. It is possible that among the loss to follow-up patients are patients who have brought legal claims for personal injuries rather than continuing in the study. Due to lack of information and other constraints, we are not presently able to determine the significance of these patients&#x02019; outcomes to the study. This is in part due to the fact that the IDE study was initially designed for a 2-year follow-up. Thus, while all of the 14 sites involved in the initial 2-year IDE trial were invited to participate in the 5-year follow-up, 6 declined continuation. Since all sites initially signed up for a 2-year study, they were under no obligation to pursue the investigation beyond the 2-year time point. The resulting small patient samples, especially in the prior discectomy subgroups, prevented in-depth statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0013"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Arthroplasty patients with or without prior surgery or prior discectomy experienced, on average, significant clinical improvements from their surgery.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of lumbar total disc replacement, using the CHARITE artificial disc (DePuy Spine, Raynham, MA), with anterior lumbar interbody fusion, for the treatment of single-level degenerative disc disease from L4-S1 unresponsive to nonoperative treatment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Reported results of lumbar total disc replacement have been favorable, but studies have been limited to retrospective case series and/or small sample sizes. METHODS: Three hundred four (304) patients were enrolled in the study at 14 centers across the United States and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with the CHARITE artificial disc or the control group, instrumented anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Data were collected pre- and perioperatively at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. The key clinical outcome measures were a Visual Analog Scale assessing back pain, the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire, and the SF-36 Health Survey. RESULTS: Patients in both groups improved significantly following surgery. Patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group recovered faster than patients in the control group. Patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group had lower levels of disability at every time interval from 6 weeks to 24 months, compared with the control group, with statistically lower pain and disability scores at all but the 24 month follow-up (P &#x0003c; 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up period, a significantly greater percentage of patients in the CHARITE artificial disc group expressed satisfaction with their treatment and would have the same treatment again, compared with the fusion group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in the CHARITE artificial disc group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). The complication rate was similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, randomized, multicenter study demonstrated that quantitative clinical outcome measures following lumbar total disc replacement with the CHARITE artificial disc are at least equivalent to clinical outcomes with anterior lumbar interbody fusion. These results support earlier reports in the literature that total disc replacement with the CHARITE artificial disc is a safe and effective alternative to fusion for the surgical treatment of symptomatic disc degeneration in properly indicated patients. The CHARITE artificial disc group demonstrated statistically significant superiority in two major economic areas, a 1-day shorter hospitalization, and a lower rate of reoperations (5.4% compared with 9.1%). At 24 months, the investigational group had a significantly higher rate of satisfaction (73.7%) than the 53.1% rate of satisfaction in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0011). This prospective randomized multicenter study also demonstrated an increase in employment of 9.1% in the investigational group and 7.2% in the control group.</p><p>

OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety and effectiveness of lumbar total disc replacement (TDR) with the CHARITE artificial disc (DePuy Spine, Raynham, MA) to anterior lumbar interbody fusion for the treatment of single-level degenerative disc disease from L4-S1 unresponsive to nonoperative treatment. In addition, to evaluate the radiographic outcomes of lumbar artificial disc replacement at either L4-L5 or L5-S1 with the CHARITE artificial disc as compared to anterior lumbar interbody fusion with cylindrical cages and iliac crest bone graft; and to determine if a correlation exists between clinical outcomes and surgical accuracy of TDR placement within the disc space. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior investigators have reported excellent radiographic results with the CHARITE artificial disc for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease. These encouraging results are the product of retrospective reviews without a control. Very few studies have reported on the segmental motion of an intervertebral level implanted with an artificial disc, and no studies have reported a correlation of radiographic and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, multicenter, US Food and Drug Administration, investigational device exemption study with 24-month follow-up was performed at 14 centers throughout the United States. A total of 304 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with 205 in the investigational group (TDR with the CHARITE artificial disc) and 99 in the control group (anterior lumbar interbody fusion with BAK cages and iliac crest bone graft). A total of 71 TDR training cases were performed (up to 5 at each site) before randomization beginning at each site. Plain radiographs were analyzed for each subject in both groups regarding range of motion (ROM) in flexion/extension, restoration of disc space height, and subsidence. Prosthesis placement in the coronal and midsagittal planes was analyzed for the 276 patients with TDR. Correlations were performed between prosthesis placement and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients in the investigational group had a 13.6% mean increase, and those in the control group an 82.5% decrease in mean flexion/extension ROM at 24 months postoperatively compared to baseline. Patients in the investigational group had significantly better restoration of disc height than the control group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). There was significantly less subsidence in the investigational group compared to the control group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). The surgical technical accuracy of CHARITE artificial disc placement was divided into 3 groups: I, ideal (83%); II, suboptimal (11%); and III, poor (6%), and correlated with clinical outcomes. The flexion/extension ROM and prosthesis function improved with the surgical technical accuracy of radiographic placement (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ROM in flexion/extension was restored and maintained in patients receiving a TDR. TDR with the CHARITE artificial disc resulted in significantly better restoration of disc space height, and significantly less subsidence than anterior interbody fusion with BAK cages. Clinical outcomes and flexion/extension ROM correlated with surgical technical accuracy of CHARITE artificial disc placement. In the majority of cases, placement of the CHARITE artificial disc was ideal.</p><p>
<bold>Effect of previous surgery on clinical outcome following 1-level lumbar arthroplasty</bold>.</p><p>
<italic>Geisler FH, Guyer RD, Blumenthal SL, McAfee PC, Cappuccino A, Bitan F, Regan JJ</italic>.</p><p>OBJECT: A secondary lumbar surgery at a previously surgically treated level is believed to result in minimal clinical improvement. The clinical results of the CHARITE Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study were analyzed to assess the effect of previous surgery on clinical outcomes following either total disc replacement with the CHARITE device or anterior lumbar interbody fusion with a BAK cage and iliac crest autograft. METHODS: Patients with prior microdiscectomy, laminectomy, or minimal medial facetectomy were not excluded from enrollment in the CHARITE IDE study. Thus, the following 3 groups were analyzed: all patients treated with the CHARITE Artificial Disc, whether randomized or nonrandomized; only patients treated with CHARITE devices randomized against patients with BAK devices; and control patients with BAK devices. Each group was further subdivided based on the patients&#x02019; medical history, whether they had undergone prior surgery (prior surgery group) or had not (no prior surgery group). For all groups, baseline demographics were collected and compared for any potential recruitment bias. Postoperative improvements based on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS), and patient satisfaction scores were further collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: For all 3 groups, there were no statistical differences in clinical improvement from 3 months to 2 years postoperatively as measured using ODI and VAS scores between the subgroups (those who had prior surgery and those who did not). CONCLUSIONS: Patients indicated for 1-level lumbar arthroplasty with previous lumbar decompressive surgery can be expected to have similar clinical outcomes to patients undergoing arthroplasty without prior lumbar decompressive surgery. Similarly, candidates for anterior lumbar fusion with prior decompressive surgery may experience similar benefits from the surgical procedure as those without.</p><p>
<bold>The Lumbar I/F Cage for posterior lumbar interbody fusion with the variable screw placement system: 10-year results of a Food and Drug Administration clinical trial</bold>.</p><p>
<italic>Brantigan JW, Neidre A, Toohey JS</italic>.</p><p>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The Lumbar I/F Cage is a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) device designed to separate the mechanical and device functions of interbody fusion. A Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical study of the CFRP cage was conducted during an enrollment period from 1991 to 1993. Based on the 2-year results of this study, the cage was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 1999. Since then, the Lumbar I/F Cage device has become widely used in the United States. PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine the long-term results of patients who received this device during the 1991-1993 enrollments. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Investigators from the original study were asked to evaluate their original patients according to FDA-reviewed case report forms. Although many of the centers were unable to provide significant follow-up, two centers that enrolled almost half of the original study group provided reports on a high percentage of their original patients. This paper reviews the results in those patients. PATIENT SAMPLE: Inclusion criteria included patients with degenerative disc disease who had at least one failed lumbar discectomy or decompression procedure at one or more levels. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical success was defined by a modified Prolo score evaluating pain, function, medication usage and economic status. Fusion success, determined by evaluation of plain radiographs, was defined by continuous bone bridging the fusion area with no lucencies. Flexion-extension X-rays were done on patients who had previous removal of pedicle screw implants. Any motion on flexion-extension films indicated pseudarthrosis. METHODS: All patients were contacted at their last known address. Internet search services were used to locate additional patients. Thirty-three of 43 eligible patients (77%) were evaluated, including 31 patients who reported for examination and X-ray and 2 additional patients by telephone survey and written questionnaire. RESULTS: Clinical success was achieved in 32 of 37 patients (86.5%) at 24 months and in 29 of 33 patients (87.8%) at 10 years. This included 61% excellent, 27% good, and 12% fair results. Fusion success was reported in 37 of 37 patients (100%) at 24 months and in 29 of 30 patients (96.7%) at 10 years. Patient satisfaction was reported in 31 of 33 (93.9%). Further lumbar surgery was done in 23 patients: in 18 patients for elective removal of pedicle screws and in 5 patients to extend the fusion to adjacent levels. Adjacent segment degeneration occurred in 61% of patients but was clinically significant in only 20%. Smokers had equal clinical and fusion success with nonsmokers at 24 months and 10 years and had adjacent segment degeneration in 37%, a rate significantly lower than nonsmokers at 87%. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of clinical success, fusion success, and patient satisfaction at 24 months was maintained at 10-year follow-up. Adjacent segment degeneration was common but was usually not clinically significant.</p><p>
<bold>Long-term results of one-level lumbar arthroplasty: minimum 10-year follow-up of the CHARITE artificial disc in 106 patients</bold>.</p><p>
<italic>David T</italic>.</p><p>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart and radiographic review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term clinical results, radiographic results, and incidence of complications in a large patient cohort with one-level lumbar total disc replacement (TDR). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior authors have described short-term, mid-term, and long-term clinical and radiographic results in patients with lumbar TDR with highly variable results. METHODS: From January 1989 to November 1995, 108 patients, with a mean age of 36.4 years, underwent lumbar TDR with the CHARITE Artificial Disc, with 106 available for follow-up. A modified Stauffer-Coventry scale was used to determine clinical outcome. Return to work, work level, and the incidence of complications were assessed. Dynamic lateral flexion-extension and lateral bending radiographs were performed and segmental range of motion (ROM) was measured using the Cobb method. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 13.2 years (range, 10-16.8 years). Of the 106 patients, 87 (82.1%) had either an excellent or good clinical outcome. Of the 96 patients working before surgery, 86 returned to work (89.6%), including 77.8% of patients with hard labor level employment (28 of 36) returning to the same level of work. The mean ROM in flexion-extension was 10.1 degrees , in lateral bending it was 4.4 degrees , and 90.6% of implanted prostheses were still mobile. Eight patients (7.5%) required posterior instrumented fusion. There were 5 cases (4.6%) of postoperative facet arthrosis, 3 cases (2.8%) of subsidence, 3 cases (2.8%) of adjacent-level disease, and 2 cases (1.9%) of core subluxation. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the CHARITE Artificial Disc at one level, either L4-L5 or L5-S1, in the long-term. Clinical outcomes and the rate of return to work were excellent overall. The rate of adjacent-level disease requiring surgical intervention was considerably lower (2.8%) compared with reports in the literature for lumbar fusion. As with any surgical procedure, proper indications play a pivotal role in clinical success.
