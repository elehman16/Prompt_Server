For effective control of HIV/AIDS in India, an HIV vaccine may prove to be a useful addition to other available prevention options. Two phase I clinical HIV prophylactic vaccine trials have been conducted previously in India to evaluate Adenovirus-Associated Virus (AAV) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based HIV vaccines. Although the AAV-based vaccine showed poor immunogenicity, the MVA HIV-1 subtype C vaccine induced a modest level of dose-dependent immune responses <xref rid="pone.0055831-Mehendale1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Mehendale2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Ramanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Since vaccine strategies based on inducing neutralizing antibodies failed in large scale phase III trials <xref rid="pone.0055831-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Pitisuttithum1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> the direction of HIV prophylactic vaccine research shifted to evaluating vaccine candidates having the ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. However, a higher magnitude and limited breadth of T-cell responses, as detected by Interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) ELISPOT assays, did not correlate with protection in monkey models <xref rid="pone.0055831-Sadagopal1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>A phase III clinical trial (RV144) is the only large scale HIV vaccine trial that demonstrated a modest reduction in the infection rates among the vaccinees. The trial used a heterologous prime-boost regimen consisting of a recombinant canarypox vector prime followed by recombinant Env gp120 protein boost <xref rid="pone.0055831-RerksNgarm1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The major advantage of heterologous boosting with vector based vaccines is the obviation of vector-induced immune responses after repeated doses of the same construct affecting generation of immune responses against target antigens <xref rid="pone.0055831-Bot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Nayak1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Heterologous boosting also provides potential for different vectors to work synergistically by stimulating complementary arms of the immune response <xref rid="pone.0055831-Bot1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

The viruses used in the panel were SF162.LS- Tier 1 subtype B (cat no. 4694), MW965- Tier-1 subtype C (cat no. 4696), TV1.21- Tier-2 subtype C (cat no. 4659), HIV-001428-2.42- Tier-2 subtype C (cat no. 3551), IVC 4&#x02013;5 (Tier-2 subtype C: recent infection), MLV- control virus (cat no. 3860).</p><p>Freshly trypsinized TZM-bl cells (10,000 cells in 100 &#x000b5;L of growth medium containing 75 &#x000b5;g/mL DEAE dextran) were added to each well keeping appropriate virus and cell controls. After 48 hour incubation, 100 &#x000b5;L of cells was transferred to 96-well black solid plates (Costar, High Wycombe, Bucks, U.K.) for measurements of luminescence using the Britelite Luminescence Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Massachusetts, USA). The results were calculated as the percentage of reduction in Relative Luminescence Units (RLU) in wells containing post-immunization serum relative to the RLU in wells containing corresponding pre-immune serum (collected on the day of vaccination but before vaccination) from the same subject (data not shown). Samples showing more than 50% inhibition were further tested for determination of neutralizing antibody titres using 3-fold dilutions of sera with starting dilution of 1&#x02236;10. Nab titers were calculated as the sample dilution conferring a 50% reduction in relative luminescence (ID<sub>50</sub>) as compared to virus control wells after subtraction of background RLU in cell control wells. Validity criteria used for the assays were 1) The average RLU of virus control wells should be &#x0003e;10 times the average RLU of cell control wells, 2) The standard deviation of RLU in the virus control well should be &#x0003c;30%, 3)The standard deviation for duplicate wells should be &#x0003c;30% for sample dilutions that yield at least 40% neutralization, 4) The neutralization curves should be smooth and linear around the 50% neutralization cut-off.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size of 32 volunteers (<italic>24 vaccine and 8 placebo recipients</italic>) was appropriate for an exploratory clinical trial for evaluating safety while also providing relevant information on vaccine induced immune responses.

Several studies have shown that DNA priming improves the quality of both T-cell and B-cell immune responses, when boosted with viral vectors <xref rid="pone.0055831-DeRosa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Jaoko1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Koup1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Hence, a heterologous DNA prime and MVA boost vaccination regimen was designed to investigate whether a more robust immune response would be generated in comparison with a homologous MVA boost regimen. However, due to the small sample size, this study had limited power for analytical comparisons of safety and immunogenicity responses between the groups receiving two types of regimens.</p><p>Both vaccine strategies were shown to be generally safe and well tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. Volunteers experienced mostly mild local and systemic reactogenicity. The overall distribution of local and systemic reactogenicity, as well as unsolicited adverse events, was similar among vaccine and placebo recipients. In the present study, one Group B volunteer showed premature atrial and ventricular contractions which were detected at 3 days post third MVA injection. The ECG abnormality resolved spontaneously without any treatment. MVA, being a non replicating vector, has not been previously reported to cause pericardiac or myocardiac events <xref rid="pone.0055831-Cebere1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Gurunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although the condition was categorized as possibly related in view of the temporal relationship of the ECG abnormality and the known rare risk of myocarditis following replicating vaccinia vaccination, the event did not meet the criteria of pericarditis or myocarditis, and thus does not point to an association between ECG abnormality and TBC-M4 (a non-replicating vector) administration. The episode of glossitis observed in the same volunteer could be due to an inter-current enterovirus infection for which unfortunately no specific serology could be performed.</p><p>Immunogenicity assessments after the study vaccinations demonstrated sporadic immune responses after the DNA vaccinations in Group A. This result was expected since DNA vaccines administered by needle injection, in the absence of an adjuvant, are generally weakly immunogenic. The priming effect of DNA was evidenced after the first MVA vaccination in Group A, where 100% of subjects showed a positive IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT response, compared to 60% of subjects in Group B after the first MVA vaccination. This finding suggests that DNA vaccination did prime the immune system as has been reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0055831-Koup1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The mechanism by which DNA priming exerts such effects remains to be elucidated. One of the suggested mechanisms is induction of HIV-specific CD4+T-cells which might help in rapid expansion of CD4+ and CD8+T-cell responses during boosting <xref rid="pone.0055831-DeRosa1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Gurunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although CD4+ T cells are also implicated in long term persistence of immune response, no difference in persistence of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT response was observed at 12 months after the last vaccination in the present study.</p><p>Both the DNA and MVA constructs contained multiple genes of HIV with the intent of targeting several viral components. This strategy is thought to be useful for reducing the risk of escape from vaccine-induced immunity <xref rid="pone.0055831-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Rollman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Prime-boost immunization has been shown to significantly increase the breadth of the immune responses possibly due to the divergent cell targeting and antigen processing routes complementing one another, allowing a greater diversity of epitope recognition than with either agent alone <xref rid="pone.0055831-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, in the present study, the breadth of T-cell responses as defined by recognition of multiple HIV antigens was similar in both groups. The T-cell responses were predominantly seen against Env and Gag as observed in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0055831-Harari1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Predominant Env specific responses have also been reported after vaccinations with multi-genic poxvirus vectors previously <xref rid="pone.0055831-Currier1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-McCormack1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Although in natural chronic HIV infection, Env-specific CD8+ T-cell responses have been shown to be associated with poor control of viral replication compared to Gag-specific responses <xref rid="pone.0055831-Kiepiela1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, non-human primates immunized with DNA plus Ad5 expressing SIV Env as well as Gag were better protected against SIV challenge compared to animals immunized with vaccines expressing only Gag <xref rid="pone.0055831-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Another macaque study also showed that the protection against the acquisition of SIV infection required the inclusion of Env in the vaccine regimen <xref rid="pone.0055831-Barouch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> indicating that the generation of Env-specific responses might also be important in early HIV infection.</p><p>The MVA-alone strategy was evaluated earlier in a previous clinical trial conducted in India <xref rid="pone.0055831-Ramanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, where the low dose used was comparable in titer to the MVA dose used for vaccination in the present study. The response rates in the current Group B are comparable to those reported in the low dose group of the previous trial, with 64% and 91% of volunteers showing positive T-cell responses in the previous trial as compared to 55% and 92% after the second and third MVA vaccinations, respectively, in the current trial. Among MVA vaccine recipients in both trials, the response magnitudes were modest and directed against Env and Gag.</p><p>In the present study, antibody responses, as opposed to T-cell responses, were of higher frequency, magnitude and breadth of recognized HIV antigens by Western blot in the MVA only group (Group B) than in the DNA/MVA group (Group A). This corroborates a macaque study using MVA alone that showed 10-fold higher anti-Env antibodies following immunization with MVA alone compared to those immunized with DNA and MVA regimens <xref rid="pone.0055831-Amara1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Conversely, in some studies the antibody responses to prime-boost regimens with DNA as prime and Ad5 or protein as boost, were found to be higher than those in homologous Ad5 or protein boost regimens <xref rid="pone.0055831-Koup1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. One of the reasons for this could be the ability of poxviruses to act as adjuvants for B cells through induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, supporting plasma cell survival <xref rid="pone.0055831-Hutchings1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. By contrast, T-cell responses failed to increase in magnitude after repeated boosting with MVA in both the groups. Similar results with failure of boosting of the T-cell response with a marginal increase in antibody responses to HIV proteins after repeated immunizations of MVA have also been observed previously in animal models <xref rid="pone.0055831-Amara1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Shete1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Failure to boost the T-cell immune response against vector expressed foreign antigen after repeated immunizations may be due to induction of immune responses against viral vector proteins leading to early elimination of vectors hampering immune responses against the vaccine insert. Despite the differences observed in immune responses elicited by DNA prime MVA boost compared with homologous MVA boost regimens, the protection against SIV challenge in macaques has been shown to be comparable in one of the previous study <xref rid="pone.0055831-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Vaccinia antibodies were induced in all vaccinated volunteers after MVA vaccination in both groups. All the 8 volunteers with baseline responses were born before 1980 and hence the antibodies are likely to have been induced by a previous smallpox vaccination. No correlation was detected between the magnitude of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT response with the presence of VVbAbs at baseline (data not shown) suggesting that pre-existing immunity did not influence the induction of HIV-specific immune responses in these volunteers, as reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0055831-Ramanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Gudmundsdotter1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This is in contrast with data showing high baseline adenovirus type 5-specific antibody titres and hampering IFN-&#x003b3;ELISPOT responses <xref rid="pone.0055831-Priddy1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Titres of HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in the MVA only group (Group B) volunteers as compared to the DNA/MVA group (Group A). The neutralizing antibody response was mainly against Tier-1 subtype B and subtype C viruses, which are known to be neutralization-sensitive. No responses against Tier-2 viruses were detected in any volunteers. It has already been shown that Tier 2 responses are rarely induced by most of the vaccine strategies tested so far in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0055831-Goepfert1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, 3/12 and 5/12 volunteers from Groups A and B, respectively, showed presence of neutralizing antibodies against a recently transmitted strain of Indian origin. This could be considered as an important determinant of vaccine-induced immunity indicative of possible protection against transmitted HIV. Furthermore, although neutralizing antibodies against Tier-2 viruses were minimal, the role of non-neutralizing antibodies in protecting against HIV cannot be ruled out, as emphasized in the RV144 trial, where protection was found to be associated with presence of anti V1/V2 binding IgG antibodies <xref rid="pone.0055831-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion the safety profile as well as immunogenicity of the DNA/MVA heterologous prime-boost strategy was comparable with that of the homologous MVA alone strategy. Although DNA priming resulted in enhancement of immune responses following 1<sup>st</sup> MVA boosting in group A, the effect lasted for a very short time demonstrating no immunological advantage of heterologous prime boost strategy over homologous MVA alone strategy. New administration strategies of DNA vaccines to augment T-cell immune responses including intra-dermal needle injection, Biojector, and electroporation with or without molecular adjuvant administration have generated promising results that may deserve further investigations with vector boosts <xref rid="pone.0055831-Bakari1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Vasan2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055831-Winstone1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0055831.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
