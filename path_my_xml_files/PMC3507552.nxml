In addition to directly causing pain, it can also impair an individual&#x02019;s sleep, lower mood, and have a negative impact on daily activities, resulting in poor quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition, the financial costs of chronic DPNP are substantial from both a direct healthcare cost and loss of productivity by the sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Chronic DPNP is often difficult to treat, with drug regimes often being inadequate at controlling pain and limited by side effects and the development of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). First-line treatments for neuropathic pain include the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, the selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor duloxetine, and calcium channel &#x003b1;2 delta ligands such as pregabalin and gabapentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although amitriptyline has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), its relative nonspecific mode of action may limit its use due a broad range of adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Duloxetine has been reported to be safe and effective in patients with DPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), with a relatively low rate of adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The anticonvulsant pregabalin has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of DPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Side effects associated with this agent include somnolence; however, it has been suggested that pregabalin&#x02019;s positive effect on sleep may lead to further improvement of pain and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>For patients with diabetes, sleep can be affected by a number of factors, including increased nocturia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), sleep disordered breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), periodic limb movements (PLMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and episodes of hyper- or hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition, for patients with DPNP, sleep may also be affected by pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Pregabalin has been shown to consistently improve subjective sleep in patients with DPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and studies in healthy volunteers suggest that this agent also enhances slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of three first-line treatments for DPNP on pain, sleep, cognitive function, and quality of life, and to investigate whether the improved restorative sleep seen in healthy individuals was replicated in patients with chronic DPNP.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects 18 years of age and older with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) for at least 1 year and neuropathic pain of diabetic origin were invited to participate in the study. Subjects were recruited on the basis of symptoms suggestive of DPNP, including one or more of the following: dysesthesia, burning pain, cold or heat allodynia, shooting or lancinating pains, and hyperalgesia affecting both lower extremities at any level below the midthighs. A confirmation of DPNP was then made by means of a Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) score &#x0003e;12. Subjects were excluded if there was evidence of cognitive impairment (score of &#x0003c;25 on the Mini Mental State Exam), end-stage disease of a major system, evidence of a recurrent and/or severe hypoglycemic event (defined as hypoglycemia requiring help from a third party) in the last 3 years, or a recent cardiac or cerebral ischemic event. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and subjects with a history of dependence on or abuse of alcohol/recreational drugs were also excluded. Furthermore, subjects were not allowed to enter the study if they had been involved in another clinical trial within the previous 3 months.</p><p>Subjects were reimbursed for their time and inconvenience, and at the end of the study were provided with the study medication to which they had been randomized if this was requested. This trial was conducted according to ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines at the Surrey Clinical Research Centre (Surrey CRC). The study received a favorable opinion from the Essex 1 Research Ethics Committee and University of Surrey Ethics Committee and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Subjects were sequentially randomized into one of the three treatment arms (pregabalin, amitriptyline, or duloxetine). The randomization was provided by an independent statistician to ensure that groups were matched for age and sex where possible. Patients were stratified into four groups: males 18&#x02013;59, females 18&#x02013;59, males &#x0003e;60, and females &#x0003e;60 years of age. All participants were requested to stop taking their current pain medication (for the equivalent of at least five half-lives) before participating in the trial. For ethical reasons, subjects were allowed to continue taking opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the study and were allowed to take paracetamol with a maximum dose of 4 g/day.</p><p>After the 8-day placebo run in, subjects were titrated through 14 days of lower-dose medication (amitriptyline 25 mg twice daily; duloxetine 60 mg every morning; pregabalin 150 mg twice daily) to 14 days of higher-dose medication (amitriptyline 25 mg every morning; 50 mg every night; duloxetine 60 mg twice daily; pregabalin 300 mg twice daily). At the end of each treatment period, subjects stayed at the Surrey CRC for a 48-h comprehensive assessment of polysomnographic (PSG) sleep, subjective pain, daytime functioning, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS System Gold Medtronic MiniMed, Inc.)

Previous studies have indicated that use of amitriptyline may be limited by its effects on daytime functioning, in particular aspects of memory function that are disrupted even after long-term dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The study reported here suggests that there is limited evidence for cognitive function being compromised with amitriptyline treatment, and all three treatments were relatively well tolerated. The change in tracking (CTT) performance with pregabalin replicated a similar finding reported previously in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and supports current clinical evidence that daytime effects from pregabalin treatment are limited. There was evidence that duloxetine improved attention-based tasks and sensori-motor performance. Similar improvements with selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in mental processing speed have been observed in both patients with depression and healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), possibly reflecting CNS activation.</p><p>PSG sleep examination gave further support to a CNS-activating effect of duloxetine as both the 60- and 120-mg dose reduced total sleep time, increased the amount of wake, increased time to fall asleep, and substantially disrupted REM sleep. In contrast, sleep continuity was promoted by pregabalin (600 mg) and unchanged with amitriptyline. The signature changes in sleep seen with duloxetine have previously been reported; although the alerting effect has been associated more with evening dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Despite previous literature suggesting that amitriptyline promotes sleep initiation and sleep continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), our results indicated little impact of amitriptyline on sleep in patients with DPNP. In line with previous reports, pregabalin improved sleep continuity, reducing wake after sleep onset.</p><p>The sleep fragmentation seen with duloxetine is concerning. It is widely believed that poor sleep may worsen pain, and although duloxetine has good analgesic efficacy, its effectiveness may be limited by this physiological effect. In addition to a direct effect on sleep, there was also evidence that PLMs were significantly increased under duloxetine and amitriptyline, a finding often reported for antidepressant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Pregabalin, on the other hand, significantly reduced PLM. One clinical finding that requires further investigation was the apparent increase in AHI and increase in oxygen desaturations with pregabalin during sleep. This clinical finding has not been reported previously; although Saletu-Zhylarz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) did report an increase in snoring index. It should be noted that there was a relatively low incidence of sleep apnea in the patient population, and overall the increase in AHI was numerical rather than increasing clinical severity.</p><p>As significant changes in sleep and daytime functioning were observed, it was perhaps surprising to find that there were no significant improvements in mental health, as assessed by the SF-36, after 28 days of treatment. All three treatments (pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder and duloxetine and amitriptyline for depression) are indicated for affective disorders and it has been well documented that DPNP is associated with low mood, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although the SF-36 had been a tool used in previous DPNP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is possible that this measure was not sensitive enough to assess changes in mood over a short, 4-week period. Mood scales, such as Profile of Mood States, might be a more appropriate measure to detect subtle changes in mood state over a shorter period of time.</p><p>Overall, all three treatments were well tolerated with no significant laboratory or safety findings. There was no indication of changes in HDL values with duloxetine as has been reported by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). One patient had clinically significant hematological changes with amitriptyline (platelet count reducing from 253,000 to 87,000 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L), reinforcing the need for care when prescribing the tricyclic antidepressant in older adults. In general, all adverse events were in line with those previously reported; however, there was a significantly higher number of adverse events reported in the pregabalin treatment group, in particular, those related to nervous system disorders such as fatigue, somnolence, and dizziness. Although patients reported a higher number of adverse events with pregabalin, and this should be considered when prescribing pregabalin to DPNP patients, it should be noted that a higher proportion of patients requested to continue with pregabalin treatment at the end of the study, suggesting that the adverse events did not interfere significantly with their activities of daily living.</p><p>In conclusion, amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin were equally effective analgesic medications in patients with DPNP. Pregabalin promoted sleep, whereas duloxetine increased sleep fragmentation and substantially reduced REM sleep. Daytime function was relatively unaffected by drug treatment, and all three drugs were well tolerated. In this short, 28-day dosing study, there was no evidence of improved quality of life (SF-36) even with the sleep enhancement observed with pregabalin. Further longer-term studies, with more sensitive measures of assessment, may help establish the effect of sleep changes seen with pregabalin and duloxetine on pain, glycemic control, and quality of life during long-term treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
