Such programmes typically deliver traditional CBT components of psychoeducation, de-arousal, exposure and cognitive restructuring in a self-help format, completed over several weeks with therapist support and guidance provided remotely. iCBT is efficacious for treating panic disorder,<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> effective when supported by medical practitioners<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and in psychiatric settings,<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and enables improvement equivalent to that achieved with face-to-face individual or group delivery, but is more cost-effective.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Indeed, a recent review indicated that iCBT for panic disorder is well established<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (though iCBT may be somewhat less efficacious for milder panic symptoms).<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We previously reported the efficacy of a six-lesson iCBT programme for panic disorder.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We subsequently reduced this programme to five lessons to increase adherence and facilitate completion and explored whether similar gains could be found with minimal therapist guidance. The current paper presents efficacy and effectiveness data from two studies on the revised five-lesson iCBT programme for panic (the Panic Program). Study 1 was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the Panic Program compared with waiting list control. Study 2 investigated the effectiveness of the same programme, when prescribed by primary care practitioners to their patients via THISWAYUP Clinic, an online treatment clinic for depression and anxiety disorders (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thiswayupclinic.org">www.thiswayupclinic.org</ext-link>). We hypothesised that the iCBT programme would be effective in reducing panic symptomatology, distress and comorbid depression symptoms, and would be more effective than waiting list control. We also predicted that the iCBT programme would remain effective when completed under the supervision of primary care practitioners, but we would find lower completion rates.</p><sec id="S0002"><title>Method: study 1</title><sec id="S20001"><title>Design</title><p>A CONSORT 2010 compliant RCT design was used to compare an immediate treatment group to a deferred-treatment group (waiting list control). The immediate treatment group was followed up until 3 months post-treatment. The waiting list control group was enrolled in the iCBT course after the treatment group had completed the programme. During the waitlist period, the waiting list control group completed outcome questionnaires at time-points matched to the immediate treatment group, but received no intervention. A minimum of 25 participants were required in each group to detect a between-groups effect size (ES) of 0.80 with power of 80%.</p><p>Participants applied online to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.virtualclinic.org.au">www.virtualclinic.org.au</ext-link> after reading details about the study, including the eligibility criteria for inclusion as follows: (i) aged over 18, (ii) self-identified as suffering from panic attacks or panic disorder, and with scores on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale Self-Report version (PDSS-SR) above clinical threshold (8 or higher), (iii) prepared to provide name, phone number and address, and the name and address of their local general practitioner and (iv) had access to a phone, computer and printer.

Seventy-five applicants were excluded after completing initial online screening questions. One hundred and three applicants met the online selection criteria, provided informed consent and then participated in a brief phone interview. Trained interviewers administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI)<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> to confirm whether the applicant met DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Thirty-six individuals were excluded after telephone interview, leaving 67 applicants who met inclusion criteria and were randomised. Random numbers were generated using a computer random number generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link>) by a team member who was not involved in the study; this team member placed the group allocation numbers in a sealed opaque envelope. Group allocation was therefore concealed from the interviewer until the offer of participation was made, and the interviewer opened the sealed envelope to inform the participant of their allocated group. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of St Vincent&#x02019;s Hospital (Sydney, Australia) (HREC 08/SVH/36), and the trial was registered as ACTRN12611001120965.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Participant flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjporcpsych001826-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="S20002"><title>Diagnostic assessment</title><p>The MINI panic disorder and agoraphobia modules were administered to assess DSM-IV diagnoses of panic disorder and agoraphobia.

A similar pattern was observed on reduction in general psychological distress, though there was not continued reduction in symptoms between post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced within the iCBT group at post-treatment. There was also significantly reduced disability in the iCBT group compared with the waiting list control group at post-treatment, along with reduced neuroticism. The waiting list control group did not improve on any symptom measure from pre- to post-treatment. These results suggest that the Panic Program is efficacious for producing sustained reduction in panic symptoms and associated distress, with improvements in comorbid depressive symptoms and neuroticism. The results also indicate that iCBT for panic disorder reduces the functional impairment experienced by patients with this disabling disorder.</p><p>The efficacy of the Panic Program is consistent with our prior research showing the utility of a six-lesson iCBT programme for panic.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It is also consistent with prior research from other groups, which has established the efficacy of iCBT for panic disorder and agoraphobia.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The large within-group and between-group ESs observed in the current study on panic symptoms, general distress symptoms and disability compare favourably with our previous study and are consistent with findings from other research groups.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This is despite the briefer five-lesson format than the six-lesson format we used previously.

Although our results diverge from those of van Ballegooijen <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> who found no significant impact of iCBT on reducing panic symptoms in their RCT, this may reflect milder pre-treatment panic symptom severity in their treatment group (mean PDSS-SR of 8.8) compared with the present study (mean PDSS-SR of 13.0). The time spent by clinicians during the treatment period was minimal (average 4&#x02013;6 min per patient, with the majority of time spent emailing participants), and lower than the time spent in other previous RCTs per participant (e.g. mean of 75 min per participant).<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The adherence rate of 63% was less than observed (79%) in the previous RCT that we conducted on the six-lesson version of the Panic Program.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A potential explanation may be reduced duration of therapist time per participant during this programme (4&#x02013;6 min on average) compared with our previous RCT (75 min on average). Therapist contact has been noted previously to enhance treatment compliance<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>; therefore, additional therapist contact may have enhanced adherence in this programme.</p><p>We note the following limitations. The sample size was small; therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. There was no active control condition, so we cannot rule out whether the superior effects of the Panic Program in this study were due to non-specific therapeutic factors of participating in some form of active psychological treatment (the &#x02018;trial effect&#x02019;).<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Third, we had difficulty contacting participants at follow-up. This meant that we were not able to determine the diagnostic status of the majority of participants at follow-up. Also, assessors of 3-month follow-up diagnostic status were not masked to group allocation, which may have introduced biased assessments. Finally, this study was completed in the context of a strictly controlled rigorous clinical trial setting, and it is unclear how generalisable these results are to patients who complete internet CBT under the supervision of clinicians in &#x02018;real world&#x02019; community settings, and in primary care.

THISWAYUP Clinic is an online treatment clinic for depression and anxiety. There are currently six validated online six-lesson CBT programmes available on the website: depression, GAD, social phobia, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and mixed anxiety and depression. At the end of the programme evaluation period in this study, there were 3991 clinicians who were registered to use the website, and the majority are in primary care (89.8%, with medical specialists comprising the remaining 10.2%). Of these clinicians, 1118 are active users of the service. Registered clinicians provide their patient with a written prescription for an iCBT programme that tells the patient how to enrol and provides a secure passcode linking the patient to the supervising clinician. Patients complete a K-10, a diagnosis-independent measure of psychological distress,<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> prior to the commencement of each lesson. Automated emails are sent to the patient&#x02019;s supervising clinician once (a) the patient has completed a lesson (the email includes a lesson-by-lesson summary of the K-10 scores) (b) if the patient&#x02019;s score on the K-10 rises 0.5 s.d. between lessons, (c) if their K-10 score rises above 30 (severe range) or (d) if patients miss their nominated lesson date.</p><p>As providers of the programmes, we have responsibility to ensure that the course runs as intended and the current study was conducted as part of the routine quality assurance activities of the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (CRUfAD) at St Vincent&#x02019;s Hospital, Sydney. All measures are routine and required for the safe conduct of this programme. Prior to enrolment in any of the THISWAYUP programmes, all individuals provided electronic informed consent that their pooled data could be collated and used for quality assurance research purposes, as per the following. &#x02018;Data are collected on your progress for quality assurance purposes, namely alerting your clinician as to your progress and, when pooled with scores from other patients, informing us of the effectiveness of the course.

Secondary reduction in general psychological distress, depressive symptoms and disability was also observed. The ES of symptom change was moderate for panic symptoms and large for general psychological distress symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest that online CBT for panic can be effectively delivered in a primary care setting. The majority of treatment completers reported panic symptoms below the clinical threshold following the programme, even when above this threshold at pre-treatment. These effectiveness findings converge with previous research that has shown the utility of such a treatment approach in a psychiatric setting<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and in primary care.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Overall adherence (i.e. completing all lessons in the Panic Program) was 56%. It is interesting that increasing number of clinician contacts during the course predicted better adherence in the programme, whereas high initial psychological distress predicted poorer adherence. It may be a good practice then for the primary care clinicians to make brief regular contact with programme participants to facilitate their completion, particularly with patients showing higher pre-treatment distress.</p><p>It is unclear why there was a larger reduction in panic symptoms for participants when supervised by general practitioners compared with psychologists and other allied health providers. It may be that more complex cases are referred to psychologists and allied health clinicians who then show more modest improvement in the Panic Program. However, this is speculative and requires further research.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the inability to measure frequency (though we could determine the number of lessons after which patients received at least one clinician contact), duration and type of clinician contact with patients, meaning the impact of these factors on treatment adherence and symptomatic change could not be determined. Moreover, the lack of a control group means we cannot rule out symptomatic improvement for non-treatment-related reasons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0008"><title>Discussion</title><p>These studies demonstrate the efficacy of internet-based CBT for treating panic disorder compared with waiting list controls and its effectiveness in a real-world primary care setting. There was a significant, meaningful and enduring reduction in panic symptoms as well as observed reductions in psychological distress, depressive symptoms and global disability. These findings converge with previous RCTs, effectiveness studies and systematic reviews demonstrating the utility of internet-based treatment of panic disorder.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Adherence findings from both studies also appear to converge to support the utility of therapist contact for facilitating treatment completion. Both the lower adherence in the primary care setting (where we often anecdotally observe less frequent clinician contact than in our research trials) compared with the RCT setting and the positive association between primary care clinician contact and adherence are consistent with this. It is also consistent with the relatively lower adherence in the present RCT compared with one that we conducted previously in which there was longer average clinician contact time per participant. As such, we continue to recommend brief regular participant contact to facilitate treatment completion.</p><p>In addition to study limitations addressed in previous sections, we note the following limitations. Self-selection bias may have been present in both studies. This is inherent in the voluntary nature of the RCT, but may also be present in the effectiveness study, which may have over-represented those patients more oriented to internet-based treatment. Also, we did not measure change in agoraphobia symptoms in the programme so cannot speak to the utility of the current programme in reducing agoraphobic symptom severity.</p><p>In summary, our findings from both an RCT and effectiveness study in primary care suggest that our iCBT programme for panic disorder (the &#x02018;Panic Program&#x02019;) is both acceptable and effective in reducing symptoms of panic disorder, as well as comorbid depression, distress and functional impairment. However, adherence differs depending on clinician guidance and treatment setting (clinical trial <italic>v</italic>. primary care). In future, greater emphasis needs to be placed on educating primary care practitioners to support patients through online CBT, to improve adherence and outcomes of iCBT in routine clinical care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>To view a demonstration of the lesson content of a similar programme, please contact: <email>research@thiswayupclinic.org</email></p></fn></fn-group><sec id="s0009"><title>Funding</title><p>J.M.N. is supported by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Fellowship (1037787).
