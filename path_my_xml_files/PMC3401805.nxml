Furthermore, the success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after toxic doses of levobupicaine is higher compared to bupivacaine intoxication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>There is a relative paucity of studies describing the use of levobupivacaine 0.5% for the standard peribulbar block (PB) or for superficial extraconal anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> The majority of patients undergoing cataract surgery are elderly and have several co-morbidities. Hence the use of anesthetics with the potential for reduced cardiovascular and neurologic toxicity is strongly desirable in these patients.</p><p>In this study we examined the efficacy and blocking quality of 0.5% levobupivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine for superficial extraconal anesthesia in combination with lidocaine 2% and hyaluronidase 5 IU/ml for patients undergoing phacoemulsification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval for this randomized, double blind study was granted from the local Institutional Research and Human Ethics committees. All patients signed a written informed consent. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA I-III). Exclusion criteria included patients with history of allergy to amide anesthetic or hyaluronidase, with local sepsis, serious impairment of coagulation, orbital abnormalities, monocular patients, history of previous surgery in the study eye, and nystagmus. Patients with a history of long term use of benzodiazepines and/or opiates, presence of neurological disorders which might have affected their level of anxiety or pain threshold, uncooperative or extremely anxious patients and those with communication problems (language barrier, impaired hearing) were also excluded from the study.</p><p>On the day of the surgery, patients were asked to fast for 6 h and were premedicated with 1 to 2 tablets of Revacod (Paracetamol 500 mg + Codeine 10 mg) (The Arab Pharmaceuticals Manufac. Co, Jordan) and hydroxyzine one and half hour before the procedure. In the preoperative holding area, standard monitoring (pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and non-invasive blood pressure) was performed, an intravenous cannula was placed and ocular motility in the major directions of gaze was assessed. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups (75 patients each) by random numbers picked by induction room nurse who was blind to the study.</p><p>Superficial extraconal anesthesia was performed by insertion of 15 mm long needle (Becton Dickinson, BD Microlance 3, Benelux, Belgium) through the lower eyelid, as far laterally as possible in the inferotemporal quadrant just above the inferior orbital notch. The needle was inserted until its hub reached the orbital rim. Digital pressure was applied with the thumb and index fingers around the needle hub during injection. The purpose was to obliterate the lower eyelid space and promote the posterior spread of the anesthetic. After negative aspiration, patients received local anesthetics of either levobupivacaine 0.5% (group 1) or bupivacaine 0.5% (group 2), both in a mixture of lidocaine 2% in 3:2 volume ratio (Astra Sodertalje, Sweden) with hyaluronidase 5 units/ml (CP Pharmaceutical Ltd, Wrexham, United Kingdom) as an adjuvant to increase the absorption and spread of the mixture. An initial volume of 6 to 9 ml was injected until total drop of the upper eyelid, which was used as an endpoint mark.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> This was immediately followed by application of a Honan's balloon at a cuff pressure of 30 mm Hg.</p><p>Simple akinesia score was used to assess eyeball movement at 2, 5, and 10 min by an anesthesiologist who was masked to the kind of medications delivered to the eye. The score involved the assessment of eye movement in four major directions of gaze (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral). Normal movement in each direction was graded 2, reduced movement graded 1, and flickering or total akinesia, graded zero. Thus, the score ranged from 0&#x02013;8.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> If the akinesia score was 3 or higher, a supplementary injection of 3 to 5 ml was delivered using the same mixture of medication either medially or supero-nasally depending on the site of residual movement.</p><p>If a patient experienced pain intraoperatively, supplementary topical anesthetic (tetracaine HCL 1%) (Laboratoire Chauvin, Z.I. Ripotier Haut, Aubenas-France) was instilled by the surgeon. At the end of the procedure, surgeons who were masked to the medications used for superficial extraconal anesthesia were requested to rate their satisfaction with the block quality (0 = absolutely not satisfied to 10 = totally satisfied). Patients who were also masked to the type of medication used, were requested to rate the degree of pain on verbal pain scale (VPS) (0 = no pain to 10 = most severe pain) immediately after the block, at the end of the procedures and before discharge (4 h postoperatively).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results were analyzed using SPSS version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1.2 software (Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany) indicated that 75 patients in each group were required based on 0.5 differences in the mean final akinesia score between groups. The type-I error was set at 0.05 and type-II error was set at 0.20. Numerical data such as means and standard deviations were analyzed using unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test.

There were no statistically significant differences in akinesia score, anesthetic supplementation, pain, and surgeon's or patient's satisfaction between the groups.</p><p>The outcome of our study concurs with other similar studies. Birt and Cummings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> reported similar efficacy of 0.75% levobupivacaine and 0.75% bupivacaine, both mixed with hyluronidase or peribulbar anesthesia. They<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> did not use the study drug in a mixture with lidocaine as we did and they used a longer needle (31 mm) with 5 ml primary volume. We rather used a relatively diluted drug concentration of 0.5% with a shorter needle (15 mm). However, Lai <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> found that a mixture of bupivacaine 0.75% and lidocaine 2% provided better akinesia than a mixture of levobupivacaine 0.75% and lidocaine 2% but in our study akinesia at 10 min did not differ from previous studies that used longer needles for injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Hence anterior injection of anesthetics improves safety without decreasing the block quality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>In this study, the need for supplemental injection to achieve adequate anesthesia was similar between the two groups. Similar results were reported for retrobulbar and PBs when comparing different concentrations of levobupivacaine to bupivacaine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Some patients experienced mild pain during the injection of local anesthetic but trivial pain was reported at the end of the procedure and before discharge. There was no difference in subjective pain between groups. These outcomes are similar to a study by Borazan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> who reported no difference in verbal pain scale between patients using a mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% orlevobupivacaine 0.75% perioperatively. Additionally, Birt and Cummings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> demonstrated no differences in pain between 0.75% levobupivacaine and 0.75% bupivacaine on injection, postoperative pain and time required for the first postoperative analgesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> However, Aksu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> reported that pain during injection and after the surgical procedure was lower with 0.5% levobupivacaine compared to 0.5% bupivacaine and 2% lidocaine. This difference could be attributed to differences in the study population. In our study, 24% of patients required supplementary injections. The incidence of PBs requiring supplementary anesthesia has been reported to be as high as 54%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> This may lead to the possibility of administering higher volume of local anesthetic solution with increase risk of toxicity. Blocking with levobupivacaine will have theoretical advantage in this situation, especially in patients having cardiovascular disease.</p><p>We found a good level of surgeon's and patient's satisfaction that did not differ between groups. Di Donato <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> found no difference in patient's/surgeon's satisfaction between 0.5% levobupivacaine and 0.75% ropivacaine when peribulbar anesthesia was performed with 19 mm long needle. Alternately, Aksu <italic>et al</italic>. reported better surgeon's/patient's satisfaction in a levobupivacaine-treated group compared to a bupivacaine-treated group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>Clinically, it seems that both bupivacaine and levobupivacaine are being providing satisfactory conditions to perform surgery, with a similar clinical profile in dosages used to produce surgical anesthesia. The outcome of this study indicates that levobupivacaine has a clinical profile similar to racemic bupivacaine, and that the minimal differences observed between the two agents could be related to the slightly different anesthetic potency.</p><p>In conclusion superficial extraconal block with a mixture of levobupivicaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% or bupivicaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% provides similar block quality and efficacy for phacoemulsification. As levobupivicaine has a theoretical advantage of having better safety profile, it is better to be given preference over bupivicaine to improve patient safety, especially in elderly patients with co-existing cardiovascular disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
