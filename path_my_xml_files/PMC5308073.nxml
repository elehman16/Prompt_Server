A facilitator who was blinded to the groups explained the basic concepts and detailed process of CBL. Since the interns previously had knowledge regarding hyperplasia, they were asked to answer a pretest questionnaire comprising questions related to their knowledge of hyperplastic tissue in complete denture patients. This study was conducted in two time periods, wherein the first phase interns were randomly allocated into three subgroups of seven each for thorough discussion. In the second phase, eight interns of three groups were divided. Each group could view the entire case scenario, but the outcomes were divided among three groups. Each group worked on their own part, and at the end, all the three groups presented their findings to the facilitator. This presentation was performed by a group leader. The facilitator discussed the subject with the three subgroups. The case scenario and the questions are shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="App1">Appendix 1</xref>.</p><p>A post-test was conducted immediately with the same knowledge questions, and the results were compared with the pretest. The facilitator at the end of the session gave an explanation about hyperplastic tissue with an audio-visual aid after the post-test was administered.

Student-centered education has recently been introduced in India, and the effectiveness of such method needs to be tested, especially for the Indian scenario. There are few studies on student's acceptance for this new method of learning. Only three studies could be traced in literature related to CBL in prosthodontics in India. The present discussion has not included the two studies as they had used computer software to impart teaching. Hence, the present study was carried out with an aim to know the effectiveness of CBL in enhancing the knowledge of dental interns in Bharati Vidyapeeth Dental College and Hospital, Sangli, India. The study group was interns as they are in between the thin line of cross-over to general practice and are preparing themselves to deal with patients more effectively. The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year students are also having exposure to this topic covered for the study, but the lack of experience and tighter schedule of curriculum in these years refrained them to be a part of the study.</p><p>Although the past academic performance of the study participants was not considered, their performance in clinics in the department of prosthodontics was used as the criterion for taking these interns. The number of cases performed by these interns was almost similar; however, more objective assessment criteria should have been productive. As CBL is effective only for small group teachings, only 45 interns were recruited for the study. The facilitator was a subject expert with training in CBL method of teaching and hence calibration was not deemed necessary. Moreover, students were not sensitized to such learning.</p><p>The present study dealt with a single content area (hyperplasia) delivered in one dental institute in India. Hyperplasia was chosen as the topic for CBL to test students' application of knowledge regarding the choice of impression material and the impression technique to be employed in such situations.</p><p>In the present study, the knowledge scores showed an improvement post-CBL in all domains except one. A study by Gali <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] concluded that case-oriented small group discussions are effective to help students correlate the science of dental materials into clinical application. The results of the present study are in agreement with those of Du <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who found that CBL was more effective than lecture-based education (LBE) to teach dental students as the test scores of the CBL group were significantly higher than those of the LBE group. They suggested that CBL should be added in the future curriculum for dental students. The results of the present study are also in line with those of McKenzie[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] according to whom the case-based education course was found to have positively affected students' knowledge.</p><p>When the response of the interns related to their perception to CBL was analyzed, most of the interns perceived CBL to stimulate study interest, help understand basic concept, promote communication with students, extend more related knowledge, enlighten students during interaction with tutor, and facilitate to solve clinical problem. The positive perception of interns could be due to exposure for the first time of a newer teaching method having a supportive and informal environment which encourages students to give their inputs and ideas along with more time spent on individual cases which may not be feasible in clinics. The results of the present study are consistent with those of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who concluded that CBL is an effective method to improve students' clinical reasoning, diagnosis, and logic thinking. Chan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that CBL improved communication through group discussion.</p><p>CBL depends on both construction of cases and facilitators' skill.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] There is a wide diversity reported in the literature according to the speciality, type of cases, number and length of exposure to cases, and definition of the cases in case-based studies.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The intervention duration reported varied from two hours for one case to CBL for 1 year.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Most of the literatures documented are in the field of medicine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Ciraj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] indicated that CBL sessions enhanced active learning in microbiology. According to Nair <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] CBL is effective for better understanding of biochemistry among medical students. Although CBL has been a concept which is well developed and practiced in medical curriculum, the evidence showing the use of CBL in prosthodontics in India is scant.</p><p>CBL stimulates students' interest, so it can be easily incorporated as an aid in effective evidence-based education system and in turn evidence-based clinical practice. In India, we stress &#x0201c;Critical thinking&#x0201d; at a postgraduate level. If we incorporate it at the undergraduate level, it would contribute to better understanding. Studies have shown that CBL may be a good adjunct to traditional lectures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] CBL can also be used for early clinical exposure. Implementation of CBL phase wise in the curriculum can be considered by the professional bodies. Orientation and training programs should be conducted for the faculty to sensitize and implement different teaching approaches to stimulate higher order thinking among the learners in prosthodontics.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study was an initial step in evaluating the effectiveness of CBL in prosthodontics. CBL proved to be effective in enhancing the knowledge of dental interns. The interns had a positive response to the use of CBL as teaching method. At the time of clinical postings, CBL can be incorporated as this would facilitate learning at a higher level.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Gunnar Carlsson, Dr. K Chandrasekharan Nair, Dr. Satish Babu, Dr. Gopichander, Dr. Suresh Sajjan, and Dr. Raghavendra Adaki for their inputs in the questionnaire.
