Laparoscopic surgical techniques have been rapidly accepted by surgeons worldwide with published reports describing the benefit of less postoperative pain, decreased hospital stay and earlier return to work.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Minimally invasive therapy is done with the general aim to minimize the trauma of interventional process whilst still achieving satisfactory result.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy under regional anesthesia alone has been reported only occasionally in the past; these reports included patients unfit to receive general anesthesia, mainly patients with severe chronic obstructive airway disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Hamad and Ibrahim El-Khattary[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] used spinal anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the first time in a small series of healthy patients but they had used nitrous oxide as a pneumoperitoneum instead of standard carbon dioxide. Recently, it has been shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done successfully using carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum under spinal anesthesia in healthy patients with symptomatic gallstone disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Also, the incidence of postoperative morbidity like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, respiratory complication, thromboembolism and pneumonia was much less as compared to general anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Also, the total cost of spinal anesthesia with respect to hospital stay, induction and recovery, the need for postoperative antiemetics and analgesia and the incidence of other complication was much lower when compared to general anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we compared spinal anesthesia with general anesthesia, the gold standard uptil now, in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in healthy American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1 and 2 patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A study was carried out in 60 patients of either sex, undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy using spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia between the academic years March 2009 and July 2010, after taking informed consent under medical ethics. Patients of age between 18 and 60 years with ASA physical status I and II were included in the study. The patients with ASA grade III and IV high risk patients, all emergency procedures, bleeding disorders, acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis and acute cholangitis, previous open surgery in upper abdomen, contraindication for pneumoperitoneum, cardiovascular disorders, respiratory disorders, renal disease and liver disease, circulatory instability, and patients with known sensitivity to local anesthetics were excluded from the study.</p><p>All the patients were examined to assess their preoperative condition, demographic data and routine investigations which were recorded in brief. The patients were divided into two groups of 30 each: group A receiving general anesthesia and group B receiving spinal anesthesia.</p><p>After taking the patients to the operation theater, an intravenous line was secured in the right upper limb and infusion of 500 ml of Ringer's Lactate solution started. Blood pressure cuff, ECG electrode and capnography monitor were applied. The initial pulse, blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, ECG and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) were noted. All the patients were premeditated with Inj. Glycopyrrolate 4 mcg/kg, Inj. Midazolam 0.02 mg/kg and Inj. Ondensetron 0.08 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.).</p><p>In patients randomized for spinal anesthesia, the patient was first made to lie in supine position and all the monitors were attached. Oxygen was then administered through ventimask at 3 l/minute. Then the patient was made to lie in left lateral decubitus position. A 25-G Quincke spinal needle was introduced in subarachnoid space at L3&#x02013;L4 interspace under all aseptic and antiseptic precautions. After confirming free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, 0.3 mg/kg of hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% was injected intrathecally in cephalad direction at a velocity of 0.1 ml/second. Then, after keeping the patient in the 15&#x000b0; Trendelenberg position for 5 minutes, the patient was again made to lie in a supine position. Approximately 10 minutes after intrathecal injection, the level of analgesia was checked. During this period, 500 ml of 0.9% Ringer's Lactate was infused. A segmental sensory (pin-prick) block, extending between T4 and L5 dermatomes, was obtained without any respiratory distress.</p><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using the same techniques in both the groups with standard 4 trocar insertion. After painting and draping, Inj. Bupivacaine plain (0.2%) 20 ml was injected subcostally under diaphragm equally on both sides in both the groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Pneumoperitoneum was established by using the open (Hassen) technique with carbon dioxide at maximum intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mm Hg. Intraoperatively, the patients randomly allocated to general anesthesia group received fentanyl citrate 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg i.v. as an adjuvant while those allocated to spinal anesthesia group were given 25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g i.v. as bolus and when required. All the patients were monitored continuously both for clinical observation and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring like electrocardiography, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oxymetry and EtCO<sub>2</sub> which were recorded at 15 minute interval. Operative times as well as any intraoperative events such as shoulder pain, headache, nausea, and discomfort were recorded.</p><p>Postoperative pain was assessed at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) after completion of procedure. Other postoperative events, either related to surgical or especially to anesthetic procedure, such as discomfort, nausea and vomiting, shoulder pain, urinary retention, pruritus, headache and other neurological sequel, were recorded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>None of the patients withdrew their consent and there was no conversion to open cholecystectomy.</p><p>Demographic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and were similar in both the groups.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-4-91-g001"/></table-wrap><p>All the procedures were completed within the allocated method of anesthesia and there was no conversion of spinal to general anesthesia.

Pain assessed throughout any time in the postoperative period during the patients&#x02019; hospital stay was significantly lesser in spinal group as compared to general anaesthesia group, which is due to residual analgesic effect of local anesthetic in subarachnoid space and decrease in discomfort due to avoidance of general anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Pain relief, an important component for rapid and smooth recovery, was seen in spinal anesthesia group.</p><p>Intraoperatively, two things were noted &#x02013; hypotension and pain/discomfort in right shoulder in the spinal group. Hypotension is due to sympathetic blockade and mechanical effect of pneumoperitoneum, while pain and discomfort over right shoulder can be attributed to diaphragmatic irritation from pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide. Most of this was managed without drugs, i.e., reassurance to the patient, massage of the right shoulder, keeping the intra-abdominal pressure to 12 mm Hg, avoiding excessive tilting of table and thereby minimizing diaphragmatic irritation. In our study, diaphragmatic irritation was much less as there was subcostal instillation of Inj. Bupivacaine plain (0.2%) 10 ml each on both sides just prior to incision. Sometimes, this diaphragmatic irritation is so severe that there may be conversion of the procedure to general anesthesia. The use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum was adequate, especially with spinal group, as spinal anesthesia causes high level of motor, sensory and sympathetic blockade and thereby good abdominal muscle relaxation as compared to general anesthesia.</p><p>In group A, the initial increase in pulse rate and BP after peritoneal insufflations are due to both mechanical and neurohumoral effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The return of pulse rate and BP to normal baseline was gradual. In group B, there was little variation in pulse and BP after peritoneal insufflation as spinal anesthesia tends to decrease the pulse and BP, while the neurohumoral and mechanical effects of pneumoperitoneum tend to increase them. After several minutes, the neurohumoral and mechanical effects are compensated so that there is slight decrease in the pulse rate and BP. The decrease in pulse rate and BP in group B as compared to group A can be explained as due to decrease in pain caused by residual analgesic effect of local anesthetic in subarachnoid space.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting are particularly troublesome after laparoscopic surgery; over 50% of patients required antiemetics, so prophylactic antiemetics had been given routinely. Regarding the postoperative complications, nausea, vomiting and dizziness were more common with general anesthesia due to intubation of trachea and intravenous drugs.</p><p>As spinal anesthesia is a regional block, there is less procedure-related cost and hospital stay because of less postoperative pain and complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this controlled, randomized, prospective study, in which a comparison of spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia in otherwise healthy laparoscopic patients was done, we observed that spinal anesthesia was better than general anesthesia in terms of postoperative pain relief. Secondly, spinal anesthesia was better in terms of hospital stay, cost, nausea and vomiting and procedure-related satisfaction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
