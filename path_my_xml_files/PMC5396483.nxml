Considering
this, a study revealed that 30% of the population of the metropolitan area of S&#x000e3;o Paulo
suffered from some kind of mental disorder. Among the most common problems identified in
the study were anxiety, behavioral changes and substance abuse. Anxiety was present in
20% of the respondents. The study confirmed a greater prevalence of mental disorders in
adults in S&#x000e3;o Paulo than those of similar study conduct in other area of the world<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Although the individual clinical and sociocultural factors need to be considered,
contextual factors inevitably have a heavy impact on the development of mental problems.
Among these, the economic crisis and rising unemployment levels can certainly contribute
to a sense of general and collective insecurity<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. Brazil is experiencing a chaotic historical moment regarding political,
economic, ethical and social aspects, with a tragic legacy of a driving motion of the
economy that has acquired an astonishing rhythm of unbalance and overload over the past
four years. The result of government intervention in the economy associated with
corruption has caused increased inflation, credit restriction, closure of businesses and
rising unemployment, coupled with a lack of faith of the population in relation to the
government<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo had a population of 11,581,798 inhabitants in 2015 and is
considered the largest city in the country and in South America<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. In addition to the current economic and political developments, the process of
rapid expansion and urbanization is an aggravating factor for the welfare of the
residents, contributing to increased social insecurity, creating urban environmental
problems and irregular settlements and prejudicing the quality of life<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. This climate of dissatisfaction and personal and collective insecurity is the
background of this study, which was carried out with the nursing staff of a large
general hospital in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, with an average of 3,500 Nursing professionals, many of
whom lived in neighborhoods a long distance from the workplace.</p><p>Nursing workers represent one of the groups of professionals most susceptible to present
health problems at work, as they perform complex tasks involving a high physical and
mental workload<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Other factors potentiate damage to their physical and mental integrity, causing
pain and anxiety, such as: lack of personal protective equipment, dissatisfaction
related to working conditions, low wages, difficult interpersonal relationships, lack of
trust between professionals and management, and physical and emotional exhaustion due to
caring for patients with pain and suffering. All this generates increased rates of
absenteeism<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In anticipation of proposing a preventive treatment to reduce levels of anxiety and pain
in the nursing staff, the use of auriculotherapy has been proposed as a complementary
and preventive practice. This proposal sought to test a protocol organized by
researchers at the Northern College of Acupuncture, UK, coordinated by Hugh Mackpearson,
professor and researcher of the University of York, for the formulation of a protocol
for pain and anxiety (The Auricular Protocol for Pain &#x00026; Anxiety - APPA), created by
Karen Charlesworth. Having participated as a specialist in auricular acupuncture for the
creation of the protocol with 30 other experts from other countries, in the period from
June to July 2014, the idea emerged of holding the first protocol trial in a hospital in
Brazil, with a Nursing team. The protocol was previously created for people living in
situations of danger, conflict, disaster and poverty<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>While it was recognized that the scope of auricular technique can be greater when
performed in an individualized way that does not follow a protocol and by professionals
with theoretical and practical knowledge of diagnoses<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, the possibility of using a protocol assists in the dissemination and
popularization of the art, with the aim of benefiting more people. It should also be
noted that auriculotherapy has important advantages, being easily administered, very
rapid, relatively inexpensive, achievable with non-invasive materials and presenting
minimal adverse side effects<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the auricular
protocol for pain and anxiety (APPA) and improving the quality of life of nursing staff
of a hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This was a parallel-group randomized controlled trial conducted in the Benefic&#x000ea;ncia
Portuguese Hospital of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, from June 2015 to February 2016. A total of 193
nursing staff employees were initially contacted and 180 people who presented high or
moderate levels of anxiety, according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (over 33
points), were invited to participate. Pregnant women, subjects who would go on vacation
and those taking sick leave during the survey period were excluded, as were those that
started using allopathic medication for anxiety or antidepressants, those that initiated
other energy therapies during the study period and those that were allergic to metal or
adhesive tape. However, those that were undergoing psychological therapy at this moment
were not excluded, with the proviso that the treatment continued normally.</p><p>The sample size of 120 individuals was originally proposed for a test power of 80% and a
95% confidence interval. The eligible population obtained was 180 subjects and 133
completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), with a loss of 47
(26.11%) individuals.</p><p>

</p><p>A total of 22 people missed at least two sequential sessions in a week due to sector
rotation or sequential days off; 15 did not attend the second evaluation or did not turn
up to respond to the questionnaires (control); five went on medical leave during the
study period, three took holidays, one person stopped working for the hospital and one
gave up due to feeling pain at the zero point, which is a point located in the center of
the ear between the two shells, about the root of the helix.</p><p>For the allocation of the individuals, a random division was made into four groups,
using the Research Randomizer program (available at http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm):
Control - G1 (without intervention) Auriculotherapy with seeds - G2, Auriculotherapy
with semi-permanent needles - G3, and Auriculotherapy with adhesive tape - G4 (placebo).
The treatment consisted of ten twice weekly sessions for five weeks, which were
performed in the sector where the professional worked, during the work time, with
duration of 5 to 10 minutes. The protocol used was the beta version of the Auricular
Protocol for Pain &#x00026; Anxiety - APPA: using the Shenmen, tranquilizer, thalamus,
autonomic system or sympathetic points and the zero point, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. The protocol was applied unilaterally in
each session.</p><p>

</p><p>After the location of the reactive points with a manual probe, the cleaning of the ear
with cotton and 70% ethyl alcohol was performed, followed by the application of the
different materials: seeds, semi-permanent needles and non-allergenic adhesive tape at
the same points. The needles remained in place for two days, if there was no discomfort.
For the seeds, the subjects were instructed to stimulate them 15 times, at least three
times a day.</p><p>The therapists (n = 5) were health professionals, one psychologist and four nurses,
trained in auriculotherapy by the Institute of Integrated and Eastern Therapy. All
participants completed a biosociodemographic questionnaire and the instruments:
Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>, Visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain and SF-12v2 Quality of life<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>, applied at the beginning, after five sessions and at the end of ten
sessions.</p><p>The study fulfilled the requirements of resolution 466/12 of the National Council of
Health Ethics of Brazil for research involving human subjects, and all the subjects
signed the consent form. Participants in the Control and Adhesive Tape groups were
offered the opportunity to receive auriculotherapy after completion of the study. The
research project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing
of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (No. 1.105.429), by the Committee of the Hospital and was
registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (No. RBR-5pc43m).</p><p>For the descriptive analysis of the data, measures of central tendency and absolute and
relative frequencies were used, with the repeated measures ANOVA used to compare the
groups. Also Cohen's d index was used to measure the effect size and the percentage of
change in the three moments (before, after 5 and after 10 sessions).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the participants was 35.7 years (&#x000b1; 8.4), 84.2% (n = 112) were female,

</p><p>Only one person withdrew from the study due to pain with the needles. Other people who
felt pain continued in the trial. The adhesive tape group did not function as a placebo,
as the participants were not blinded and it also did not produce any effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The best result for reducing state anxiety was produced by the auriculotherapy with
needles. Similarly, in a study conducted in a university hospital, there was a greater
reduction of stress by auriculotherapy with needles compared to that with seeds, using
the Shenmen, Kidney and Brainstem points. Unlike seeds, needles do not need to be
stimulated, however, may produce local pain and run a risk of infection. Even with lower
results, there is an advantage in the use of seeds as they produce less discomfort<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> and can be applied by people only trained for the protocols. In this regard, the
first test of the APPA protocol in Nepal obtained positive results after the earthquake
that devastated the country in 2015<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Crisis situations compromise the mental health and the usefulness of the APPA was only
observed with regards to anxiety, perhaps because the pain level was not an inclusion
criterion for the present study. Each auricular protocol has a pathophysiological
rational, which often aims to approximate the Western knowledge with the Eastern, and
also considers the perception that the researchers have about the phenomenon of
traumatic situations. In this sense, starting from a more Eastern assumption, the NADA
(The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association) protocol has been developed to
reduce stress and alleviate trauma in communities suffering from disasters or conflicts.
It was previously developed for the well-being of communities, mental health and the
control of drug abuse and smoking, among other conditions<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. Acupuncturists Without Borders, in 2005, used the NADA protocol in the
aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and many other disasters in the USA<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. The points common to both protocols are the Shenmen and Sympathetic or
Autonomic points.</p><p>Regarding the APPA protocol, the most painful point reported was the Zero point, when
using semi-permanent needles. There was no reported discomfort in relation to the other
points. The Zero point was used postoperatively in another study, as a regulator of the
autonomic nervous system and of parasympathetic activity, together with the Shenmen
point, with positive results based on the analysis of heart rate variability<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Auriculotherapy points for anxiety were evaluated in 14 articles, with the Shenmen
(64.3%) and Relaxation (28.6%) points being the most used. Other points used for
emotional problems were: Brainstem, Master Cerebral, Heart, <italic>Valium</italic> or
Tranquilizer, Sympathetic and Endocrine<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Auriculotherapy has also been studied as a less invasive method of vagus nerve
stimulation for the treatment of patients resistant to therapy, with disorders such as
depression and epilepsy. A trial used stimulation of the inferior concha achieving
positive results with electro-stimulation. This area shows neuroanatomical evidence of
vagal afferents(19). The Shenmen, in the triangular fossa, is a region innervated by a
branch of the vagus nerve, with anti-inflammatory and calming actions<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The APPA produced a reduction in the level of pain of 36% with needles and 24% with
seeds. Specific points for musculoskeletal or visceral pain were not used, opting for
the use of general points, such as the Shenmen, Thalamus, which are indicated for pain.
It is in the thalamus that painful information is located and projected to the
structures of the limbic, motor and cortical systems. Thus, the painful impulse reaches
the limbic system, carrying the experience as something unpleasant and emotional,
resulting in the interpretation of pain<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. Other studies with the APPA protocol have suggested the evaluation of the
effects on pain and the investigation of whether more complementary points may
eventually be needed. Mental and physical health are two closely intertwined and
interdependent elements of life and the APPA seeks to influence both aspects. Currently,
the intrinsic and strong relationship between the physical and emotional aspects of
anxiety is recognized and accepted. There is a significant correlation between pain and
symptoms of anxiety and depression, especially chronic pain<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Considering the limitations of the study, it was not possible to ensure the proper
participation of the subjects who were treated with seeds, as the seeds need to be
pressed to achieve better results. As it is important for the APPA Protocol that the
auriculotherapy is made with non-invasive materials, further studies with other
materials, such as magnets or magnetic crystals, are recommended. The location of the
points was performed manually, without the use of electronic devices or of the
atrio-cardiac reflex proposed in French auriculotherapy for the location of points. The
group with adhesive tape did not function as a placebo, due to failing to blind the
subjects. Perhaps the auriculotherapy with seeds would achieve better results if the
number of participants was greater or if a longer treatment time was used. Other points
could possibly be added or changed in the APPA protocol, in order to intensify its
effect in relation to pain. It is suggested that other studies consider these
aspects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The APPA protocol, when applied with the nursing staff of a hospital in S&#x000e3;o Paulo,
achieved significant positive differences in the reduction of anxiety, according to the
repeated measures ANOVA, after 10 sessions. The group with semi-permanent needles
presented a Cohen's d index of 1.08 (large effect) and 17% reduction. There was a
reduction in pain levels by 34% for the needle group and 24% for the seed group and a
13% increase in the mental domain of SF12v2 quality of life measure, although there was
no statistical differences in the intergroup analysis. Further studies are suggested
with new populations and in different contexts and situations so that the results can be
confirmed. It is also recommended that other auricular points are tested to intensify
the effects in relation to pain.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p><bold>How to cite this article :</bold> Kurebayashi LFS, Turrini RNT, Souza Talita PB, Marques CF, Rodrigues RTF,
