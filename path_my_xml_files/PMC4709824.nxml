In our previous study, we used implicit and explicit measures of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor and found different characteristics. The present study serves to explore further differences and commonalities of these measures. In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of different relative reliabilities of visual and proprioceptive information on the explicitly and implicitly assessed bias of sensed hand direction. In two conditions, participants made an aiming movement and returned to the start position immediately or after a delay of 6 s during which the cursor was no longer visible. The unimodal proprioceptive information on final hand position in the delayed condition served to increase its relative reliability. As a result, the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor was reduced for the explicit measure, with a complementary increase of the bias of sensed cursor direction, but unchanged for the implicit measure. In Experiment 2, we examined the influence of global context, specifically of the across-trial sequence of judgments of hand and cursor direction. Both explicitly and implicitly assessed biases of sensed hand direction did not significantly differ between the alternated condition (trial-to-trial alternations of judgments of hand and cursor direction) and the blocked condition (judgments of hand or cursor directions in all trials). They both substantially decreased from the alternated to the randomized condition (random sequence of judgments of hand and cursor direction), without a complementary increase of the bias of sensed cursor direction. We conclude that our explicit and implicit measures are equally sensitive to variations of coupling strength as induced by the variation of global context in Experiment 2, but are differently sensitive to variations of the relative reliabilities as induced by our additional unimodal proprioceptive information in Experiment 1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aiming</kwd><kwd>tool use</kwd><kwd>sensory coupling</kwd><kwd>implicit measure</kwd><kwd>explicit measure</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Ra 2183/1-3</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="77"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In many tasks, the position of ones&#x02019; own hand can be sensed visually and proprioceptively, and both sources of information are efficiently combined to obtain a single percept of the hand at a certain position (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Van Beers et al., 1999</xref>). In the task of controlling the position of a cursor on a computer monitor, or more generally in tool use, visual and proprioceptive information typically are no longer fully redundant in that visual information refers to the position of the cursor and proprioceptive information to the position of the hand. Thus, the two sensory modalities refer to different objects in different planes of motion. However, there is a systematic relation between the movements of the hand and the motions of the cursor, and this relation could be sufficient to prompt sensory coupling (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ernst, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Parise et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, we observed such coupling in a cursor-control task (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>): hand and cursor were clearly distinct percepts, but when discrepancies between their directions of movement were introduced, the sensed directions became mutually attracted. This mutual attraction was asymmetric in that the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor was stronger than the bias of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of the hand.</p><p>In the present experiments, we explore differences and commonalities between two measures of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor in a cursor-control task. The first measure is based on explicit judgments. After an aiming movement in a particular direction and the return to the start position, participants move their hand along a circular path to its remembered position at the end of aiming. These judgments are psychophysical judgments of the perceived and remembered hand direction that participants are consciously aware of. The deviation of these judgments from the physical direction of the hand serves as an explicit measure of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor. For short, we refer to this measure as explicit measure of hand direction.</p><p>The second measure of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor is implicit in that it is based on the movements of the participants without them being aware of judging the direction of their hand. As detailed in the Methods section, this measure is the angle between the aiming movement and the return movement back to the start position. Its rationale is based on the observation that discrepancies between sensed and physical locations of the hand give rise to systematic errors in subsequent movements (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bock and Eckmiller, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rossetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and Sangals, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Spence, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and S&#x000fc;lzenbr&#x000fc;ck, 2012</xref>). For short, we refer to this measure as implicit measure of hand direction.</p><p>Our exploration of explicit and implicit measures of hand direction is motivated by some findings on visuo-motor adaptation. Visuo-motor adaptation involves both implicit and explicit components (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Mazzoni and Krakauer, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and Hegele, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and S&#x000fc;lzenbr&#x000fc;ck, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Rentsch, 2015</xref>). Whereas the explicit component is reduced at older adult age, the implicit component is generally stable at least until about age 65 (see <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Heuer et al., 2013</xref>, for review). The age-related change of the explicit component turned out to be associated with an age-related decline of the discrimination of the directions of hand movement and concurrent cursor motion (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 2013</xref>), which again was associated with an age-related increase of the explicit measure of the bias of the judged direction of hand movement toward the direction of cursor motion (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>). The implicit measure of the bias, in contrast, remained stable across the age range studied, consistent with the absence of an age-related decline of the implicit component of visuo-motor adaptation.</p><p>In addition to the contrasting age-related changes, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer (2013)</xref> observed other differences between the explicit and implicit measures of sensed hand direction. First, the explicitly measured bias was stronger than the implicitly measured bias. Second, the explicit measure had considerably larger intra-individual variability than the implicit measure. Third, sequential effects of the psychophysical judgment required in each trial (judgment of cursor or hand direction) were different for the explicit and implicit measures of hand direction. Finally, the individual explicitly and implicitly measured biases of sensed hand direction were uncorrelated. The differences between the two measures of bias and the lack of correlation suggest that they are based on different combinations of visual and proprioceptive information (cf. <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Knill, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sober and Sabes, 2005</xref>). In terms of a dichotomy, the explicit and implicit measures might tap different representations of hand position that serve different purposes &#x02013; cognition and motor control, respectively &#x02013; and that are differently accessible by conscious awareness (cf. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Head and Holmes, 1911</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Paillard, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dijkerman and de Haan, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">de Vignemont, 2010</xref>).</p><p>At present, the origin of the differences between the explicit and implicit measures of sensed hand direction is not yet sufficiently clear. They might indeed result from different representations of the position of the hand, which combine proprioceptive information related to the hand and visual information related to the cursor with different relative weights. However, they might also result from a single representation of the position of the hand, with the differences between the two measures being caused by additional factors. As an example, consider the smaller implicit than explicit bias measures. For a certain discrepancy between sensed and physical hand positions at the end of the aiming movements, as indicated by the explicit measure, the directional error of the subsequent return movements might not reflect the full discrepancy, but only a part of it (cf. <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rossetti et al., 1995</xref>). This would be the case if the return movement would not only be coded in terms of amplitude and direction (e.g., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rossetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Vindras and Viviani, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Sainburg, 2005</xref>), but also in terms of the final position (e.g., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kelso and Holt, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt and McGown, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bizzi et al., 1984</xref>) or posture (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Rosenbaum et al., 1995</xref>). For motor memory in particular, both an influence of amplitude and end position has been shown (e.g., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Laabs, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gundry, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Jaric et al., 1994</xref>). An influence of end position coding could account for the smaller implicit than explicit bias measures. For other differences between the two measures, however, accounts that posit only a single representation of hand position and different ways of making use of it are not that obvious.</p><p>The present study was designed to explore further potential differences between the implicitly and explicitly assessed biases of hand direction toward the direction of the cursor in a cursor-control task. Such additional differences would bolster the hypothesis that the implicit and explicit measures tap different representations of hand position. In particular, we examined the effects of varying the relative reliabilities of visual and proprioceptive information (Experiment 1) and the influence of global context, specifically the across-trials arrangement of judgments of hand and cursor direction (Experiment 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Models of sensory integration typically posit a weighted average of different sensory signals, with the weights being adjusted to the reliabilities of the individual signals. This type of integration serves to minimize the variance of the multimodal estimates (cf. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ernst and B&#x000fc;lthoff, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). However, as pointed out by <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sober and Sabes (2005</xref>; cf. <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald and Knill, 2009</xref>), minimum-variance models are incomplete in that the weights of the combined sensory signals do not only depend on the reliabilities, but also on task-specific factors.</p><p>Regarding reliabilitiesin the case of the cursor-control task considered here, the visual signal related to the direction of cursor motion is probably more reliable than the proprioceptive signal related to the direction of hand movement. In general, dominance of visual information over sensory inputs of other modalities is fairly well established (e.g., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Besson et al., 2010</xref>). With the cursor-control task, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer (2013)</xref> observed smaller variability of the judged direction of the cursor than of the judged direction of the hand, consistent with higher reliability of visual than of proprioceptive information. Regarding the specifics of cursor-control tasks, attention tends to be focused on the visual information (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2010</xref>), and conscious awareness of the position of the hand is only poor (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;sseler and Sutter, 2009</xref>). In fact, there is evidence that proprioceptive input is functionally neglected during tool use (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and Rapp, 2012</xref>), for example by inhibiting its access to the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bernier et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, both the reliabilities and the task specifics lead one to expect a stronger weight of the visual modality so that the bias of the sensed direction of the cursor toward the direction of the hand should be smaller than the bias of the sensed direction of the hand toward the direction of the cursor &#x02013; which is consistent with the asymmetry observed with explicit measures of cursor and hand direction.</p><p>In the first experiment, we varied the relative reliabilities of visual and proprioceptive information in a particular way. In the &#x0201c;immediate&#x0201d; condition, an aiming movement to a remembered target was performed, followed immediately by the return movement to the remembered start position and a subsequent judgment of cursor or hand direction at the end of aiming. In the &#x0201c;delayed&#x0201d; condition, the start of the return movement was delayed by about 6 s. During the delay, the cursor was no longer visible, but the hand remained in the final position of the aiming movement. Thus, visual information on the final position of the cursor in the delayed condition was basically identical to that in the immediate condition, except for some decay because of the delay, but proprioceptive information on the final position of the hand was presented for a longer duration and without concurrent visual information on cursor position. Thereby the relative reliability of proprioceptive information on final hand position &#x02013; relative to the visual information on final cursor position &#x02013; was enhanced as compared with the immediate condition. If the weights of sensory coupling in the cursor-control task depended on the reliabilities of proprioceptive and visual information, the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of cursor motion should be reduced in the delayed condition as compared with the immediate one (cf. <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bellan et al., 2015</xref>), and the bias of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of hand movement should be increased.</p><p>Our main interest was in possibly different effects of the variation of the relative reliabilities of proprioceptive and visual information on the explicitly- and implicitly measured bias of sensed hand direction. Such different effects are suggested by the following consideration. On the one hand, we are not continuously consciously aware of the position of our hand, but only when it is required, e.g., by the request to provide a psychophysical judgment. On the other hand, we produce a rather continuous stream of hand movements, and this likely requires a rather continuously updated representation of hand position. From this potential difference, one could expect that sensory coupling might occur at different times &#x02013; at selected discrete points in time when hand-position information is required for judgments and thus explicit measures of hand direction, but rather continuously when hand-position information is required for movement control and thus implicit measures.</p><p>Our manipulation of the relative reliabilities of visual and proprioceptive information was restricted to the end of aiming. Throughout the aiming movement, except at its end, the difference between the reliabilities was the same in the immediate and the delayed condition. Only after the end position had been reached, the reliability of proprioceptive information was boosted by its unimodal presentation in the delayed condition. Even though proprioceptive information can decay somewhat with a static hand position after the end position has been reached (cf. <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Paillard and Brouchon, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Craske and Crawshaw, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wann and Ibrahim, 1992</xref>), the decay of the no longer present visual information should have been stronger (cf. <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bellan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, when sensory coupling takes place just before a psychophysical judgment of hand direction is given, it should reflect the different relative reliabilities in the two conditions. In contrast, when sensory coupling takes place continuously as long as bimodal information is accessible, it might not or only little be affected by the additional unimodal proprioceptive information in the delayed condition. This should be the more so as proprioceptive information during the movement is typically more reliable than after the final position has been reached (cf. <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Paillard and Brouchon, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Craske and Crawshaw, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wann and Ibrahim, 1992</xref>), probably because of the contribution of outflow information (corollary-discharge, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Sperry, 1950</xref>, or efference-copy, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the explicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position should be reduced by the enhanced proprioceptive information after the end of the movement (accompanied by an increased explicitly assessed bias of sensed cursor direction), but that the implicitly assessed bias of hand direction should not be reduced or less than the explicit bias. Note that in the delayed condition, the interval during which the start position had to be remembered was also increased relative to the immediate condition; this could have resulted in a larger variability of the direction of the 3rd stroke relative to the 2nd stroke, but not in a change of the mean, and thus the implicitly assessed bias.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-eight healthy right-handed participants (mean &#x000b1; SD: 25.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 years; 14 males and 14 females) signed informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the general approval by the ethics committee of the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Apparatus and Procedure</title><p>The experimental setting and procedures were similar to those of <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer (2013)</xref>. In brief, seated participants held a stylus with their right hand and made three-stroke movements on a digitizer (Wacom Intuos 4 XL, 133 Hz sampling rate). They faced a monitor which was covered by a large black circular screen with a semi-circular window (32 cm in diameter) in its center. A first target (T1, 1.4 cm in diameter) was located in that center, and the start position (SP, 1.2 cm in diameter) was located 3 cm below T1. A second target (T2, 1 cm in diameter) was presented at pseudo random locations, ranging from -60&#x000b0; to +60&#x000b0; relative to the central location, on an invisible circle with a radius of 15 cm around T1. An opaque board placed above the participants&#x02019; arm blocked their direct view of the hand.</p><p>At the beginning of each trial, participants were guided to the SP by arrows shown on the monitor. One second after the stylus was in the SP, T2 appeared for 1 s (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, 1st panel). Subsequently, T1 appeared. After a delay of 0.5 s, an auditory go-signal was delivered. The participants then made three-stroke movements from the SP to T1 (1st stroke), to T2 (2nd stroke), and back to T1 (3rd stroke) at a comfortable speed. When the 1st stroke was made to T1, this target disappeared. Then, the participants made the 2nd stroke to the remembered T2 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, 3rd panel) until the movement was stopped by a stopper ring, a semi-circular plastic ring with a radius of 15 cm around T1 placed on the digitizer&#x02019;s surface. Afterward, they made a return movement (3rd stroke) back to the remembered T1 location (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, 4th panel).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Behavioral task of a three-stroke movement and judgments of hand and cursor directions <bold>(A)</bold>.</bold> SP, T1 and T2 refer to a starting position, a first target, and a second target, respectively.

Only during the 2nd stroke, the direction of cursor motion was rotated relative to the direction of hand movement by a randomly chosen angle out of 6 (clockwise [CW] direction: -30&#x000b0;, -18&#x000b0;, -6&#x000b0;; counter-clockwise [CCW] direction: 6&#x000b0;, 18&#x000b0;, 30&#x000b0;), with the constraint of equal frequencies of the 6 angles. The randomization of rotation angles served to prevent adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation.</p><p>In the delayed condition, a delay of 6 s was inserted after the end of the 2nd stroke, whereas there was no such delay in the immediate condition (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>). During the delay the cursor was invisible. A short beep at the end of the delay in the delayed condition and at the end of the 2nd stroke in the immediate condition signaled the participants to start the 3rd stroke.</p><p>One second after completing the 3rd stroke, participants were asked to judge the direction of either the hand or the cursor at the end of the 2nd stroke. For the judgment of cursor direction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, 5th panel, top), a short line (2 cm) was displayed. It marked the peripheral end of a radial line from T1 to the circumference of the invisible ring of 15 cm diameter centered at T1. The radial line, and thus its visible peripheral end, moved at a constant speed CCW or CW, beginning at a start position 102&#x000b0; to the right or left of the vertical. The participant instructed the examiner to stop and finely adjust (back and/or forth) the line to the direction that matched the judged direction of the cursor at the end of the 2nd stroke. For the judgment of hand direction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, 5th panel, bottom), the participant moved the pen without visual&#x02013;feedback from the right (or left) lower corner of the stopper ring CCW (or CW) along the ring and stopped where he/she judged the hand direction to match the direction of the hand at the end of the 2nd stroke. Judged direction (hand or cursor direction) and direction of line or hand movement during the judgment (CW or CCW) were randomized across trials, again with the constraint of equal frequencies.</p><p>Judgments of cursor and hand direction were obtained with different responses, i.e., verbal responses to guide the experimenter in matching the position of a visual marker to the remembered position of the cursor, and manual responses to match the sensed position of the hand to the remembered position at the end of the 2nd stroke. Although different from each other, however, the responses which provided the explicit measures were closely related to the judged objects: the position of a visual marker had to be matched to the previous position of the visually perceived cursor, and the position of the proprioceptively perceived hand had to be matched to the previous position of the proprioceptively perceived hand. Moreover, judgments were obtained in different coordinate systems for the cursor and the hand, but in the same coordinate systems in which the respective judged objects were localized, defined by the computer screen in a vertical plane and the manual workspace in a horizontal plane. Note that both the motion of the visual marker and the movement of the hand during the judgments differed from cursor motion and hand movement, respectively, during the 2nd stroke. Therefore, only positions could be matched, but not directions and/or amplitudes of movements.</p><p>Before data recording, there were 10 familiarization trials that included the procedure without the visual&#x02013;feedback rotation and/or without the judgment and four practice trials that included all the procedure (one trial for each combination of delayed vs. immediate and hand vs. cursor judgment). The experiment consisted of four sets of trials, each of which included 1 warm-up trial and 36 experimental trials (six trials for each of the six angular rotations). Across the four sets, the immediate and the delayed condition alternated. Across participants, the order of the immediate and delayed conditions was counterbalanced. A total of 72 experimental trials were recorded and analyzed for each condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The angular deviation of the judged hand or cursor direction from the actual hand or cursor direction at the end of the 2nd stroke was measured in each trial (the CCW direction had a positive sign). Individual means and standard deviations of the angular deviations were computed for each judged direction (cursor or hand), each delay condition, and each visual&#x02013;feedback rotation. The influence of the rotated visual&#x02013;feedback on the deviations of the judged from the actual hand or cursor directions was assessed by the slope of a linear regression of the angular deviation (dependent variable) on the visual&#x02013;feedback rotation (independent variable), computed for each participant, delay condition, and judged direction (cursor or hand). These slope parameters specify the strength of sensory coupling in terms of the biases of the judgments of hand and cursor directions in degree per degree of the visual&#x02013;feedback rotation. We used them as explicit measures of the biases of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor and of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of the hand.</p><p>As implicit measure of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor, we computed the angular deviation of the direction of the 3rd stroke from the direction of the 2nd stroke in each trial, that is, &#x003b1;&#x02019; = &#x003b1; in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>.</bold> This measure exploits the existence of error propagation in successive aiming movements (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bock and Eckmiller, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and Sangals, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Heuer and S&#x000fc;lzenbr&#x000fc;ck, 2012</xref>), in particular the propagation of errors that originate from visually induced deviations between the physical and the sensed position of the hand (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rossetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Spence, 2005</xref>). In our case, the visually induced angular deviations of the sensed position of the hand from the actual one (angle &#x003b1;&#x02019; in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>) occur in the 2nd stroke due to the rotated visual&#x02013;feedback, and they are estimated from the angular error of the return movement (angle &#x003b1; in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). When the sensed position deviated in the CCW or CW direction from the actual position of the hand, the angular deviation (&#x003b1;&#x02019;) had a positive or negative sign, respectively. Individual means and standard deviations of the angular deviations were computed for each delay condition and each visual&#x02013;feedback rotation across trials including both judged directions (cursor and hand) because the 3rd strokes were made before the direction to be judged was instructed. The angular deviations &#x003b1;&#x02019; were subjected to the same linear regressions as the angular deviations of the judgments of hand direction from the actual direction. The slope parameters of these regressions served as implicit measures of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor.</p><p>The data were screened for outliers both among trials and among participants. Based on the linear regressions, trials with angular deviations outside the range of predicted deviations &#x000b1; 3 standard deviations of the residuals were eliminated as outliers. As a result of the screening of the explicit measures of hand and cursor direction, 0.20% of all trials were removed from all analyses. The screening of the implicit measure of hand direction resulted in a removal of 0.20% of trials. Subsequently, the bias parameters for each type of measure (explicit cursor, explicit hand, implicit hand), each delay condition, and each participant were screened for outliers. Means and standard deviations across all participants were calculated for the three types of measure and the two delay conditions, and bias parameters outside the range of mean &#x000b1; 3 standard deviations were defined as outliers. These computations were repeated until no further outliers were found. As the result, three participants were identified as having outliers for the explicit measure of cursor direction and were excluded from all analyses.</p><p>The bias parameters, as estimated by the slopes of the linear regressions of angular deviations on visual&#x02013;feedback rotation, neglected the pointing errors of the 2nd strokes to the remembered targets (T2). To exclude a possible role of such errors for our results, we estimated the biases also in a second way, using the estimated angular deviations for a pointing error of zero at each visual&#x02013;feedback rotation instead of the directly observed angular deviations. The results obtained with these estimates of bias parameters confirmed the findings with the more direct estimates. Both the computation of these estimates and the results obtained with them are reported in detail as Supplementary Material.</p><p>For statistical analysis, individual regression coefficients (our explicit and implicit measures of biases of sensed hand and cursor directions) were subjected to a 2 (delay condition: immediate vs. delayed) &#x000d7; 2 (type of measure: hand-explicit vs. hand-implicit) repeated-measures ANOVA.

The intra-individual variability was larger in the delayed than in the immediate condition.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The variation of the relative reliabilities of visual information on cursor direction and proprioceptive information on hand direction had different effects on explicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed hand direction at the end of an aiming movement toward the direction of the cursor. Relative reliabilities were varied by means of a 6-s period at the end of aiming, during which proprioceptive information was available, but visual information was not. As a consequence, the explicitly measured bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor was reduced, whereas &#x02013; in a complementary manner &#x02013; the explicitly measured bias of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of the hand became stronger. In contrast, the implicit measure of the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor remained unchanged. Thus, our manipulation of the relative reliabilities of proprioceptive and visual information succeeded in producing different effects on our explicit and implicit measures of hand direction.</p><p>The different effects of the variation of the relative reliabilities on explicit and implicit measures suggest different principles of sensory coupling. Perhaps the most basic principle of sensory integration is minimization of the variance of a weighted average of sensory signals, with the weights being adjusted to the respective reliabilities of the individual signals (cf. <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ernst, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This principle is likely to be supplemented with other influences (cf. <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sober and Sabes, 2005</xref>). In a cursor-control task, for example, visual information on cursor position is critical for determining the success of an action because the target is typically given by vision. From the perspective of task performance, which is generally subject to conscious awareness, the position of the cursor matters, whereas the position of the hand is irrelevant. However, the position of the hand is likely to matter for movement control, at least when movements are coded in terms of directions and amplitudes (e.g., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rossetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Vindras and Viviani, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Sainburg, 2005</xref>). Because of the different roles of visual and proprioceptive information in a cursor-control task, and in tool use more generally, principles of sensory coupling might differ between measures that rely on conscious awareness (explicit measures) or are derived from motor behavior (implicit measures), respectively.</p><p>Turning to the specific differences observed between explicit and implicit measures of hand direction, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the measures differ with respect to the times at which sensory coupling occurs. Implicit measures should reflect rather continuous sensory coupling throughout the duration of the aiming movement, which would leave only a weak influence of the final unimodal proprioceptive information on hand position in the delayed condition. Explicit measures, in contrast, should reflect sensory coupling just before a judgment is provided and thereby be based on the relative reliabilities of (memorized) sensory information at a certain time after the end of the movement, where the relative reliabilities of proprioceptive and visual information clearly differed between the immediate and the delayed condition. A possible alternative to this hypothesis is that the weighting of different sensory modalities tapped by the implicit measure is fundamentally insensitive to the relative reliabilities of the coupled signals. However, this alternative appears unlikely, given the broad evidence of reliability-based weighting not only for psychophysical judgments (e.g., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fetsch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>), here we found again (1) considerably stronger explicitly measured biases of hand direction than implicitly measured biases and (2) a much stronger intra-individual variability of explicitly measured biases than of implicitly measured ones. These findings, together with the new observation of different effects of the relative reliabilities on explicit and implicit measures, are consistent with the hypothesis of distinct representations of hand position involved in conscious awareness, as tapped by our explicit measure, and movement control, as tapped by our implicit measure.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2</title><p>In the second experiment, we examine the effects of the sequence of trials with different judgments (cursor or hand) on explicit and implicit measures of hand direction. Trial history is known to affect various behaviors, such as grip force production (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Johansson and Westling, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Lukos et al., 2013</xref>), reaction time (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kirby, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Song and Nakayama, 2007</xref>), aiming movements (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zelaznik et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Song and Nakayama, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>), reach-to-grasp movements (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell and Goodale, 2009</xref>), and saccadic eye movements toward visual targets (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fecteau and Munoz, 2003</xref>). Implicitly and explicitly measured biases of hand direction are no exception: <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer (2013)</xref> found that they were affected by the immediate trial history, that is, by the local context, in opposite directions. The present experiment was designed to explore the effects of global rather than local context on implicit and explicit measures of hand direction.</p><p>The exploration of the effects of global context was motivated by the following considerations. First, a more or less continuously updated representation of hand position is needed for movement control, and it should be tapped by our implicit measure. This representation and its updating likely involve rather autonomous processes that are cognitively impenetrable (cf. <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2008</xref>) and probably insensitive to the global context, as is the case with other motor behaviors such as the grasping component controlled implicitly during reach-to-grasp movements (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell and Goodale, 2009</xref>). Explicit measures, on the other hand, involve psychophysical judgments which are well known to be affected by context (cf. <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Poulton, 1989</xref>). Thus, this consideration suggests the hypothesis that global context should affect explicit, but not implicit measures. Second, (conscious) expectations of a judgment of hand or cursor direction could serve to direct attention to proprioceptive or visual information, respectively, and thereby to modulate the asymmetry of the biases. Such an effect of predictability could be restricted to explicit measures of bias. According to this consideration, predictability of the forthcoming judgments should affect explicitly assessed biases, but not implicitly assessed ones. Third, implicit measures, but not explicit ones, could be affected by the preceding judgments (cf. <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>). Thus, when global contexts differ with respect to preceding judgments only, implicitly assessed biases, but not explicitly assessed biases, should be modulated.</p><p>We studied the effects of global context by means of a methodology used by <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Zelaznik et al. (1983)</xref> and others (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Song and Nakayama, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Whitwell et al., 2008</xref>). The principle is to compare two types of trials under three different conditions with blocked, alternated, and randomized order. In the present experiment, the two types of trials are those with judgments of hand and cursor direction. With blocked trials, the global context is homogeneous. Each trial is preceded by a number of trials with the same judgment, and prediction of the judgment required in the next trial is straightforward. With alternating trials, the global context is heterogeneous, though predictable. The heterogeneous global context could affect information processing in various ways (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Los, 1996</xref>). One group of participants underwent these conditions in which the sequence of judgments was predictable. A second group of participants underwent a randomized order of judgments. Here the global context is not only heterogeneous, but the judgment required in the next trial is unpredictable in addition.</p><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty healthy right-handed participants signed informed consent.

First, the range of the rotation angles was reduced in Experiment 2 because judgment variability was somewhat increased at the largest rotation angles (-30&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0;) of Experiment 1 (cf. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). The six angles of rotated visual&#x02013;feedback for the 2nd strokes ranged between -25&#x000b0; and +25&#x000b0; (CW direction: -25&#x000b0;, -15&#x000b0;, -5&#x000b0;; CCW direction: 5&#x000b0;, 15&#x000b0;, 25&#x000b0;). Second, unlike Experiment 1, no beep sound was provided to signal that participants should start the 3rd stroke.</p><p>The global context was varied across two groups. In Group 1, the sequence of judgments of hand and cursor was predictable. There were three different conditions. In the blocked-cursor condition (72 trials), cursor direction had to be judged in all trials; in the blocked-hand condition (72 trials), hand direction had to be judged in all trials; in the alternated condition, judgments of cursor and hand direction alternated (72 trials for each type of judgment, totaling 144 trials). Participants of Group 1 were informed at the beginning of each condition that all trials required the same judgment for the blocked-cursor and blocked-hand conditions, and that the hand and cursor judgments alternated across trials in the alternated condition. In Group 2, there was only a single condition (randomized) in which judgments of cursor and hand direction were mixed as in the alternated condition, but their sequence across trials was random and thus unpredictable (144 trials for each judgment, totaling 288 trials).</p><p>Before data recording, there were eight familiarization trials that included the procedure without the visual&#x02013;feedback rotation and/or without the judgment and four practice trials that included all the procedure (two trials for each type of judgment). An experimental block included 1 warm-up trial and 36 experimental trials (six trials for each of the six angular rotations). Each of the blocked-cursor and blocked-hand conditions included two blocks, and the alternated condition included four blocks. The order of the three conditions was randomized across participants of Group 1. The randomized condition of Group 2 included eight blocks of trials. A total of 288 experimental trials were recorded and analyzed for each participant. A few minutes of break were inserted after each block.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Data analysis was basically identical to that of Experiment 1 with one exception. Namely, individual means and standard deviations of the angular deviation of the direction of the 3rd stroke from the direction of the 2nd stroke were computed not only for each context condition and each visual&#x02013;feedback rotation, but also for each judged direction (cursor or hand). This is because in Experiment 2, the 3rd strokes were made not always before the direction to be judged was instructed. The data were screened for outliers both among trials and among participants as in Experiment 1. As a result of the screening of the explicit measures, 0.49% of trials were removed from all analyses. The screening of the implicit measure resulted in a removal of 0.32% of trials. Subsequently, the individual bias parameters were screened for outliers based on means and standard deviations across all participants for each type of measure (explicit cursor, explicit hand, and implicit hand) and each context condition. Two participants of each group were identified as having outliers for the explicit measure of cursor bias. These participants were excluded from all analyses.</p><p>For the statistical analysis, individual regression coefficients (as measures of explicit and implicit biases) and standard deviations were used as in Experiment 1. In a first step, we analyzed explicit and implicit measures of hand direction. When comparing the blocked and alternated conditions of Group 1, mainly ANOVAs with different within-participant factors (such as visuo-motor rotation, type of measure, and context condition) were used. When comparing the alternated and randomized conditions, ANOVAs with a between-participant factor (context condition) and different within-participant factors (such as visuo-motor rotation and type of measure) were used. In a second step, explicit measures of cursor direction were analyzed. The blocked and alternated conditions of Group 1 were compared by using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test for the regression coefficients and an ANOVA with within-participant factors (context condition and visuo-motor rotation) for the individual standard deviations. The alternated and randomized conditions were compared by using a <italic>t</italic>-test for the regression coefficients and an ANOVA with a between-participant factor (context condition) and a within-participant factor (visuo-motor rotation) for the individual standard deviations. Mauchly&#x02019;s test was used to determine if sphericity was violated and was found non-significant for all relevant significant ANOVA results.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The main purpose of Experiment 2 was to test whether the explicit and implicit measures of the bias of hand direction toward the direction of the cursor are affected differently by global context.

Next, we report the intra-individual variability of implicit and explicit measures of hand direction and finally the findings on the explicit measure of cursor direction.</p><sec><title>Explicit and Implicit Measures of the Bias of Sensed Hand Direction</title><p>First, the effects of global context on implicit and explicit measures of hand direction were examined by comparing the blocked-hand and alternated conditions of Group 1. Similar to Experiment 1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>), there was a generally stronger explicit-measure bias than implicit-measure bias toward the direction of the cursor. The means of the individually estimated biases across two context conditions were 0.716 for the explicit measure (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>) and 0.365 for the implicit measure (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>).

This indicates a weak bias of the judgments of cursor direction toward the direction of the hand. The mean individual biases were multiplied with -1 to obtain positive values which are plotted in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>.</bold> Regarding the effects of global context, the explicit measures of the bias of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of the hand did not differ between the alternated and the blocked-cursor conditions [<italic>t</italic>(22) = 1.09, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05].

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the variations of the biases of cursor judgments across context conditions (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>) were similar to the variations of the biases of hand judgments (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>).

Such contrasting effects turned out to be essentially absent. Instead, the global context effects were quite similar for explicit and implicit measures of sensed hand direction. We shall discuss the absence of contrasting effects and the observed common effects in turn.</p><p>The three different global contexts in terms of trials with judgments of hand and cursor direction differed with respect to the heterogeneity of the judgments in a block of trials and with respect to their predictability. According to our initial considerations, both these factors could have affected the explicit and implicit judgments differently. For example, (conscious) expectation of a judgment of hand direction could have served to direct attention to proprioceptive information, increasing the weight of this signal in sensory coupling so that the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor would be reduced. Such an effect could be limited to explicit measures. The absence of such an effect is in line with the claim that the weights of sensory coupling are essentially independent of attending to the one or the other signal (cf. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Helbig and Ernst, 2008</xref>). Similarly, a judgment of hand direction in a preceding trial could have facilitated processing of proprioceptive information, again increasing its weight in sensory coupling. Such an effect could have been limited to the implicit measure. Again there was no indication of such a differential modulation of biases. Finally, the implicit measure, but not the explicit one, could have been insensitive to global context in principle. The present findings also do not substantiate this tentative hypothesis. Taken together, they also cast doubt on the robustness and/or generality of the different sequential effects for the explicit and implicit measures of hand direction found by <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer (2013)</xref>.</p><p>The effects of global context were not only similar for explicit and implicit measures of hand direction, but also for explicit measures of hand and cursor direction, even though for the explicit measure of cursor direction, the variations across context conditions were small and not statistically significant. This pattern of results is different from Experiment 1 where the delay produced opposite effects on the explicit measures: it reduced the bias of sensed hand direction toward the direction of the cursor and increased the bias of sensed cursor direction toward the direction of the hand. Thus, the delay of Experiment 1 affected primarily the asymmetry of the bias, whereas the global contexts of Experiment 2 affected primarily the strength of coupling (sum of the biases of sensed hand and cursor directions). In formal models of sensory coupling (e.g., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bresciani et al., 2006</xref>), coupling strength has been claimed to depend on a coupling prior, which reflects the probability of knowing the relation between the different sensory signals (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ernst, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Coupling strength varied systematically across the context conditions of Experiment 2. Most conspicuously, it was stronger in the alternated condition than in the randomized condition. Thus, in the randomized condition, participants were more proficient in keeping visual information on cursor position and proprioceptive information on hand position separated. We suggest that this is a consequence of higher effort or investment of more cognitive resources. Randomness of the sequence of judgments of cursor and hand directions could enhance the subjective difficulty of the task and thereby increase motivation. The relation between task difficulty and effort or motivation has a long history in Psychology (see <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brehm and Self, 1989</xref>, for review). This relation has even been invoked to account for apparently paradoxical increases of performance when the task became harder to perform (e.g., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000fc;ker, 1963</xref>). Findings such as these imply that increased effort goes along with the allocation of additional cognitive resources (cf. <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kahneman, 1973</xref>). Although we are not aware of direct evidence related to effort and sensory coupling, there is some indirect evidence on the availability of cognitive resources, as varied by age of the participants, and sensory coupling. At older adult age, when cognitive resources can be conceived as being reduced in comparison with young adult age (e.g., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Salthouse, 1988</xref>), we found stronger biases of judged directions in a cursor-control task (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>) and poorer discriminability of hand and cursor directions (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 2013</xref>). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cognitive resources result in a reduced proficiency to keep visual information on cursor position and proprioceptive information on hand position separated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>General Discussion</title><p>The present findings add to the understanding of sensory coupling in cursor-control tasks and, more generally, in tool-use tasks in which visual and proprioceptive information refer to different objects (the hand and the effective part of a tool such as the cursor in a cursor-control task). Across different dependent measures such as (intentional) reproductions of movement distances or psychophysical judgments of cursor and hand positions as well as for positions, amplitudes and directions, the general finding is an assimilation, which is typically asymmetric (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ladwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rand and Heuer, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Kirsch et al., 2015</xref>). Although it is not always clear that tool use, in particular the presence of a kinematic transformation, is critical for the assimilation, it is worth noting that assimilation of concurrent visual and proprioceptive signals is not a universal phenomenon. For example, when an independently moving visual stimulus (cursor) was concurrently presented with aiming actions, a contrast effect has been observed where the seen cursor direction was shifted away from the felt hand direction (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zwickel et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>,<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). This contrast effect was flipped to assimilation under specific circumstances (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Zwickel et al., 2010a</xref>). Even though the contrast effect was specific to independent visual and proprioceptive inputs, such a flipping reveals the complex nature of sensory coupling associated with manual actions and the need of a careful examination of factors that affect the cross-modal influences.</p><p>One such factor is the measure by which cross-modal influences are assessed. The type of measure should play a role as soon as sensory coupling does not only depend on the reliabilities of the coupled signals and the <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the relation between these signals, but also on the purpose or use of the combined signal (cf. <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Knill, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sober and Sabes, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald and Knill, 2009</xref>). Here we draw a distinction between an explicit measure, which is based on psychophysical judgments and implies subjective awareness of the judged positions of hand and cursor, and an implicit measure, which is derived from motor behavior and does not imply subjective awareness of hand position. We found that the two types of measure are differently sensitive to variation of the relative reliabilities of proprioceptive and visual information, in particular, to a boost of the reliability of proprioceptive information on the end position of a movement by unimodal presentation. In contrast, they turned out to be similarly affected by the variation of coupling strength induced by global context, in particular, the sequences of psychophysical judgments of hand and cursor directions.</p><p>According to the current findings, our explicit and implicit measures differ with respect to the reliability-based weighting of proprioceptive and visual information. The different weights could be a consequence of different reliabilities of the coupled individual signals at different times during a movement. The implicit measure is likely based on a continuously updated representation of hand position, and the reliability of hand-position information could be enhanced during the movement by efferent contributions (cf. <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Paillard and Brouchon, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Craske and Crawshaw, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wann and Ibrahim, 1992</xref>). With such a continuously updated representation, the boost of the reliability of proprioceptive information after the end of the movement, which we implemented in the delayed condition of Experiment 1, should have only little or no effect. The explicit measure, in contrast, is likely based on the sensory information available at the time the psychophysical judgment is required. Thus, reliabilities during the movements should be of little importance, but reliabilities just before the judgments &#x02013; and after the end of the movement &#x02013; should be.</p><p>The current findings suggest that our explicit and implicit measures of sensed hand direction share variations of coupling strength, which should be related to prior knowledge of the relation between hand and cursor movements (cf. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ernst, 2012</xref>). This so-called coupling prior seems to be affected by the effort invested in task performance, with a higher effort going along with a weaker coupling. A weaker coupling implies less <italic>a priori</italic> redundancy of visual and proprioceptive information, so that there is a higher demand on the processing of different concurrent sensory signals. In normal everyday life, there is a tight relation between the directions of hand movements and cursor motions. Thus, a high coupling strength would be appropriate. In the experimental task, however, the relation between the directions of hand movements and cursor motions is less tight because of the random visuo-motor rotations. Therefore, a weaker coupling strength would be appropriate. Appropriate adjustments of the coupling prior could also be facilitated by higher effort or increased cognitive resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: MR and HH.
