Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250&#x02013;280 g; n=18) were randomly divided into three groups. The LPS group received 5 mg/kg endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), which induced acute lung injury (ALI). The control (CTRL) group received normal saline and the SEVO group received sevoflurane (2.5%) for 30 min after ALI was induced by 5 mg/kg LPS. Samples were collected for analysis 12 h after LPS. Lung injury was assessed by pathological observations and tissue wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios. Apoptotic index (AI) was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and electron microscopy. Caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 protein levels were determined by immunocytochemistry and western blotting, respectively. Bcl-xl levels were measured by western blotting and Bcl-2 levels by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In the LPS group, W/D ratios, AI values, caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 levels were significantly higher than in the CTRL group and lung injury was more severe. In the SEVO group, W/D ratios, AI, caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were lower than in the LPS group. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression were higher than in the LPS group and lung injury was attenuated. Sevoflurane inhalation protected the lungs from injury by regulating caspase-3 activation and Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 expression to inhibit excessive cell apoptosis, and such apoptosis might be important in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sevofluran</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary acute lung injury</kwd><kwd>Caspase-3</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a highly lethal inflammatory lung disorder. During the onset of ALI, many types of damaging factors promote apoptosis of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, increasing lung tissue damage and contributing to the ALI inflammatory response (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Though the exact mechanisms leading to pulmonary cell death are unknown, it is likely that apoptosis plays an important pathogenic role (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be of either pulmonary (direct) or extrapulmonary (indirect) origin (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and, based on available evidence, direct and indirect ALI are truly different processes (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr"/>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). While there is substantial overlap, studies estimate that approximately 55% of ARDS is caused by direct, rather than indirect, lung injury (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Because many supportive therapies for ARDS fail (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), effective preventive strategies are needed. It was reported that sevoflurane postconditioning reduced endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS)-induced ALI, protecting lung function (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Post-processing of inhalation anesthetics is a potential method for protecting the viscera from reperfusion injuries (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Preconditioning with volatile anesthetics was shown to decrease apoptotic cell numbers and apoptosis regulatory protein levels both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, effects of sevoflurane preconditioning on apoptosis, during its protection of direct lung injury, are poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate effects of sevoflurane on LPS-induced ALI in rats and the possible mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals and grouping</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Soochow University approved all experimental protocols. A total of 18 healthy male adult Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250-280 g, were maintained in the Soochow University experimental animal center. They were randomly divided into three groups: control (CTRL) group, LPS group and sevoflurane (SEVO) group. Pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) was injected endotracheally into each animal. After rats were anesthetized, the limbs were affixed to a board. Their necks were shaved, a medial 1 cm incision was made, and the trachea was exposed. The trachea was punctured with a 1 mL syringe with a 25-Ga needle and LPS or normal saline was slowly injected into the trachea over 30 s. After a bubble appeared, the incision was sutured. Rats in the SEVO group, which had also received LPS, were administered inhaled SEVO for 30 min. All rats were then returned to their cages and given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 12 h. They were then sacrificed by carotid arterial bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Hematoxylin and eosin staining</title><p>The right lung inferior lobes were fixed with 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-&#x003bc;m thick sections with a Leica RM2235 rotary microtome (Leica Biosystem, Germany) and mounted onto slides.

Longitudinal sections were placed onto copper grids, which were stained with uranyl acetate and lead nitrate and visualized with an H-600 electron microscope (Hitachi Limited, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Lung wet weight to dry weight (W/D) ratios</title><p>After each rat was euthanized, the chest cavity was opened and the right middle lobe excised. Lung samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, blotted and weighed (wet weight).

The W/D ratio was then calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>TUNEL assays were performed using an apoptosis detection kit (Roche Applied Science, Germany). Under the light microscope, TUNEL-positive cells had brown-stained nuclei. Five visual fields were selected randomly from each sample and at least 100 cells per field were counted at 200&#x000d7; magnification. The apoptotic index was calculated (apoptotic cells/total cells&#x000d7;100%) from a total of 25 fields per sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>A streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemical method was used to detect total caspase-3 protein.

After blocking with goat serum (BSA) for 30 min, rabbit anti-caspase-3 (1:500; Boster, China) primary antibody was added for overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibody (1:700, Boster) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The stain was developed with diaminobenzidine and lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were then dehydrated and mounted under coverslips. Integrated optical density was determined with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, USA) at 400&#x000d7; magnification.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The left lung inferior lobes were harvested 12 h after LPS instillation and homogenized in lysis buffer.

Total protein content in each supernatant was measured by the BCA protein assay. Subsequently, samples containing an equal amount of protein, were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Beyotime, China). After blocking with 5% fat-free milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (CST, USA) against Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, cleaved-caspase-3 or &#x003b2;-actin overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing three times with TBS-T, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of the secondary antibody (CST).

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green on an Exicycler&#x02122; 96 real-time quantitative thermal block.

The housekeeping gene &#x003b2;-actin was used for normalization. The ratios of the emissions incorporated into the PCR products of the tested gene to the signals for &#x003b2;-actin products were calculated to evaluate relative changes in mRNA expression levels.

Pneumonia and aspiration of gastric contents account for most cases of direct lung injury while sepsis is the major cause of indirect lung injury (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The most commonly used experimental models of direct lung injury are those using intratracheal LPS administration, mechanical ventilation or acid aspiration (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Unfortunately, these simulate events that are often encountered in clinical anesthesia, so we chose a direct lung injury model for our study. We focused on examining regulation of apoptosis in a model of LPS-induced ALI.</p><p>Apoptosis is a mechanism for removing unwanted cells, thus limiting inflammation and tissue injury (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Cytokines may inhibit inflammatory cell apoptosis, prolong inflammatory reactions and promote apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. We found an exudate 12 h after LPS instillation containing a large number of inflammatory cells, accompanied by alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis. Ultimately, the number of inflammatory and apoptotic cells peaked at 12 h in our model. In inflammatory lung diseases, although molecular mechanisms of signaling are not completely understood, apoptosis of both lung epithelial cells and macrophages is proinflammatory and some results indicate that apoptosis generates inflammation in the lung, and suggest that caspases are promising targets for drug development. Blockade of Fas-FasL interactions either prevents or attenuates pulmonary inflammation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Sevoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic commonly used in the clinic. When used, the bronchi and pulmonary alveoli are directly exposed to this agent. Previous studies confirmed the anti-apoptotic effects of sevoflurane on ischemia-reperfusion injury. In recent reports, sevoflurane pretreatment effectively attenuated lung injury by inhibition of neutrophil accumulation and alteration of the surfactant composition, attenuating the inflammatory response (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). When lung damage in the LPS group was the most severe, in the SEVO group was significantly less severe, indicated by apoptotic index and pathological morphology. As a potential mechanism, sevoflurane inhibited the abnormal increase in apoptosis of lung cells caused by LPS, so that the inflammatory response of lung tissue was decreased, leading to a lower degree of lung injury.</p><p>The anti-apoptotic effect of sevoflurane has been well reported. However, the anti-apoptotic mechanism of sevoflurane in primary lung injury has been less studied. To date, two major apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic, have been described in mammalian cells. Both pathways converge at the level of caspase-3 activation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Some related research showed that enhanced caspase-3 activation was seen at 8 h. In our study, we observed an increased apoptosis rate 12 h after LPS. At this time-point, levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were significantly lower in the SEVO, compared with LPS group. Cell death is believed to be inevitable after cleavage of terminal caspases, with the most important being caspase-3. We propose, therefore, that sevoflurane can inhibit apoptosis by decreasing levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3, blocking apoptosis at its final stage.</p><p>The Bcl-2 protein family is believed to determine the life or death status of cells. Members of this family include both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), with Bcl-xl protein as the most well-known (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Bcl-xl was shown to inhibit apoptosis by participating in a variety of protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Husain et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) reported that ALI was regulated by Bcl-2. In another report, sevoflurane anesthesia not only improved oxygenation and ameliorated inflammation, but also altered microRNA expression in a rat ALI model (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl was increased by sevoflurane, while that of apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak was decreased, thus regulating hepatic apoptosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In our study, the SEVO group had decreased number of TUNEL-positive cells in the lungs, compared with in the LPS group, as well as significantly higher levels of the early apoptotic signaling mediators, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2. Bcl-2 mRNA was similarly increased in the SEVO group to levels equivalent to those in the CTRL group. In mammals, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 were shown to inhibit apoptosis by interfering with the activity of caspase-3 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, we believe that sevoflurane pretreatment can lead to maintenance of a relatively high concentration of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, blocking caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated the following: 1) sevoflurane preconditioning inhibited development of apoptosis in LPS-induced ALI; 2) sevoflurane-mediated anti-apoptotic activity was associated with decreased levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 and upregulation of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2; and 3) sevoflurane preconditioning is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent lung injury resulting from aspiration events. Further studies are needed to confirm whether epithelial cells are protected by sevoflurane preconditioning.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
