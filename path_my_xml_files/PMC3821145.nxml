Background</title><p>Pain is amongst the most common problems after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R1">1</xref>). Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience, which is associated
with the real or probably damage of tissue. Unrelieved postoperative pain in addition to
creating fears in the surgical patients, it makes adverse psychological impact on them
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R3">3</xref>). The uncontrolled postoperative pain will make a lot of acute and chronic
effects, including systemic mediators, hypercoagulability, postoperative immunosuppression,
and delayed wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R4">4</xref>). So, one of the
main aims of anesthesia is to reduce postoperative pain. However, many drugs that are used
for this purpose, especially opioids and NSAIDs (None Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs),
have side effects such as respiratory distress, nausea, itching, and gastrointestinal
bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R5">5</xref>). Recent studies have indicated
interest in using complementary therapies such as heat and cold therapy, hypnotism, music
therapy and aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is used for the relief of pain, anxiety, depression,
insomnia and fatigue, using the existing oils in different parts of the plant such as
Lavandula angustifolia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R6">6-11</xref>). Lavandula is a
flowering plant from the Lamiaceae family, native to the western Mediterranean region. The
lipophilic monoterpenes at the plant are reacted to the cell membranes, and cause changes in
the activity of ion channels, carriers and nervous receptors. Such property can explain the
soothing and anti-bacterial effects of Lavender oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec10729"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Cesarean surgery is common, especially in our country, and the patient's postoperative pain
is a serious problem. Furthermore, the extent of conventional method for the pain relief is
a prescription of opioids and NSAIDs, which are also associated with certain complications,
and needs additional methods of the pain control, consequently, we decided to assess the
effect of the inhalation aromatherapy using Lavender oil essence on postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec id="sec10730"><title>3. Materials and Methods </title><p>In a triple blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, which was performed for the first
time in Ahvaz, a city located in the south western part of Iran, after approving by Ahvaz
Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (AJUMS) Ethical Committee, 60 pregnant women, who
were admitted to a general hospital for cesarean section, were divided randomly into two
groups. Subjects with pregnancy, ASA class I and II, absence of hypertension, coagulation
disorders, migraines and chronic headaches, no history of allergies to medicinal plants, no
history of anosmia were included. Subjects with respiratory problems during surgery, nausea,
vomiting, sensitivity and dissatisfaction after the first dose of aromatherapy using
Lavender oil essence were excluded. The severity of pain was documented based on the Visual
Analog Scale (VAS).The VAS is a standard tool like a 10 cm ruler including 10 numbers begin
from 0 (no pain) and end to 10 (most severe pain). Different states of a human face in
response to pain severity have been plotted on the other side of ruler. The patients were
asked to choose one of them according to their pain severity. The number shown on the back
of the ruler was considered as pain score. The Lavenders (Lavandula angustifolia) are a
genus of several species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. In this study,
Lavender essence 10% was provided by the Barij Essence Pharmaceudical Company (Kashan,
Iran). Placebo was a base of aromatherapy blend without Lavender essence which was provided
by the Barij Essence Pharmaceudical Company too. In the beginning, possible side effects of
drugs used in the study, were explained to the patients, and after obtaining informed
consent, patients were entered into the operating room. Patients were performed monitoring
by ECG (Electrocardiography), monitoring for heart rate recording, NIBP (None Invasive Blood
Pressure) and Pulseoximetry. After embedding the peripheral intravenous cannula, 500 cc of
Ringer's crystalloid fluid was infused for patients. Afterwards, regional block with spinal
anesthesia was performed with 60 mg of Lidocaine 5%, and then the patients underwent
cesarean section. Opioid or benzodiazepine was not used after cesarean section in operating
room as sedation. Pain score were measured using the VAS score for all patients. After the
onset of postoperative pain (if VAS &#x0003e; 3), four, eight and 12 hours after that, the
inhalation aromatherapy was performed using Lavender essence. In one group, three drops of
aromatherapy blend containing Lavender essence 10% (provided by The Barij Essence
Pharmaceutical Compnay) were poured on cotton in cast containers, and the patient was asked
to inhale it for 5 minutes from a distance of 10 cm; and pain score was measured using the
VAS again, and if the VAS was greater than three, analgesic was given in accordance with the
hospital routine protocol (the first time, intra muscular injection of Diclofenac sodume 75
mg and next times, Diclofenac suppositories 100 mg). Using the same procedure, aromatherapy
was performed in the other group by three drops of placebo (a base of aromatherapy blend
without Lavender essence) where its smell and appearance were similar to the Lavender oil
essence. Heart rate, blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and patient's satisfaction
were recorded before and after the aromatherapy based on the questionnaire. During the
research, the project executive and the patients were not aware of the type of drug and
placebo, and after the study and data analysis, the Lavender and the placebo were disclosed
by the Barij Essence Pharmaceudical Company. All data were analyzed using the SPSS for
Windows (version 19.0). Independent T-test was used compare the mean pain in two groups; the
Paired t- test was used to compare the pain before and after intervention. The significance
level was set to P &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="sec10731"><title>4. Results</title><p>In this study, all patients were ASA class I. At the time of the onset of the pain after
cesarean section, aromatherapy with Lavender essence was performed. Average age, height,
weight in the two groups showed no significant difference, and times of need to the first
analgesic from cesarean section were similar in the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3337">Table 1</xref>). After using the drug comparing it with before, there was
more decrease in the VAS score in the Lavender group than the placebo group, these values
were significant in four, eight and 12 hours after the first intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3338">Table 2</xref>). In the Lavender group, the level of
satisfaction from the drug was 90 %, while in the placebo group, a 50% satisfaction was
reported (P = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2630">Figure 1</xref>). In the Lavender
group, using Diclofenac suppository for completing analgesia was 43.3%, and in the placebo
group was 76.7% (P = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2631">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>After using the drug comparing it with before, heart rate showed a greater reduction in the
Lavender group compared with the placebo group, which has been shown in the table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3339">Table 3</xref>). However, no difference was observed in
terms of the blood pressure between the two groups. In terms of the complication incidence,
only one patient in the placebo group had nausea, and none of the patients in both groups
had vomiting and dizziness.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3337" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline Charactristics of Patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lavender group, Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo group, Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, y</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.83 &#x000b1; 5.65</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.57 &#x000b1; 4.11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.96</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height, cm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.57 &#x000b1; 4.15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.7 &#x000b1; 4.41</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.78</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, kg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.57 &#x000b1; 8.99</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.07 &#x000b1; 9.35</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.78</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time of first request of analgesia after Spinal anesthesia</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.83 &#x000b1; 9.16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.33 &#x000b1; 9.67</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.72</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl3338" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the VAS in Two Groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lavender group, Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo group, Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.23 &#x000b1; 0.43</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.27 &#x000b1; 0.64</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.353</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction 4 hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.37 &#x000b1; 0.89</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5 &#x000b1; 0.57</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.008</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction 8 hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.63 &#x000b1; 0.89</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.49</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.024</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction12hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.40 &#x000b1; 0.62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2 &#x000b1; 0.48</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.011</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl3339" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Heart Rate in Two Groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lavender group, Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo group Mean &#x000b1; SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.83 &#x000b1; 5.96 </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.63 &#x000b1; 2.45</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction 4 hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.30 &#x000b1; 4.60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.77 &#x000b1; 4.24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.439</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction 8 hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.30 &#x000b1; 5.62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 &#x000b1; 3.16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.016</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain reduction12hours after medication for the first time</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2 &#x000b1; 2.82</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.57 &#x000b1; 2.23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.798</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig2630" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Satisfaction From Using Drug in Two Groups</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="aapm-03-203-i001"/></fig><fig id="fig2631" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Frequency of Patients need to Take Diclofenac Suppositories to Complete

cesarean. The results showed that pain after surgery in four, eight and 12 hours after the
onset of symptoms following inhalation of Lavender essence have had a significant decrease
compared with the placebo group. The pain control after cesarean delivery is a great
challenge for the anesthesiologists and gynecologists, because the spread use of drugs can
cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting and excessive sedation; and it can cause a delay
in getting out of bed and discharge from the hospital. In addition, the drugs excrete in
breast milk and can cause sedation in baby as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R13">13</xref>). The use of non-opioid analgesics and alternative treatment alone has failed
to establish an effective and satisfactory analgesia for patients. It seems necessary to use
multiple methods of analgesia (multi-modal) for the pain relief after Cesarean section and
to have more research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R4">4</xref>). The
effects of various forms of Lavender essence on postoperative pain control have been
investigated in the previous studies. In a study performed by Sobhani and Colleagues in 2004
in Rasht city on pain relief after cesarean section, in each three stages of the
intervention (in which its first stage was performed six hours after the onset of the pain)
there was a significant reduction in pain after inhaling Lavender essence. These results are
similar to our study except that: 1) in the mentioned study, intervention was not
immediately performed after the onset of the pain and 2) we used Lavender essence 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R14">14</xref>). In a study on women undergoing elective
cesarean section performed in Tabriz city, an important reduction was seen in pain at half,
eight and 16 hours after intervention in the group using inhaled Lavender, while in our
study, there was no significant difference between the two groups at the first intervention
at the onset of the pain unlike for the four, eight and 12 hours. Also in our study, the
Lavender essence 10% was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R6">6</xref>). In a study
performed by Sheikhan and Colleagues on episiotomy pain using Lavender bath extract, pain in
the Lavender group at four hours and also five days after delivery was significantly reduced
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R8">9</xref>). Moreover, in a similar study conducted by
Ailsa also using Lavender oil bath for 10 days after vaginal delivery, the slight reduction
of pain, though significant, was seen in the Lavender group compared to the control group
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R15">15</xref>). Furthermore, in Khadivzadeh's study in
which Lavender cream has been used to relieve episiotomy pain, the pain on days three, five
and 10 after birth was significantly reduced compared to the control group, but this
difference was not significant in the first 24 hours of the delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R16">16</xref>). We found that Diclofenac suppository dosage as a supplemental
analgesic drug in the Lavender group was significantly lower than the placebo group. These
findings are similar to a study by Jung TK on patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric
banding surgery. But in our study the Lavender essence 10% was used. In that study, despite
the decrease of pain, the score was not significantly different in the two groups, but
morphine consumption was decreased significantly in the Lavender group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R17">17</xref>). In the present study, patient's satisfaction
with supplemental analgesia techniques was considered, and it showed that satisfaction with
treatment in the Lavender group was significantly higher than the placebo group. This
satisfaction has also been reported in two previous studies, which were conducted on obese
patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and patients undergoing breast
biopsy surgery with the difference that we used Lavender essence 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R18">18</xref>). Also, in a
study conducted by Mohammadkhani on postpartum perineal pain, patients receiving Lavender
were more satisfied than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9570R19">19</xref>). Due to
the lack of reported side effects such as nausea, vomiting and dizziness in the group
treated with Lavandula in our study and other studies on this drug, it can be concluded that
this drug doesnot have serious and common side effects of the opioid analgesics and NSAIDs,
and further studies could be used as part of a multimodal analgesic treatment of
postoperative pain. Based on findings of our study, it can be concluded that the inhaled
Lavender essence may be used as a part of the multimodal analgesic treatment after cesarean
section, but it is not recommended using the sole analgesic treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research is a result of residential thesis (Ref No: U90291). Hereby, we acknowledge
