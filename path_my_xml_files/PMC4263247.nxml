The aim was to show superiority of ATX-101 over placebo. The study comprised a screening period (Week &#x02212;8 [Visit 1] to baseline [Visit 2]), followed by a 12-week treatment period with a maximum of four treatment sessions timed approximately 28&#x000a0;days apart (Visits 2&#x02013;5), and a 4-week (Visit 6) and 12-week (Visit 7) efficacy and safety follow-up. Patients from 29 centres from Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom were enrolled. The study followed all local legal and regulatory requirements. Signed informed consent was given by all patients in agreement with the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice, before any study-specific procedure was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Men and non-pregnant, non-lactating women under medical birth control if of reproductive age were required to be 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years of age to participate.

Patients were required to have a body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and show no significant abnormality in their clinical and laboratory evaluations. Patients who had one or more of the following were excluded: previous SMF treatment or other recent aesthetic facial treatment; loose skin or previous trauma in the neck or chin area, or prominent platysmal bands that could lead to an aesthetically unacceptable outcome after treatment; any cause of enlargement in the submental area other than localized SMF; any medical condition likely to affect the safety or efficacy assessment or the patient's ability to undergo study procedures or provide informed consent.

ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> and placebo treatment kits were indistinguishable in appearance, and each treatment kit was identified by a blinded label with one of the randomization numbers attributed by the computerized system.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients received a maximum of 10&#x000a0;mL of one of two ATX-101 fixed-dose regimens (1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> or 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) or placebo (sodium phosphate and sodium chloride in water for injection) at up to four treatment sessions with an interval of approximately 28&#x000a0;days between each session (Visits 2&#x02013;5). During each treatment session, 0.2&#x000a0;mL per injection of either ATX-101 (1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> or 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) or placebo was injected subcutaneously directly into the SMF, using a grid to position injection sites 1.0&#x000a0;cm apart and achieve an even distribution. Up to 50 individual injections were administered per treatment session. Anaesthesia with topical lidocaine preparations and ice, and in some cases local lidocaine injections, was provided as required. Vital signs were measured at each visit during treatment and follow-up periods. SMF reduction and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) were assessed at each treatment visit. AEs were also assessed at 7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;days after each treatment visit. All AEs and use of concomitant medications were reported. Treatment could be delayed or stopped for efficacy (early therapeutic success) or safety reasons (occurrence of AEs or insufficient fat to safely administer injections), as well as discontinued at the patient's request. All randomized patients were to receive at least one treatment session and attend a 4-week and a 12-week follow-up visit (Visits 6 and 7) after the final treatment session (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic disposition of randomized patients into different treatment groups.

The two coprimary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients classified as responders to treatment with respect to the 5-point CR-SMFRS score (&#x02265;1-point improvement from baseline in SMF reduction) and the 7-point SSRS score (patients satisfied with their appearance in association with their chin and face, SSRS &#x02265;4). For both endpoints, an imputation of missing values by using the last observation carried forward method was used. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints included: the proportion of patients with a reduction in SMF of &#x02265;1 point on the Patient-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS); the effect of treatment on the psychological impact of SMF using the Patient-Reported Submental Fat Impact Scale (PR-SMFIS); patient responses to the Modified Derriford Appearance Scale 24 (modified DAS 24) questionnaire and Subject Global Questions; and the clinician-rated effect of treatment on skin laxity (Skin Laxity Rating Scale [SLRS]).

Patients underwent clinical evaluations and examination of the treatment area for AEs at each treatment session before and after administration of the study material and approximately 7&#x000a0;days after each treatment. AEs were characterized by their start and stop date, and relationship with treatment, and were classified by their severity and intensity. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any undesirable medical occurrence or worsening of an existing condition after the first dose of treatment. Changes from baseline were also determined for clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, body temperature and body weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>Two previous phase II studies (NCT00618722 and NCT00618618) were used to determine a reduction in the expected CR-SMFRS and SSRS response rates for patients treated with ATX-101 to 80% of the observed rate relative to placebo. A 10% dropout rate (assumed to be non-responders) was anticipated in each treatment group. A conservatively rounded sample size of 120 patients per treatment group to guarantee a power of 90% was determined by using the Pearson chi-square test for two proportions (two-sided test with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.025) based on these response rates.</p><p>The ITT population was the primary population for the superiority analysis at Visit 7, and missing values were imputed using last observation carried forward. All statistical tests for comparison of treatments were two sided with a type I error rate of 0.05. Treatment comparisons for the two coprimary efficacy endpoints were made using odds ratios (ORs) from binary logistic regression and with a null hypothesis of no difference between each treatment group. The null hypotheses for both coprimary variables had to be rejected at the same significance level. This was accounted for by using the larger of the two <italic>P</italic>-values in the Bonferroni&#x02013;Holm testing procedure, which serves as adjustment for multiplicity.</p><p>A Pearson's chi-square test was applied for comparison of each treatment group with placebo regarding changes from baseline in PR-SMFRS and SLRS scores, and PR-SMFRS improvements of &#x02265;1 point were analysed by binary logistic regression. For PR-SMFIS, descriptive statistics were calculated and the change from baseline was analysed by an overall analysis of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) and post hoc Fisher's least significant difference tests for continuous variables if <sc>anova</sc> showed an overall treatment effect. Changes at Visit 7 from baseline for items on the subject-reported modified DAS 24 and Subject Global Questions were analysed using frequency tables and compared between treatment groups using a Pearson's chi-square test if applicable. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and clinical parameters. The number of AEs and patients with each AE were categorized based on association with treatment, study withdrawal, death, severity, intensity, system organ class and preferred term. Statistical summaries were based on TEAEs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics</title><p>The study was conducted between January 2011 and February 2012.

Some of the most common TEAEs associated with the treatment area were injection-site pain, swelling, numbness, bruising and induration (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>). These were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, with the exception of pain, which was more frequently moderate to severe but with a short median duration of 1&#x000a0;day for both ATX-101 groups.

Analgesics could also be prescribed at the physician's discretion. To prevent dilution of ATX-101 in the treatment area, local lidocaine injections were generally avoided, and were only administered to 15 and 12 patients in the ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> groups, respectively, compared with 14 patients in the placebo group. Among the patients receiving lidocaine injections, ATX-101 treatment still achieved a higher proportion of responders compared with placebo, as seen for the overall population.</p><p>ATX-101-related AEs were generally related to the injection procedure and were mostly transient and resolved between treatments (28-day interval). Induration, including fibrosis, for example, had a median duration of 15.0 and 21.0&#x000a0;days in the ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> groups, respectively, compared with 39.5&#x000a0;days in the placebo group. Only a very small number of AEs were not resolved at the 3-month follow-up, of which only one was considered a serious TEAE related to study treatment and was classified as injection-site nerve injury. In this case, the patient temporarily experienced an asymmetric smile, possibly due to injury of the branch of the nervus facialis on the right side of the face. This was most probably caused by incorrect injection technique. This patient did not require hospitalization or further treatment and the event subsequently resolved without sequelae. Seven patients reported nine serious TEAEs (one and two patients in the ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> and 2&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> groups, respectively, and four patients in the placebo group). No deaths occurred. There was no apparent relationship between ATX-101 and AEs that occurred outside the treatment area. In addition, no relevant changes in clinical laboratory tests or vital signs were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Treatment with ATX-101 resulted in significant reductions in SMF (CR-SMFRS) and increased patient satisfaction (SSRS) with the appearance of their face and chin. In addition, a range of secondary efficacy outcomes (PR-SMFRS, PR-SMFIS and other questionnaires) allowed SMF size and definition of the submental area to be reported by the patient, and to determine how SMF and the reduction of SMF may impact patients psychologically and influence their perceived attractiveness. A significant number of patients in both ATX-101 treatment groups reported an improvement in the definition of their chin/neck compared with patients in the placebo group. Overall, reduction in SMF with ATX-101 treatment was not associated with an undesirable increase in skin laxity. A significant level of satisfaction was established in several questionnaires for ATX-101 treatment compared with placebo, with patients expressing improvement in the way they felt about themselves and related to others.</p><p>Both ATX-101 regimens showed a similar safety profile, with TEAEs ranging from mild to severe in intensity but being mostly transient and generally associated with the treatment area. Given that the incidence of these events was also high with placebo, many of them may have been related to the injection procedure itself. Injection-site pain, bruising, swelling, erythema, numbness and induration were the most frequently experienced AEs. Appropriate, practiced technique is fundamental to adequate ATX-101 delivery into the SMF and to achieve efficient reduction with limited side-effects. The local inflammatory response that is induced by adipocytolysis, and is responsible for the clearance of cellular debris and removal of breakdown products,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> may also contribute to the observed TEAEs. The transient nature of these TEAEs was predictable based on phase I studies, which showed that ATX-101 does not accumulate at the injection site and is absorbed rapidly and removed through protein binding.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>A considerable placebo effect was observed during this study for outcomes such as CR-SMFRS, SSRS and PR-SMFRS scores and Subject Global Questions. The placebo effect is an extensively documented phenomenon, particularly in the aesthetic field,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> where outcomes based on subjective reports are frequently used. However, ATX-101 treatment achieved significantly better outcomes than placebo across the range of efficacy measures evaluated, with a consistent improvement recorded in the active treatment groups.</p><p>Overall, ATX-101 treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the submental convexity and amount of SMF, a significantly improved visual appearance of the submental area and, consequently, of the general appearance of the face. ATX-101 treatment had a positive impact on psychological quality of life/well-being, resulting in significant patient satisfaction with treatment and appearance in association with their face and chin. Therefore, ATX-101 represents an effective and well-tolerated, minimally invasive injectable means of reducing unwanted SMF in patients who are either unsuitable or unwilling to undergo extensive surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the investigators who contributed to and recruited patients for this study: Belgium: Hugo Boonen, Karen Vermeersch; France: Bernard Rossi, Jean-Michel Mazer, Philippe Humbert, Gilles Rostain; Germany: Yvonne Frambach, Beatrice Gerlach, Martina Kerscher, Roland Weisser, Anita R&#x000fc;tter, Sigrid Karrer, Welf Prager, Ernst Magnus Noah, Rolf-Markus Szeimies, Michael Sebastian, Martin Miehe, J&#x000fc;rgen Bauerschmitz, Margrit Simon, Bernd Kardorff; Italy: Nicol&#x000f2; Scuderi; Spain: Andres Marcos Vivas, Pedro P&#x000e9;rez Escariz; United Kingdom: Joshua Berkowitz, David Eccleston, Tahera Bhojani and Harryono Judodihardjo.
