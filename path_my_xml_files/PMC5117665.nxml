Here we used a zebrafish model of diet-induced obesity to analyze the impact of dietary intake on fertility and the phenotype of the next generation. Over an eight-week period, one group received 60 mg of food each day (60 mg arm), while another received 5 mg (5 mg arm). At the end of the diet, the body mass index of the 60 mg arm was 1.5 fold greater than the 5 mg arm. The intervention also had a marked impact on fertility; breeding success and egg production in the 60 mg arm were increased 2.1- and 6.2-fold compared to the 5 mg arm, respectively. Transcriptome analysis of eggs revealed that transcripts involved in metabolic biological processes differed according to dietary intake. The progeny from the differentially fed fish were more likely to survive when the parents had access to more food. An intergenerational crossover study revealed that while parental diet did not influence weight gain in the offspring, the progeny of well-fed parents had increased levels of physical activity when exposed again to high nutrient availability. We conclude that dietary intake has an important influence on fertility and the subsequent fitness of offspring, even prior to breeding.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Gravida: The National Center for Growth and Development</institution></funding-source><award-id>STF-14-27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horsfield</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from Gravida: The National Center for Growth and Development (STF-14-27) to JH.

But, in addition to the environment present during development, we should also consider the environment to which the parents are exposed. One of the most important factors in the environment is the availability of food. In 2008, it was estimated that there were 915 million undernourished people in the world [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, in that same year there was also estimated to be 1046 million adults that were overweight [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For parents, the availability of nutrients can have a strong influence on the health and development of their offspring, even before pregnancy.</p><p>Parental under- and overnutrition can reprogram the development of the next generation and alter their risk of disease [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One study concluded that parental obesity more than doubled the risk of adult obesity in the children [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The biological children of obese parents that were adopted into new families still became obese as adults, suggesting that the family environment cannot overcome parental effects [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, much attention has been given to the role that an abnormal in utero environment could play in programming fetal development [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Conceptual and empirical advances now support the possibility that traits acquired by parents might be inherited by the children, an idea that was rejected by classical genetics [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are now several epidemiological studies showing that environmental exposures can have transgenerational consequences. A notable study looked at historical longitudinal cohort data and observed that the paternal grandfather&#x02019;s food supply was associated with mortality in the grandsons; also, the paternal grandmother&#x02019;s food supply was associated with mortality among the granddaughters [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There has been intense interest in epigenetic modifiers (such as DNA methylation, chromatin structure and small RNAs), that can provide long-term changes in gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is thought that the inheritance of environmentally-induced epigenetic changes via the gametes could provide a mechanism for how transgenerational phenotypes arise [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Animal models allow prospective studies on the developmental consequences of environmental exposures in a way not possible in humans. Many studies on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance have been performed in rodents; indeed, some of the classic studies on obesity, epigenetics, and inheritance were conducted using the agouti viable yellow (A<sup>vy</sup>) mice [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the evidence now suggests that diet [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], toxic exposures [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], traumatic experiences [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and transient exposure to an altered genetic background [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] can all have a transgenerational impact. Recently, the use of surrogacy has been effective in providing insight into disease inheritance via the gametes [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, studies on transgenerational inheritance would benefit from an animal model with external fertilization. Zebrafish are well suited for studying development due to the ease with which they can be bred, the external fertilization of their eggs, and the number of eggs they produce. Recently, researchers have recognized the possibility of using zebrafish to model a range of human metabolic diseases, including obesity [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Like humans, fish carefully balance their energy intake, utilization and storage [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The major deposits of white adipose tissue in zebrafish adults are pancreatic, esophageal, visceral, subcutaneous, and cranial [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Models of zebrafish obesity have been described that derive from constitutive <italic>akt</italic> expression [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], <italic>agrp</italic> overexpression [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or a high-calorie diet [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Zebrafish subjected to diet-induced obesity developed by Oka et al. 2010 were found to have a higher body mass index, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatosteatosis, compared with calorie-restricted control zebrafish [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Oka et al. also showed that transcriptional changes in the visceral adipose tissue of their obese zebrafish were similar to gene expression changes found in mammalian obesity [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The group subsequently went on to show that interventions, including Campari tomato [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], green tea extract [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and Yuzu peel [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], could rescue the pathology observed in their model.</p><p>In this study, we adapted the model established by Oka et al. to look at the effect of parental nutrition on the health of the offspring. However, early on we found that the fish on the control diet showed signs of undernutrition, rather than maintaining their weight on this diet. We therefore refer to the dietary treatments in our experiment by the amount of food given to the fish, rather than designating treatment arms as control and overfed. Nonetheless, we found that the different dietary regimes had a notable impact on fertility, egg quality, and the phenotype of the offspring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish research was approved by the University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee. Mature zebrafish were maintained in 3.5 L tanks on a Palletized Centralized Life Support System (Tecniplast). The water in this recirculating system was pumped through mechanical filtration, charcoal filtration, and UV-treatment; and 10% of the water was replaced every hour. The water was kept at 26&#x02013;30&#x000b0;C, with pH 7.6&#x02013;8.0 and a conductivity of 300&#x02013;600 &#x003bc;S. The facility environment maintained a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark circadian cycle. Water quality parameters were automatically measured and adjusted, and remained within acceptable limits for the duration of the study.</p><p>Three groups of the ABPS in-house wild type line (derived from an AB line originally obtained from ZIRC) were used. Each group was born on a different day; at the time of the dietary intervention, the groups were aged eight (group 1), seven (group 2), and six (group 3) months post fertilization (mpf). Nutrition prior to the diet consisted of a dry feed twice a day of ZM zebrafish food (Zebrafish Management Ltd.) with the grade dependent on zebrafish age. ZM000 was given up until 14 days post fertilization (dpf), ZM100 was given between 15 and 35 dpf, ZM200 was given between 36 and 90 dpf, and ZM300/400 was given after 90 dpf.

Using ImageJ, a threshold was set to select the fish as objects, and watershedding was used to distinguish overlapping objects, the total distance travelled during the recording time was then measured for each tank [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The experimental fish were weighed and photographed before and after the dietary intervention in order to determine the weight gained.

Fish in the 60 mg arm also appeared more colorful, with increased sexual divergence in their coloration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s009">S1 Table</xref>).

The data support the idea that there is a correlation in the fish populations between physical activity and energy availability.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Parental nutrition has reproductive consequences</title><p>The fertility of the three groups of experimental fish was assessed following the dietary intervention. Crossing the fish with single partners within each tank revealed that pairs of fish in the 60 mg arm treatment arm were more likely to breed successfully (produce eggs) than the incrosses of fish within the 5 mg arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166394.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

We found that the odds of breeding increased 4.9 fold (95% CI: 1.5&#x02013;16.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), compared to incrosses (F: 5 mg x M: 5 mg), when a female from the 60 mg arm was used (F: 60 mg x M: 5 mg) while the inverse cross had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166394.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). While this pattern held true for group 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), it did not hold for group 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), the oldest group, where the breeding success for the F: 5 mg x M: 60 mg cross was significantly greater than that observed in group 2 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and group 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Overall, the results suggest that the female diet contributed more than the male diet towards breeding success.</p><p>The dietary intervention had a similar effect on the size of the clutches of eggs produced by the fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). First, it should be noted that, compared to group 1, the younger fish in group 3 produced smaller clutches; for incrosses in the 5 mg arm this rate was 0.8 fold (95% CI: 0.6&#x02013;1.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) lower. As with breeding success (above), the clutch sizes were unchanged when males from the 60 mg arm were crossed to females from the 5 mg arm (F: 5 mg x M: 60 mg), relative to incrosses within the 5 mg arm. However, when females from the 60 mg arm were crossed to males within the 5 mg arm (F: 60 mg x M: 5 mg), in group 3 the eggs were produced at a rate 1.6 fold (95% CI: 1.0&#x02013;2.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.049) higher than incrosses within the 5 mg arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that the females in the 60 mg arm of group 3 showed a non-significant trend towards having larger ovaries, these were 47 &#x000b1; 14 mg compared to 21 &#x000b1; 3 mg in the 5 mg arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s009">S1 Table</xref>). In summary, following the dietary intervention, females in the 60 mg arm were more likely to breed and produce larger clutches of eggs than the females in the 5 mg arm.</p><p>In contrast to the trend of increased breeding success and clutch size with increased nutrition, the incidence of egg fertilization did not differ between incrosses within the 60 mg arm and incrosses within the 5 mg arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s002">S2G&#x02013;S2I Fig</xref>). However, there was a high incidence of egg fertilization in the crosses of males from the 60 mg arm with females from the 5 mg arm (F: 5 mg x M: 60 mg) and a low incidence of egg fertilization in the crosses of males from the 5 mg arm with females from the 60 mg arm (F: 60 mg x M: 5 mg), that was consistent across the three groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166394.s002">S2G&#x02013;S2I Fig</xref>). In group 3, this difference reached statistical significance with the males from the 60 mg arm increasing the incidence of egg fertilization by 7% (IRR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.06&#x02013;1.09, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), relative to the incross within the 5 mg arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166394.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

The fertilized eggs hatched at the expected rate, typically at 2 dpf, with 99% (average across all groups) having hatched by 3 dpf.

Tail malformation in larvae, occurred sporadically at a frequency of 1% (average across all groups) and was not affected by the parental diet. However, there was acephaly (larvae that developed without a head) among 0.5% of offspring produced by incrosses within the 60 mg arm. This malformation was apparent at 1 dpf, in group 1 (n = 1 in 268 embryos), group 2 (n = 2 in 317 embryos), and group 3 (n = 1 in 227 embryos), and was never observed in crosses with the 5 mg arm.

It is therefore a concern that dietary manipulations used in one lab may not be readily reproduced by another. When we adapted the Oka et al. feeding protocol we observed significant weight loss on the &#x02018;control&#x02019; diet. However, the fish receiving the control diet in the study by Oka et al. did not show weight loss; rather, there was a small weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This suggests that different fish populations may respond differently to dietary regimes depending on their original facility conditions.</p><p>A combination of factors may underlie the different response to the Oka et al. feeding protocol that we observed in this study. When considering the control diet, Oka et al. aimed to provide the fish with 20 calories [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], citing Pannevis et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] who estimated the maintenance energy required by a 300 mg <italic>Danio</italic>. While the fish used in our experiment were older, they were still under 300 mg and so the caloric requirement should have been equivalent. Furthermore, weight loss in the control diet was still observed in the F<sub>1</sub> fish, which were young and small at the start of the intervention. Another difference is that Oka et al. used freshly hatched <italic>Artemia</italic> while this study used 1-day post-hatch <italic>Artemia</italic>; this could have resulted in 22&#x02013;37% less energy for the fish in this study [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition to these factors we expect a contribution from the background levels of feeding in the facility. This study highlights a need to standardize the zebrafish feeding protocols [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and conduct more basic research on zebrafish nutrition and metabolism.</p><p>Organisms must make important decisions about how to invest their limited resources among competing processes such as growth and reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The treatment arms used in this study reflect a spectrum of nutrient availability, from restriction in the 5 mg arm to excess in the 60 mg arm. We observed a correlation between the availability of metabolic resources and levels of physical activity; this is consistent with the finding that chronic food-deprivation in zebrafish reduces levels of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We expect that the size of the fish, which was altered by the diet, contributed to activity levels. Investing energy in swimming activity would provide several advantages for a fish in terms of escaping predators, searching for food, and finding a mate [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Increased resource availability improved breeding success and egg production for females and improved fertilization rates for males. Given the important role of male behavior in the mating process, breeding success is not likely to be explained solely by the levels of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast to breeding success, the clutch size is a more specific phenotype and might be linked directly to the metabolic resources available to the females. Unlike mammalian females that produce a limited number of germ cells that are arrested in meiosis prior to birth, adult fish ovaries contain mitotic germ cells and are always producing new eggs [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While the increased resource availability improved the fertilization rates from males, likely due to improved sperm quality, there were decreased fertilization rates from the females. Given increased clutch sizes, lower fertilization rates might allow the best eggs to be selected for further development.</p><p>A biological association between obesity and infertility is well described in humans, for both males [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and females [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, in our study, the fish did not appear to develop obesity-related infertility. Zebrafish may not recapitulate the human obesity condition due to species-specific differences in sedentary behavior or differences in diet composition such the amount of fat or sugar consumed [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is possible that establishing the amount of food required to reach satiety and optimizing the duration of the dietary intervention could lead to conditions that better reproduce human obesity in fish populations. Furthermore, while weight gain can be detrimental to modern human health, under environmental conditions where nutrients are limited, gaining weight can be advantageous [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The parental diet influenced the development of the offspring and altered their energy balance in adulthood. As highly fecund animals, zebrafish produce many offspring that have a low probability of survival through maturation [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We found that nutrient availability before breeding improved offspring quality, as evident by the increased probability of surviving to adulthood. The parental diet also influenced the regulation of energy utilization as indicated by the increased levels of activity when both the F<sub>0</sub> and the F<sub>1</sub> received the high abundance diet. One possible explanation is that parental exposure to a scarce food supply resulted in the offspring being metabolically programmed towards energy conservation [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This poor parental environment might then, under certain environmental conditions, provide a fitness advantage for the offspring.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling of the unfertilized eggs showed signs of adaptation towards greater resource availability. Comparing the changes to those observed in other studies highlighted the link between diet, metabolism, and transcription. In our study, high nutrient availability led to an enrichment of factors promoting growth in the eggs, a finding supported by the increased yolk size and lipid content in the embryos. The nutrient-restricted eggs showed a relative upregulation of many genes suggesting a need to activate more pathways in preparation for their development. Our data point to the process of translation as a contributor to the intergenerational effects of parental diet. This finding is supported by recent studies in animal models that have shown that tRNA-derived small RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and ribosomal RNA copy number [<xref rid="pone.0166394.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] can be affected by parental and be transmitted to the next generation.</p><p>The availability of nutrients influenced the allocation of metabolic resources in the embryo. High nutrient availability led to enrichment of growth promotion pathways, better survival, and higher motility in the offspring. This result suggests that these individuals had inherited more resources, promoting their fitness. In contrast, low nutrient availability led to lower survival, conservation of motile energy and relative upregulation of metabolic pathways, suggesting embryos had to conserve and build metabolic resources, having not inherited these from their parents. In this way, parental nutritional status can alter metabolic decision-making in offspring with consequent impact on survival and energy expenditure. Conservation of these phenomena through the animal kingdom remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0166394.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Phenotypic changes resulting from nutrient availability.</title><p>Gross phenotypic changes in all three of the groups used in the study.
