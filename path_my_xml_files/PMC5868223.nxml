The precede phase of the model consists of five phases. Phase 1 &#x02013; social diagnosis (community forums, nominal groups, focus groups, surveys and interviews), Phase 2 &#x02013; epidemiological diagnosis (vital statistics, years of potential life loss, disability, prevalence, and morbidity), Phase 3 &#x02013; behavioural and environmental diagnosis (personal and environmental diagnosis), Phase 4 &#x02013; education and organizational diagnosis (predisposing factors (knowledge, beliefs, and values), enablers (accessibility, availability and skills), Phase 5 &#x02013; administrative and policy diagnosis (the analysis of policies, resources and circumstances prevailing organizational situations that could hinder or facilitate the development of the health program.</p><p>The PRECEDE-PROCEED model can be used to design and evaluate an eye health promotion effort. The PRECEDE component allows a researcher to work backward from the ultimate goal of the research to create a blueprint to instruct the formation of the intervention or strategy.

Simple random was performed in the selection of the schools. According to this data, there are 41 primary schools in S&#x000f6;ke. Three primary schools were selected by simple random sampling method.</p><p>With the power analysis performed, 5% error, 95% confidence interval, and minimum sample size of 0.5 effect magnitude were determined as 87, respectively, according to significance level. Two of these three primary schools were randomly assigned as experimental school control groups. In the randomization of the students who are in these schools, the students in the experimental and control groups were determined with simple random order. Ninety-eight students were included in the study group. The two students in the control group were separated due to relocation due to health problems in three students without research. The difference between the individual characteristics of the experiment and control group (age, gender, socioeconomic status, and social security) was examined. As a result of the analyzes made, it was found that the experiment and control group were identical in terms of the examined factors (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Criteria for entering the study were agreeing to participate in the study, studying in the third grade, not having received education on eye health protection. Moreover, exclusion criteria were a not agreeing to participate in the study, having received education on eye health protection. All students who had inclusion criteria for the study were invited. Of the 196 students who were eligible for entering the study, 191 students were ready to participate in research. The data were collected through a six-part questionnaire including.</p><p>An anonymous 20-item questionnaire was compiled and distributed to students. The form was categorized into three sections including, the knowledge (8 questions), attitude (7 questions), and practice related (5 questions). Knowledge questions focused on issues such as how long should you use the television (TV) and computer, how long and when the eyes should rest, what is the effect of outdoor activity on eye health, how near working behaviors affect eye health.</p><p>Participants were also asked questions such as regular eye examinations, whether he regularly used glasses and sunglasses. To make more accurate judgments about students&#x02019; answers, a numerical value was assigned to each correct answer: knowledge (each correct answer = 5), attitude (each correct answer = 5), and practice (each correct answer = 5) questions. The minimum and maximum scores were 0 and 100, respectively, questions. Scores were not categorized as poor, medium, and good scores. Statistical comparison of the difference between the scores obtained.</p><p>The content validity of the designed questionnaire was approved by 5 education specialists and 5 eye health specialists. The content validity of the questionnaire was assessed by the content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI). The CVR was calculated between 0.69 and 0.78 to reject or retain each item of the questionnaire. For CVI, the wordings of the questions were evaluated in terms of relevance, simplicity, and clarity and found to range from 0.75 to 0.96. The internal consistency reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha (&#x003b1; = 0.96).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Training materials</title><p>Three training materials were developed for the eye health promotion program.

At the end of the 6-month follow-up, again the final test data were collected from the experimental and the control group.

Parents&#x02019; questions were answered through phone calls every month.</p><p>The education was provided only to the experimental group. In addition, during the follow-up, the students provided the researcher with the medical report of their eye examination. The parents&#x02019; questions were answered through phone calls during the follow-up. Three weeks after the education program ended, the posttest was administered. The parents were asked to fill out the follow-up form on students eye health-protective behaviors and instructed to follow-up their children for 1 month.</p><p>The researcher held a face-to-face interview with the parents of the students in the experimental and control groups in June and collected the 1 month follow-up forms. During this interview, the parents were educated on the importance of follow-up. They were asked to monitor their children's eye health-protective behaviors during the 3-month summer holiday and record the data. They were given three follow-up forms, one to be completed each month. After the holiday, the students gave the completed follow-up forms to their teachers, and the researcher collected the forms from the teachers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data obtained from this study were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 software SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11<sup>th</sup> Floor, Chicago, IL 60606-6412.

The near working behaviors of the experimental group improved in the final follow-up, compared to the pretest (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). No significant change was observed in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>It was found that increasing the time that children spend outdoors is important. This reduces the time spent in near working activities, increases the visibility range of eyes, and helps prevent the development and progression of myopia in children.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Paudel <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) reported that the average time spent outdoors per week was 4 h for myopic children, and 4.5 h for nonmyopic children and that the difference was significant. They also found that myopic children spent more time (4.2 h) indoors, and less time in outdoor activities (1.9 h) per week, than nonmyopic children. They indicated that the time spent outdoors has a protective effect in the prevention of myopia development.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the students in the experimental group were found to spend more time outdoors (10.46 &#x000b1; 5.37 h) than those in the control group (7.65 &#x000b1; 6.68 h) in the final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The students&#x02019; knowledge on eye health increased in the experimental group in the final follow-up compared to the pretest (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and no significant difference was found between the students&#x02019; knowledge on eye health in the pretest and final follow-up for the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Hobday <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) presented a 9-week education program on eye health in several schools.

In addition, the effect of eye health protective and promoting behaviors on the occurrence or prevention of visual problems can be analyzed in the future studies.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The period of time (6 months) for evaluating behaviors to improve eye health in students after the end of the eye health promotion program is the limit of this research. Another limitation of the assessment of behavioral changes expected of students, other than going to the eye doctor for examination, is due to the memory factor of the students, the parents, and the teachers&#x02019; self-reports.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><article-title>Universal Eye Health.
