Forty-five healthy, female volunteers (25.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x000a0;years, BMI 25.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who had not taken hormonal contraceptives for a minimum of 2&#x000a0;months were recruited. A 20&#x000a0;mg dose of Letrozole was administered once orally in each of 3 groups when the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 1) 12&#x000a0;mm, 2) 18&#x000a0;mm, 3) the first day following ovulation (post-ovulation), or 4) treatment was withheld (control). Serial ultrasonography and phlebotomy began on day 4 of the menstrual cycle and continued for 1.5 menstrual cycles. Participants recorded menses and daily events in a life events calendar for the duration of the study. Demographic and single point measurements were compared among groups by ANOVA. Changes in hormone concentrations over time were compared among groups by repeated measures ANOVA. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for non-normally distributed data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The dominant follicle in all treatment groups ovulated. There were no differences among experimental groups in peak follicle diameter, follicular growth rate, endometrial thickness at ovulation or inter-ovulatory interval. Plasma concentrations of estradiol dropped, while FSH and LH concentrations rose following treatment in all treatment groups. Plasma FSH and LH concentrations were higher in the 18&#x000a0;mm group compared to the 12&#x000a0;mm and post-ovulation groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of a single 20&#x000a0;mg dose of Letrozole at the times of the menstrual cycle we examined did not induce dominant follicle regression or failure of corpus luteum formation. Letrozole-induced suppression of estradiol synthesis by the dominant follicle was not detrimental to follicle growth or ovulation following follicle selection, likely due to increased circulating concentrations of FSH and LH resulting from a lack of estradiol-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration number</title><p>Clinical trials registration number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01046578">NCT01046578</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aromatase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Follicular phase</kwd><kwd>Ovulation</kwd><kwd>Estradiol</kwd><kwd>Endometrium</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CA)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The traditional model of folliculogenesis during the human menstrual cycle posits that a single cohort of antral follicles in the ovary begins to grow at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and a dominant follicle is physiologically selected in the mid-follicular phase: ovulation of the dominant follicle occurs approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks following the onset of menses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, a more current model has evolved through the use of serial transvaginal ultrasonography which enabled detailed characterization of follicular and luteal dynamics through the identification of definitive ovarian points of reference; i.e., the occurrence of ovulation and the emergence of follicular waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Menses occurs in the middle of the inter-ovulatory interval and the final of 2 or 3 waves of follicle development culminates in ovulation. Descriptions of antral follicle waves in women are consistent with follicular wave dynamics observed during the estrus cycles of several domestic animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Data from Canada and the United States emphasize the need for a better understanding of the regulation of ovarian function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as the use of emergency and cyclic hormonal contraception increases. In 2006, approximately 450,000 pregnancies were documented in Canada and 20% ended in elective termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, 51% of the 6.7 million documented pregnancies in the United States in 2008 were unintended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with 40% of unintended pregnancies ending in elective termination (20% of all pregnancies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The Centers for Disease Control reported 11% of 15&#x02013;44 year olds and 23% of 20&#x02013;24 year olds had ever used an emergency contraceptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The reasons for use were fear of contraceptive failure (45%) and unprotected sex (49%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Croxatto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have demonstrated the occurrence of ovulation following emergency contraception administration varied depending on the size of the follicle at administration. The closer the follicle size was to preovulatory, the less likely treatment with a full or half dose of emergency contraception was going to prevent ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, the mechanism of action for combined hormonal contraception use as an emergency contraceptive is not well understood and investigations into the removal of endogenous estrogen would provide a unique opportunity to evaluate mechanisms of steroidogenesis impact on folliculogenesis.</p><p>The non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) Letrozole (Femara<sup>TM</sup>) reversibly inactivates the aromatase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and prevents the enzymatic conversion of androgens to estrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Letrozole is the most commonly used AI for ovulation induction and has been used successfully when administered between days 3 and 7 of the follicular phase as small 5-day dose (2.5 or 5.0&#x000a0;mg/day) and large single dose (20&#x000a0;mg) regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To date, there are no reports of AI use initiated at other points of follicle growth in humans.</p><p>The decline in FSH coupled with the rise in estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) early in the follicular phase is well documented; however, the response of post-deviation follicles to decreasing E<sub>2</sub> and increasing FSH is not well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the bovine model of ovarian function, neither a single nor 3&#x000a0;day AI dosing protocol was able to induce regression of a dominant follicle nor cause an increase FSH release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Yapura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] observed a lengthened follicular dominance and increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) with a single and 3&#x000a0;day AI dosing protocol. Single and multi-day dosing in humans and animal models demonstrated similar results, therefore the use of the single day protocol should be viewed as most appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A better understanding of the role of estrogen in controlling folliculogenesis, and the effects of aromatase inhibitors on post-deviation ovarian function may lead to the development of better protocols for both fertility and contraception. Thus, the overall objectives of the present study were to evaluate mechanistically the ovarian and endocrine effects of Letrozole treatment when administered at the time of dominant follicle selection, the immediate pre-ovulatory period and immediate post-ovulatory period during natural menstrual cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective pilot study was conducted using a controlled, randomized complete block, open label design at a single center.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-five women between the ages of 18 and 35&#x000a0;years (25.5&#x000a0;years&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9; mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) with a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x02013;32 (25.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6) were enrolled and 41 women completed the study.

Most examinations (95%) were performed by one operator (HCMA); the remaining examinations were performed by co-authors. Participants were monitored for 1.5 menstrual cycles (i.e., from the first menses of the observational period to the first ovulation after the second menses). Beginning on day 4 (day 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;first day of menses), ultrasonographic examinations were performed every-other-day until the day of letrozole treatment in the peri-selection (12&#x000a0;mm) group or until the dominant follicle was&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;mm in diameter in all other experimental groups when ultrasound examinations were done daily thereafter for a minimum of 11&#x000a0;days or until the fate of the dominant follicle was determined (i.e., regression, formation of an anovulatory follicular cyst, hemorrhagic anovulatory follicle (HAF), luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) or ovulation (OV)). Following ovulation, women in the control group were then examined every-other-day until the post-treatment ovulatory follicle attained a 16&#x000a0;mm diameter. Daily examinations then resumed until the subsequent ovulation. In all treatment groups, subsequent ultrasound examinations were conducted every-other-day from the time that the dominant follicle&#x02019;s fate was determined until the post-treatment ovulatory follicle was&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;mm in diameter; daily examinations then resumed until the subsequent ovulation.

</p><p>The number and diameter of antral ovarian follicles&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;mm were imaged and tabulated during each ultrasound examination to assess the day of wave emergence. The average of two orthogonal measurements was used as the mean follicle diameter for all follicles&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mm. The dominant follicle was defined as the follicle&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mm that surpassed the diameter of all other follicles in the cohort by&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;mm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subordinate follicles were defined as all other follicles in the cohort with the dominant follicle and the 1<sup>st</sup> subordinate follicle was the largest of the subordinate follicles.

Ovulation was defined as the disappearance of a follicle&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;mm in diameter detected ultrasonographically the previous day, followed by subsequent visualization of a corpus luteum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Wave emergence was defined retrospectively as the day when the largest follicle of each wave was first identified at 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mm.

Briefly, endometrial thickness was measured as the distance from the anterior stratum basalis-myometrial junction to the posterior stratum basalis-myometrial junction in the mid-sagittal plane. The transverse and sagittal planes of section which represented the largest dimensions of the fundal aspect of the endometrium were used for all measurements. Endometrial echotexture pattern was assessed each day as either an M, A, B, C or D pattern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Blood sampling</title><p>In the treatment groups blood samples were taken daily for 5&#x000a0;days beginning on the day of treatment.

In all participants a single blood sample was taken 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;days after the fate of the follicle was known. A final blood sample was taken when the pre-ovulatory follicle of the second cycle reached 18&#x000a0;mm.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p>The dominant follicle observed in all treatment groups ovulated and there were no differences among experimental groups for peak follicle diameter, follicular growth rate, nor endometrial thickness at ovulation. As expected E<sub>2</sub> concentration declined, while both FSH and LH concentrations increased following administration of a single 20&#x000a0;mg dose of AI in all treatment groups. Differences among groups in P<sub>4</sub> concentrations, inter-menstrual interval and inter-ovulatory interval were not observed, therefore, we concluded that there was no effect of treatment on luteogenesis.</p><p>Concentrations of serum E<sub>2</sub>, FSH and LH on the day before receiving treatment in each group did not exceed previously published ranges for the specified physiologic time points in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] nor did they differ from the control group at the same time point. Decreased E<sub>2</sub> was observed within 24&#x000a0;h of AI administration in all women, supporting our hypotheses that treatment with an AI would cause a transient drop in E<sub>2</sub>. These findings contrast studies in the bovine model, where increasing plasma E<sub>2</sub> concentrations were observed for 4&#x000a0;days following AI administration in metestrous. The E<sub>2</sub> increase was associated with a simultaneous increase in follicle diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which is similar to the continued follicle development in all our treatment groups despite the drop in E<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In the 12&#x000a0;mm group an increase in E<sub>2</sub> concentrations began 2&#x000a0;days after AI administration and was attributed to the health and continued growth of the pre-ovulatory dominant follicle, while the absence of a rise in E<sub>2</sub> in the 18&#x000a0;mm and post-ovulation groups has been attributed to the physiologic drop in E<sub>2</sub> secretion following ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A compensatory mechanism for the preservation of follicle growth and ovulation following the acute drop in E<sub>2</sub> after AI administration may be explained by the observation of increases in FSH and LH concentrations.</p><p>All treatment groups exhibited a rise in FSH following treatment in the present study. Garcia-Velasco et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] demonstrated a 7&#x000a0;day delay in a rise in FSH when Letrozole was administered during the luteal phase. Both documented rises in luteal FSH concentrations in women contrast with a lack of FSH change in the bovine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study, all three groups exhibited a typical mid follicular phase rise in FSH during the 4&#x000a0;days immediately following treatment. A 4-day rise in FSH following aromatase inhibitor treatment later in the follicular phase (day 12 and 18) appeared to elongate the FSH rise thus potentially allowing multiple dominant follicles to develop.</p><p>Circulating LH concentrations reached maximum concentrations within 24&#x000a0;h of treatment and returned to initial concentrations by the end of the observation interval in all groups. The rise in LH concentrations within 24&#x000a0;h is consistent with reports of AI treatment in the bovine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A sustained elevation in LH following cessation of follicular phase AI administration has not previously been reported in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Bedaiwy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] documented no difference in LH concentrations in AI treated cycles compared to natural cycles up to day 11 of the menstrual cycle; however, treatment with 2.5&#x000a0;mg AI led to significantly lower LH on the day of hCG administration. It has been suggested that the prolonged elevation in LH following aromatase inhibitor treatment in the follicular and luteal phases indirectly enhances dominant follicle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>When treatment was administered at a 12&#x000a0;mm follicle diameter the selected follicle continued to grow, and attained a larger pre-ovulatory size compared with the 18&#x000a0;mm treatment group and control group and there was a tendency for the follicle to be larger than observed in the post-ovulation group. However, in the 18&#x000a0;mm group there was no change in follicle diameter at ovulation compared to the control group. The trend towards a larger ovulatory follicle in the 12&#x000a0;mm group may be related to the acute drop in E<sub>2</sub> in the mid-follicular phase. We postulated that the compensatory rise in FSH and LH following an AI induced drop in E<sub>2</sub> accentuated follicular growth. However, within the constraints imposed by our study design, we were unable to conclude that AI treatment affects ovulatory follicle diameter.</p><p>Our observation of an unaltered growth profile is in contrast with the bovine model where a single, large dose of letrozole after follicle selection prolonged the interval from treatment to ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To date, there has been no in depth evaluation of the effects of AI use on follicle growth profiles when administered prior to dominant follicle selection (i.e., 10&#x000a0;mm diameter). In retrospect, it would have been useful to have include a treatment group in which women received Letrozole on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day following menses an prior to follicle selection. Initiation of AI treatment prior to selection has been documented in ovulation induction, which appears to release negative feedback on FSH secretion and stimulate further growth of the extant follicular wave; however, available studies did not measure changes in FSH during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In natural menstrual cycles, the duration of the FSH rise at wave emergence is short and it is presumed that this is due to the negative feedback system of E2 and inhibin B. This mechanism is postulated to ensure monovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, multiple dominant follicles were developed by women in the 12&#x000a0;mm, 18&#x000a0;mm and control groups in the follicular phase of the treatment cycle. In the 12&#x000a0;mm group, 20% of the women ovulated two follicles during the treatment period, in contrast with the reported 4% natural occurrence of double ovulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another participant in the 12&#x000a0;mm group developed a second dominant follicle that regressed. This observation is conceptually similar to a recent study in the bovine model wherein the 1<sup>st</sup> subordinate follicle of animals given an AI in the follicular growth phase (day 1&#x02013;3) exhibited larger mean diameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It was postulated that an extended mid follicular phase FSH rise in women allowed a subordinate follicle to be rescued from atresia. In both the 18&#x000a0;mm and control groups, a second dominant follicle grew but either regressed (10%) or resulted in ovulatory failure (9%). Ovulatory failure occurs in approximately 5% of cycles of regularly cycling women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and 10% of cycles in infertile women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. An increased incidence of ovulatory failure was not observed in the present study.</p><p>We were limited in our ability to evaluate the impact of AI treatment on luteal function. We hypothesized that AI treatment would result in ovulatory failure and hence did not anticipate a need for the evaluation of serial luteal phase P<sub>4</sub>. We were also limited in our ability to directly assess differences between the control group in this pilot study and each of the treatment groups across the entire treatment timeframe. Blood draws in the control group were timed only to coincide with the times of letrozole treatment. An optimal design to facilitate comparison of the control group to the treatment groups during the observation interval would have required volunteers to submit to daily blood collection for approximately 15 consecutive days. We were already limited by our ability to attract volunteers for the study protocol as executed. We were also financially unable to support a separate control group in this study for each treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Aromatase inhibitor treatment at follicle diameters of 12&#x000a0;mm or 18&#x000a0;mm or 24&#x000a0;h post ovulation were associated with a transient decrease in E<sub>2</sub> concentrations and elevated circulating FSH and LH concentrations during the 4&#x000a0;days following treatment. The drop in E<sub>2</sub> concentration did not suppress dominant follicle growth or early corpus luteum development.

There is no reason to suspect other commercially available aromatase inhibitors (i.e., anastrozole) would have different effect than the observations made with letrozole on ovarian function.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AI</term><def><p>Aromatase inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>E<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>Estradiol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSH</term><def><p>Follicle stimulating hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAF</term><def><p>Hemorrhagic anovulatory follicle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LH</term><def><p>Luteinizing hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LUF</term><def><p>Luteinized unruptured follicle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OV</term><def><p>Ovulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P<sub>4</sub></term><def><p>Progesterone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHIRL</term><def><p>Women&#x02019;s Health Imaging Research Laboratory</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the volunteers whose participation and dedication was invaluable for the completion of this study.
