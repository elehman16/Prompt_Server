Several evidence based strategies in secondary prevention of stroke are available but frequently underused. Support programs with multifactorial risk factor modifications after stroke or TIA have not been investigated in large-scale prospective controlled trials so far. INSPiRE-TMS is a prospective, multi-center, randomized open intervention trial for intensified secondary prevention after minor stroke and TIA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients with acute TIA or minor stroke admitted to the participating stroke centers are screened and recruited during in-hospital stay. Patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to intervention (support program) and control (usual care) arms. Inclusion of 2.082 patients is planned. The support program includes cardiovascular risk factor measurement and feedback, monitoring of medication adherence, coaching in lifestyle modifications, and active involvement of relatives. Standardized motivational interviewing is used to assess and enhance patients&#x02019; motivation. Primary objective is a reduction of new major vascular events defined as nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction or vascular death. Recruitment time is planned for 3.5 years, follow up time is at least 2 years for every patient resulting in a total study time of 5 years (first patient in to last patient out).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the high risk for vascular re-events in acute stroke and the available effective strategies in secondary prevention, the INSPIRE-TMS support program has the potential to lead to a relevant reduction of recurrent events and a prolongation of the event-free survival time. The trial will provide the basis for the decision whether an intensified secondary prevention program after stroke should be implemented into regular care. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>clinicaltrials.gov: 01586702</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TIA</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Secondary prevention</kwd><kwd>Intervention trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Patients with recent stroke or TIA are at high risk for a recurrent stroke or other major vascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Despite this high risk and the availability of evidence based secondary prevention strategies, risk factor control and medication adherence frequently remain under recommended targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>This observation has a variety of reasons: Although at much higher risk, post-stroke patients do often not receive more intensive medical care than patients in primary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The separation of health systems in hospital-based and outpatient care as in Germany is a major barrier for optimal secondary prevention as recommendations given in the acute stroke facility are frequently not followed by primary care physicians (in part depending on their specialty) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Another problem is that despite a high motivation for optimal secondary prevention shortly after experiencing the initial cerebrovascular event, many patients don&#x02019;t stick with the recommended measures over a longer time period. One-third of stroke patients discontinue secondary prevention medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and control of arterial hypertension as the most important risk factor for stroke remains unsatisfactory across countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Positive experiences with structured support programs have been gained in other diseases such as diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], coronary heart syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and arterial hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] yielding better quality of risk factor control and remarkable reductions in clinical event rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Considering the typical stroke and TIA population which consists mainly of elderly patients frequently having multiple risk factors and a high risk for dependency after a recurrent event, a structured supported secondary prevention program after stroke appears promising. However, it has never been tested in an adequately powered trial. As a consequence, stroke has not been selected for chronic disease management programs.</p><p>A recent observation strengthens the hypothesis that patients with cerebrovascular disease are likely to benefit from a multimodal secondary prevention scheme. Intensified medical treatment in patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis (forming the control arm and compared against stenting) was associated with a more than 50% lower recurrence rate in the SAMMPRIS trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] compared to patients with the same inclusion criteria but non supported secondary prevention in the WASID trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However this effect was not observed in a face-to-face trial but in a comparison with a historical cohort.</p><p>The INSPiRE-TMS trial is therefore designed to evaluate the effects of a structured support program focussing on cardiovascular risk factor control, monitoring of medication adherence, coaching in lifestyle modifications, and active involvement of relatives over a period of at least 2 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>INSPIRE is a prospective, multi-center, randomized open intervention trial for intensified secondary prevention initiated and coordinated by the Center for Stroke Research Berlin.

Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) will be calculated from height and weight measurements. Blood pressure will be measured manually in sitting patients (resting at least 5 min) on both arms. Both blood pressure values will be recorded and the higher value will be used for statistical comparisons. Arterial hypertension is defined by either repeated elevated systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;140 and/or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;90 mm Hg or the previous use of antihypertensive drugs. Diabetes is defined by either HbA1c &#x02265;6.5% or use of antidiabetics. Hyperlipidemia is defined by either LDL cholesterol&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;100 mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering drugs. Smoking will be evaluated in number of cigarettes per day and in pack years. Patients who currently don&#x02019;t smoke will be divided in non-smokers and past smokers (within the last 5 years). The time since smoking cessation will be documented. Physical activity is measured as frequency of &#x0201c;physical activity with an intensity leading to transpiration and/or elevated breathing frequency over more than 30 min&#x0201d; per week. Detailed and structured information concerning vascular risk factor targets will be given to the patients before discharge and these recommendations will be included in the discharge letter to primary care physicians (PCP) irrespective of the trial allocation.</p><p><italic>Standard care</italic> will consist of outpatient care usually guided by a primary care physician.

A secondary ischemic event has considerably more serious consequences leading to physical disability in more than 60% and death in more than 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition to the medical and personal impact of the recurrent stroke, the costs of recurrent events and rehospitalisation are enormous. Lifetime costs per first ever stroke case are more than 40.000 Euro in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Growing evidence suggests that early diagnostic work-up with consequent initiation of multimodal preventive measures results in a major reduction of re-events. In patients with TIA, the &#x0201c;effect of urgent treatment of transient ischemic attack and minor stroke on early recurrent stroke&#x0201d; (EXPRESS) study was conducted as a population based sequential comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It demonstrated that urgent assessment of stroke aetiology and early start of secondary prevention was associated with reduced risk for recurrent stroke. The interventions comprised immediate start of poly-pharmaceutical risk factor control, antithrombotic therapy and interventional treatment for symptomatic carotid stenosis. However, patients were followed-up for only three months. Very similar effects were found in the SOS-TIA study with much lower recurrence rates as expected according to the ABCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Hence, it seems of crucial importance to start a secondary prevention program at an early stage after the cerebrovascular event. This is particularly important because shortly after the index event, patients are generally very motivated for participation in a structured support program.</p><p>In contrast to other diseases such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and COPD, stroke has not been selected for chronic disease management programs in Germany. Therefore, neither hospitals nor primary care physicians are able to offer intensive monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors to patients after stroke or TIA. Recommendations given in discharge letters frequently focus on medical treatments but not on recommendations regarding non-pharmacological treatments such as life style modifications including physical activities and dietary aspects. Family members are usually not involved in the treatment concepts. Since lifestyle is strongly influenced by the social network, patients frequently continue the unhealthy lifestyle. Smoking, poor diet coupled with physical inactivity and alcohol consumption are still leading causes of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>While the primary objective of INSPiRE-TMS is to investigate the effects of a structured multifactorial support program on the vascular re-event-free survival time, a number of completed or ongoing randomized studies examine effects of supported secondary prevention on differences in risk factor control, medication adherence or surrogate parameters. To our knowledge, none of them has been adequately powered to detect a difference in vascular recurrence free survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Some limitations of the study will need to be considered: First, there is a potential contamination effect in patients who are randomized to the control group. With the information given before randomization and during follow-up visits, these patients may be better informed about effective vascular prevention compared to the normal post-stroke population. This effect is frequently seen in prospective controlled trials. However, it seems unlikely that this contamination will lead to the same effect as the structured intervention program. Second, the information about life style parameters, adverse events and endpoint events will be self-reported. Thus, self-reported errors are to be expected in both groups and expectation bias by study personnel may occur in follow-up documentation. In order to control for these biases, follow-up assessment is planned to be done by study nurses blinded to the trial arm and not involved in the individual support program. The primary endpoints and serious adverse events will be documented in a written form by the patient prior to the follow-up-interview and will be adjudicated by a blinded Endpoint Committee. Third, the study is conducted in two European health systems and generalizability of the study results may therefore be questioned. However, the methods of intervention are standardized as far as possible in individual counseling and both the quality of risk factor control and rate of recurrent events will be described in detail in the control and intervention arms. This should allow a projection of the study results into other health systems.</p><p>In summary, the INSPiRE-TMS trial is designed to answer the question whether a structured support program for secondary prevention after a cerebrovascular event is effective in reducing new major vascular events. The results of the trial are expected for the year 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BI: Barthel Index; BP: Blood pressure; BMI: Body Mass Index; CHD: Coronary Heart Disease; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; CRP: (C Reactive protein); DWI: Diffusion-Weighted Imaging; HbA1c: Hemoglobin A 1c; INR: International Normalized Ratio; INSPiRE-TMS: Intensified Secondary Prevention Intending a Reduction of Recurrent Events in TIA and Minor Stroke Patients; KKS: Center for Clinical studies (Zentrum fuer Klinische Studien); LDL: Low density lipoprotein; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; MOCA: Montreal cognitive assessment; mRS: Modified Rankin scale; NASCET criteria: North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria; NIHSS: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; PCP: Primary care Physician; SAE: Serious adverse event; TIA: Transient ischemic attack; TOAST criteria: Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HJA conducted the design of the trial.
