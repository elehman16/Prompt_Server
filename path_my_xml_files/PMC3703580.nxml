The continuous follow-up and active case detection for all children ensured that malarial infections were detected early and within similar time frames, plus resurgent or new clinical infections were excluded from the analysis of haemoglobin change. A strict malaria case definition was adhered to and the measurement of submicroscopic parasitaemia over time allowed the effects of incomplete treatment to be modelled.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A limitation of the study was the need to recruit participants over two malaria transmission seasons and the significantly reduced malaria transmission rate in 2008 and thus reduced recruitment, which also appeared to affect the severity of malaria in terms of parasite densities at first detection and haemoglobin concentrations. However, CIs of the effect size in the final multivariable analysis do not include the clinically significant effect size included in the sample size calculation, and thus our observation is unlikely to be due to a type II error as a result of lack of power to detect a true effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is possible that the relatively low dose of CQ we used was insufficient to mediate the effects that we were testing for and we were unable to conduct pilot studies of CQ drug dosage and duration to determine the potential best treatment regime to test or of the timings of evaluation of possible mechanisms of effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The change in design in 2008 to all children receiving ACT antimalarial treatment did not affect the analysis of the primary outcome. The change did, however, limit our ability to determine the effect of initial antimalaria therapy on haemoglobin response in the placebo group. An effect of antimalarial treatment CQ on Hb when in the context of adequate parasite clearance, as was observed, might have been expected to occur in the early period of recovery.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The precise contribution of malaria to anaemia is difficult to calculate mainly because many anaemia-causing conditions coexist in children living in malaria-endemic countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Murphy and Breman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> estimate the annual incidence of severe malarial anaemia (SMA) to be 1.42&#x02013;5.66 million, resulting in between 194&#x02005;000 and 974&#x02005;000 deaths in children younger than 5&#x02005;years of age.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> One important component is inflammation-induced iron delocalisation, which is characterised by sequestration of iron by the monocyte&#x02013;macrophage system and hepatocytes, resulting in a state of pseudo-iron deficiency, a state that reverses after the inflammation has subsided.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The trans-membrane protein ferroportin is the exclusive route for cellular iron efflux and is responsible for releasing absorbed iron from enterocytes and sequestered iron from macrophages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism which responds both to iron status and inflammation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> blocks ferroportin.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> which results both in the reduced iron absorption of dietary iron and impaired macrophageal release of iron, the latter effect being quantitatively much more significant as macrophageal iron recycling and transport to the erythron are 25-fold to 30-fold greater than the influx of dietary iron. In this way, hepcidin is the mediator of the anaemia of chronic disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; could also play a role in ferroportin-mediated iron transfer independent of hepcidin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Rapid resolution of malaria-induced inflammation could therefore limit the degree and duration of malarial anaemia by reducing the duration of iron delocalisation.</p><p>Chloroquine is a cheap and safe antimalarial drug with proven anti-inflammatory properties; it has been shown to reduce iron delocalisation in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> We hypothesised that chloroquine may enhance haematological recovery after a malarial episode through its anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory actions, antimacrophageal iron loading effect and antimalarial effect (despite widespread resistance).

The study was initially designed and conducted as a 2&#x000d7;2 randomised placebo-controlled trial in 2007 but had to be changed, due to changes in the national malaria treatment guidelines, to a two-arm RCT during the second malaria transmission season in 2008. In the 2&#x000d7;2 phase of the study, children with malaria were initially openly randomised to receive a therapeutic dose regime of chloroquine plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (CQ-SP) or co-artemether (ACT) (day 0). After treatment, on day 3, children were subsequently randomised (double blind) to receive weekly chloroquine or placebo until day 90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002666F1">figure 1</xref>). In the two-arm phase, all enrolled children with malaria were treated with ACT and then randomised and followed up as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002666F1">figure 1</xref>). A combination of active and passive case detection was used to identify children in participating communities with malaria using a standard case definition of clinical malaria (see below).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002666F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram describing participants&#x02019; movements in 2007 and 2008.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013002666f01"/></fig><p>The climate of this district is typical of sub-Sahelian Africa with a long dry season lasting from November to June and a relatively short rainy season lasting from July to October. Malaria transmission is seasonal, hyperendemic and follows the rainy season, occurring between July and December. The prevalence of children experiencing one or more malarial episodes among a cohort of 1002 children aged between 1 and 6&#x02005;years under active malaria surveillance during a population-based study in 2003 was 34% (Doherty <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished data). During the study period, standard malaria control activities in the district consisted of insecticide-treated bednet distribution and case finding and treatment. In 2008, the standard first-line antimalarial treatment regimen for uncomplicated malaria in the Gambia was changed from CQ-SP to co-artemether.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Eligibility for malaria surveillance and subsequent possible enrolment into the RCT included all children in the participating communities, aged between 12 and 72&#x02005;months, at the start of the surveillance period and who were not severely wasted, defined as weight-for-height Z scores less than &#x02212;3SD.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for enrolment included: (1) uncomplicated malaria at day 0, defined as a history of fever 48&#x02005;h prior to presentation or a measured temperature of 37.5&#x000b0;C or more with peripheral parasitaemia (asexual forms of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> &#x02265;500/&#x003bc;L by microscopy) on day 0 of the study and (2) for randomisation to the postmalarial intervention, children had to have an Hb between 69 and 110&#x02005;g/L on day 3 with no peripheral parasitaemia.</p><p>Children were excluded from the RCT if they were: (1) unable to take oral medications; (2) had features of severe malaria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>; (3) had a known haemoglobinopathy; (4) were enrolled in another project; (5) had already received antimalarial drugs from other sources outside the project team or (6) were prescribed other drugs with potential antimalarial or antianaemic effects such as co-trimoxazole and haematinics.</p><p>Following randomisation to weekly CQ or placebo, children were withdrawn from the study if: (1) they developed a second malarial episode or had life-threatening symptoms, more severe disease or serious adverse reactions; (2) left the study area for more than 14&#x02005;days; (3) received antimalarials from other sources or (4) their Hb fell below 70&#x02005;g/L.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Field and clinical procedures</title><p>To effect the surveillance protocol, the study villages were divided into geographically adjacent clusters supervised by a resident study nurse who visited each village morning and evening and provided 24&#x02005;h clinical coverage to all enrolled children in their cluster. The active surveillance consisted of twice weekly temperature monitoring of enrolled children by village assistants, while the passive surveillance consisted of mothers referring sick children to the visiting study nurse. Children with fever&#x02014;reported or measured&#x02014;were screened for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test (MRDT; Cortez diagnostics, Inc) after clinical evaluation. Children testing negative to MRDT were treated based on the likely diagnosis from the symptoms and signs. Children testing positive to MRDT were started on antimalarials immediately (either CQ-SP or ACT in 2007, and ACT in 2008 for 3&#x02005;days) and directly observed by the study nurse and managed as appropriate. Finger prick blood samples (days 7, 15, 30 and 70) were collected in an EDTA microtainer while venous blood (2&#x02005;mL&#x02014;days 0 and 90; and 5&#x02005;mL&#x02014;days 3 and 45) samples were collected in an EDTA vacutainer and sent to the study laboratory on the same day. Comorbidities were treated as appropriate, avoiding co-trimoxazole and haematinics. For the subsequent visits after initial malaria diagnosis at day 0, children were seen by the study nurse and blood samples and clinical data collected as per protocol. Only children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for advancement to the weekly chloroquine/weekly placebo phase of the study were sampled after day 3. These children were also followed up on days 15, 30, 45, 70 (except in 2008) and 90.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>The randomisation to malaria treatment group in 2007 (CQ-SP or ACT) was open (non-blinded to trial staff, investigators or participants) and was carried out by sequential assignment as children were identified. The block randomisation to the postmalaria treatment of weekly CQ or placebo in both 2007 and 2008 was double blinded and was carried out in blocks of eight. The randomisation codes were generated by a staff member independent of the study team and held by the external trial monitor. Treatment codes were labelled A to H and placed in sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes held by the study nurses. Allocation to the treatment was by matching the code in the envelope to a bottle of the intervention labelled with the same code and then labelled with the subject ID.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Children openly randomised to malaria treatment at day 0 with CQ-SP received choroquine syrup (Chlormal, Medreich Sterilab Ltd, Avalahalli, Bangalore, India) consisting of 50&#x02005;mg chloroquine base per 5&#x02005;mL as chloroquine phosphate at a dose of 10&#x02005;mg/kg for 3&#x02005;days (days 0&#x02013;2).

The stored urine was allowed to thaw at room temperature and then diluted 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;100, and the rest of the procedure was according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013002666TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Laboratory investigations conducted</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Investigations</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specimen</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Days collected*</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microscopy for malaria parasite</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 70 and 90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To assess parasitaemia</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 and 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To assess iron status</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full blood count</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 70 and 90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To assess Hb change over time</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Automated reticulocyte percentage</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 70 and 90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To monitor bone marrow response</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quantitative PCR for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0, 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 70 and 90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To assess submicroscopic parasitaemia</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Urinary neopterin concentration</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Urine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3, 15 and 30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To assess macrophage activation as measure of immune-mediated inflammation</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*No blood was collected on days 7 and 70 in 2008.</p></fn><fn><p>Hb, haemoglobin.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Delta haemoglobin summary statistics are presented as means and SDs for normally distributed continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables.

There was no evidence of an effect of the postmalaria treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002666F5">figure 5</xref>) or of the initial antimalarial treatment on neopterin concentrations (see online supplementary figure S3).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002666F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Percentage of participants with submicroscopic malaria (qPCR) over time by postmalarial treatment group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013002666f03"/></fig><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002666F4" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Reticulocyte percentage as an indicator of bone marrow response by treatment group for both years combined.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013002666f04"/></fig><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002666F5" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Urinary neopterin by postmalarial treatment group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2013002666f05"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chloroquine is used in the treatment of several diseases in addition to its antimalarial use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> However, we believe this to be the first study to assess its potential role in the management of postmalarial anaemia. We hypothesised that since malarial anaemia is essentially a systemic inflammatory response to infection,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> chloroquine, by suppressing plasmodium-induced inflammation, could enhance erythropoietic recovery. We tested this hypothesis by comparing two groups of children&#x02014;one group receiving weekly chloroquine and the other group weekly placebo after complete clearance of peripheral parasitaemia as determined by microscopy. The primary outcome measure was the recovery in Hb at days 30 and 90 compared to the day 3 Hb levels. Our results showed no significant difference in the Hb change between the two groups. The data were interrogated further by a random effects model modelling data at days 30 and 90 simultaneously while adjusting for Hb at day 3 and taking into account random measurement errors and missing data. This confirmed that weekly chloroquine at 5&#x02005;mg/kg body weight did not improve Hb recovery after uncomplicated clinical malaria. There was a suggestion that weekly CQ may have increased the rate of recovery in Hb change at day 15 accompanied by non-significantly increased reticulocyte percentage.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the need to recruit participants over two malaria transmission seasons. In 2008, there was a reduced malaria transmission rate, and thus there were fewer cases available for recruitment and also an apparent effect on the severity of malaria in terms of parasite densities at first detection and effect on haemoglobin concentrations, with a significantly higher baseline Hb in 2008. However, the change in design that was necessitated in 2008 did not change the primary outcome analysis. Furthermore, CIs of the observed effect size in the final multivariable analysis do not include the effect size included in the sample size calculation, and thus our observation is unlikely to be due to a type II error as a result of lack of power to detect a true effect of this magnitude.</p><p>The change in design in 2008 to all children receiving ACT antimalarial treatment did not affect the analysis of the primary outcome. The change did, however, limit our ability to determine the effect of initial antimalaria therapy on haemoglobin response in the placebo group. An effect of antimalarial treatment CQ on Hb when in the context of adequate parasite clearance, as was observed, might have been expected to occur in the early period of recovery.</p><p>The recommended anti-inflammatory dose of CQ is 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;mg/kg/day. However, owing to a lack of safety data for this condition and considering the potential adverse effects, particularly retinal damage, we used the lower prophylactic dose of 5&#x02005;mg/kg/week. Using this low dose might have contributed to our inability to detect an effect of CQ. Drenou <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> reported the successful long-term control of sideroblastic anaemia (a condition of reduced incorporation of iron into haem in the presence of sufficient or high iron) in an adult patient using chlrorquine but at 100&#x02005;mg/day.</p><p>We had hypothesised that chloroquine will impede macrophageal iron sequestration during the acute clinical episode and improve iron availability for the process of erythropoiesis. Urinary excretion of neopterin is markedly increased in individuals infected with malaria, and corresponds to the concurrent activation of T cells and macrophages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31 R32 R33">31&#x02013;33</xref> We measured the urinary neopterin at days 3, 15 and 30 and expected to see a more rapid decline in the neopterin level in the weekly chloroquine group than in the weekly placebo group, but no difference was observed between the treatment groups. It is possible that a difference may have occurred at an intermediate time point between days 3 and 15, when the levels had already almost normalised. Indeed, Brown <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> showed that in a group of volunteers experimentally infected with <italic>plasmodium</italic> parasites, the timing of maximum neopterin excretion coincided with the treatment and elimination of parasitaemia. In our study, this would coincide with study days 0&#x02013;3. In future, it might be more informative to carry out more measurements during the first week of malaria diagnosis.</p><p>The participants were followed up for 90&#x02005;days because the reports had suggested that Hb continues to fall even after successful malaria treatment primarily due to continuing inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> In this study, we found no evidence of persistent inflammation, except in the few cases with remaining parasitaemia at day 30, which also had decreased absolute Hb and Hb change at day 30 compared with children with no parasitaemia or parasite counts of 1&#x02013;2/&#x003bc;L.</p><p>Our observation that children with higher Hb at diagnosis had greater Hb recovery is potentially paradoxical as one would have expected the reverse through statistical regression to the mean and a greater &#x02018;catch up&#x02019; in children with a lower starting Hb at day 3. However, as the majority of iron used for Hb recovery is recycled,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> those with higher Hb at day 0 have more iron available for recovery. Our non-provision of exogenous iron during the study may have restricted the ability of the more anaemic children to respond appropriately, as suggested by our observation of reduced Hb recovery in children with apparent iron deficiency at day 0. An earlier study in Gambian children showed improved haematological recovery in children treated for malaria and cosupplemented with iron compared to placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> However, we have also shown in Gambian children reduced iron absorption from supplementation in postmalarial anaemia, while also experiencing greater Hb recovery compared to supplemented children with iron-deficiency anaemia, thus causing us to question the efficacy of iron supplementation given within 2&#x02005;weeks of antimalarial treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Without the inclusion of a further randomised treatment arm of postmalarial treatment iron supplementation, it is not possible to make further recommendations concerning the recent argument for the provision of iron supplementation to children in malaria endemic areas with regular malaria surveillance and treatment facilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></p><p>Our finding that stunted children recovered Hb poorly is consistent with an earlier report of stunting being a determinant of the severity of malaria-associated anaemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> In our population, this effect was independent of iron status.</p><p>Age has been shown to be strongly associated with risk of severe anaemia in children with acute malaria, the risk decreasing with increasing age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> In addition, we have shown in this study that older children recover better from anaemia after an acute malaria episode than younger children. Paying special attention to younger children with malarial anaemia could reduce malaria-related mortality in children.</p><p>In conclusion, weekly chloroquine administered for 3&#x02005;months to children with mild malarial anaemia at a dose of 5&#x02005;mg/kg/week resulted in no improvement in erythropoietic recovery compared to placebo. Older children and children with higher initial Hb, less stunting at diagnosis and without iron deficiency had better Hb recovery postmalaria. Similar to other reports in the literature, urinary neopterin was elevated during acute malaria. The role of iron deficiency in erythropoietic recovery postmalaria noted in this study suggests areas for further detailed investigation of the clinical value in administering both antimalarial and iron supplementation to children with malarial anaemia residing in areas of high iron deficiency and malaria burden.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e220" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002666.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e221" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002666.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the contribution of all the members of the field team&#x02014;Kabiru Ceesay, Edrisa Sinjanka, Lamin Ceesay, Lamin Sowe, Kalilu Sanneh, Bakary Sarr, Muhammed Sidibeh, Yahya Sanyang;the data staff, especially Jahid Hassan and Musa Jarjou; the laboratory staff, especially Musa Colley, Karamo Camara, Mustapha Bittaye and Ebrimah Danso; all the drivers of the MRC Keneba, Ms Cheryl Eniyou O, Mrs Fatou Noho and Ms Jankey Jagne; all the village assistants; and the study subjects and their parents.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CVN, CPD and AMP conceived and designed the study with input from SEC.
