Children who ultimately participated in this follow-up study, having been born to the cohort of women recruited before delivery at the 125 centres in 19 countries participating in follow-up, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>.

Women were informed that they might be contacted for follow-up prior to giving consent for recruitment. Therefore, some centres did not require that the follow-up study be resubmitted to an ethics committee. Others required a new submission or considered the follow-up protocol as an amendment to the original trial protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>How children were assessed</title><p>Children were screened using the Ages and Stage Questionnaires (ASQs).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Thirty questions cover the five domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal&#x02013;social. To pass, the child has to pass all five domains. An additional section addresses general parental concerns, and it is not scored. We added two questions about use of health service resources.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Up to 24 months, age is adjusted for gestation at birth. Each questionnaire is valid for 4 weeks either side of the target age. This was extended by an additional week for each year of the child&#x02019;s age.</p><p>For centres where the full ASQ was not thought feasible for cultural or language reasons, we shortened the questionnaires by selecting the questions considered most likely to predict severe developmental delay. Three questions were selected in each of the gross motor, communication and problem solving domains, together with five general questions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> To pass, the child had to have at least one &#x02018;yes&#x02019; in each domain.</p><p>Questionnaires were available in English and Spanish. They were sent by post, administered in clinic (usually a clinic provided for children within the study) or during a home visit, or completed over the telephone. If the family could not be contacted directly, information about whether the child was &#x02018;alive and well&#x02019; was collected, whenever possible. The aim was to assess children when they were at least 18 months, but this varied depending upon what was feasible.</p><p>Children who passed the ASQ for their own age, or for an older age group, were considered screen negative. Children who failed the ASQ were considered screen positive. Also considered screen positive were children whose ASQ was incomplete and could not be scored and those who passed the ASQ for children in a younger age group. Screen-positive children, and a sample of screen-negative children, were invited for a clinical and neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> or the Griffiths Tests,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> or an alternative test if neither was available. If no test was possible, we relied on clinical history and examination, including information about non-neurosensory disability (see below) using the Health Status Questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> The person doing this assessment was usually aware of whether or not the child had passed the ASQ.</p><p>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics provided the date and cause for all deaths. When surviving UK children were at least 18 months old, a questionnaire was also sent to their GP asking about neurosensory function and general health.</p></sec><sec><title>Data review</title><p>Data for each child who died, or was thought might have disability, were reviewed by an independent paediatrician. A second paediatrician reviewed a 10% random sample of these, plus any with uncertainty about the diagnosis. Outcome was determined by consensus. Data for a 20% sample of children considered screen negative were also reviewed, together with all those who had a short ASQ only.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome for the follow-up study was the composite measure of death or neurosensory disability at age of 18 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Secondary outcomes for the children were death alone, each individual measure of neurosensory disability alone, delayed speech, other disability and contact with health services.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions of outcome measures for the children</title><sec><title>Death or neurosensory disability at 18 months of age (primary outcome)</title><p>The time point of at least 18 months (corrected for gestation at birth) provided the best balance between feasibility of follow up and certainty of diagnosis. Excluded were (a) cases where death or neurosensory disability was judged to have had its origin at conception or during embryogenesis, (b) deaths after 18 months and (c) disability clearly caused by some event occurring after 18 months. Four children were classified as fulfilling the criteria for inclusion in the composite primary outcome because, although only 12&#x02013;17 months old when last seen, they were clearly disabled and would be dead or disabled at 18 months (magnesium sulphate, <italic>n</italic> = 3; placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 1).</p><p>Children were classified as having neurosensory disability if they were functionally blind (binocular visual acuity &#x0003c;6/60) or deaf (severe enough to need a hearing aid), had severe cerebral palsy (not walking or unlikely to walk unaided by 24 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) or had a developmental quotient (DQ) &#x0003c;&#x02212;2 SD. Children with a DQ &#x0003c;&#x02212;2 SD were classified as having definite delay, as were children whose developmental progress was less than that would be expected of an average child half that age.

We estimated the composite primary outcome (death or neurosensory disability) might affect 20&#x02013;25% of children in the placebo group. After adjustment for expected losses to follow up, it was anticipated that there would be data on death or disability for 2370&#x02013;2810 children. This would give 70&#x02013;80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a relative difference between the groups of 20% in the primary outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analyses were based on the groups to which the women and children had been allocated at trial entry.

In addition, a <italic>post hoc</italic> Poisson regression was conducted for the primary outcome adjusting for gestation at birth, whether the mother had an anticonvulsant before trial entry, PNM in country, route of maintenance therapy, sex of the baby, multiple pregnancy and whether admitted to a special care baby unit.</p><p>The analysis of children&#x02019;s death alone included all deaths and took account of the age at death, using log-rank survival analysis.

The coordinating centre in Oxford traced children from the 67 UK centres. Local collaborators traced all other children. Data collection closed on 31 December 2003. For 27 children, the parent/s or carers opted out of follow up. Of these, 16 were &#x02018;alive and well&#x02019; when contacted. There is no information on the other 11 children. Also excluded from the analyses were 40 children who died (<italic>n</italic> = 26) or had disability due to a problem originating at conception or embryogenesis (14). Two of these surviving children also had cerebral palsy.</p><p>Included in the follow-up study were 4483 children whose mothers were randomised before birth (magnesium sulphate, <italic>n</italic> = 2254; placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 2229) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>), of whom 388 (9%) were stillborn or died before discharge from hospital and 4095 (91%) were alive at discharge. The main substantive differences between children included in follow-up and those in the trial overall were that a higher proportion came from low or middle PNM countries (61% in follow up versus 43% in the trial overall). Therefore, most of their mothers received the intravenous maintenance regimen for magnesium sulphate (63% versus 52%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Also, fewer children included in follow-up were born before 33 completed weeks (23% versus 27%).</p><sec><title>Completeness and review of data</title><p>Data for 3283 children (73%) were available for analysis (magnesium sulphate, <italic>n</italic> = 1635; placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 1648) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). For 106 children in the UK, information was from the GP only. In the UK, 98% of children were contacted. Outside the UK, 11 centres contacted all included children and 36 contacted more than half of included children. Data were available for 57% of children in high PNM countries (994/1744), 75% in middle PNM countries (1213/1609) and 95% in low PNM countries (1076/1130) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia was not associated with any substantive reduction in survival without neurosensory disability for the children exposed while <italic>in utero</italic>.</p><p>When the Magpie Trial was designed, follow-up was planned in the UK only. Once it became clear that more than 80% of recruitment was from developing countries, it seemed imperative to at least try to contact a sample of these women and children. Although 50 centres were unable to participate in follow-up, this could not have introduced bias into the assessment of outcome, as randomisation had been stratified by centre. For the 125 centres that did participate in follow-up, 74% included follow up of all children recruited and 85% included at least 90% of children. The decision about who was included in follow-up was made at the start of the study, blind to treatment allocation. The primary reason why some centres only tried to contact a proportion of children was that many of those born early in the trial would have changed address, possibly several times, and so would be impossible to trace. Hence, in these centres, children were only included in follow up if they were born after a pre-specified date. At one centre, an additional factor was that it was unsafe to visit certain geographic areas, so those with a discharge address within these pre-specified areas were not included. It is implausible that these factors could have been related to outcome, and as they are likely to be equally distributed between the treatment groups because of the randomisation, it is unlikely that they introduced any bias.</p><p>Having provided reassurance that there was no potential bias between the groups in the way children were selected for inclusion in follow-up, our pragmatic philosophy was that any information about outcome was better than none. This approach enabled us to trace families and assess children in situations where follow-up had previously been thought impossible. We are not aware of other perinatal trials that have conducted follow-up in a comparable range of countries and settings. Restricting the study to centres able to guarantee that a high proportion of children could be traced would have excluded most low-income countries. Overall, 73% of included children were contacted, which is a remarkable achievement. In many countries, there was a strong impression that women valued this continued interest in the welfare of their child. The chief exception was some rural communities, where strangers visiting a remote village might be regarded with suspicion.</p><p>A key challenge was to identify an appropriate and simple tool for screening large numbers of young children over a wide age range and in a variety of settings and countries. The ASQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> seemed to meet these criteria. Although it is user friendly, with pictures and clear text, each questionnaire is three pages. As this was initially thought to be rather long for some communities, especially those who were non-English speaking and predominantly rural, we shortened it to one page. In practice, many centres found administering the full ASQ less problematic than anticipated. Uptake of the short ASQ was therefore lower than expected.</p><p>The use of a variety of tools for neurodevelopmental assessment and that it was not possible for all children to have a full assessment were limitations of this study. Also, this follow-up has less power than the original trial as it was not feasible to include all children randomised, those included tended to be at lower risk of adverse outcome and it was harder to contact families in high PNM countries. These losses to follow-up do not appear to have had a substantive impact, however, as results are relatively consistent across countries with differing completeness of follow-up. In a blinded trial such as ours, it is unlikely that not being able to trace 27% of children after discharge would introduce appreciable bias in the conclusions, as the reasons for failure to contact them will have been equally true of children in both arms of the study. As those who were followed-up had been randomly exposed to magnesium sulphate, these data still allow an unbiased assessment of the treatment effect of antenatal magnesium sulphate on longer term outcomes. Moreover, the total numbers eventually followed, 2895 survivors from 3283 enrolled, are large relative to other antenatal trials and still allow power to detect uncommon adverse outcomes. By comparison, the Cochrane review of antenatal steroid therapy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> the most obvious example of an antenatal intervention that has improved outcome for preterm infants, comprises data on only 3517 fetuses exposed, of whom 3184 survived and on whom long-term outcome data are reported for just 778 children.</p><p>Magnesium sulphate given as neuroprotection to women at risk of preterm birth before 30 weeks of gestation has been evaluated in one previous trial;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> there was a tendency to a lower risk of death or cerebral palsy at 2 years if the mothers were allocated magnesium sulphate rather than placebo (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66&#x02013;1.03). Nearly 8% of surviving babies in that study had cerebral palsy; only 17 surviving children were identified as having cerebral palsy in the present study, and in two of these, the problem was thought to have arisen during conception or embryogenesis. However, 10 of the other 15 children were among those whose mothers were allocated placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). The numbers involved are small, and this imbalance could have arisen by chance, but the trend is in the same direction as in the earlier trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> In our study, only one baby with cerebral palsy and 2.3% of all the babies were born before 30 weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Magnesium sulphate for women with pre-eclampsia more than halves the risk of eclampsia (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29&#x02013;0.60) and probably reduces the risk of maternal death before discharge from hospital (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26&#x02013;1.14) compared with placebo. No substantive harmful effects were apparent in the short term, for either mother or baby. Exposure to magnesium sulphate while <italic>in utero</italic> was not associated with a clear difference in the risk of death or disability for children at 18 months. These data provide reasonable reassurance about the long-term safety of magnesium sulphate for the children, at the dosage used in our study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This report is dedicated to the women and children, and their families, who participated in the follow-up study.
