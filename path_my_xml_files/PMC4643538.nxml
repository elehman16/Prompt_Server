However, their implementation remains a challenge. We designed an implementation strategy, based on peer assessment (PA) focusing on barriers to change in physical therapy care. A previously published randomized controlled trial showed that PA was more effective than the usual strategy &#x0201c;case discussion&#x0201d; in improving adherence to a low back pain guideline. Peer assessment aims to enhance knowledge, communication, and hands-on clinical skills consistent with guideline recommendations. Participants observed and evaluated clinical performance on the spot in a role-play simulating clinical practice. Participants performed three roles: physical therapist, assessor, and patient.

By unpacking the program we identified three main tasks and eleven subtasks. After the program was finished, a questionnaire was administered in which participants were asked to rank the program tasks from high to low learning value and to describe their impact on performance improvement. Overall ranking results were calculated. Additional semi-structured interviews were conducted to elaborate on the questionnaires results and were transcribed verbatim.

Perceptions were affected by the role-play format and the time schedule. Learning outcomes were awareness of performance, improved attitudes towards the guideline, and increased self-efficacy beliefs in managing patients with low back pain. Learning was facilitated by psychological safety and the quality of feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The effectiveness of PA can be attributed to the structured and performance-based design of the program.

In addition, a study by Rutten et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] on determinants of guideline adherence showed that physical therapists (PTs) do not hold realistic perceptions of the extent to which they adhere to guideline recommendations.</p><p>The limited ability of clinicians to accurately self-assess the quality of their professional performance is not new [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A compelling body of research evidence shows that the development of adequate self-perception requires both internal and external information about one&#x02019;s professional performance, including appropriate performance standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is a need for interventions containing feedback that can help to develop realistic self-perceptions of guideline adherent behavior and enhance motivation to change routine practice.</p><p>We designed an implementation strategy based on peer assessment (PA) that targets identified barriers to change for PTs in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We tailored an existing PA design that was shown to be effective in undergraduate PT education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to the context of professional PT practice and to the purpose of guideline implementation. In a previously published randomized-controlled trial (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), PA was shown to be more effective than the traditional &#x0201c;case discussion&#x0201d; implementation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Both strategies aimed to improve adherence to the clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with low back pain. The programs consisted of four meetings over a six-month period. Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;months follow up.</td></tr><tr><td>Randomization and intervention allocation</td></tr><tr><td>CoPs showing interest in the program were invited to a plenary meeting in November 2009. They were informed that the study compared two educational strategies, and that both programs required an equal amount of time and effort. All physical therapists regularly treating patients with low back pain were eligible for inclusion. Included CoPs were randomly allocated to the PA group and the CD group resulting in six CoPs for the PA program (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;49) and four CoPs for the CD program (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;41).</td></tr><tr><td>Interventions</td></tr><tr><td>PA is the process whereby professionals evaluate or are being evaluated by their peers and provide each other with performance feedback. The main difference between PA and CD is that in the PA approach the tasks were structured, with a focus on performance rather than discussion, and participant roles were pre-defined. In the CD approach the tasks were less structured with ample opportunity for in-depth elaboration and discussion, and participant roles were not defined. In PA and CD, participants worked on identical cases concerning problem content, but for PA these cases were adjusted to allow for performance of participants in different roles. In PA, written cases were not known in advance but were presented by a coach on the spot, simulating daily clinical practice. For CD groups, written cases were included in the program guide to allow for proper preparation, along with instructions and written questions to guide the discussion process.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome measures</td></tr><tr><td>Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at six months. Primary outcome was knowledge and guideline-consistent reasoning, measured with 12 performance indicators using four vignettes that fully covered the patient profiles described in the guidelines. Changes in reflective practice were measured with the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (Grant et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]).</td></tr><tr><td>Results</td></tr><tr><td>Vignettes were completed by 78 participants (PA group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44; CD group <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34). Multilevel analysis showed an increase in guideline-consistent clinical reasoning of 8.4&#x000a0;% in the peer-assessment groups whereas the control groups showed a decline of 0.1&#x000a0;% (estimated group difference 8.7&#x000a0;%; 95&#x000a0;% CI: 3.9 to 13.4; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

Clinical performance was directly observed and evaluated by peers in a role-play that simulated clinical practice. Participants received a PA-manual in advance, containing a description of the PAprocedure, a time schedule for each meeting, and guidelines for receiving and providing constructive feedback. They received a link to the updated guideline &#x0201c;Low back pain for physical therapy and manual therapy&#x0201d; (Staal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) published by the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy. Four meetings were scheduled over a period of six months. As the PTs were novices in the PA method, and no additional training was provided, the PA process was supported by a coach (MM or HE). Coaches were experienced PTs, teachers in PT education, and trained in the PA procedure. They facilitated the process of providing and receiving feedback, and they gave additional feedback when needed.</p><p>Each participant performed three roles: PT, assessor and simulated patient. In the PT role, participants completed a written assignment that contained a clinical case and brief instructions for diagnosis or treatment. Clinical cases were developed by a team of experienced PTs and guideline experts. The cases fully covered the patient profiles of LBP described in the guidelines, including red flags. PTs analyzed the clinical cases by reasoning aloud and demonstrated (hands-on) skills relevant to the clinical problem. Afterwards, they reflected on their performance. In the assessor role, peer performance was observed and assessed with a scoring sheet containing performance criteria that could be scored on a 7-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;much improvement needed, to 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;no improvement needed) and space for written feedback. Performance categories addressed diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. In the patient role, participants received the clinical case along with written simulation instructions. Simulation instructions consisted of a description of the patient&#x02019;s complaints, including personal factors (e.g., cognitive / emotional), and contextual factors (e.g. family, work) that might be relevant to the patient&#x02019;s problem. Participants were instructed to improvise patient responses and provide feedback from the patient perspective.</p><p>Prior to the third session, each participant developed a personal change plan, including an action plan, based on performance feedback and self-assessment. In the third meeting, the group reviewed change plans and provided additional peer feedback. The fourth session was identical to the first two sessions, but the design of the clinical cases was tailored to participants&#x02019; specific learning needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Questionnaires and interviews</title><p>Prior to data collection, we unpacked the PA program and identified three main tasks and eleven subtasks that were assumed to affect guideline adherence. Task analysis was supported by guidelines described by Janssen-Noordman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An online questionnaire was administered after completion of the PA program in which participants were asked to rank the program tasks from high to low learning value, assigning the highest rank for the most learning value and the lowest rank for the least. Subsequently, they were asked to provide written comments on the three most instructive PA task elements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>Emerging questions from the questionnaires comments served as input for conducting semi-structured interviews to obtain more understanding of how the PA program affected professional development (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In contrast to a reductionist approach to the data by means of task analysis and task ranking, the interviews had a more holistic approach, focusing on experiences with the PA program as an integrated system. From each peer group, one PT was selected for an interview (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6). Purposeful selection was based on average and deviant ranking results. An interview guide was designed by MM and PW addressing the three main questions that emerged from the questionnaire data:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What did you expect of the PA program?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How did you perceive the PA program, and how did it affect your daily practice?</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the questionnaire, you indicated that you perceived task X, Y and Z to have the strongest learning value. Can you explain why?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Selected participants were invited by e-mail, and received information about the study&#x02019;s purpose, procedure, the use of the data, and the focus of the interview.</p><p>The first interview was conducted by MM and PW face-to-face. The following interviews were conducted by either MM or PW using teleconferencing technology. To enhance the credibility of the results, research assistants AS and GB joined the telephone interviews, taking notes and posing additional questions when needed. Interviews of each participant, including verbal consent, were audiotaped. Interviews lasted between 45 and 90&#x000a0;minutes. Recordings were transcribed verbatim. An independent check on the transcripts was conducted by AS and GB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Quantitative analysis</title><p>Ranking results were described by calculating mean, median, and sum scores for each learning task using IBM SPSS statistics 20.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Qualitative analyses</title><p>A sample of texts from questionnaires and interview transcripts was studied and coded by MM and PW independently. The analytic process was guided by template analysis that combines a-priori codes with emerging codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The PA program as a whole and its learning tasks and subtasks served as a-priori codes. Additional codes were defined during the analytic process when these seemed relevant regarding the research question. Codes were compared, and some codes were merged into higher-order codes. PW and MM discussed a codebook until consensus was reached. Subsequently, all written comments in the questionnaires and interview transcripts were analyzed line-by-line, using ATLAS-ti v.7 software. Emerging themes were identified by constant comparison of codes and higher order codes. We summarized the results in a matrix that crossed a-priori codes (tasks and subtasks) and emerging themes from the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Two independent researchers SD (health scientist and PT) and MS (educational scientist) evaluated the analysis process and outcomes. They were not involved in the design or delivery of the PA program. Disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached and we finally agreed that the matrix fully fitted the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>This project received approval of the medical ethical committee of Radboud University Medical Center.

The results clearly show that participants committed the most to learning tasks related to performance in the therapist role: performing the task, receiving peer feedback, external coach feedback, and simulated patient feedback. Participants varied widely in the perceived learning value of subtasks related to performing the PT role, but agreed on the superior value of receiving peer feedback. In the next section, we will elaborate on these results.</p><p>These results point to the importance of exposing observable behavior (PA) rather than expressing intended behavior (Case Discussion). Although exposure was associated with feelings of discomfort and performance stress, its impact on awareness of professional development was not questioned. This raises the question of how feelings of discomfort and stress can affect learning and change in professional practice.</p><p>In the PT role, participants needed to make the transfer from implicit reasoning to explicit reasoning and from intentional behavior to observable behavior to allow for assessment and feedback. Bandura&#x02019;s social cognitive theory emphasizes that exposure is conditional to the development of mastery experiences, and mastery experiences are the most important source of information for the development of self-efficacy beliefs. In turn, self-efficacy beliefs contribute significantly to performance improvement and motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This notion is supported by the theory of planned behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Bandura also points to the importance of the peer group in strengthening self-confidence through &#x0201c;vicarious&#x0201d; experiences provided by social models. The impact of modeling on perceived self-efficacy is strongly influenced by perceived similarity to the models (peers) and is considered to be more powerful than performance feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Increased self-confidence might have helped participants to approach difficult tasks as challenges to be mastered rather than as threats to be avoided.</p><p>The foregoing explains how PA participants succeeded in raising self-efficacy beliefs despite feelings of performance stress, but does not explain why they showed superior test results on clinical vignettes in the trial (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). High arousal levels are generally considered to have a negative impact on the quality of performance according to the Yerkes-Dodson law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and PA participants&#x02019; experiences supported that, as they contended that they had underperformed in the PA context. However, they must have processed the information in a way that enhanced retrieval and transfer of knowledge to the context of clinical vignettes. Studies addressing the influence of emotion on cognitive processing provide an explanation for this apparent contradiction. McConnel &#x00026; Eva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] conducted a literature review on the impact of emotion on the transfer of clinical knowledge and skills. They conceptualized emotion by two dimensions: <italic>valence</italic> and <italic>arousal</italic>. Valence refers to the emotional state (e.g. positive or negative). Arousal refers to the level of activation. One of the findings was that emotional experiences are more likely to be mulled over than non-emotional experiences. This unintentional retrieval of emotional events might have strengthened memory traces of PA participants and facilitated the transfer to new clinical problems. Another view is presented by regulatory focus theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which contends that receptiveness to feedback depends on &#x0201c;emotional arousal&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;emotional valence&#x0201d;. Summarizing these considerations, the critical feature of PA might be attributed to the emotional involvement (either negative or positive) with performing the PT role. As feelings of failure do not contribute to the development of self-efficacy beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], successful PA implementation should allow for coping with performance stress within or between the sessions. Training in the PT role and a safe learning environment might be crucial to enable the coping process.</p><p>Performance in the assessor role was perceived as a less powerful learning experience. However, it should be noted that the assessor role and the PT role cannot be considered as independent. Observing peer performance allowed observers to model the observed behavior, which might have contributed to reducing performance stress and triggering performance improvement. On a more unconscious level, participants might have profited from the activity of the mirror neuron system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] that is capable of shaping the observed behavior to a virtual image of their intended behavior. In appraising their peers&#x02019; performance, assessors needed to reason aloud, compare personal views with group views, and discuss performance standards. This may have provided peer assessors with the missing data for informed self-assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the role of the external coach in providing feedback, participants ranked peer feedback higher than coach feedback although coach feedback was valued because of its objectivity, its conciseness, and its receptiveness. A comparable study on peer assessment in undergraduate PT education, in which students were asked to rank similar learning tasks, showed that students preferred teacher feedback to peer feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Professionals did not question the quality of peer feedback compared to coach feedback, but emphasized the importance of peers being involved in their professional development process. This finding is supported by situated learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which contends that the transfer of knowledge is hampered by the gap between the learning context and application context. Delivering the implementation program within communities of practice allows for co-constructing and tailoring knowledge to the personal learning needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In this respect, the coach remained an outsider.</p><p>Although the PA program was successful regarding its aim, the adoption of the program for knowledge transfer purposes should be carefully considered.</p><p>Firstly, some participants argued that the role-play format did not adequately reflect their authentic professional behaviors. This view is understandable, but compared to passive guideline dissemination, role-play aims to facilitate the transfer of scientific evidence to clinical practice, which it did, according to participant reports. As regards the use of peer role-play (low fidelity simulation) compared to standardized patients (high fidelity simulation), research in undergraduate education shows that both tools provide a psychological safe area of practice, where mistakes are not critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Studies on student perceptions show that standardized patients are perceived as more effective than peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, research evidence on learning outcomes remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Compared to direct observation (work-place based assessment), the role-play format allows for standardizing the content of interest, creating an adequate case mix, and describing the key-features of health problems relevant to the guidelines, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Considering constraints in time and costs, peer role-play is the most feasible method. This conclusion is supported by a systematic review undertaken by Overheem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], who evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of six methods to assess physician performance.</p><p>Secondly, some participants perceived the tight time schedule as stressing and preventing in-depth elaboration of the clinical problems. The PA program was designed to enhance the transfer from the learning context to the application context, as the transfer from one problem to another problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Yet, in an attempt to solve all the presented problems within time limits, the approach to learning might have been too superficial.</p><p>Thirdly, performance in the PT role was perceived as challenging and sometimes even threatening. When conditions of psychological safety are not met, the effectiveness of PA might be questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provided rich data and convincing results. Because we clearly described the program design, its underlying theoretical constructs, and the critical features of successful guideline implementation, future program designers may profit from our results.</p><p>It can be argued that a limitation of the PA approach is the role-play of peers simulating patients. Although the choice of peers instead of standardized patients was defensible as argued above, and although the results show that their feedback was valued, additional training in the patient role might have increased the fidelity of the peers&#x02019; performance.</p><p>Another limitation concerns the questionnaire and the interview guide. Questionnaire comments were reduced by the three tasks with the highest-ranking results. We compensated for this limitation by interviewing participants with contrasting ranking results. Nevertheless, because we did not focus on less instructive tasks in our interviews, we might have lost information that would have underpinned our results.</p><p>Finally, the generalizability of our results might be limited because all participants in this study were Dutch. Research shows that effective peer assessment practices are culture dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The effectiveness of PA can be attributed to the structured and performance-based design of the program. Participants showed a strong cognitive and emotional commitment to performing the tasks related to the physical therapist role. That might have contributed to an increased awareness of strengths and weaknesses, and a motivation to change routine practice in the management of patients with low back pain.</p><p>Conditional to successful implementation is an environment where mistakes can easily be made, but in which the self-confidence of participants remains undamaged. Adjustment of the tight time schedule and the number of cases, providing more time to elaborate on problems and to recuperate from experiences, might improve the PA task design. However, attempts to improve the effectiveness of PA should not be limited to the modification of the PA tool. We recommend a shift in the feedback culture of PTs in primary care, from avoiding performance feedback to actively seeking feedback.</p><p>Future research should address the feasibility of PA as a tool to enhance bottom-up quality improvement and accountability to external stakeholders of PT care.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12909_2015_484_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p><bold>Online questionnaire.</bold>(PDF 213 kb)</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12909_2015_484_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM2"><label>Additional file 2:</label><caption><p><bold>Interview guide.</bold> (PDF 317 kb)</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>All authors declare that there are no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>All authors read the final manuscript, gave their approval for publication, and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.
