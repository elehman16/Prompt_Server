A negative birth experience is associated with subsequent infertility, and women's experiences should therefore be considered seriously in the provision of maternity care.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The concept of a walking epidural during labor is worthwhile as confining a parturient to bed may lead to painful and prolonged labor with higher incidences of abnormal presentations and fetal distress.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nowadays, it's considered to be the gold standard for labor pains. Epidural analgesia has been used extensively in developed countries and now getting popular in developing countries like India, etc., with some modification in the traditional epidural technique.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, there have been remarkable changes in the field of obstetric anesthesia. Anesthesiologists have improved upon their techniques to alleviate pain during labor while at the same time increasing the safety for both mother and the baby. Newer techniques such as combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, continuous epidural infusions, walking epidurals, and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) are now available.</p><p>In contrast, continuous infusion extradural analgesia (CIEA) has been associated with significant motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, newer modalities, such as CSE and PCEA, are more expensive, technically more difficult, and associated with an increased incidence of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus along with the use of opioids.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although rarely meningitis has also been reported.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The greatest advantage of implementing intermittent lumbar extradural for labor analgesia is the lack of need of a volume elastomeric extradural infusion pump, making its role worthwhile in conducting deliveries in emergency settings, and primary, secondary, and tertiary health centers of developing countries (India, etc.) where these facilities are not easily available but do have the human resources to provide the intermittent top-ups.</p><p>Our study was designed to evolve an appropriate dose combination of bupivacaine and fentanyl in extradural labor analgesia using an intermittent bolus technique and to evaluate the maternal and neonatal outcomes with its effect on the progress of labor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee, the present study was conducted after taking informed written consent from all the parturients.</p><p>A total of 90 patients were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups A and B, and control group C:</p><p>

We decreased the volume and concentration of the drug injected extradurally, keeping in view the difference in demographic data (age, height) in the Indian population as compared to the western parturients [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Our aim was to minimize the concentration of the local anesthetic along with an appropriate dose of the opioid, so as to provide maximal labor analgesia along with active maternal participation during labor without affecting fetal well-being.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of anthropometric variables and age of parturients between three groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-5-147-g003"/></table-wrap><p>The test dose was avoided in this study because in a laboring patient, maternal heart rate variability from the pain of uterine contractions may confuse the interpretation of the heart rate response, and intravenous epinephrine may have deleterious effects on the uterine blood flow.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The time interval from the initial bolus dose to the maternal analgesia request in our study was significantly increased in Group B. The longer latency to demand for analgesia in parturients of Group B could be attributed to a comparatively higher concentration of the opioid (fentanyl) used with the diluted low concentration of the local anesthetic (bupivacaine) since an increase in doses of the opioid and local anesthetic is directly proportional to the quality and duration of satisfactory analgesia and anesthesia but inversely to the time of the onset of block.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The VAS and VPS at 10 min were lower in Group B indicating an early onset of analgesia. There was no difference in the degree of motor blockade in both intervention groups.</p><p>In our study, 93.33% parturients in Group A and 90% in Group B were mobile during 25&#x02013;50% of the study time. Ambulation was achieved in 70% of the fentanyl epidural group and 68% in the bupivacaine, epinephrine, and fentanyl (BEF) group by Breen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The incidence of sparing of motor blockade in both intervention groups in the present study is likely explained by the use of a lower concentration bupivacaine solution. Because motor blockade is considered undesirable during labor analgesia, the potential local anesthetic (bupivacaine) sparing effect of an intermittent bolus technique may be more clinically relevant than other continuous extradural techniques such as CIEA, PCEA, and CSEA.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the advantages of bolus compared with the continuous infusion of extradural solutions. When injected as a bolus through a multiorifice epidural catheter, the solution exits the distal end of the epidural catheter through all the orifices.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In contrast, when a continuous infusion of the same volume is injected through the catheter, it primarily exits through the proximal orifice. Another possible explanation of reduced bupivacaine consumption with the bolus technique may be the distribution of solutions in extradural space which is nonuniform but which spreads uniformly when delivered in large volumes with high injectable pressure.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Our most significant findings were the reduction in the number of boluses and the overall reduction in the local anesthetic use in Group B (2 &#x003bc;g/ml fentanyl).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Local anesthetic sparing by a magnitude of 15&#x02013;20% is also characteristic of PCEA[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] whereby patients self-administer the local anesthetic according to their level of pain. However, a potential criticism of the PCEA system is that patients will only demand a bolus when developing pain as the sensory block regresses. This is compounded by the lag time between the administration and action of epidural drugs. In contrast, regular intermittent bolus administration endeavors to prevent pain by injecting the local anesthetic at time intervals chosen so that the majority of patients remain pain free.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In addition to bupivacaine, we found a dose sparing effect of fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The systemic absorption of extradural fentanyl may result in fetal depression.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In Group B, there were two reported cases of fetal bradycardia seen as compared to group A in which only one case was seen. Incidence maternal side effects like urinary retention and hypotension were quite higher in the control group than any intervention group that possibly justified with the higher consumption of the local anesthetic (bupivacaine). Maternal analgesia satisfaction was higher (90% reported good/excellent) in Group B (with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml fentanyl group) than in Group A (1 &#x003bc;g/ml fentanyl) showing a 60% satisfied level which was merely 40% in Group C. This difference was found to be clinically significant when measured by a 100-mm VAS and VPS.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>There are few limitations in our study. By study design, subjects randomized to each group were nulliparae and multiparae; in multiparae there was lesser drug requirement because of shorter duration of labor as compared to nulliparae. In the current study, the salutary effect of the intermittent bolus technique was higher in women with longer duration of labors and in nulliparae. So, its use was found to be of greater significance in primigravida or nulliparous women.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Another limitation is a small sample size.</p><p>In summary, we found that 2 &#x003bc;g/ml extradural fentanyl is better than 1 &#x003bc;g/ml when combined with bupivacaine in the intermittent bolus technique, as it leads to faster onset, longer duration of analgesia, higher maternal satisfaction, and lesser drug requirement of the local anesthetic with a comparable side effect profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The
