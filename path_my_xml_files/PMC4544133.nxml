The demographic characteristics of patients in two groups (group A&#x02014;atorvastatin and group B&#x02014;rosuvastatin) were comparable at baseline. The demographic profile in our study is consistent with previous studies in which ACS is reported to mainly affect middle-aged men.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The primary outcome parameter for efficacy comparison was alteration in CRP levels. In the present study, CRP levels decreased significantly (35%) in group A, which was treated with 40 mg of atorvastatin for 4 weeks and the level of CRP also decreased significantly (44%) in group B, which was treated with 20 mg of rosuvastatin for 4 weeks. A <italic>P</italic> value was &#x0003c; 0.001 in both the groups. The fall in CRP was more significant in group B as compared to group A (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The results of our study are in agreement with previous studies which have used different statins (pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin) in different doses to show the effect of statin therapy on CRP. In studies comparing statin with placebo, patients with statin had a greater reduction of CRP than those receiving placebo. The percentage reduction was from 13% to 50% with various statins.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Majority of studies have used higher doses of different statins and had longer follow-up period considering the thought that effect of statins on CRP develops over longer period.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are two of the most commonly prescribed drugs for hypercholesterolemia and are a part of routine treatment of patients of ACS. Atorvastatin has been shown in clinical studies to produce reduction in CRP of 39% to 60% across the dose range of 10 to 80 mg.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Few studies have assessed the effect of rosuvastatin in the patients with established coronary artery disease. So this comparative study was planned using doses, which are commonly prescribed clinically, for both the drugs. Earlier Russian study showed 10 mg/d rosuvastatin to be slightly inferior to 40 mg/d atorvastatin.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin trial) of apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity CRP levels, 20 mg rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The CRP levels were reduced by 37%.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study a decrease in CRP levels in rosuvastatin group was 44%. The exact reason of this difference could not be ascertained.</p><p>The exact mechanisms by which statins exert anti-inflammatory effect, thereby reducing CRP levels, are not known but postulated mechanisms are as follows-</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Statins inhibit lymphocyte adhesion to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and impair T-cell stimulation by directly binding to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 site</p></list-item><list-item><p>By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway and consequently reduce the intracellular pools of isoprenoids, thereby downregulating the prenylation process</p></list-item><list-item><p>A study showed that statins reduce IL-6-induced CRP in human hepatocytes via inhibition of protein grenylation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Our study showed no significant difference between the secondary outcome measures of recurrent angina, recurrent MI, stroke and mortality between the two groups. There were no cases of recurrent MI, stroke or mortality in either group. There were three cases of recurrent angina in group A and four cases in group B but the difference was not significant. The absence of any significant difference between clinical events in two groups in our study can be explained by short duration of study and that both the groups had been given statins, whereas most of the previous studies have compared various statins against placebos.</p><p>In the present study, there was a highly significant reduction in ESR levels in both the groups with no inter-group differences. The results were in accordance to study by Macin <italic>et al.</italic> which has also shown reduction in ESR rates with 40 mg/d of atorvastatin over 30 days.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] There is lack of data for the same with rosuvastatin.</p><p>In our study, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin had a favourable effect on lipid profile with a significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides levels. These findings are in accordance with those in literature.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] There was a small decrease in HDL in both the groups. Atorvastatin has been shown to decrease HDL in initial period of 4-6 weeks followed by a steady increase in HDL thereafter in patients of ACS.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The adverse effect analysis in our study revealed that the overall incidence of adverse effects was low in the patients of both the groups. There were no cases of any serious adverse drug reaction including hepatic dysfunction or myositis. Most common adverse effects were related to gastrointestinal system like constipation, upper GI discomfort and pain in abdomen. All these adverse effects were mild in severity and none needed any change or termination of treatment. So our study showed that both 40 mg of atorvastatin and 20 mg of rosuvastatin were well tolerated and free of major adverse effects and drug interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, findings of our study showed that both atorvastatin (40 mg) and rosuvastatin (20 mg) are effective in decreasing CRP and LDL cholesterol levels even in a short duration of 4 weeks. It is tempting to suggest using CRP as a surrogate end point or monitoring variable for statin treatment in addition to LDL cholesterol. This dose of rosuvastatin was found to be more effective in decreasing CRP level. Both the drugs were effective, safe and offer an attractive approach for early treatment of ACS patients.</p><p>It is conceivable that clinical benefit afforded by statins if started early after ACS is partly due to other non-lipid-lowering effects, in which anti-inflammatory effect is primary as manifested by reduction in CRP levels. One common factor in all the studies which have shown clinical benefit from statin treatment, associated with decline in CRP in patients of ACS, is that all the studies are large studies with bigger sample size and longer follow up.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine</article-title><year>2011</year><edition>21st ed</edition><publisher-loc>Jabalpur</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Banarsidas Bhanot</publisher-name><fpage>300</fpage><lpage>2</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Papathanasiou</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Pappas</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Korantzopoulos</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Leontaridis</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Vougiouklakis</surname><given-names>TG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kiriou</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>An epidemiological study of acute coronary syndromes in northwestern Greece</article-title><source>Angiology</source><year>2004</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>187</fpage><lpage>94</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15026874</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maseri</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inflammation, atherosclerosis and ischemic events - Exploring the hidden side of the moon</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1997</year><volume>336</volume><fpage>1014</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9077383</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yudkin</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Juhan-Vague</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Hawe</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Humphries</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>di Minno</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Margaglione</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>HIFMECH Study Group.
