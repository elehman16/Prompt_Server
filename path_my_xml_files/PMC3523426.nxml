The efficacy of acupuncture in management of mild to moderate CTS has been investigated in limited studies with controversial results. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term effects of acupuncture in treatment of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>In a randomized controlled trial study, participants were randomly assigned to either control group which night splinting, vitamin B1, B6 and sham acupuncture for four weeks were administered, or intervention group that underwent acupuncture in 8 sessions over 4 weeks and night splinting. The clinical symptoms using global symptom score (GSS) and electrophysiological parameters were assessed at baseline and four weeks after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of 72 patients met the inclusion criteria, 64 patients actually completed the 4 week intervention and were evaluated for the outcome. There was a statistically significant difference in GSS between two arms of treatment after the intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.001) Using repeated measure ANOVA, the GSS in acupuncture group was significantly different after 4 weeks (p &#x0003c;0.001).

Diagnosis of patients was made based on at least one of the following clinical criteria which were confirmed by Tinel's and Phalen's tests:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> 1) Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and ring finger (the region innervated by median nerve); 2) Provocation of symptoms by repetitive actions of the hand or wrist; 3) Mitigation of symptoms by changing hand posture or shaking the wrist; 4) Nocturnal symptoms. The diagnosis of all patients with clinically diagnosed CTS, was confirmed by the presence of 1 or more of the following standard electrophysiological criteria:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> 1) prolonged distal motor latency (DML &#x02265; 4.2 ms); 2) Prolonged antidromic distal sensory latency (DSL) to the second digit (&#x02265;3.6 ms); 3) Reduced wrist-palm sensory nerve conduction velocity (W-P SNCV &#x0003c; 40 ms).</p><p>In this study, mild CTS was attributed to the patients with decreased conduction velocity over the palm-wrist segment and delayed DSL, with or without normal median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude. Moderate CTS was attributed to patients with abnormally delayed DML and DSL with either decreased median SNAP amplitude.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: Severe CTS; presence of either fibrillation potentials or reinnervation on needle electromyography (EMG) in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB); experiencing symptoms less than 3 months before the study or symptoms improving during the one month initial observation period (to exclude patients who might have spontaneous resolution of symptoms); clinical and electro-diagnostic criteria of associated conditions that could mimic CTS or interfere with its evaluation, such as cervical radiculopathy, proximal median neuropathy, or significant polyneuropathy; evidence of predisposing conditions such as pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism and trauma; previous unfavorable experience of acupuncture or bleeding history; cognitive disorders and unwillingness to participate in the present study.</p><p>Between June 2010 and February 2011, participants were randomly assigned using computerized random numbers to control or treatment groups. Night splinting, vitamin B1, B6 and sham acupuncture was administered in control group for four weeks. For sham acupuncture, participants received a non-skin penetrating pricking sensation using a previously validated sham procedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> The needles inserted at similar body locations as the true acupuncture group and the length of time was similar for needle insertion. Intervention group underwent acupuncture in 8 sessions over 4 weeks and also night splinting. Acupuncture consisted of 8 sessions that were 60 minutes each in duration, administrated over 4 weeks (2 sessions per week). Acupuncture was done with 0.25<sup>*</sup>40 mm size gauge in fixed and classic acupuncture points (PC-7 [Daling], PC-6 [Neiguan] for each patient. All participants were blindfolded during each treatment to prevent patient knowledge of treatment assignment and true and sham acupuncture were done by an expert acupuncturist.</p><p>The clinical symptoms were assessed using Global Symptom Score (GSS) at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of intervention. This scoring system rates clinical symptoms from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (very severe symptoms) in the following 5 areas: Pain, numbness, tingling, weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening. Therefore, the maximum score was 50 that indicated most severe symptoms and the minimum score was 0 that showed absence of symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></p><p>Electrophysiological parameters were assessed as the secondary outcome at baseline and four weeks after the intervention. These parameters included DML (distal motor latency), sensory NCV (nerve conduction velocity) and DSL (distal sensory latency). All tests were done using an Advantage EMG machine (Medelec synergy, UK). Nerve conduction studies were performed by an experienced electro-myographer who was blinded to random assignment. Surface stimulation in sensory and motor nerve conduction studies was done using standard methodology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> The electromyo-grapher monitored the hand temperature using an adhesive surface thermistor on the thenar eminence to ensure the hand temperature between 32&#x000b0;C and 34&#x000b0;C.</p><p>During the sensory nerve conduction studies, the median sensory nerve fibers were stimulated antidromically with 0.05 ms square pulse at midpalm and wrist with a distance of 7 cm and 14 cm from the recording ring electrode looped around the proximal interphalangeal joint of the third digit. The reference ring electrode was placed around the distal interphalangeal joint. During the motor nerve conduction studies, the median motor nerve fibers were stimulated with 0.05 ms square pulse at the wrist at a distance of 8 cm proximal to the recording electrode placed over the motor point of the thenar muscles. The reference electrode was placed over the dorsal aspect of the first metacarpophalangeal joint.</p><p>This trial was registered in the Iranian Randomized Controlled Trial Registry with number IRCT201108174242N2.The design of the study was approved in Ethics Committee of Vice Chancellor for Research, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (project no 389393). All participants received trial information and provided written informed consent.

The independent sample t-test was used to compare the clinical characteristics (nerve conduction and global symptom score) between the two groups at baseline and after the intervention. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare GSS between groups at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention. The comparison of electrophysiological parameters in the two groups was done via paired sample t-test. All tests of hypotheses were 2-tailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05.

There was no statistically significant difference in demographic data between the two groups at the start of trial (p &#x0003e; 0.05) indicating the success of randomization.

This study was limited due to considering short-term effects, small number of patients in each arm of treatment and more physician visits in the acupuncture group. The small sample size prevented from subgroups analyses to further elaborate the effects of acupuncture in mild and moderate CTS. Further research is recommended to determine long-term outcome and comparison of acupuncture to other conservative managements of CTS.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this randomized controlled trial indicated that acupuncture can improve the overall subjective symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and could be adopted in comprehensive care programs of these patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>SK was the main investigator, analyzed the data and wrote the paper.
