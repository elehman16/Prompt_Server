Despite efforts to promote voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), however, the number performed has fallen short of targets in many countries, particularly among men aged over 25 years, who are at increased risk of acquiring HIV in many countries. There is a vital need for demand creation interventions that can address reported barriers to VMMC and increase circumcision prevalence.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>A commonly reported barrier to VMMC uptake among adult men is concern about lost wages during and after the procedure.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Other reported barriers include fear of pain, concerns about the recommended 6-week period of sexual abstinence after circumcision,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and men's concern that female partners may not approve.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A qualitative study we conducted in rural areas of Kenya's Nyanza region identified financial concerns as the leading barrier among adult men.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Many men expressed concern about providing for their families in the days after undergoing circumcision, and these were especially pronounced among married men. Study participants and local stakeholders identified a food voucher or cash transfer program as a priority intervention to increase VMMC uptake.</p><p>Building on the qualitative study and a strong theoretical and empirical rationale for using economic interventions to promote uptake of health interventions,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> we recently conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Kenya that found economic compensation to be effective in increasing VMMC uptake among 25- to 49-year-old men within a period of 2 months.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Participants randomized to receive food vouchers worth 700 Kenya Shillings (KES) or 1200 KES (approximately US $8.75 and US $15.00, respectively) conditional on becoming circumcised were significantly more likely to get circumcised than participants randomized to receive a voucher for only the cost of transport (200 KES or US $2.50) or no compensation. In the US $8.75 and US $15.00 groups, VMMC uptake within 2 months was 6.6% and 9.0%, respectively, compared with 1.9% and 1.6% in the US $2.50 and the no compensation groups, respectively.</p><p>The promising RCT results give rise to important questions regarding why compensation provision motivated VMMC uptake for some men and, equally importantly, why it did <italic>not</italic> do so for other men. Moreover, despite evidence on the effectiveness of economic interventions and their widespread use in some countries,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> few studies identified whether such interventions succeed because they directly address economic barriers, if they coerce individuals to undertake an intervention out of need for the financial incentive, or if instead they &#x0201c;nudge&#x0201d; individuals toward desired health behaviors, as suggested by behavioral economics theories of present-biased decision-making.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> To complement the RCT and gain further insight on how compensation provision for VMMC was perceived, we conducted a qualitative study among trial participants and their female partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study received ethical approval from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Kenyatta National Hospital/University of Nairobi. The study took place in the Nyanza region of western Kenya in collaboration with Impact Research and Development Organization, the primary provider of VMMC services in the study area.</p><p>Details and results for the RCT that this qualitative study was part of have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Trial participants met the following eligibility criteria: age between 25 and 49 years, self-reported to be uncircumcised, and no intention to leave the study area in next 3 months. Participants were randomized to a control group or 3 groups that were offered different amounts of food vouchers <italic>conditional</italic> on VMMC uptake within 2 months. The food voucher amounts were chosen because they approximated the costs of transportation from most participants' homes to a clinic or dispensary (US $2.50), the costs of transportation plus 1&#x02013;2 days wages for most men (US $8.75), and the costs of transportation plus 3&#x02013;4 days wages for most men (US $15.00). Importantly, the largest food voucher amount (US $15.00) was comparable to but not in excess of the likely opportunity costs associated with circumcision to minimize the possibility that participants' decisions would be influenced by the prospect of receiving a large net monetary gain.</p><p>This qualitative study enrolled a subsample of trial participants and their female partners. A stratified purposive sampling strategy was used to identify the qualitative study participants.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Male participants were selected to be recruited according to whether or not they had undergone circumcision during the 2-month study period, their voucher amount, and location of residence. Approximately equal numbers of participants randomized to each of the 4 study groups were identified for recruitment. Individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with participants after they either became circumcised during the RCT or chose not to during the eligibility period. Forty-five male participants, 19 of whom underwent circumcision during the trial and 26 of whom did not. IDIs were also conducted with 19 female partners of men enrolled in the trial, 10 with circumcised partners and 9 with uncircumcised partners. Research assistants (RAs) contacted selected participants by phone to request an interview; those not reachable after 3 attempts were considered ineligible. In order not to bias the sample of participants by income level, those who did not have a phone were visited in person by RAs. Those unavailable after 2 in-person attempts were considered ineligible. In order not to violate the confidentiality of their medical information, we sought permission from male participants with partners before contacting their female partners for an interview. Two participants refused to have their partners contacted and 2 women refused to participate. Women were required to know about the study and food voucher to participate; very few women were not aware of the study when contacted. Women were contacted either by phone or in person as described and male partners were not present during interviews.</p><p>Interviews were conducted by male and female RAs in either English or Dholuo, the primary local languages. All interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide and in a private location. RAs also obtained consent from participants to audio-record interviews in addition to taking notes. Participants received refreshments valued at KES 100 (US $1.25) and compensation for transport if the interview was not conducted at the participant's home.</p><p>After each interview, RAs translated and transcribed interviews verbatim and then read several transcripts for quality and corrected errors; these were included in the analysis. Research team leaders provided comments to RAs on the initial round of transcripts to improve the quality of interviews. The study investigators created structural codes based on the interview guide and coded all transcripts. After coding the first few transcripts, the investigators compared application of codes and reconciled any discrepancies in the application of codes. The investigators conducted an inductive thematic analysis using a data-reduction table to identify patterns in participants' decision-making and the role played by the food voucher offers in these decisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The majority (79%) of qualitative study participants who became circumcised and nearly all of those who did not (96%) were married (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The average number of dependents, both within and outside of the household, was 8.5 for circumcised participants and 7.6 for uncircumcised participants. More than half of both circumcised (53%) and uncircumcised (62%) participants were employed in occupations involving heavy manual labor (eg, farming and fishing). Approximately one quarter were employed in professions involving no manual labor (eg, teaching or office work), and the remainder were employed in professions involving some manual labor (eg, drivers, cooks). Overall, the characteristics of the qualitative participants were similar to those found in the parent study; however, it should be noted that this was not designed to be a representative sample. While the study attempted to recruit male participants for IDIs evenly across the 4 study groups, the distribution of participants across groups varied as a significantly higher proportion of participants receiving the $8.75 and $15.00 vouchers became circumcised in the RCT.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The distribution of voucher amounts was more balanced among those who did not become circumcised.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Male Participant Characteristics, by Circumcision Uptake Status</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="qai-72-s316-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The majority of participants said that the financial costs of getting circumcised were a major barrier.

Women whose partners were in the control and US $2.50 groups expressed negative opinions of the compensation amounts, whereas women whose partners received US $8.75 or US $15.00 generally had more positive opinions of the economic intervention and felt that the compensation amounts were adequate.</p><p>Finally, there was no evidence that the provision of economic compensation was perceived as being coercive. When circumcised participants were asked about the compensation amounts, they were evenly split between saying it was the right amount or <italic>too little</italic>. Even in the $15 group, among those who said that the voucher was the right amount, most said that it did not cover all their lost wages from circumcision. Circumcised participants were specifically asked, &#x0201c;Was the voucher amount so high that you felt you could not turn it down?&#x0201d; No participants perceived the amount of compensation to be coercive, although 1 circumcised participant expressed feelings of obligation to participate following randomization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results indicate that financial concerns, particularly the prospect of lost wages, continue to be an important consideration with regard to VMMC uptake for many adult men. This was true among participants who became circumcised during the study and those who did not. In addition, the results suggest that compensation in the form of food vouchers conditional on becoming circumcised was effective because they partially offset participants' opportunity costs associated with getting circumcised. For the majority of participants who chose not to get circumcised, the voucher amounts were perceived as being inadequate relative to their expected circumcision-related costs. Additionally, noneconomic barriers were identified by other uncircumcised men.</p><p>Interviews with participants who became circumcised provided support for both the hypothesized reasons why incentives or compensation provision are effective in influencing individual behaviors. Some participants indicated that they chose to undergo circumcision because the food vouchers partially offset circumcision-related economic costs. Other participations reported going for circumcision because the intervention reduced the immediate costs by a little bit and &#x0201c;nudged&#x0201d; them toward undertaking a decision that they had previously been intending to undertake in the near future. This latter result is consistent with the possibility that small incentives can help overcome decision-making biases identified in the behavioral economics literature, such as the tendency to place disproportionately greater weight on <italic>immediate</italic> costs and benefits.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The results also underscore that in order for economic interventions to be highly effective, it is important that incentive or compensation amounts are chosen correctly. In interviews with participants who did not become circumcised, a common finding was that compensation amounts were too small given how much participants reported earning. Compensation amounts exceeding US $15.00 may therefore need to be offered to achieve higher VMMC uptake.</p><p>This study is noteworthy in light of growing interest in the use of economic incentives in the HIV prevention community. Although several studies have shown that economic incentives (including conditional cash transfer programs) can promote HIV testing uptake<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and reduce HIV prevalence among young women by increasing education,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> there have been relatively few attempts to assess specific reasons why incentives have or have not been effective in certain subpopulations. This study offers insights on specific barriers addressed by compensation provision, suggests ways in which the intervention can be made more effective, and reveals the need for entirely different noneconomic interventions such as increased information or education about circumcision from knowledgeable individuals.</p><p>The relatively small sample size in this study is among its key limitations. However, given the sampling strategy and the fact that the sample reflects the study population and outcomes of the study, the results provide important insight into the effect of economic interventions on VMMC uptake in this population. Circumcision demand creation efforts and services have been widely implemented in the Nyanza area over the past 5 years, and many men have already become circumcised. Study participants could therefore differ from other men in the region in that those remaining uncircumcised perceive greater barriers than those who have already gone for circumcision. It is also likely that our findings about the role of economic factors could be specific to Kenya; similar research on compensation provision should be undertaken elsewhere.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this study provides important insights into how economic interventions influence decision-making about VMMC. Men explain a detailed thought process by which they weighed the costs and benefits of becoming circumcised and assessed whether the voucher was sufficient to outweigh the costs incurred through loss of income and transportation. Although the vouchers offered were not effective for addressing all men's concerns with circumcision, they have been shown to be an important tool for increasing circumcision uptake among some adult men and warrant further consideration in future VMMC demand creation efforts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge Emmanuel Bahati, Mary Nyakomitta, Belinda Charles Odhiambo, George Ongenga, and Nancy Achieng Ounda for conducting interviews and Megan Bronson for helping to organize the data collection process.
