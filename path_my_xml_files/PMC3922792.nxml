Several reviews and meta-analyses report that PA independently produces clinically important improvements in glucose control in people with Type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unclear what the optimal strategies are to increase PA behaviour in people with Type 2 diabetes in routine primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study will determine whether an evidence-informed multifaceted behaviour change intervention (Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes) targeting both consultation behaviour of primary healthcare professionals and PA behaviour in adults with Type 2 diabetes is both acceptable and feasible in the primary care setting. An open pilot study conducted in two primary care practices (phase one) will assess acceptability, feasibility and fidelity. Ongoing feedback from participating primary healthcare professionals and patients will provide opportunities for systematic adaptation and refinement of the intervention and study procedures. A two-arm parallel group clustered pilot randomised controlled trial with patients from participating primary care practices in North East England will assess acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the intervention (versus usual clinical care) and trial processes over a 12-month period. Consultation behaviour involving fidelity of intervention delivery, diabetes and PA related knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, intentions and self-efficacy for delivering a behaviour change intervention targeting PA behaviour will be assessed in primary healthcare professionals. We will rehearse the collection of outcome data (with the focus on data yield and quality) for a future definitive trial, through outcome assessment at baseline, one, six and twelve months. An embedded qualitative process evaluation and treatment fidelity assessment will explore issues around intervention implementation and assess whether intervention components can be reliably and faithfully delivered in routine primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes will address an important gap in the evidence-base, that is, the need for interventions to increase free-living PA behaviour in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The multifaceted intervention incorporates an online accredited training programme for primary healthcare professionals and represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. This study will establish whether the multifaceted behavioural intervention is acceptable and feasible in routine primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes (MaMT2D) was registered with Current Controlled Trials on the 14th January 2012: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN67997502">ISRCTN67997502</ext-link>.

Factors contributing to the increased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes include increased or unchanged calorie consumption combined with limited energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Reduced energy expenditure is important because the majority of people with Type 2 diabetes, or those at highest risk for developing the condition, are physically inactive compared with national norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity (PA)/exercise is widely considered to be an integral element of diabetes management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] of laboratory-based studies demonstrate that PA/exercise can produce a clinically important improvement in glucose control in people with Type 2 diabetes (in the absence of weight loss) producing an average improvement in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of between &#x02212;0.4% and &#x02212;0.6%. While this improvement is comparable to pharmacological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], pharmacology does not provide a long-term solution to glucose control in this largely progressive condition. Appropriate lifestyle behaviour changes, such as increased engagement in free-living PA, are therefore required to halt progression to subsequent classifications of drugs or insulin therapy. A 2012 meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural interventions targeting free-living PA/exercise in adults with Type 2 diabetes found a clinically important improvement in HbAlc of &#x02212;0.32%, (95% confidence interval (CI) = &#x02212;0.44% to &#x02212;0.21%) demonstrating that outcomes observed under laboratory conditions can be replicated in clinical and community settings when using evidence-based behavioural strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The Department of Health for England currently recommends that adult&#x02019;s &#x02265;19 years old should accumulate a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity PA each week to achieve tangible health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, despite the known benefits of PA, there remains a shortage of effective interventions that can be offered in the primary care setting to adults with Type 2 diabetes to support them to increase their levels of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With traditional advice-giving approaches being largely ineffective, behavioural interventions that aim to increase PA/exercise and maximise glycaemic control in the long-term are needed. Furthermore, targeting PA in the primary care setting is particularly promising because people with Type 2 diabetes have regular contact with their primary care team; therefore, multiple opportunities exist for delivery of effective interventions by primary healthcare professionals.</p><p>Although national guidelines outline the need for patient education models in the management of Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] evidence-based tools are lacking. This is especially the case with respect to advice on effective strategies/techniques for use by diabetes care providers to increase levels of PA/exercise. The majority of people with Type 2 diabetes in the UK are offered some form of education/intervention, at least at the point of diagnosis; however, the length, information content and style of the interventions vary greatly between services. The majority of interventions do not include adequate support to help people with Type 2 diabetes to achieve PA recommendations, very few have been formally evaluated, and rarely have the individuals responsible for the delivery of these interventions been formally trained for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A 2012 systematic review of behavioural interventions targeting PA/exercise reported that five out of seventeen RCTs targeting PA/exercise referred to training for care providers. Furthermore, two of these five trials explicitly described the content of training provided, and none of the included trials attempted to assess the efficacy of the training on consultation behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. With so few primary studies explicitly utilising treatment fidelity strategies to monitor and improve training for care providers (where training is offered), or to monitor the delivery of interventions to patients in practice, it is difficult to establish whether the interventions are being delivered as intended. Therefore it becomes impossible to decipher whether reported outcomes are a function of the intervention or &#x02018;non-intervention&#x02019; factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><sec><title>Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes</title><p>The multifaceted behaviour change intervention &#x02018;Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes&#x02019; (MaMT2D) aims to address the evidence gaps outlined above. The first component is an online training intervention programme for primary healthcare professionals to develop knowledge and skills for (1) use of a range of behaviour change counselling skills and evidence-based behaviour change techniques for improving free-living PA behaviour; and (2) delivery of a primary healthcare professional-led intervention to engage adults with Type 2 diabetes in discussions about increasing their levels of free-living PA. The second component (primary healthcare professional-led intervention) provides adults with Type 2 diabetes with evidence based intervention strategies and a range of resources to facilitate an increase in free-living PA behaviour; for example decisional balance aids, activity planners/trackers and pedometers (SW200, Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>Following the Medical Research Council framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the current intervention was developed following an initial needs assessment with patients and primary healthcare professionals. This informed a subsequent participatory development process involving primary healthcare professionals, psychologists, physiologists, clinical experts, designers and adults with Type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting. This allowed identification of the most appropriate mode of delivery and form of intervention components for patients and primary healthcare professionals.</p><p>The information content of MaMT2D was informed by the findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis of behavioural interventions targeting free-living PA/exercise in adults with Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This review reported on a series of moderator analyses to identify specific candidate behaviour change techniques and intervention features associated with clinical effectiveness (&#x02265;0.3% reduction in HbA1c). Moderator analyses showed positive associations between theory-based interventions and clinical effectiveness (although no one theory held benefit over another), including interventions lasting at least six months in duration and interventions that utilised &#x02265;10 behaviour change techniques. Analyses did not identify a specific mode of delivery (group sessions versus individual face-to-face sessions versus a combination of group and individual face-to-face sessions) associated with clinical effectiveness; therefore, mode of delivery was selected in accordance with the views elicited from primary healthcare professionals (online) and patients (individual face-to-face sessions) during the participatory development process.</p><p>Given that the optimal theoretical underpinning of behaviour change interventions targeting PA in the context of diabetes care was not elucidated by the systematic review, key selection criteria were agreed for theory selection. These criteria included a strong evidence-base for modelling the process of intervention components and outcomes that were the foci of MaMT2D (increasing free-living PA in adults with type 2 diabetes and enhancing consultation behaviour of primary healthcare professionals to deliver a PA behavioural intervention to adults with type 2 diabetes).</p><p>Exploratory work with primary healthcare professionals and patients identified the need to target: 1) motivational factors, such as attitudes/beliefs regarding the use of PA by healthcare professionals as a management option for people with Type 2 diabetes; 2) volitional factors, such as self-efficacy to increase and maintain increases in PA behaviour in adults with Type 2 diabetes; and 3) self-efficacy of healthcare professionals for delivering a behavioural intervention in routine primary care. Therefore, additional criteria for guiding theory selection included: 1) capable of targeting both motivational and volitional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; and 2) existence of in-built constructs and evidence-based strategies that can be used effectively to target both motivation/intention and actual behaviour to support maintenance. Furthermore, theories needed to have readily available, reliable and valid instruments to measure the theoretical constructs and postulated relationships between constructs to inform the evaluation strategy for MaM2TD.</p><p>In accordance with these explicit criteria, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] were selected to underpin the development and evaluation of the MaMT2D intervention. The TPB has been extensively and successfully used to predict intentions to increase PA and actual PA behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] including healthcare professional behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the TPB does not provide guidance on how theoretical constructs can be targeted within interventions using evidence-based strategies, or how to address the frequent lack of concordance between motivation/intention and action, that is the &#x02018;intention-behaviour&#x02019; gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>SCT has demonstrated utility in samples of people with diabetes when predicting PA behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and provides specific evidence-based strategies for translating motivation/intentions into action/behaviour in both healthcare professionals and patients (for example, observational learning strategies, such as modelling to support the acquisition of behaviour changes skills and self-efficacy for the effective delivery of behaviour change techniques to patients). Together the TPB and SCT provide a complimentary theoretical framework for guiding the design and evaluation of the intervention components within MaMT2D.</p><p>In addition, a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis identified a range of evidence-based behaviour change techniques associated with clinically important improvements in glycaemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These techniques were included in the MaM2TD intervention alongside other evidence-based intervention components/techniques informed by TPB and SCT. Briefly they are: use of follow-up prompts (PA behaviour will be prompted at the three-month time point via a telephone call from a participating primary healthcare professional and a motivational postcard from the research team); information on where and when to perform PA behaviour (primary healthcare professionals will be given access to an online repository where they can access specific details about local activities, for example, time and location); plan social support/social change (patients will be encouraged to elicit support (practical or emotional) from friends and family members); goal setting behaviour (patients will be supported to set their own PA goals); barrier identification/problem solving (patients will be asked to consider in advance barriers to attaining their goals and encouraged to consider ways to overcome them); time management (patients will be supported to identify appropriate times to be active); prompt rewards contingent on effort or progress made towards a predetermined goal (patients will be encouraged to reward any progress made towards PA goals); prompt review of behavioural goals (PA goals will be reviewed four times over a twelve-month period); prompt generalisation of PA behaviour (patients will be supported to increase PA behaviour in a different setting or situation once they have mastered it in one setting); prompt focus on past success (patients will be asked to consider past successful attempts at PA); provide information on the consequences of behaviour to the individual (patients will receive specific and relevant information if/when requested, for example, the effect of PA on their HbA1c); feedback on performance (feedback on consequences of behaviour will be provided to patients during each review appointment); action planning (patients will be supported to set SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and self-monitoring of PA behaviour (patients will be offered use of activity planners, trackers and a pedometer).</p><p>The efficacy of several techniques identified by the systematic review (and others included in the current intervention) has been reported previously in the context of PA behaviour change. For example, interventions utilising action planning and coping planning were found to predict an increase in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Indeed, it has been reported that inclusion of both action planning and coping planning at different stages of the behaviour change process is optimal when targeting PA behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Self-regulation strategies, such as self-monitoring, are reported to be more effective than interventions not utilising this technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of interventions is optimised when self-monitoring is combined with at least one other self-regulatory technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The behaviour change techniques selected are consistent with theories used to integrate and organise the delivery of techniques in MaMT2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The online training intervention programme is designed to provide primary healthcare professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence (self-efficacy) to use the MaMT2D behaviour change techniques and intervention components in practice.</p><p>Finally, primary healthcare professionals will be shown how to use a range of behaviour change strategies/counselling skills to promote PA behaviour change. These include: agenda setting; use of importance and confidence rulers to initiate change talk; a decisional balance aid to discuss pros and cons for change; and communication skills (asking open questions, active listening and informing).</p><p>This protocol describes a two-phase process that will be used to develop and evaluate MaMT2D. Phase one is an open pilot study that will assess the acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of delivery of MaMT2D and will provide opportunities for intervention optimisation and refinement of study processes and procedures. Phase two is an external pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will assess acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of MaMT2D (informed by any necessary optimisation identified in phase one) over a 12 month period. A qualitative process evaluation and treatment fidelity assessment will be carried out throughout the trial period, to identify any barriers and facilitators to implementation as well as adherence to the study protocol by primary healthcare professionals and patients. The pilot RCT will be conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: SPIRIT Checklist) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phase One: Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes: Open Pilot Study</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to conduct an open pilot study to establish the acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of the multifaceted intervention MaMT2D in the primary care setting. Intervention components will be iteratively optimised incorporating feedback from primary healthcare professionals and patients during the open pilot study. Recruitment, retention and adherence rates, including willingness to take part in video recordings of consultations, semi structured interviews, focus group discussions and complete study outcome measures will be assessed to inform a pilot RCT (phase two).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The open pilot study (phase one) will assess and optimise the acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of intervention delivery before MaMT2D enters a pilot RCT. Due to the high level of user involvement (healthcare professionals and patients) throughout the intervention development process, it is unlikely that the open pilot study will raise any important issues. An open pilot component was incorporated to identify and resolve any implementation issues and facilitate refinements to the intervention ahead of a planned pilot RCT. This will increase the likelihood that the intervention will be acceptable, feasible and delivered to a satisfactory level of fidelity. Should the open pilot indicate that some modifications to the intervention and research procedures are needed, these will be made prior to moving onto the pilot RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Two primary care practices in the County Durham and Darlington area of North East England will each recruit 15 patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) in line with standard guidance for pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria for primary care practices</title><p>The eligibility criteria for primary care practices are as follows:</p><p>1.

A primary care data quality analyst from the North of England Commissioning Support Service will provide each primary care practice with system specific reports to enable them to identify patients who meet the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Patients registered at each participating practice who fulfil pre-defined eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> provides an overview of practice and patient recruitment.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing the planned study recruitment processes for primary care practices, professionals and patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-15-46-1"/></fig><p>All primary care practices in the County Durham and Darlington area of North East England will be invited to participate in the study. The Primary Care Research Network (PCRN) and clinical leads from the North East Commissioning Service will facilitate practice recruitment by distributing postal invitations to all practices and making personal contact with practice managers and clinical commissioning groups.</p><p>To allow continuity of care (should one primary healthcare professional withdraw from the study), a minimum of two primary healthcare professionals from each participating practice will be required to provide informed written consent to take part in the study. Consent will be sought from primary healthcare professionals to complete the online training intervention programme and subsequently to deliver the primary healthcare professional-led intervention to patients recruited to the study (should their practice be randomly allocated to MaMT2D); and to complete online study questionnaires at baseline, one, six and twelve months. Separate consent will be sought to video record consultations with patients for the purposes of treatment fidelity assessment; to take part in one or more interviews with a researcher to identify barriers and enabling factors to effective implementation of the intervention in primary care; and to take part in a focus group discussion with a researcher and other participating primary healthcare professionals upon completion of the study (to gauge overall opinion of the intervention and study processes and procedures, including ways in which they could be improved). If primary healthcare professionals decide to opt out of video recordings, interviews and focus group discussions, they can still participate in the main study. A member of the research team will obtain informed written consent from each participating primary healthcare professional [See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Healthcare Professional Consent Form and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Practice Information Sheet]. Two copies of the consent form will be signed and countersigned. One copy will be retained by the practice and stored in their study site file and a second copy retained and filed securely by the research team. The decision regarding participation is entirely voluntary and participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Ethical permission was not sought to collect data from participants once they have made a decision to leave the study (that is, following cessation of outcome data provision and discontinuation of treatment); although any data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be included in the analyses, unless the participant (healthcare professional or patient) specifically requests they be removed.</p><p>Specific design decisions were made to limit the amount of missing data in accordance with published guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The MaMT2D intervention was designed to be flexible and to accommodate individual differences; therefore, patients will be supported by primary healthcare professionals to identify their activity of choice, including frequency, intensity and duration to increase tolerability. Furthermore, MaMT2D was designed to be integrated into usual clinical care. Consequently, patients randomised to the MaMT2D intervention will receive the intervention components during their usual diabetes review appointments to reduce burden. Finally, an experienced research nurse employed by the Diabetes Research Network will collect clinical outcome data from electronic patient records during each data collection phase (that is, baseline, one, six and twelve months) to minimise the burden on participating healthcare professionals and practice personnel. Information from each participant consent form will be entered into a password protected data management system that will record consent preferences (for example, decision to participate or not in semi-structured interviews). Each practice will be randomised to the intervention or control group following receipt of informed written consent by all participating primary healthcare professionals.</p><p>Practices will be stratified based on list size (with three cut-off points: &#x0003c;3,280; &#x02265;3,280 to 5,989; &#x02265;5,990 to 10,453; and &#x0003e;10,454) and randomised to either the intervention or control group prior to identification and recruitment of patients.</p><p>A nominated member of staff from each participating practice will be asked to identify all patients registered on their practice list who meet the eligibility criteria. An invitation letter printed on practice headed paper, a standardised patient information sheet and consent form [See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Patient Information Sheet Control Group; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Patient Information Sheet Intervention Group; and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Patient Consent Form] along with a pre-paid envelope will be mailed to all eligible patients. Patients who do not respond to the invitation within a six-week period will be mailed a reminder letter. Patients will be asked to provide informed written consent to attend four face-to-face appointments at their primary care practice; wear an accelerometer for seven continuous days, complete a study questionnaire and have clinical measures taken at each data collection time point (baseline, one, six and twelve months). In addition, separate consent will be sought to video record their consultations; to take part in semi-structured interviews with a researcher (to identify enabling factors and barriers to effective implementation of MaMT2D in primary care); and to take part in a focus group discussion with a researcher and other participating patients from their practice upon completion of the study (to gauge overall opinion of the intervention and study processes and procedures, including ways in which they could be improved). If patients decide to opt out of video recordings, interviews and focus group discussions, they can still remain in the main study. Consent from both the healthcare professional and patient are required before a video recording of a consultation can take place. The first two practices to provide informed written consent will enter the open pilot study described above. Each practice will be provided with a site file containing a copy of the trial protocol, patient information sheets and consent forms for reference purposes and a log for recording and monitoring patient recruitment, attrition and adverse events. If a drop-out or adverse event occurs, the contact person at the practice will be asked to contact a member of the study team to provide details. A log of all recruitment activity will be maintained by the study team and stored on a password-protected server at Newcastle University.</p><p>Participating primary healthcare professionals will be interviewed by a member of the research team prior to, and following, completion of the online training intervention programme. This training has been accredited by the Federation of the Royal College of Physicians, with completion conferring three Continuing Professional Development points. The online training intervention programme has been designed to: (1) increase the diabetes and PA related knowledge of primary healthcare professionals; (2) develop positive attitudes/beliefs towards use of PA as a management option for diabetes; (3) enhance self-efficacy for delivering a primary healthcare professional-led behavioural intervention targeting PA to patients with Type 2 diabetes; and (4) promote skills development in terms of delivering specific behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling skills in the context of diabetes management.</p><p>Interviews with primary healthcare professionals will focus specifically on the acceptability and feasibility of the MaMT2D intervention, including study processes and procedures. Suggestions for improvement will be discussed with the research team and, where feasible, incorporated into the intervention, research processes and procedures for the subsequent pilot randomised controlled trial. Primary healthcare professionals at participating practices will be asked to review all changes prior to their implementation. The interview topic guides will be developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The TDF is the result of a multi-disciplinary expert consensus approach aiming to organise and simplify the theoretical literature on behaviour change by reviewing 33 behavioural theories and organising the 128 key constructs into broad &#x02018;theory domains&#x02019; based on commonalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. After further validations, the TDF consists of 14 theory domains each providing broad explanations of why a behaviour was or was not performed: &#x02018;Knowledge&#x02019;, &#x02018;Skills&#x02019;, &#x02018;Professional Role and Identity&#x02019;, &#x02018;Beliefs about Capabilities&#x02019;, &#x02018;Optimism&#x02019;, &#x02018;Beliefs about Consequences&#x02019;, &#x02018;Reinforcement&#x02019;, &#x02018;Intentions&#x02019;, &#x02018;Goals&#x02019;, &#x02018;Memory, Attention and Decision Processes&#x02019;, &#x02018;Environmental Context and Resources&#x02019;, &#x02018;Social Influences&#x02019;, &#x02018;Emotions&#x02019; and &#x02018;Behavioural Regulation&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. While the TDF is not a theory as such, it has been useful in organising narrative data to link findings of qualitative research back to theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and is used here to identify domain specific issues with the online training intervention programme (for example, knowledge/skills gaps) and supporting materials for the primary healthcare professional-led intervention for use with patients.</p><p>Interviews during phase one will be conducted with patients immediately following their diabetes review appointments incorporating MaMT2D at baseline and at one-month follow-up. Patients will be interviewed by a member of the research team using a topic guide developed using the TDF to establish comprehension, acceptability of the primary healthcare professional-led intervention and to detect any domain specific issues (for example, information/support gaps).</p><p>Treatment fidelity assessment with primary healthcare professionals (video recordings of MaMT2D consultations with patients) will identify adherence to components of the primary healthcare professional-led intervention in accordance with the content of the online training intervention programme. A fidelity checklist developed for the purpose of this study will be used to assess presence/absence and appropriate use of intervention components. This will enable insights into potential adaptations or improvements to the online training intervention programme for primary healthcare professionals, including the tools (paper-based materials, DVD and pedometer) used within the primary healthcare professional-led intervention. Review appointments will be video recorded and assessed for treatment fidelity only when both participating primary healthcare professionals and patients provide their informed written consent. Following published guidance, 20% to 40% of consultations will be video recorded and, where feasible, equal numbers of consultations will be video recorded at each intervention time point to ensure representativeness of the data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Healthcare professional and patient data (including consent, fidelity, outcome data and patient appointment dates) will be entered in a data management system by a member of the research team. A data manager from the Diabetes Research Network will enter patient questionnaire data at each data collection time point. Questionnaire data from healthcare professionals will be transferred electronically from Survey Monkey by a member of the research team. The data management system will generate alerts via email ahead of each participant&#x02019;s data collection time point and a member of the research team will respond to these alerts accordingly.</p><p>The use of an open pilot study enables an iterative and systematic approach to intervention adaptation and refinement, to optimise the multifaceted intervention for use in the clinical setting and to refine study processes and procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Amendments to intervention components</title><p>An assessment will be made following completion of the open pilot study to determine whether any amendments to the intervention and study processes and procedures are required. All interview data will be analysed by LA (and a proportion of transcripts analysed by SJD) and any issues with the intervention, study processes and procedures will be addressed following discussion with the research team. A final decision to continue to the pilot RCT will be made by the principal investigator, MIT. All video recordings from the open pilot consultations will be coded by LA (a proportion double coded by a researcher with expertise in health behaviour change to ensure reliability) and discussed with the research team. An assessment will be made as to whether fidelity of delivery (adherence to intervention components) is sufficiently high to permit the study to continue to the pilot RCT in phase two (that is, whether primary healthcare professionals have attained adequate coverage of intervention components where appropriate). Where omissions are consistent across primary healthcare professionals, reasons for this will be explored and the research team will discuss how the programme can be improved to increase fidelity during phase two. Measuring adherence to pre-defined intervention components is quantifiable; however, adherence may not require all components of an intervention to be delivered during every individual session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. For example, the use of the technique &#x02018;generalisation of physical activity behaviour&#x02019; is unlikely to be used during a baseline session; therefore, appropriate absence of this technique will be recorded during the coding process. Where it is appropriate to use a behaviour change technique or an intervention component, a fidelity threshold will be applied where 50% will be considered &#x02018;sufficiently high&#x02019; to continue to the pilot RCT in phase two.</p><p>Following amendments to the intervention, primary healthcare professionals will be asked to revisit the online training intervention programme and materials to review any revised (or new) content before continuing to deliver the intervention to patients. All amendments to the intervention and study processes and procedures will be made prior to commencement of phase two of the study. Any changes to the study protocol will be documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Movement as Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes: Components of the intervention</title><p>This multifaceted behaviour change intervention comprises two distinct but interrelated components: an online training intervention programme for healthcare professionals and a primary healthcare professional-led intervention toolkit for patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthcare professional online training intervention programme</title><p>The online training intervention programme presents eight distinct but interrelated modules that cover topics such as diabetes and metabolism, PA and exercise and the psychology of behaviour change. Module 7 is a dedicated &#x02018;skills based&#x02019; module that aims to equip primary healthcare professionals with the skills to use pre-selected behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling skills listed previously to promote patient centeredness and increase PA behaviour in patients. Textual information, interactive features, video demonstrations, and consolidation quiz questions at the end of each core module aim to prepare primary healthcare professionals to confidently and faithfully deliver the primary healthcare professional-led intervention to participating patients. Once all content of the training intervention programme is viewed by primary healthcare professionals an online certificate will be generated to confirm completion.</p><p>Primary healthcare professionals employed by both primary care practices will complete the online training intervention programme component of MaMT2D. They will be emailed a unique login ID to access the password protected programme and will be given four weeks to complete all modules before using the intervention with patients. Ongoing access to the programme will be provided for the duration of the study and can be accessed at any time.

The printed materials comprise: 1) a discussion card presenting a decisional balance aid, importance and confidence rulers and a seven-day PA recall diary to enable individualised feedback to be provided on current PA behaviour (type, frequency, intensity and duration); and (2) a booklet to support patients through the process of short and long-term PA goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring towards their PA goal and encouragement to use rewards contingent on progress made towards a previously set PA goal. A menu of PA options is presented to encourage patient autonomy (that is, to consider what type of PA they would like to incorporate into their everyday lives), and activity planners and trackers are provided to allow patients to self-monitor the amount of time they spend active (or the number of steps taken each day) with reference to a predetermined PA goal (that is, patients will be supported to develop their own PA goals and plans and revise them based on their individual needs and preferences).

A refined and optimised version of both components of MaMT2D (online training intervention programme for primary healthcare professionals and the range of printed materials, DVD and pedometer (SW200, Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for patients (as part of the primary healthcare professional-led intervention) will be compared with usual clinical care. Assessment of all outcomes will inform future work (for example, a definitive RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient outcome measures</title><p>PA behaviour will be measured objectively using a blinded (that is, no data visible to patients) wrist worn tri-axial accelerometer (GENEActiv, ActivInsights Ltd, Kimbolton, UK) for seven continuous days at each data collection time point. Clinical outcome measures, comprising glycaemic control (HbA1c), diastolic and systolic blood pressure (mmHg), waist circumference (cm) and body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), will be measured and recorded by primary healthcare professionals during review appointments. Self-reported PA (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]; diabetes-related knowledge (Audit of Diabetes Knowledge (ADKnowl)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]; behavioural intentions, subjective norms and attitudes/beliefs about PA for the management of diabetes (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Diabetic Patients (PAQ-DP)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]; PA-related self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]; and health-related quality of life (Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] will be measured by self-report postal questionnaire. Each outcome will be assessed at baseline, one, six and twelve-month follow up. Background information will be collected from patients on age, gender, employment status, length of time since diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes and method of diabetes control (that is, diet, oral medication).</p></sec><sec><title>Healthcare professional outcome measures</title><p>Change in consultation behaviour involving utilisation of selected behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling techniques will be assessed subjectively using a questionnaire specifically developed for the purpose of this study. Objective assessments will be made by video recording a sub-sample of primary healthcare professionals in practice. Self-reported diabetes and PA-related knowledge; behavioural intentions, subjective norms, attitudes/beliefs about PA as a management option for Type 2 diabetes (adapted PAQ-DP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]; self-efficacy for delivering a behaviour change intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]; and PA behaviour (IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] will be assessed by online questionnaire at each data collection time point (baseline, one, six and twelve months follow up). Background information will be collected about current job title and role, length of time in current role, details of any previous training undertaken in the area of health behaviour change (for example, behaviour change counselling and motivational interviewing), diabetes and PA for the management of Type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity assessment</title><p>A sub-sample (20% to 40%) of consultations will be video recorded to assess fidelity of primary healthcare professionals use of specific behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling techniques within MaMT2D consultations (and usual care consultations) with patients. Each intervention component will be coded as either &#x02018;present&#x02019; or &#x02018;absent &#x02018;and an assessment will be made on the extent to which it was utilised (that is, how closely delivery meets pre-specified criteria of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and intervention components). The Behaviour Change Counselling Index (BECCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] will be used to assess primary healthcare professional&#x02019;s use of behaviour change counselling skills to enhance patient-centeredness of consultations. A sub-sample of video recordings will be double coded by a second coder and any discrepancies will be resolved by a third coder. All coders will have expertise in theory-linked BCTs, including experience using the 40-item taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] used to define BCTs and behaviour change counselling techniques included in MaMT2D. This assessment will enable quantification of primary healthcare professional and patient interactions, to provide insights into the therapeutic relationship, as well as allow an assessment to be made as to whether this relationship translates into actual PA behaviour change. The outcome of these analyses obtained during the pilot RCT will help to understand the nature of the interaction during MaMT2D consultations and usual clinical care, and to identify any potential barriers and facilitators to effective implementation of the intervention in routine primary care. Assessment of treatment fidelity will help determine whether any estimated differences detected in objectively assessed PA behaviour between the intervention and control group patients can be attributed to any changes in consultation behaviour of participating primary healthcare professionals (influenced by the online training intervention programme) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>To maximise treatment fidelity a number of strategies will be used.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity strategies for design of the study</title><p>Both intervention and control group patients will receive the same &#x02018;treatment dose&#x02019; (that is, the same number of contacts from primary healthcare professionals and the research team). To plan for implementation setbacks a minimum of two primary healthcare professionals will be recruited (and trained in the intervention arm of the study) from each primary care practice. By utilising treatment fidelity strategies related to study design, the study aims and objectives can be adequately tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving provider training</title><p>A standardised online training intervention programme will be provided to ensure all primary healthcare professionals in the intervention arm of the study receive access to the same training content. Where primary healthcare professionals do not adhere sufficiently to delivery of pre-selected behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling skills, the research team will explore possible reasons for this and changes to the intervention will be made as appropriate during the open pilot study. Video recordings of consultations will be made throughout phases one and two to assess skill acquisition, utilisation and treatment fidelity.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment fidelity strategies for monitoring and improving receipt of the intervention</title><p>A qualitative process evaluation and treatment fidelity assessment will be conducted throughout phases one and two to assess primary healthcare professional performance on delivery of specific behaviour change techniques and behaviour change counselling skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative process evaluation</title><p>Interviews will be carried out with a purposive sample of primary healthcare professionals and patients during phases one and two of the study. Interview topic guides will be developed using the TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The outcome of interviews will help to optimise the intervention, and streamline study processes and procedures during phase one and to obtain an in-depth understanding of barriers and facilitators to successful implementation during phase two. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. A proportion of transcripts will be analysed by a second researcher.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection, storage and security</title><p>Data collected via audio recorders, video recorders and accelerometers will be saved to a password protected server in the Institute of Cellular Medicine (ICM) at Newcastle University. These data will be accessed only by members of the research team. Once all data have been uploaded to the server they will be securely deleted from the recording devices. Patient questionnaire data will be anonymised and stored in locked filing cabinets in the ICM.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and concealment of allocation</title><p>Practice recruitment will be carried out in two stages. Practices will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual clinical care group after each recruitment stage and following receipt of informed written consent from participating primary healthcare professionals. Consent will be obtained by a member of the research team who is blind to details of randomisation sequencing and concealment. Practices will be allocated to one of four strata based on list size with three cut-off points: &#x0003c;3,280; &#x02265;3,280 to 5,989; &#x02265;5,990 to 10,453; and &#x0003e;10454 (thresholds based on quartiles of distribution of list size across all practices in the County Durham &#x00026; Darlington area of North East England) and will be randomised independently within strata using random permuted blocks. The blocks will be generated using a subroutine that utilises the &#x02018;rand()&#x02019; function built into the programming language awk implemented on the central Linux system at Newcastle University. The size of blocks will be concealed until the end of recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>It is inherently difficult to blind primary healthcare professionals and patients in behavioural interventions with the nature of usual clinical care for diabetes being so well defined. Therefore, blinding of participants will not be possible. Due to pragmatic reasons researchers will not be blinded to group allocation of participating practices; however, the statistical analyses will be performed by a statistician blind to the treatment allocation of participating primary healthcare professionals and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>Analyses of data collected from phase two (the pilot RCT) will be descriptive with key outcomes being interval estimates of the variables of interest relating to assessment of acceptability, feasibility and data completeness. Although we may not have the power to detect a clinically important difference between groups we will generate interval estimates of the mean difference between groups for the main outcome measures to be included in a definitive trial (for example, PA and HbA1c). This will allow us to test the appropriateness of our analytic procedures. As this is a pilot study, the level of missing data will be documented but no imputation will be undertaken. Since we can not rule out the possibility of a very large difference between groups, the outcome of the analyses may suggest that a larger trial is not required. Planned exploratory sub-group analyses will be conducted to determine whether differences exist between primary healthcare professionals based on role and between patients as a function of gender, age, method of diabetes control and length of time since diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>A favourable ethical opinion for this study (protocol version 1.1) was granted by Sunderland Research Ethics Committee (application number 12/NE/0037). National Health Service (NHS) Research &#x00026; Development approval was granted by NHS County Durham &#x00026; Darlington. The trial was subsequently adopted by the CLRN portfolio to receive support from both the Diabetes Research Network (DRN) and Primary Care Research Network (PCRN).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PA/exercise is an integral part of diabetes management. However, the use of PA/exercise in routine clinical care for adults with Type 2 diabetes is hindered by the lack of acceptable, feasible and robustly evaluated interventions. Availability of such interventions will enable diabetes care providers to support their patients to increase and maintain their levels of free-living PA that are sufficient for achieving long-term glycaemic control.</p><p>The effective delivery of behavioural interventions is compromised by the lack of evidence-based training programmes to equip healthcare professionals with a range of intervention-specific competencies (knowledge and skills) and confidence to support adults with Type 2 diabetes to become more physically active in the long-term. A systematic review of 17 trials reported use of treatment fidelity measures in a majority of studies in terms of study design (for example, consistent duration and frequency of sessions across trial arms) and monitoring to improve receipt of intervention components and enactment of intervention&#x02013;related knowledge and skills by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, treatment fidelity strategies to monitor and improve provider training and delivery of treatment in practice were frequently omitted (for example, use of standardised training materials, observation of intervention implementation during training and video recordings of sessions with intervention providers and recipients). Training of intervention providers and treatment fidelity assessment are important for ensuring reproducibility of intervention-related skills in clinical practice and increasing the likelihood of implementation in routine clinical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The current study aims to address the above three barriers to facilitate use of PA as a management option for Type 2 diabetes in the routine primary care setting. MaMT2D is, to the best of our knowledge, the UK&#x02019;s first online accredited training intervention programme to support primary healthcare professionals to develop the competencies to effectively deliver a primary healthcare professional-led intervention targeting the increase and maintenance of free-living PA in patients with Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>MaMT2D has been developed through a structured participatory design process, involving healthcare professionals and adults with Type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting working alongside psychologists, physiologists, designers and clinical experts. The theoretical underpinning of the multifaceted behaviour change intervention is evidence-based and the content informed by a systematic review of the evidence on behaviour change strategies and other intervention features used in behavioural interventions targeting free-living PA in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The approach used to develop the intervention maximises the likelihood that MaMT2D is acceptable and feasible for use by primary healthcare providers and patients in the clinical setting.</p><p>An open pilot design will allow opportunities for optimisation and refinement of study procedures and information content of both the online training intervention (primary healthcare professionals) and paper-based materials in the patient toolkit for use within the primary healthcare professional-led intervention in accordance with the preferences of primary healthcare professionals and patients. A subsequent external pilot cluster RCT (informed by the findings of the open pilot) and concomitant qualitative process evaluation and fidelity assessment will assess to what extent intervention components can be reliably and faithfully delivered in routine practice. Interval estimates of the mean difference between groups for the main outcome measures at each time point will be reported. Treatment fidelity strategies (use of standardised training, study manuals, ongoing process evaluation and video recording and assessment of patient sessions (intervention and usual clinical care)) will be utilised throughout the intervention period to serve two main purposes: 1) to ensure the intervention is being delivered according to the protocol; and 2) to identify any barriers to successful delivery of the intervention content and implementation in routine practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of primary healthcare practices to MaMT2D commenced during July 2012.
