The study was aimed to compare the prophylactic effects of intravenously administered palonosetron, ondansetron, and granisetron on prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This prospective, double-blind study, comprised 120 adult consented patients of ASA grade I and II of either gender, was carried out after approval of Institutional Ethical Committee. Patients were randomized into three equal groups of 40 patients each in double-blind manner. Group P received inj. palonosetron (0.075 mg), group O received inj. ondansetron (4 mg), and group G received inj. granisetron (2 mg) intravenously five minutes before induction of anesthesia. The need for rescue antiemetic, episode of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and side effects were observed for 12 hours in the post-anesthesia care unit.

The incidence of PONV is 30-40% in normal population and touches a peak of 75-80% in certain high-risk groups.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] With the use of lesser emetogenic anesthetic techniques and advent of newer drugs for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the incidence of PONV has come down by 50%, especially with the use of non-opioid medication for pain relief.</p><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting is defined as nausea and/or vomiting occurring within 24 hours after surgery. Patient characteristics, type of surgical procedure, duration of anesthesia, and surgery are few of the important determinants for risk of PONV. There is involvement of three nerves and seven neurotransmitters for activation of vomiting center, which makes the prophylaxis and treatment complex. The antiemetic premedication can reduce the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Numerous pharmacological agent, regimens, and techniques were evolved from time to time, but they have limited efficacy due to various side effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist are effective antiemetic drugs with more safety and favorable side effect profile as they lack the sedation, dysphoria, and extra-pyramidal side effects of other commonly used antiemetics. Ondansetron is the first 5-HT3 antagonist, used alone or in combination for the prophylaxis due to its lower cost. Granisetron is highly selective, potent, and produces irreversible block of 5-HT3 receptors. Palonosetron is the second generation 5-HT3 antagonist with unique chemical structure and longer half- life of 40 hours.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present double-blind, randomized prospective study was aimed to compare the antiemetic efficacy, duration of action, and side effects of palonosetron, ondansetron, and granisetron for antiemetic prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval by the Institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent, 120 adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I and II, aged 18-58 years of either gender, scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia, were enrolled for present study. All the patients underwent pre-anesthetic assessment before enrollment. Patients with history of systemic hypertension, endocrine or metabolic disorders, hepatic or renal disease, cardio-pulmonary dysfunction, patients with gastro-intestinal disorders, psychiatric diseases, and morbid obesity were excluded from study. Other exclusion criterions were pregnant and menstruating females, history of motion sickness or those who had taken antiemetic drugs within 24 hours before surgical procedures.</p><p>The total 120 patients were equally divided into three groups of 40 patients according to a computer-generated random table. Patients of group P were given injection palonosetron (0.075 mg), patients of group O were given injection ondansetron (4 mg), and patients of group G were given injection granisetron (2 mg), intravenously along with premedication, five minutes before induction of general anesthesia. The study drug preparation was done by an assistant who was unaware to the study protocol and was not involved in the study for any further evaluation of patients.</p><p>All patients were given tab alprazolam 0.25 mg and tab ranitidine 150 mg the night before surgery and were kept fasting for eight hours prior surgery. On arrival to operation-theater, routine monitoring of heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), electrocardiogram (ECG) was started. After securing intravenous line, infusion of lactate Ringer was started. Patients were premedicated with intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>), and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) followed by study medication according to group allocation five minutes prior to induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>After pre-oxygenation, induction was done with propofol (2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium bromide 0.08 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, N<sub>2</sub>O (60%) in oxygen. All patients were mechanically ventilated to maintain the EtCO2 between 35-40 mm Hg. Additional analgesia during the surgery was achieved with fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g). At the end of surgery, the residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with appropriate doses of neostigmine (0.05 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Extubation was performed when respiration was adequate and patient was able to obey simple commands.</p><p>The baseline systemic arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, and SpO2 were recorded followed by after premedication, after induction and then at five min intervals till one hour and then at every 15 min till the end of surgery. They were monitored for any hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, hypoxemia, and bronchial spasm. Hemodynamic changes occurring during study period were managed with volume expansion, vasopressor or atropine, if required.</p><p>Postoperatively, nausea or emetic episode were recorded by the nursing staff without knowledge of which group of anti-emetic drug was given to the patients. The side effects like headache, dizziness, and drowsiness were also noted. Postoperatively, the patients were given intramuscular injection of diclofenac sodium (75 mg) for postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Nausea was defined as an urge to vomit, and vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth. Patients were asked about nausea and vomiting at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours. Complete response was defined as no nausea, retching or vomiting, and no need of rescue antiemetic medication within 12 hours in postoperative period. If required, rescue anti-emetic metoclopramide 5 mg was given intramuscularly. The total number of complete responders was recorded.</p><p>For the study, the minimum sample size required was 32 patients in each group for type 1 error of 0.01 and power of 90% to ensure statistically significant results. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, total 120 patients were enrolled for better validation of results. The recorded data are systematically compiled in tabulated manner as mean &#x000b1; SD and analyzed by Stat graphics Centurion, using one-way ANOVA and Chi-square test. Comparison between groups for postoperative nausea and vomiting score was performed by using the Kruskal Wallis test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study was successfully conducted on 120 adult consented patients for their postoperative assessment of PONV.

There were only few episodes of headache and dizziness, which were resolved as time relapsed without any specific treatment.</p><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting is defined as nausea and/or vomiting occurring within 24 hours after surgery. Vomiting involves co-ordination of the respiratory, gastro-intestinal and abdominal musculature, and is controlled by the vomiting center, which is situated in the lateral reticular formation close to tractus solitarius in the brain stem. The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema is rich in dopamine, opioid, and serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.</p><p>The etiology of the PONV is complex and multifactorial. Preoperative anxiety, positive pressure ventilation, inhalational anesthetic agents, and nitrous oxide increase the risk of PONV. Anesthetic agents initiate the vomiting reflex by stimulating the central 5-HT3 receptors on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). PONV is more common in younger age group and in obese patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Apfel <italic>et al</italic>. considered laparoscopic surgery, female gender, non-smokers, a history of PONV, motion sickness, and postoperative opioid therapy as important independent causal factors for PONV.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Antiemetic drugs tend to have more prominent action at one or two receptors while 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are highly specific and selective for acting against nausea and vomiting by binding to the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and at vagal efferent in the gastrointestinal tracts.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The present study showed that the palonosetron and granisetron were statistically superior to ondansetron for control of PONV and the difference was statistically highly significant in first 12 hrs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). During the present study, anesthetic and surgical factors were well controlled, so that any difference in emesis free episodes can be attributed to the study drugs and goes in accordance with the studies conducted by Tram&#x000e8;r <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Gigilla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The optimal dose of palonosetron is 0.075 mg and is more effective in preventing nausea and vomiting for a longer period of time with a single dosing, which makes it more cost-effective.</p><p>In our study, the complete response was 86.6% with granisetron and 90% with palonosetron, which is in accordance with the study of Bhattacharyya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Clinical recovery score and recovery time were comparatively lower in patients of ondansetron group as compared to patients of granisetron group with no significant difference.</p><p>In the present study, we did not include any control group receiving placebo as PONV is not controlled by placebo. It was suggested that if active drugs are available, placebo-controlled trials are unethical as PONV is very much distressing after major surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Evidence-based management of postoperative nausea and vomiting also justifies the use of prophylactic antiemetic medication for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study showed that antiemetic prophylaxis with 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5-HT3) antagonist provided clinically effective prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting with statistically significant difference in their efficacy and duration of action.
