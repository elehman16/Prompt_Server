</p><sec id="s1a1"><title>Benefits of physical activity</title><p>One of the acute effects of physical activity in DM2 is a decrease in blood glucose levels which is related to exercise duration and intensity.

</p><p>In their study, Lim <italic>et al</italic> sent personalised messages of exercise, diet and glucose through a clinical decision support system, which worked from the data received from the patients, at the hospital server, of their physical activity and their glycaemic control.

MEDAS is a valid instrument for quick estimation of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. MEDAS includes 12 questions on food consumption frequency and two questions on intake habits of foods considered characteristic of the Spanish Mediterranean diet. Each question will be scored 0 or 1.

The SF-12 questionnaire is self-administered and was developed for measuring eight dimensions of HRQL: physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, emotional role, social functioning and mental health. These eight dimensions may be pooled as two summary measures: the physical component summary (PCS-12) and the mental component summary (MCS-12). To estimate the summary components of the SF-12, the algebraic sum of the standardised scores of each of the eight dimensions weighted by their weights is calculated. The PCS-12 and MCS-12, obtained adding the scores of all 12 questions, range from 0 to 100, with a score of 0 indicating the lowest level and a score of 100 the highest level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><p>Specific intervention and counselling appointment will be performed by three nurses at the health centre, who have previously been instructed in two 1&#x02009;hour sessions on how to carry out each session.

The first part (2&#x02009;min) will address the concept of the plate method already used in several studies as reference standard in nutrition<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;39</xref> and which allows for creating a variety of menus. This is a simple method that does not require measuring or weighting food portions. A plate approximately 23&#x02009;cm in size is used to create the main menu for lunch or dinner. The plate is divided into four parts: half the plate for salad or vegetables, one-fourth for proteins (with white meat preferred to red meat) and the final fourth for carbohydrates. In addition to the above, a medium-sized piece of fruit and a skimmed dairy product should be taken as dessert. The second part of the session (2&#x02009;min) will be focused on development of each particular recommendation to comply with the Mediterranean diet, using short, clear messages.

This application for smartphones, easy to use for adult people, allows for rapid assessment of whether personal habits agree with the recommended healthy lifestyles as regards both nutrition and physical activity. Food intake is assessed in terms of amount and quality based on standardised patterns, adaptation to the Mediterranean diet and adequate proportion of the main nutrient classes, generating a customised recommendation. The application provides detailed information on nutritional deviations, both in diet composition and in calorie number, to allow for a change in habits.

Groups of 10 people, accompanied by at least two nurses, will take the walk on a flat ground, which will start and end at the door of the healthcare centre. Once you have completed the five heart-healthy walks, the participants will already know the route and can continue doing them themselves without the need for the nurses to go with them.

Data quality will be ensured using the range checks for data values. Data will be provided as mean and SD for quantitative variables and by frequency distribution for qualitative variables. Analysis of the results will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. If data distribution is non-normal, parallel non-parametric tests will be used. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to verify normal data distribution. A &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test will be used to analyse the association between independent qualitative variables and a McNemar test for paired samples. The means of two groups will be compared using a Student&#x02019;s t-test or Mann-Whitney&#x02019;s&#x000a0;U test for independent samples, and change within the same group will be assessed using a Student&#x02019;s t-test or Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test for paired samples as appropriate. The relationship between quantitative variables will be analysed using a Pearson&#x02019;s or Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient as appropriate. A multivariate analysis will be performed to explore the variables most determinant for changes in physical activity and dietary pattern. In order to identify whether changes in independent variables have significant effects on dependent variables as a whole, a multivariate analysis of variance will be performed. To analyse the effect of intervention, changes in the intervention and attention-control groups will be compared and Cohen&#x02019;s d will be estimated, adjusting for variables that may have an influence on the result, especially baseline data. A gender and age analysis will be conducted to evaluate the differences in the mid-term and long-term outcomes between men and women and according to the different age groups. The impact of intervention may be modified by age, sex, cultural and socioeconomical level, BMI and baseline lifestyles, as well as some conditions (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, etc). These variables will be controlled in the analysis. For two-sided tests, an alpha risk of 0.05 will be set as the limit of statistical significance.

However, the researcher who analyses the data will be blinded. Analysis of one of the primary outcome measures, increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, will be performed using data reported by subjects themselves; however, a validated tool will be used to assess this variable. The other primary outcome measure, physical activity, will be assessed using a pedometer, a device that provides objective data, and may serve as quality control.
