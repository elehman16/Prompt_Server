Teachers are in a key position to support students, but poor mental health may be a barrier to doing so effectively. The Wellbeing in Secondary Education (WISE) project is a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve the mental health support and training available to secondary school teachers through delivery of the training package Mental Health First Aid and a staff peer support service. We will conduct a process evaluation as part of the WISE trial to support the interpretation of trial outcomes and refine intervention theory. The domains assessed will be: the extent to which the hypothesised mechanisms of change are activated; system level influences on these mechanisms; programme differentiation and usual practice; intervention implementation, including any adaptations; intervention acceptability; and intervention sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Research questions will be addressed via quantitative and qualitative methods. All study schools (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) will provide process evaluation data, with more detailed focus group, interview and observation data being collected from a subsample of case study schools (4 intervention and 4 control). Mechanisms of change, as outlined in a logic model, will be measured via teacher and student surveys and focus groups. School context will be explored via audits of school practice that relate to mental health and wellbeing, combined with stakeholder interviews and focus groups. Implementation of the training and peer support service will be assessed via training observations, training participant evaluation forms, focus groups with participants, interviews with trainers and peer support service users, and peer supporter logs recording help provided. Acceptability and sustainability will be examined via interviews with funders, head teachers, trainers and peer support services users, and focus groups with training participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The process evaluation embedded within the WISE cluster RCT will illuminate how and why the intervention was effective, ineffective or&#x000a0;conferred iatrogenic effects. It will contribute to the refinement of the theory underpinning the intervention, and will help to inform any future implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN95909211?q=kidger&#x00026;filters=&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=2&#x00026;totalResults=2&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN95909211</ext-link> registered on 24 March 2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Wellbeing</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Teachers</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001921</institution-id><institution>Public Health Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/164/06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kidger</surname><given-names>Judi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">Teaching professionals are at an increased risk of common mental health disorders compared with other occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Findings from the Wellbeing in Secondary Education (WISE) pilot study found that, among a sample of 555 secondary school teachers, scores on the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale were approximately four points below the average of the general working population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, 19.4% reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), compared with a general population prevalence of 8&#x02013;10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Poor mental health amongst teachers is associated with adverse work-related outcomes such as absenteeism, presenteeism and health-related workplace retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Failure to address teachers&#x02019; mental health and wellbeing can detrimentally influence student health. Poor teacher-student relationships in secondary school predict student psychiatric disorders and later exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, positive relationships are associated with lower levels of student depression and increased educational achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Teachers are also the professionals most likely to have routine contact with students in regard to their mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, poor wellbeing reduces teachers&#x02019; belief in their ability to support students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with this problem being compounded by a lack of training in how to effectively do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In turn, this threatens teachers&#x02019; own mental health, as they recognise their unfulfilled potential to help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">To date, there have been limited interventions aiming to support teacher mental health, with most focusing on teachers&#x02019; competencies in supporting students. Two large scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of providing teachers with mental health training within secondary school settings. A cluster RCT evaluated the impact of delivering Youth Mental Health First Aid training to school staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Standard Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training aims to train lay people to recognise the signs and symptoms of common mental health problems, while the youth version of the programme is targeted at those who work with individuals aged 8&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years. The study found positive changes in staff mental health knowledge, attitudes and confidence in helping young people. However, no changes were reported in actual helping behaviours or student mental health. More recently, the Saving and Empowering Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project, a three-arm RCT across 10 European countries, compared the effectiveness of training teachers to recognise and support students at risk of suicide, raising student awareness about mental health and suicide, and screening by professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The teacher training element did not demonstrate a large effect, and the authors suggested that poor teacher wellbeing may have reduced their ability to support students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Neither of these secondary school-based interventions included a component to improve the mental health of teachers themselves; therefore, there is an evident need to develop interventions that address this outcome.</p><p id="Par13">We conducted a pilot RCT of an intervention to improve the mental health and wellbeing of teachers and improve their skills in supporting students across six secondary schools in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. From the study results, we deemed it would be feasible and justifiable to conduct a full-scale cluster RCT, with an embedded process and economic evaluation. The protocol for the cluster RCT has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This paper outlines the protocol for the embedded process evaluation.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Wellbeing in Secondary Education (WISE) intervention</title><p id="Par14">The WISE intervention&#x02019;s primary aim is to improve the mental health and wellbeing of teachers through provision of a peer support service and training in supporting students. The intervention&#x02019;s theory of change is informed by social support theory. Social support offers problem-focused coping strategies and emotion-focused supportive strategies, both of which can have a positive impact on physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on findings from the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we hypothesise that peer supporters will provide both emotion-focused support, for example, by listening non-judgementally, and problem-focused support, for example, by offering practical suggestions for solutions to work-based difficulties where appropriate. Perceived availability of social support may be even more important to mental health than actual support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and therefore the existence of a peer-delivered support service is theorised to have a positive impact on teacher wellbeing, regardless of actual service utilisation. The theory of change is further informed by an ecological view of school connectedness, which considers the quality of social bonds and interactions within a school to be a characteristic of the whole school environment or culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Improvement to teachers&#x02019; own mental health and wellbeing via supportive relationships with peers should lead to more positive teacher&#x02013;student relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which is associated with improved student mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, all teachers and students within an intervention school may benefit, regardless of whether they themselves directly engage with the intervention.</p><p id="Par15">The WISE intervention involves three components, namely a staff peer support service, teacher training in MHFA, and a teacher mental health awareness raising session.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Staff peer support service</title><p id="Par16">School staff nominated by their colleagues (8% of staff body, with a maximum of 16) will attend the 2-day standard MHFA training. This proportion of the population has been used in successful peer influence interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and we hypothesise that training this number of peers will mean that all staff members have access to someone whom they feel comfortable approaching for support. The one exclusion criterion for nomination will be membership of the Senior Leadership Team, as pilot findings indicated that staff might feel uncomfortable using a support service that includes senior leaders. The 8% of staff with the most nominations, whilst ensuring a mix of gender and teaching/non-teaching roles, will be invited to attend the standard MHFA training. The training educates participants to spot the signs and symptoms of mental health problems, and to know how to respond to an individual in distress or need of support. It focuses on the ALGEE model, namely to Assess for risk of suicide or other&#x000a0;harm, Listen non-judgementally, Give reassurance and information, Encourage appropriate professional help-seeking, and Encourage self-help and other support strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Guidance developed by the study team will be presented during the training on how to set up and run a peer support service, although each peer support service will have the autonomy to develop their own advertising and service implementation strategies to ensure best fit for the context of their particular school. Following completion of the training course, staff will establish a confidential peer support service for colleagues offering informal support and signposting to other services where appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Teacher training in MHFA for schools and colleges</title><p id="Par17">Teaching staff (8% of teaching staff, with a maximum of 16) with pastoral roles such as personal tutor or head of year will attend the 1-day MHFA for Schools and Colleges training. The course is based on the Youth MHFA training, and also covers ALGEE, but focuses particularly on the school setting. Trained teachers will continue with their usual teaching and pastoral roles within school, but will apply the MHFA for Schools and Colleges learning in their day-to-day interactions with students, responding to signs and symptoms of distress and providing initial help and support to individuals they identify to be at risk of mental health difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Teacher mental health awareness raising session</title><p id="Par18">All teaching staff will receive a 1-hour awareness raising session, which will highlight the importance of mental health in schools, offer advice on how to support the mental health of self and others, and introduce the peer support service. The session has been designed through collaboration between the study team and MHFA trainers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Implementation strategy</title><p id="Par19">Different models for implementation will be used in England and Wales, due to differing funding structures and a desire to make use of existing resources and infrastructure to maximise intervention sustainability, if effective. In Wales, training will be delivered to schools by Healthy School Coordinators, who will first complete a 6-day bespoke version of the MHFA instructor course. Healthy School Coordinators are employed by Local Authorities or Public Health Wales and are responsible for monitoring and accrediting schools participating in the Welsh Network of Healthy Schools Scheme. Seven Healthy School Coordinators will be trained to ensure sufficient capacity for intervention delivery. In England, training will be delivered by accredited MHFA trainers.</p><p id="Par20">We will aim to deliver the three training components to each school within one academic term (September to December 2016). The order in which training components are delivered is not pre-specified due to the need to fit with schools&#x02019; pre-planned training dates. Each training component includes standardised slides. However, for the MHFA training, trainers can choose to utilise supplementary activities and modes of learning (e.g. group discussion, videos, exercises) from a suite of options. Peer supporters will meet within 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks of the standard MHFA training course to establish the peer support service.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Process evaluation aims</title><p id="Par21">Process evaluations embedded within RCTs support the interpretation of trial outcomes and the refinement of intervention theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recent Medical Research Guidance on process evaluation offers the most comprehensive and developed instruction on their conduct within effectiveness trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While recognising the need for a flexible evaluation model, the guidance specifies key process evaluation components, which reflect the underpinning realist and&#x000a0;complex&#x000a0; systems principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Mechanisms of change</title><p id="Par22">We will examine if&#x000a0;the intervention&#x02019;s hypothesised mechanisms of change are activated, and the extent to which these mechanisms are modified though their interaction with contextual characteristics.

The study sample comprises secondary schools across the two study sites of England and Wales. Twenty-four schools were required to ensure statistical power, but 25 were recruited to mitigate against the risk of drop-out. Schools have been stratified by site (England or Wales), administrative region (educational consortia in Wales and local authority in England) and proportion of students eligible for free school meals (FSM) (high, medium or low compared to the national average), which is a proxy measure of socioeconomic status. Twelve schools have been randomly allocated to the intervention arm and 13 to the control arm.</p><p id="Par30">All 25 study schools will provide process evaluation data. Four intervention and four control schools have been purposively sampled to serve as &#x02018;case study schools&#x02019; and more extensive process evaluation will be undertaken in these cases. To sample the case study schools, the 25 schools were stratified by trial arm allocation (intervention or control), site (England or Wales), administrative region (educational consortia or local authority) and proportion of students eligible for FSM (high/low compared to the national average).

The consent procedure for schools to join the study and for participants to complete a questionnaire is reported in the main protocol paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For the interviews and focus groups conducted as part of the process evaluation, all those invited to take part will receive a participant information leaflet at least 2 weeks prior to data collection. Written consent will be obtained by the study team prior to any data collection taking place. Parents of students taking part in focus groups will also be supplied with an information sheet, and will be asked to give consent for their child to take part. Consent will either be written or verbally obtained by the school contact, which they will formally record in writing. For those invited to take part in the study as peer supporters, written information will be provided at least 2 weeks prior to the training delivery, and written consent will be obtained before the training is attended.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par53">This paper presents a detailed protocol for the process evaluation of a complex school-based intervention intended to improve the mental health and wellbeing of teachers. We will address five key evaluation domains, namely (1) mechanisms of change and their interaction with system-level influences; (2) programme differentiation and usual practice; (3) implementation and adaptation; (4) acceptability; and (5) sustainability. Process data will support the interpretation of the outcome data from the RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], through the illumination of how and why the intervention was effective, ineffective or conferred iatrogenic effects. It will further contribute to the development and refinement of the intervention theory, and support further understanding of the mechanisms through which peer support models may impact upon both teacher and student mental health and wellbeing. Data will feed into the dissemination plan and may support the longer-term implementation of the intervention, depending on effectiveness. The evaluation will also offer additional insight into the complexity of the school system, and how the system interacts with efforts to address health outcomes from a whole school perspective.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALGEE</term><def><p id="Par5">Assess for risk of suicide or other harm, Listen non-judgementally, Give reassurance and information, Encourage appropriate professional help, Encourage self-help and other support strategies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FSM</term><def><p id="Par6">Free School Meal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHFA</term><def><p id="Par7">Mental Health First Aid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par8">Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WISE</term><def><p id="Par9">Wellbeing in Secondary Education</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was undertaken with the support of The Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer), a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence.
