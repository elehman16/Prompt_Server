It is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of attention, motor activity and impulsivity. ADHD is characterized by high heritability (0.76) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], likely conferred by several genes, each making a small contribution to the overall risk for the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>It has become common practice in genetic association studies of ADHD to focus on genes implicated in brain monoamine transmission, given that psychostimulant drugs, such as methylphenidate (MPH), are effective in controlling ADHD symptoms. It is widely believed that this effect results primarily, but not exclusively, from modulation of dopamine transmission and downstream monoamine systems. Although this strategy of using a "pharmacological bridge" to select candidate genes is reasonable, it is possible that molecular mechanisms responsible for the pharmacology of psychostimulants and the underlying pathological processes of ADHD do not coincide or coincide only to some extent. Numerous genetic association studies investigating these pharmacological candidates in relation to ADHD have been published. However, results have proven difficult to replicate and the odds ratios associated with each gene were low, ranging from 1.13 to 1.45 (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). This may reflect, among other things, the low <italic>a priori </italic>probability that these genes are implicated in ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>a priori </italic>probability that some of these genes are associated with the "drug response phenotype" may be substantially higher given the important biological evidence that psychostimulants interact with different molecular targets in the brain dopamine system and downstream neurotransmission pathways. For example, it has been demonstrated that MPH binds to the dopamine transporter and blocks its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, genetic variants that affect the structure and/or the function of the dopamine transporter may retain reasonable <italic>a priori </italic>probability to modulate behavioral response to MPH. In fact, in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we found that the 3'-UTR VNTR polymorphism in the dopamine transporter gene modulates behavioral response to MPH, replicating a previous study by Stein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additionally, investigating the "drug response" phenotype has the important advantage of being amenable to the placebo-controlled, double blind study design, a robust design for controlling bias in behavioral research studies.</p><p>Although the primary mechanism of action of MPH is believed to involve increased synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine levels, it has been suggested that behavioral response to MPH may also be mediated through serotonergic mechanisms acting downstream of the dopamine system. Giros et al. have shown that dopamine transporter gene-knockout mice display a high level of motor activity, a phenotype amplified by exposure to a novel environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This hyperactivity is reduced with the administration of MPH, even though these animals display high levels of extra-cellular dopamine. Gainetdinov et al. postulated that this paradoxical effect could be mediated by serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In accordance with this hypothesis, they have shown that a selective 5-HT transporter inhibitor (fluoxetine) or 5-HT enhancers (5-hydroxytryptophan or L-tryptophan) significantly reduce motor hyperactivity in this animal model but not in wild type animals. In contrast, in the same animal model, it was shown that nisoxitine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker, does not affect locomotor hyperactivity. Thus, it appears that the level of dopaminergic tone may determine the potency of the serotonergic enhancers in decreasing the hyperactivity observed in the dopamine transporter knockout model of ADHD. Notwithstanding some problems in extending these animal findings to children affected with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], these observations suggest that brain 5-HT pathways may play a role in mediating the pharmacological effect of psychostimulants. Given the critical role of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in regulation of 5-HT transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the 5-HTT gene <italic>(SLC6A4) </italic>may be considered a suitable candidate gene to explain at least part of the variability in behavioral response to MPH.</p><p>A polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR or 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region) has been shown to modulate transcriptional activity and availability of 5-HTT both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>with the short allele (<italic>s</italic>) having reduced transcriptional activity compared to the long allele (<italic>l</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This polymorphism has been extensively studied in relation to mood/anxiety disorders and impulse dyscontrol related disorders. It is generally believed that the <italic>s </italic>allele (or the <italic>ss </italic>genotype), associated with low levels of transcription of the <italic>SLC6A4</italic>, results in a desensitization of post synaptic 5-HT receptors, which in turn increase the risk for these disorders. More recently, it has been shown that this polymorphism is triallelic, with the <italic>l </italic>allele having two forms, <italic>l<sub>G </sub></italic>and <italic>l</italic><sub>A</sub>, resulting from a common G&#x02192;A polymorphism. The <italic>l<sub>G </sub></italic>allele creates a functional AP2 transcription-factor binding site. Expression assays showed nearly equivalent expression for the <italic>s </italic>and <italic>l<sub>G </sub></italic>alleles, accounting for more variation in 5-HTT expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Previous association studies between ADHD and the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism yielded various results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Five case-control association studies reported an association between 5-HTTLPR and ADHD or its symptomatic dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These studies suggest that the <italic>l </italic>allele may be associated with externalizing disorders whereas the <italic>s </italic>allele may be related to internalization symptoms. In line with these case-control studies, three family studies reported a trend towards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and one study reported a significant over transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] of the <italic>l </italic>allele of 5-HTTLPR from parents to children with ADHD. The overall risk associated with <italic>SLC6A4 </italic>was estimated to be 1.31 with 95% confidence interval of (1.09-1.59) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Under the assumption that 5-HT transmission may be part of the biological mechanisms mediating behavioral response to MPH, we have examined the association of the polymorphic 5-HTTLPR with behavioral response to MPH by using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to test this association.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>One hundred and fifty seven children were recruited from the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Program and the child psychiatry outpatient clinics at the Douglas Institute in Montreal. They were referred to these specialized care facilities by schools, community social workers, family doctors and pediatricians.</p><p>To be included in the study, children had to be between 6 and 12 years of age and meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Diagnosis was based on observation of the child's behavior and an interview with at least one parent by a child psychiatrist. This clinical examination was supplemented by a structured clinical interview of parents using the DISC-IV (parental report) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as well as school reports. In the majority of cases, mothers were the primary informants. Parents completed the Child Behavioral Checklist or CBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], a scale that assesses several behavioral domains of the child. For this scale, parents were asked to give an overall evaluation of the child's behavior without a specific timeframe.</p><p>In order to assess behavioral response to MPH, we used the Conners' Global Index for parents (CGI-Parents) and teachers (CGI-Teachers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Parents and teachers were instructed to assess the child's behavior during the week preceding each assessment. The CGI-Parents and CGI-Teachers are subsets of the original Conners' Rating Scales, widely used for assessing symptoms of ADHD and other psychopathology in children between 3 and 17 years of age for which normative data have been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Each Conners' Global Index (CGI) scale consists of 10 items representing the Hyperactivity Index of the original Conners' scale. Each item describes a behavior that is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all true) to 3 (very true). CGI-Parents and CGI-Teachers are each comprised of two factors: "Emotional lability" and "Restless-impulsive behavior". The raw total and factor scores are transformed into normalized T-scores, with 65 or higher considered to be clinically significant. This rating scale has been recommended for titrating and monitoring treatment with psychostimulant drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All these assessments were completed during the week preceding the clinical trial (i.e. at baseline) while the children were not taking any medication.</p><p>Children with a history of Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, psychosis or any medical condition or impairment that would interfere with the ability of the child to complete the study, were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Once each child completed the baseline evaluations, a 2-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover experimental design was used to assess the behavioral response to MPH as compared to placebo. Since the primary purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of the <italic>SLC6A4 </italic>genotype on the variability of behavioral response to MPH, we used a moderate dose (0.5 mg/kg/day) of MPH that has been shown to produce a robust behavioral response in most children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This dose also follows the recommendations of initiating treatment with MPH at a low to moderate dose and titrating to higher doses if the child does not respond adequately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, although several studies reported a linear dose-response curve of behaviors to MPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], other studies suggested a curvilinear dose-response curve, with higher doses adding only a marginal effect compared to medium doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, we reasoned that using a 0.5 mg/kg/day is an adequate dose to study behavioral response to MPH within its linear dose-response curve segment. After one week of baseline assessments, which also served as a wash-out period for children previously treated with MPH, subjects received one week of treatment with placebo followed by one week of treatment with 0.5 mg/kg/day of MPH given in a divided dose (morning and noon). The order of administration (placebo and MPH) was blind, counterbalanced and determined by random assignment.</p><p>Placebo and MPH were prepared individually in opaque gelatin capsules in weekly blister packs by a pharmacist not otherwise involved in the study to maintain the blind allocation of treatment. At the end of each week of treatment, the blister packs were collected and medication compliance checked. At this time, a research assistant contacted the child's parents and teacher and asked them to fill the CGI-Parents and CGI-Teachers respectively, taking into consideration the behavior of the child during the entire previous week of treatment (including weekends for parents).</p><p>The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Douglas Institute. Parents provided written informed consent. The study was explained to the children and they gave their verbal assent to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular genetics</title><p>The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the <italic>SLC6A4 </italic>gene was genotyped using PCR amplification of DNA and resolution of different alleles using agarose gel electrophoresis according to previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

This approach has the advantage of being supported by a wealth of information on the molecular and neurochemical mechanisms of MPH. The use of the double blind placebo-controlled design is likely to refine the quality of the pharmaco-behavioral genetic approach by controlling for bias in the evaluation of behaviors. It is notable in this regard that the only three studies using a double blind placebo-controlled design to investigate behavioral response to amphetamine in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and MPH in children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found convergent results indicating that subjects homozygous for the 9-repeat allele in the 3'UTR VNTR polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene are less sensitive to the effects of psychostimulants.</p><p>Based on the hypothesis of Gainetdinov and Caron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], that the paradoxical calming effects of MPH may be due to enhanced 5-HT transmission downstream of the dopamine system, it is possible that patients who are homozygous for the <italic>s' </italic>allele, presumed to be impaired with regard to 5-HT transmission, would present poor response to MPH. In contrast, patients homozygous for the <italic>l' </italic>allele, presumed to have more efficient 5-HT transmission, would show very good response to MPH.</p><p>The main finding of this study is consistent with this hypothesis to a certain extent. Indeed, we identified an association between the triallelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene and behavioral response to MPH as assessed by the CGI- Parents. Children with the <italic>s's' </italic>genotype responded significantly better to placebo and did not derive a further improvement with MPH. On the contrary, children with the <italic>l'l' </italic>genotype responded minimally to placebo and derived significant improvement with MPH. Children with the <italic>s'l' </italic>genotype had an intermediate profile. The statistical differences are also reflected in clinical differences. Indeed, children with the <italic>l'l' </italic>genotype retained clinically significant impairment after treatment with placebo (CGI-Parents&#x0003e;65) and improved to the non-clinical range with MPH. In contrast, children with the <italic>s's' </italic>genotype showed significant clinical improvement with placebo and appeared to deteriorate when MPH was added to their treatment.</p><p>Studies investigating the pharmacogenetics of ADHD have reported both positive and negative results. Some recent findings have detected no significant associations between polymorphisms of the DAT1, DRD4 and 5-HTT genes and response to MPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, it has been difficult to compare results from these studies given significant variability in key methodological issues.</p><p>This current study design however is potentially more robust given the placebo arm, which acts as an internal control, quantitative measures of MPH response by two raters, namely parents and teachers, as well as consideration of comorbid disorders.</p><p>On the other hand, we did not identify a genotype or genotype-by-treatment interaction with therapeutic response to MPH as assessed by teachers in the school environment. Although this apparently contradicts findings from the parents' evaluation, this result could be interpreted by the fact that environmental factors and observer effects, as well as the interaction between the observer and the child have an important impact on the child's behavior and its assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In fact, genetic epidemiological studies suggest that the genetic factors implicated in ADHD symptoms as evaluated by parents and teachers are at least partially different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] (see review by Thapar et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]). Also, it has been demonstrated that parent and teacher ratings of improvement with MPH correlate only modestly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and differ in their magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Faraone et al. reported that when poor or no response is reported by one reporter (parents or teachers), it is unlikely to be confirmed by the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that the 5-HTTLPR may be specifically modulating behaviors and therapeutic response of these behaviors to MPH as evaluated by parents in the home environment.</p><p>Also, it should be noted that the effect of the 5-HTTLPR genotype remained significant after controlling for the effect of the 3'UTR VNTR polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene, which was previously reported to be associated with response to MPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, these results need to be replicated in a larger sample given that some genotype combinations were represented by few subjects.</p><p>Some limitations should be kept in mind while interpreting the results from this study. First, this study used a single dose of MPH (0.5 mg/kg/day), which is in the low to medium range commonly used in clinical practice. As our primary purpose was to use MPH as a pharmacological probe to challenge behaviors relevant for ADHD, we used a dose that is both in the low/medium therapeutic range and recommended as a starting dose. Even though this dose elicited clinically and statistically significant improvements, an experimental design with several doses (including lower doses for some genotypes) and longer periods of treatment with MPH treatment will be important to further explore the clinical implications of the present findings. Second, our sample comprised relatively few females. Separate analyses on males and females revealed essentially the same results in males but no significant findings in females. A larger sample needs to be studied in order to validate or refute these results in girls.</p><p>Furthermore, although the majority of subjects were Caucasians, it is possible that differences in other loci which are differentially distributed between the three genotype groups could confound this finding. However, there were no significant differences in the distribution of Caucasians/non-Caucasians between the three genotype groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this pharmacogenetic study investigating the role of the 5-HTT gene in behavioral response to MPH in children with ADHD is the largest study using the double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design for the evaluation of behavioral response to psychostimulants. In addition, the assessment tools used in this study were developed for children, have been standardized with regard to the general population and were shown to be adequate for the evaluation of therapeutic response to drugs in children with ADHD. The results of this study strongly suggest that children with the <italic>s's', s'l' </italic>and <italic>l'l' </italic>genotypes may be characterized with differential profiles of response to placebo and MPH in the context of a short term clinical trial. If these profiles are confirmed in a larger group of patients, this may help in the design of better interventions that are tailored for the specific needs of each of these groups of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr. Ridha Joober receives a consultation honorarium from Janssen-Ortho and Pfizer Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GT analyzed results and prepared the manuscript.
