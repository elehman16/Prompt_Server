often demonstrate poor posture when using smartphones<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have reported that frequent smartphone use can lead
to adoption of a non-neutral neck posture or development of musculoskeletal disorders<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, many people use smartphones
with their head shifted forward and the smartphone placed near their waist or lap while in a
sitting position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in cervical
mobility, head posture, and dysfunction of local and global muscle systems are believed to
lead to changes in force-length curves, muscle imbalances, and segmental instability, all of
which can potentially affect thoracic cage function and rib cage biomechanics<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many previous studies have investigated alterations in cervical movement patterns during
smartphone use. In addition, previous studies have focused on psychological problems, such
as subjective symptoms of physical problems and stress. However, to date, no study has
reported on the effects of sitting posture on respiratory function while using a smartphone.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different sitting postures on
respiratory function and determine whether there are differences in changes between
smartphone a group of smartphone users and a control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>We recruited 50 healthy volunteers from Daegu University in Gyeongsan City, South Korea.
Our study was designed as a randomized control trial. The participants were divided into 2
groups. The control group spent time as they liked for 1 hour, and the smartphone group used
a smartphone while in a sitting position for 1 hour. The smartphone group subjects started
the experiment in a comfortable position in which they held a smartphone with both hands and
looked at the screen. When they started using the phone, they played a game.</p><p>Four participants quit during the study (control group, 3; smartphone group, 1) due to
deterioration of their conditions. The mean age, height, and body weight of the control
group (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) were 21.68 &#x000b1; 1.99&#x02005;years, 166.07 &#x000b1; 10.64&#x02005;cm, and 59.86 &#x000b1;
15.08&#x02005;kg (8 men and 14 women), respectively. The mean age, height, and body weight of the
smartphone group (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) were 22.83 &#x000b1; 2.39&#x02005;years, 169.00 &#x000b1; 8.91&#x02005;cm, and
67.00 &#x000b1;13.42&#x02005;kg (13 men and 11 women). Participants were excluded if they had spinal
structure problems, neurological disorders, or respiratory dysfunctions (e.g., asthma), if
they were smokers, or if they had become nonsmokers within the last 5&#x02005;years. All
participants understood the purpose of the study, and informed written consent was obtained
prior to enrollment. Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu
University in accordance with the ethical guidelines established in the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>To investigate changes in respiratory function, we measured forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second
to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). These variables were
measured using a spirometer (Spiropalm, COSMED, Rome, Italy). All participants sat on a
stool and looked straight ahead. After the participant&#x02019;s nose was clamped with a nose clip,
the participant breathed into the mouthpiece of the spirometer. The best performance out of
3 tries was recorded as the FVC. Measurements were performed before and after the
experiment.</p><p>We used IBM SPSS Statistics v20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) to analyze the data. Analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) was used for statistical analyses, and the level of statistical
significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no differences between both groups in gender, age, height, or weight. There were
initially 25 subjects in each group, but 4 participants were excluded due to deterioration

postures on respiratory function. The smartphone group exhibited significant decreases in
FVC and FEV1 compared with the control group. These results suggest that a sitting posture
while using a smartphone can reduce respiratory function.</p><p>In the current study, the results of the smartphone group decreased significantly from 3.2
&#x000b1; 0.9 to 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 for FVC and from 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 to 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 for FEV1. There are 2 possible
causes of respiratory dysfunction. First, individuals using smartphones have been found to
have reduced global and local muscle performance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is believed that dysfunction of these muscles leads to reduced
respiratory performance; this is mainly due to the common function of the
sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and scalene muscles in cervical movement and inspiration.
Additionally, weakness of the deep neck flexor and extensor muscles can lead to reduced
stability of the cervical and thoracic spine, as well as changes in rib cage
biomechanics<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These changes in rib
cage biomechanics can also lead to associated changes of respiratory muscles by altering
their force-length curves and force production abilities<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Second, changes in force-length curves, muscles imbalances, and segmental instability of
the cervical spine are also possible causes of respiratory dysfunction. Segmental
instability of the cervical spine might also be observed in the thoracic spine because of
certain muscles, such as the longus colli, that attach to both neck proprioceptor impairment
areas, thus rendering it difficult to attain optimal spine alignment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore,
sagittal postures of the thoracic spine were found to be associated with forward head
posture, cervical mobility, and neck pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Concerning respiratory function, it was shown that thoracic
kyphosis was accompanied by dyspnea and ventilator dysfunction<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In young healthy participants with a normally positioned
diaphragm, a slumped sitting posture results in increased intra-abdominal pressure by
approximating the ribs to the pelvis. This makes it difficult for the diaphragm to descend
caudally during inspiration<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The clinical implication of our findings is that the posture when using a smartphone leads
to reduce respiratory function. The limitations of our study include a small sample size
with a limited age range; this makes generalization of results difficult. Furthermore, other
kinematic data, such as electromyography, were not assessed. Further studies will be
required to obtain kinematic measurements related to motor function of the posture when
using a smartphone.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Appel</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Childs</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Healey</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of posture on vital capacity</article-title>.
