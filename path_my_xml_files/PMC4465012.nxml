Although acupuncture has been widely accepted as a clinical approach for angina, there is no sufficient evidence of its effectiveness against this syndrome, and its mechanisms have not yet been well elucidated. We develop this protocol to confirm the clinical efficacy of electro-acupuncture on stable angina pectoris by needling on acupoint Neiguan (PC6). Furthermore, we employ high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the gene expression profiling and determine involvement of histone modifications in the regulation of genes after electro-acupuncture treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, controlled, double-blinded (assessor and patients) trial will be carried out. Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to two acupuncture treatment groups and one control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants in acupuncture groups will receive 12 sessions of electro-acupuncture treatment across 4 weeks, followed by a 12-week randomization period. The acupuncture groups are divided into Neiguan (PC6) on Pericardium Meridian of Hand-jueyin or a non-acupoint. The primary clinical measure of effect is the frequency of angina attacks between these groups for four weeks after randomization. RNAs are extracted from peripheral neutrophils collected from all participants on day 0, day 30, and week 16, and are processed to RNA-Seq. We then investigate profiles of histone modifications by ChIP-Seq, for H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylation of H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27ac), in the presence or absence of acupuncture treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study determines the efficacy and mechanisms of electro-acupuncture on stable angina pectoris. We focus on effectiveness of acupuncture on alleviating symptoms of myocardial ischemia and the gene regulation and the chromatin remodeling marks, including H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and H3K27ac, which could be key factors for regulating gene expressions caused by electro-acupuncture treatment at Neiguan. This is the first genome-wide study of electro-acupuncture treatment in angina patients, and will provide valuable information for future studies in the fields of acupuncture and its underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Fourteen patients have been recruited since recruitment opened in November of 2012. This study is scheduled to end in November of 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/en/proj/show.aspx?proj=3537">ChiCTR-TRC-12002668</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Stable angina pectoris</kwd><kwd>Study protocol</kwd><kwd>Gene profiling</kwd><kwd>Histone modification</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Stable angina is a clinical syndrome characterized by discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arms, typically elicited by physical exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the multiple medical and interventional technologies that have been developed to reduce myocardial ischemia, stable angina still affects nearly 60 million people in China. And despite the association with a worsened quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], repeated hospitalizations, and increased healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], angina often remains undertreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Acupuncture, the most well-known complementary and alternative medical approach, has been applied to prevent and cure many diseases such as angina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], palpitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and disruption of the left cardiac function in coronary heart disease (CHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] for more than 2000&#x000a0;years. Recent studies show that acupuncture treatment can improve regeneration capacity of local micro-vascular and collateral circulation during myocardia ischemia; thereby ameliorating ischemia symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It not only quickly relieves the symptoms of acute angina pectoris, but also improves nitroglycerine&#x02019;s therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A review article has concluded that the effectiveness (between 80% to 96.2%) of acupuncture therapy is comparable to conventional drug regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, many conventional anti-angina medications react adversely with other medications that the patients may be taking for other illnesses, whereas acupuncture therapy does not pose such an interference with the patient&#x02019;s medical regimen. Clinical experience has suggested that myocardial ischemia can be effectively treated via acupuncture at a single acupoint, Neiguan (PC6), which is first described in Miraculous Pivot Meridians. Neiguan (PC6) indicates a point located 2 cun above the transverse crease of the wrist and between the tendons of m. Palmaris longus and m. flexor radialis. And because this point is connected to the pericardium, it can also be used to treat precordial pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Neiguan (PC6) is the Luo point of the pericardium meridian of hand-jueyin, as well as one of the eight confluence acupoints.</p><p>Many have proven that needling at PC6 can protect against myocardial ischemic injury through multiple mechanisms, including improving angiogenesis and reducing apoptosis and calcium overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Though some studies have looked at the systemic alternations of functional molecules after median nerve stimulation in rats with myocardial ischemic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], no epigenetic research has been conducted on the response to electro-acupuncture (EA) treatment applied to angina patients. Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones are a primary mechanism by which gene expression activities may be modified in response to environmental stimulation. Due to the innate plasticity of DNA methylation of cytosine bases, environmental cues can induce epigenetic shifts in the timing and intensity of gene expression that may contribute to a physiological acclimation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although the vast majority of modifications remain poorly understood, scientists have seen considerable progress in the understanding of lysine acetylation and methylation. Whereas lysine acetylation almost always correlates with chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity, lysine methylation can have different effects depending on which residue is modified. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3 lysine 36 is associated with transcribed chromatin. In contrast, methylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), H3 lysine 27 (H3K27), and H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) generally correlate with repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recent studies show that the acetylation of lysine residues on histones is a well-established post-translational modification, and is a direct regulator of chromatin structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Two enzyme families, histone acetylase and histone de-acetylase, control the level of histone acetylation and act as critical gene transcriptional activators or silencers. It is known that post-translational modification of histone H3K9 is critical for regulation of gene transcription, and includes both acetylation and methylation. Methylation of histone H3K9 correlates with transcriptional repression, whereas acetylation of the histone H3K9 is associated with transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our previous studies on rats have demonstrated that acupuncture promotes angiogenesis after myocardial ischemia though regulation of H3K9 acetylation at the VEGF gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is the first experimental report showing that acupuncture can effectively up-regulate VEGF expression through H3K9 acetylation modification directly at the VEGF promoter and hence contribute to angiogenesis in the rat MI model. A recent study demonstrates that enhancers play a central role in cell type-specific gene expression and are marked by H3K4me1/2. Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27ac. Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, Dr. Ge, et al. at NIH identified that deletion of Mll4 (KMT2D) markedly decreased H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac levels on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, others have found that histone modification-mediated chromatin remodeling plays an important role in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We now aim to study whether H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac can be correlated with the protective effects of acupuncture at PC6 in human patients.</p><p>A few published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning acupuncture treatment for stable angina pectoris claim that convincing evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating stable angina pectoris patients is still inadequate, due to the poor quality of existing studies. To address these problems and to hopefully provide a more conclusive answer to these questions, a team within our research group has designed a protocol to start a multicenter RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In order to study the underling molecular mechanisms, we will first confirm the efficacy of electro-acupuncture as a treatment method for stable angina pectoris using a relatively small patient population. We will then compare the gene profiles and histone modifications before and after electro-acupuncture treatment at Neiguan.

Based on the theory of acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Neiguan (PC6) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) on Pericardium Meridian of Hand-jueyin is the classic acupoint in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. Additionally, to test and verify the clinical efficiency of Neiguan, we have chosen a non-acupoint (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) located on the junction of the deltoid and biceps muscles at the front of medial upper arm that does not belong to any channel as a reference point. Therefore, acupuncture groups in our study are defined as: (1) Neiguan (PC6) on Pericardium Meridian of Hand-jueyin group; (2) non-acupoint group.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Illustration of acupoints.

After being needled, the points will be punctured again using auxiliary needles 2&#x000a0;mm lateral to the first needle, and to a depth of 2&#x000a0;mm without manual stimulation. HANS-200E electro-acupuncture apparatus (HANS, 2-100Hz, made in Jiangsu, China) is used for electric stimulation at every acupuncture point. Each acupuncture needle and auxiliary needle at each point is connected to a stimulus isolation unit with parameters of 2/15Hz and stimulated for a total of 30&#x000a0;minutes. The stimulation intensity varies from 0.1&#x000a0;mA to 1.0&#x000a0;mA until the patients feel comfortable. De qi sensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] will be achieved in the acupuncture groups, through lifting and thrusting combined with twirling and rotating the needles. After retaining the needles for 30&#x000a0;min, all needles are taken out with clean cotton balls to avoid bleeding. Every patient will receive treatments three times a week for a total of 12 treatments, with a 1-day interval every 2&#x000a0;days of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Control group</title><p>To compare to the acupuncture groups, we randomly selected 20 cases of patients with stable angina pectoris as a control group.

This study is expected to provide convincing evidence that electro-acupuncture at Neiguan has protective effects against angina, and that many functional genes and pathways contribute to such effects. Moreover, histone modifications are expected to mediate the changes of gene expressions caused by electro-acupuncture treatment.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Grouping and acupoint selection</title><p>There are three acupuncture groups in this trial, including a Neiguan (PC6) group, a non-acupoint group, and a control group. Some reports state that acupuncture on Neiguan may increase the usage of nitroglycerin, just as we have mentioned previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, to ensure the quality of research, we asked all participants to use nitroglycerin. In order to avoid interference caused by nitroglycerin&#x02019;s therapeutic effect, we set up this control group. Our pilot experiment has shown that neither the clinical efficacy nor the molecular changes resulted from acupuncture treatment at Neiguan has been affected by the basic use of drugs. Compared with the control group, we can not only determine the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture on the patients with stable angina pectoris, but also compare the profiles of gene expression and histone modifications. In order to meet the requirements of ethics, the patients in control group will be provided 12 free sessions of electro-acupuncture treatment after 16&#x000a0;weeks. Therefore, we are also able to detect the differences in histone modifications before and after electro-acupuncture treatment at Neiguan for these patients.</p><p>The functions of non-acupoint have been reported as controversial by some studies that have shown no difference between acupoint and non-acupoint stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To clarify the specificity of acupoint PC6, we set up the non-acupoint group to be a reference point that does not belong to any meridian. We have strategically chosen a non-acupoint as a reference point based on two principles. The first is based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theories and literatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In most Chinese literature, the preferred non-acupoints is located closely beside therapeutic acupoints and half way between two lines or acupoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The second is based on our previous studies using animal models (unpublished). We have chosen a standard position that does not result in the same effects as the acupoint PC6 when stimulated and has no documented adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Target tissue/cell for laboratory study</title><p>By using high-throughput sequencing, we can investigate genome-wide gene expressions and histone modifications before and after electro-acupuncture treatment, and then analyze the correlations between acupuncture effects and histone modifications. As a clinical trial, it is not possible to study cardiac tissues of the patients, thus, blood samples are our specimen of choice, and neutrophils are the target cells. Neutrophils, as a hallmark of acute inflammation, has been proven, via autopsy specimens of culprit lesions from acute MI patients, to be vital to acute plaque rupture, demonstrating higher concentrations of activated neutrophils than in those without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. More recently, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been also proposed as a useful biomarker for predicting cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, we have chosen neutrophil as target cells in this study. As a possible result, many pathways found to be effectively activated or repressed by electro-acupuncture treatment might be related to immune response or inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Epigenetic marks</title><p>Our previous study has demonstrated that electro-acupuncture can promote angiogenesis after myocardial ischemia through H3K9 acetylation regulation at VEGF gene in rat heart tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We now focus on two epigenetic marks, H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac and analyze their genome-wide regulation profiles in this study. Their increased binding to genes in response to acupuncture intervention could indicate an activated chromatin remodeling, and hence a positive regulation for functional gene expressions. Because of budget constraints, we were unable to analyze other epigenetic marks reported to be important for gene regulation, such as H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9ac.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study are expected to confirm the effectiveness of electro-acupuncture in the management of stable angina pectoris, and to determine the key role that histone modifications play in gene regulation under acupuncture in stable angina. Our study will provide the first set of gene expression profile for stable angina pectoris and their changes induced by electro-acupuncture. Through in-depth study of histone modifications, we may uncover some molecular evidences of the effects of acupuncture, which can prove useful for basic and clinical researchers, as well as for clinical practitioners.</p><p>The trial is sponsored and financially supported by (973 Program, No. 2012CB518501) the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first participants were included on March 28, 2013, and this article was submitted on July 15, 2014.
