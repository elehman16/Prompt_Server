Dysbiosis in microbiota of different locations of human organism has been related to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity, allergy, vaginal infections, atopic dermatitis, and tooth decay.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Interestingly, probiotics are showing beneficial effects on these diseases by restoring the balance of the microbiota.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In 2003,the presence of a physiological microbiota was first described in human milk.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Recent studies have revealed that dysbiosis in this specific microbiota is related to mastitis.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref></sup></p><p>Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast usually associated with lactation. Dysbiosis in mastitis is characterized by proliferation of certain bacterial species such as <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., which has been identified as one of the main bacterial groups related to mastitis.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></sup> Data about the incidence of this problem are very variable probably because of differences in diagnosis criteria.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: healthy women between 18 and 45 years with development of normal pregnancy, childbirth took place 1&#x02013;6 days before recruitment, birth between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation, women who had received preventive antibiotic treatment between 48 hours before and 48 hours after childbirth (one dose was sufficient for inclusion regardless of the type of antibiotic), and women with firm intention to breastfeed their children for at least 16 weeks. Exclusion criteria during the study were mammary pathologies or children's pathologies that hinder or preclude breastfeeding and low expectation of adherence to the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from the women.</p><p>Sample size was estimated based on the effect on the main outcome of the study and the incidence of mastitis. Based on previous data about mastitis incidence, the study was designed to exhibit sufficient power (80%) to detect a difference between groups of 40% in the incidence rate of mastitis after treatment with a 0.05 significance level (Software R version 2.12.2). The number of women necessary was 258 per group, total sample size was increased up to 625 women to compensate dropouts.</p><p>Women were recruited and distributed into two study groups, according to a randomization generated by a computer program (R version 2.12.2).

Probiotic and placebo were provided in identical gelatin capsules packaged in identical plastic tubes labeled in plain white with a code number that referred to the manufacturing batch. As stability of probiotic bacteria is dependent on temperature of conservation, capsules were kept at 4&#x000b0;C throughout the study. The concentration of viable <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the probiotic capsules was stable throughout the study (2.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> CFU/capsule at the end of the intervention).</p><p>Twelve hospitals from different regions of Spain collaborated in the study.

Women were contacted monthly by phone and asked about mastitis symptoms and asked to score their breast pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extremely painful). In case of mastitis symptoms, diagnosis was confirmed by a corresponding medical doctor or midwife. Data about use of antibiotic, analgesic, and topic treatment for nipple and for breast symptoms were also collected.</p><p>As changes in diet might influence the results on main outcomes of the study, this variable was controlled by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by the women at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Compliance of women was evaluated by collecting the remaining capsules at the end of intervention.</p><p>Breast milk samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of intervention. In case of mastitis event, breast milk samples were also collected. For breast milk sample collection, nipple and mammary areola were cleaned with soap and water and an antibacterial (chlorhexidine) solution was applied. Breast milk samples were obtained by manual expression and collected in sterile tubes after discarding the first drops of milk.

In the control group, 24.6% of women suffered from mastitis. Data about incidence of mastitis are very variable.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This variability is probably because of differences in diagnosis criteria. Mastitis incidence reported by studies using the same diagnosis criteria of <italic>L. fermentum</italic> consumption was slightly lower, between 13% and 20%.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> It has been previously reported that antibiotherapy during delivery was significantly more widely administered to women reporting mastitis (OR 1.53).<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These data might explain the slightly higher incidence observed in the <italic>L. fermentum</italic> study because women who received preventive antibiotic in the context of delivery were recruited. Regarding efficacy of probiotic strains to prevent mastitis, Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic strain, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> PS2, to prevent mastitis. They observed a similar decrease of mastitis incidence during the first 3 months of breastfeeding (56%) for probiotic consumption. Although values of incidence reduction are similar to those of the <italic>L. fermentum</italic> study, there are important differences in protocols, apart from the different evaluated <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. For example, in the Fern&#x000e1;ndez study, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> was administered during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, but probiotic administration was not continued during breastfeeding. In the <italic>L. fermentum</italic> study, in which the probiotic strain was administered during breastfeeding, most episodes of mastitis occurred along the first 4 weeks postpartum. New studies should evaluate whether administration of <italic>L. fermentum</italic> during some weeks before childbirth might help to prevent more efficiently early episodes of mastitis.</p><p>Breast pain was quite frequent in women mainly during the first month, but in most cases it was not associated with clinical mastitis. <italic>L. fermentum</italic> consumption reduced the odds of suffering from pain and its intensity. In fact, in women who suffered from mastitis, the level of IL-8, a cytokine directly related to pain,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> was significantly lower in the probiotic group. Levels of IL-8 in breast milk were also directly related to <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> load in milk. This relation was also observed in a previous study performed in women suffering from painful breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> IL-8 is considered as an indicator of mastitis,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> so the reduction observed in the probiotic group in women suffering from mastitis is also indicative of lower level of inflammation and severity of mastitis.</p><p>Levels of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in milk were significantly lower in women receiving <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716. As high level of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> is a risk factor for lactational mastitis, the reduction in this bacterial count might be responsible for the observed reduction in the incidence of mastitis. In fact, although higher level of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was found in milk of women who suffered from mastitis during the study, in the probiotic group this level tended to be lower.</p><p>The mechanism by which <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716 reduces the load of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in breast milk is not totally clear, although different activities of the probiotic strain might be involved. Antibacterial activity or competition phenomena have been described for <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716 in in vitro assays.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, although <italic>L. fermentum</italic> was detected in 61% more women in the probiotic group than women in the control group, we could not observe a significant presence of the strain in breast milk at the end of the intervention. Therefore, maybe local activity in the mammary gland is not mainly responsible for the activity. Other authors have suggested that metabolites with antibacterial properties produced by probiotic strains might reach the mammary gland and affect survival or virulence of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
<italic>L. fermentum</italic> showed in vitro the capability of inhibiting <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> growth in a diffusion agar assay, evidencing the production of antibacterial compounds that were not identified.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In contrast, <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716 has shown immunoenhancing activity by increasing immunoglobulins and Th1 cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-12.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. have a mechanism to avoid phagocytosis, the primary cellular defense of the mammary gland against pathogens.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In animal models, <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716 increased the phagocytic activity of circulating blood leukocytes. This kind of activity in humans might help to prevent the proliferation of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. in the mammary gland.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>A limitation of this study is the high level of dropouts during the study. Although women with firm intention of breastfeeding during the first 4 months were recruited, around 25% of women stop breastfeeding during the intervention. In Spain, where this study was performed, data of National Institute of Statistic estimated the prevalence of breastfeeding at the third month of lactation to be 53.5%.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Most of the dropout cases took place during the first month of study. Women reported that they were too busy with their babies to commit to the study. Despite the number of women who complete the study was significantly lower than planned, the study keeps enough statistical power. It is because of a higher incidence of mastitis finally observed and the high difference in the level of incidence between groups.</p><p>The other limitation of the study is the population. To observe higher level of incidence, only women receiving preventive antibiotic were included. In another recent study performed with the other probiotic strain, <italic>L. salivarius</italic> PS2, population with history of mastitis was selected.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In this study, the decrease of mastitis incidence in the probiotic group was similar to that observed in our study. Therefore, although more studies should be performed in the general population, the capability of certain probiotic strains to protect against mastitis does not seem to depend on these risk factors.</p><p>Besides being a randomized double-blinded trial controlled by placebo, another strength of this study is the measurement in the same study of the incidence of a disease, its risk factors, and parameters indicative of the severity of the disease.</p><p>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age by the WHO because breast milk provides all the nutrients and components necessary for proper infant development and growth.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Mastitis is an important health problem that affects a high percentage of women during lactation. This problem has a direct impact not only on the mothers threatening their health but also on the infants, as mastitis makes the normal breastfeeding difficult and in some cases can even lead to abandonment of breastfeeding. Otherwise, the symptoms of mastitis affect the mother&#x02013;infant relationship because the symptoms of pain associated with mastitis might cause anxiety and feeling of anger because of the pain problems during breastfeeding.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Until now, an appropriate management of breastfeeding is the recommendation for mastitis prevention.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Results of this study show that <italic>L. fermentum</italic> CECT5716 consumption might be a new and efficient strategy to prevent the development of lactational mastitis.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s017" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>MALDI-TOF analyses were possible with the help and collaboration of Dr. Federico Garc&#x000ed;a and the staff of the Department of Microbiology of the San Cecilio University Hospital, Granada, Spain.
