The open nature of the study implied that both the investigators and the parents/guardians were aware of the treatment; however, the laboratory personnel generally were unaware of the treatment allocation. Healthy participants aged 9&#x02013;10&#x02005;months were randomised (2:2:1) to receive either two doses of the MMRV vaccine (MMRV/MMRV group) or MMR followed by MMRV (MMR/MMRV group), or MMR followed by MMR+V (MMR/MMR+V group; control) at 9 and 15&#x02005;months of age.

The sample size was estimated taking into consideration the co-primary objectives of non-inferiority. Non-inferiority was achieved if the lower limit of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates between the two treatment groups and control group (MMRV/MMRV&#x02013;MMR/MMR+V; MMR/MMRV&#x02013;MMR/MMR+V) was &#x02265;&#x02212;10% for each vaccine antigen, 43&#x02005;days postdose 2. Similarly, the secondary non-inferiority objective was achieved if the lower limit of the two-sided standardised asymptotic 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates between the MMRV/MMRV group and pooled MMR results from the MMR/MMRV and MMR/MMR+V groups, 43&#x02005;days postdose 1 was &#x02265;&#x02212;10% for measles, mumps and rubella. Considering that up to 25% of the participants enrolled could be non-evaluable, a total of 450 participants (180 participants in each of the treatment groups and 90 participants in the control group) were to be enrolled in the study. A sample size of 130 evaluable participants in each treatment group and 65 evaluable participants in the control group was planned, which gave a power of at least 93.91% with a non-inferiority margin of 10% for all antigens to meet the co-primary objectives. A central randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm provided each child with a unique treatment number. A randomisation (2:2:1) blocking scheme ensured that the balance between treatments was maintained by providing a unique treatment number that identified the vaccine dose to be administered to the participants. Furthermore, given the different physical characteristics of the study vaccines and the number of injections between study groups, the study was conducted in an open manner wherein the treatment allocation of participants was known to the investigators and the parents/guardians.</p><p>Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort which included all participants for whom prevaccination and postvaccination serology results were available and who complied with study procedures. Seroconversion rates (defined as the appearance of antibodies (ie, antibody concentration/titre &#x02265; cut-off value) in the serum of participants who were seronegative before vaccination), and geometric mean titres (GMTs) were calculated with exact 95% CIs for antibodies against each vaccine antigen after each dose. The 95% CIs for the GMTs were obtained by exponential transformation of the 95% CI for the mean of the log-transformed titre.</p><p>Safety analysis was performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) which included all vaccinated participants. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms reported for the participants during the respective postvaccination periods were calculated with exact 95% CIs.

The co-primary non-inferiority criterion ruling out a 10% difference in seroconversion rates postdose 2 of MMRV/MMRV and MMR/MMRV compared with MMR/MMR+V was achieved for all antigens, indicating that the immune responses elicited by the two vaccination regimens were non-inferior to those elicited by the control regimen. Although the two-dose MMRV/MMRV schedule is not included in several immunisation programmes, this regimen has been established to be non-inferior to the two-dose MMR+V schedule in separate studies in Germany and Singapore.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Additionally, on comparing the postdose 1 responses, one dose of MMRV in the MMRV/MMRV group elicited non-inferior immune responses against measles, mumps and rubella compared with pooled results of one dose of MMR in the MMR/MMRV and MMR/MMR+V groups.</p><p>In the three vaccine groups, we observed low baseline seropositivity rates (&#x0003c;2.7%) for measles, mumps and rubella in participants at 9&#x02005;months of age. This finding suggests a possible decline in circulating maternal antibodies and measles infection by this age which would support 9&#x02005;months as a suitable age for initial vaccination. However, it should be noted that this finding is inconsistent with a notable Indian study conducted approximately a decade ago that suggested the persistence of high circulating maternal antibodies at 9&#x02005;months of age with baseline seropositivity rates of 15% for measles and 20% each for mumps and rubella.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Additionally, while lowering the measles vaccination age in low-income countries is supported by many, vaccinating at 9&#x02005;months or earlier may mean that the immune system has not reached optimum maturity to mount an effective response and provide effective long-term protection against measles or the other diseases with just a single vaccine dose.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The seroconversion rates for all antigens in the MMRV/MMRV group were consistent with previous observations in Singaporean children at 9&#x02005;months of age by Goh <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, with a first dose of MMR, the observed postdose 1 seroconversion rates to measles (MMR/MMRV=88.2%; MMR/MMR+V=87.5%) and mumps (MMR/MMRV=84.2%; MMR/MMR+V=83.3%) in this study were somewhat lower than those reported by Schuster <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> following administration of a first dose of MMR to children aged 11&#x02013;21&#x02005;months in Germany (measles 93.4%; mumps 93.6%). A contrast in immune responses between the current study and the German study may be attributed to the age at vaccination, maturity of the immune system and circulating maternal antibodies. Also, the higher GMTs observed in measles in the MMRV/MMRV group compared with the MMR/MMRV and MMR/MMR+V groups could translate to more effective protection in a highly endemic measles environment where coverage from a second dose of a measles-containing vaccine remains variable throughout the country.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Lower seroconversion rates with other live-attenuated vaccines (such as the oral polio vaccine and the rotavirus vaccine) have also been observed in India and South Asia compared with more industrialised settings.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref></p><p>Nevertheless, we observed high seroconversion rates for all vaccine antigens following the administration of a second vaccination at 15&#x02005;months of age, indicating that an early two-dose immunisation strategy when the first dose is administered as early as 9&#x02005;months elicits a satisfactory immune response. An interesting observation was the markedly high GMT against mumps postdose 2 in the MMR/MMRV (10&#x02005;108.5) group compared with the MMR/MMR+V (4925.3) and MMRV/MMRV (6428.0) groups. This observation has not been reported previously despite the higher mumps antigen content in the MMRV vaccine when compared with the MMR vaccine and studies that evaluate this finding may be needed in the future.</p><p>Early administrations of all three vaccination regimens were well tolerated when administered to young children at 9 and 15&#x02005;months of age. Similar differences in solicited general symptoms have been observed in studies conducted in the Indian subcontinent with other live-attenuated viral vaccines (such as <italic>Rotarix</italic>) compared with other countries.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Notably, unlike previous studies conducted in other countries,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> this study did not demonstrate any difference in fever rates between MMRV and MMR when used as a first dose of measles-containing vaccine. Although this may be related to the epidemiological context in India, which differs from developed countries, the reason is unclear. In general, the reporting rate of fever was also lower than that seen in other studies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Again, this may be due to the younger age of children enrolled, or the presence of maternal antibodies, which may have limited measles virus replication postdose 1, resulting in the blunting of immune response and fever response rates; or cross-cultural/geographical differences in the reporting of symptoms. Further data may be needed to determine if there is in fact a difference in the reactogenicity profile between developed and developing countries.</p><p>It is possible to eliminate measles from a specific region by sustaining high immunisation coverage as is evident from Latin America, Finland and the USA;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref> countries such as Finland have also successfully eliminated mumps and rubella using the MMR vaccine.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In view of the ongoing transmission and high mortality risk of measles in India, immunisation coverage of &#x02265;95% for the first and second doses would be required to ensure prevention of measles virus transmission.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Currently, the Indian national immunisation schedule's 9&#x02005;months single dose immunisation coverage is 74%;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> however, as this represents the average, coverage rates in some parts of the country may be even lower. Several European countries, where the first MMR dose is administered to children in the second year of life (12&#x02013;24&#x02005;months), continue to face relatively low immunisation coverage rates resulting in measles and mumps outbreaks,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> as was recently observed even in South Wales.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> An earlier vaccination schedule was implemented in Germany as a result of such outbreaks, whereby the first dose is now administered at 11&#x02013;14&#x02005;months followed by the second dose at 15&#x02013;23&#x02005;months of age.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This revised strategy achieved well-documented successful immunisation coverage rates,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and highlights the importance of early vaccination with increased compliance and subsequently higher coverage rates.</p><p>There are a few limitations of the study that should be considered: (1) the six tertiary care centres where the study was conducted are not representative of the entire Indian population, (2) investigator bias while reporting AEs due to the open design of the study, and (3) there were no adjustments made for confounding factors (eg, centres) in the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that in an Indian setting, the two-dose vaccination regimens of MMRV/MMRV and MMR/MMRV are non-inferior to the control MMR/MMR+V regimen (ie, the local standard of care recommended by the IAP)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> in terms of immunological response.
