Moreover, both opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produce problematic side-effects, particularly with prolonged use as may be required in the treatment of chronic pain, which markedly limit the clinical utility of these two classes of analgesics. Tricyclic antidepressants are more amenable to longer term use, but also produce side-effects, ranging from dry mouth to the potential for cardiotoxicity, which can limit their clinical utility.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Alternative pharmacological treatments for chronic pain are, therefore, needed.</p><p>Evidence has been generated over the past few decades that various anticonvulsant agents provide relief of several chronic pain syndromes, and therefore, as an alternative to opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and tricyclic antidepressant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Anticonvulsants such as Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers: Carbamazepine and phenytoin relieve neuropathic pain, but their usefulness is limited by low efficacy and adverse side-effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In particular, the N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker pregabalin has been reported to be efficacious in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Sodium and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker zonisamide is efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker ethosuximide was found to be effective in chemotherapy evoked painful peripheral neuropathy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It should be noted, however, that these reference compounds were mostly studied singularly (i.e., in separate studies), and that their efficacy was assessed under different experimental conditions and against different modalities using different behavioral readouts. The results of these studies thus raise the question of whether all anticonvulsant drugs or particularly classes may be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes.</p><p>The major purpose of the present study was to compare clinically used anticonvulsant drugs which are differ in their mechanism of action in a chronic pain model, the chronic constriction injury, in order to determine if all anticonvulsants or only particular mechanistic classes of anticonvulsants are analgesic. The chronic constriction injury model appears to be one of the most frequently used model for the study of neuropathic pain and its treatment. The model, which is based on a unilateral loose ligation of the sciatic nerve, shows many of the pathophysiological properties of chronic neuropathic pain in human subjects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It also shows a relatively high degree of similarity with other models of neuropathic pain in terms of the time course and the degree of allodynia and hyperalgesia against mechanical and/or thermal stimuli, the occurrence of spontaneous pain, and its sensitivity to sympathectomy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Animal and maintenance</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of body weight between 200 and 230 g were used for this work. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (1622/PO/a/12/CPCSEA). Each rat was housed in plastic box cage individually with well-controlled supplied air, humidity (57%) and temperature under a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drugs and chemicals</title><p>Pregabalin was obtained from Torrent Research Centre (Gandhinagar, Gujarat), and zonisamide was obtained from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai, Maharashtra) as a gift sample. Ethosuximide was purchased from Sigma (India). All drugs were dissolved in isotonic saline solution to prepare drug solutions of specific concentration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Induction of peripheral mononeuropathy: Chronic constriction injury model</title><p>Unilateral mononeuropathy was produced in rat using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model performed essentially as described by Bennet and Xie.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal combination of ketamine and xylazine at 60 and 6.5 mg/kg, respectively. The left hind leg was shaved, moistened with a disinfectant and now common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the middle of the thigh by blunt dissection through the biceps femoris. Proximal to the sciatic trifurcation, about 7 mm of the nerve was freed of adhering tissues and four loose ligatures were made with 4.0 braided silk suture with about 1 mm spacing. The wound was then closed by suturing the muscle using chromic catgut with a continuous suture pattern. Finally, the skin was closed with 3.0 black braided silk sutures using a horizontal mattress suture pattern. Sham surgery was performed by exposing the sciatic nerve as described above, but not damaging it. Povidone-iodine ointment was applied topically to the wound and benzylpenicillin antibiotic (20,000 IU/Kg, b.i.d) was given intramuscularly for 5 days after surgery. The animals were then transferred to their home cage and left to recover.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sensory testing (Nociceptive assay)</title><p>Nociceptive assays aimed at determining the severity of behavioral neuropathic parameters, namely spontaneous pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia, were performed. The assays involved measurement of the degree of spontaneous (ongoing) pain and tests of hind limb withdrawal to cold, thermal and mechanical stimuli (dynamic mechanical allodynia, cold allodynia, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia). Separate group of animals (<italic>n</italic> = 4) was used for each assay.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Spontaneous pain</title><p>Spontaneous pain was assessed for a total time period of 5 min as described previously by Choi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The operated rats were individually placed inside an observation cage, and an initial acclimatization period of 10 min was given to each of the rat. A total of four rats were assigned to this group. Consider noted the cumulative duration that the rat holds its ipsilateral paw off the floor. The paw lifts associated with locomotion or body repositioning was not counted. For each measurement, three successive readings were taken without any elapse and the mean was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Dynamic component of mechanical allodynia</title><p>Dynamic allodynic response was assessed according to the procedure described by Field <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage. An initial acclimatization period of 10 min was given to each of the rat. A total of four rats were assigned to this group. A positive dynamic allodynia response consisted of lifting the affected paw for a finite period of time in response to mild stroking on the planter surface using a cotton bud. This stimulus is nonnoxious to a normally behaving rat. The latency to paw withdrawal was then noted. If no paw withdrawal was shown within 15 s, the test was terminated and animal was assigned nonresponsive. For each measurement, three successive readings were taken with 3 min elapsed between each test and mean was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Cold allodynia</title><p>The rats demonstrating unilateral mononeuropathy were assessed for acute cold allodynia sensitivity using the acetone drop application technique as described by Caudle <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage and allowed to acclimatize for 10 min. A total of four rats were assigned to this group. A few drops (100-200 ml) of freshly dispend acetone were squirted as a fine mist onto the midplanter region of the affected paw. A cold allodynic response was assessed by noting the duration of the paw withdrawal response. For each measurement, the paw was sampled 3 times with 3 min elapsed between each test and mean was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Mechanical hyperalgesia</title><p>Mononeuropathic rats were assessed for mechanical hyperalgesia sensitivity according to the procedure described by Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The operated rat was placed inside an observation cage and allowed to acclimatize for 10 min. A total of four rats were assigned to this group. Hind paw withdrawal duration (PWD) was measured after a mild pinprick stimulus to the midplanter surface of the ipsilateral hind paw. A withdrawal was defined as being abnormally prolonged if it lasted for at least 2 s. The mean duration of withdrawal was taken from a set of three responses with 3 min elapsed between each test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Thermal hyperalgesia</title><p>Thermal hyperalgesia response was assessed according to the procedure described by Eddy and Leimbach.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A total of four rats were assigned to this group. The temperature of eddy's hot plate was set at 55.0&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000b0;C. The operated rats were placed on a heated surface and the time interval between placement and the shaking, licking or tucking of the affected hind paws was recorded as the latency response. If no paw withdrawal was shown within 22 s, the test was terminated and animal was assigned nonresponsive. For each measurement, three successive readings were taken with 3 min elapsed between each test and mean was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>Eight groups, each comprising four SD rats, were employed in the present study.

The present study, therefore, sought to directly compare the analgesic effects of clinically used anticonvulsant drugs with differing mechanisms of action by experimental peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>Inhibition of neuronal voltage-gated sodium and/or calcium channels may play a pivotal role in membrane excitability. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are critical elements of action potential initiation and propagation. Deregulation of VGSCs expression is thought to be involved in changes to neuronal firing and contribute to neuropathic pain states. Recently discovered T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels become activated after a small depolarization of the neuronal membrane and therefore play a crucial role in excitability of both central and peripheral neurons.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are involved in neurotransmitter release and therefore play a dominant role in controlling nociceptive signal transmission under pathological conditions.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Neuronal injury produced by CCI, results in changes in sodium channel numbers and types, which contribute to the hyperexcitability,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] while T-type calcium channels may regulate the rate of repetitive neuronal firing and N-type calcium channels may regulate the release of neurotransmitters, further contributing to the hyperexcitability.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Blockade of sodium channels suppresses sodium-dependent action potential. Inhibition of, T-type calcium channels attenuates the sharp depolarization of the membrane potential while N-type calcium channels reduce the release of pronociceptive neurotransmitters from the central nerve terminals of primary afferent neurons.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The sodium and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker zonisamide has been reported to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker ethosuximide found to be effective in chemotherapy evoked painful peripheral neuropathy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker pregabalin has been reported to be efficacious in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, data were showed that CCI induced spontaneous pain was significantly attenuated by zonisamide and pregabalin in dose-dependent manner while ethosuximide showed limited effectiveness.</p><p>In case of mechanical allodynia, both doses of zonisamide (80 and 40 mg/kg), higher dose of pregabalin (50 mg/kg) and ethosuximide (300 mg/kg) showed limited effectiveness while lower dose of pregabalin (20 mg/kg) exerted delayed effect on CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. In the case of chemical allodynia, the higher dose of zonisamide and ethosuximide observed to be irregularly attenuated the chemically induced allodynic response while lower dose of zonisamide showed limited effectiveness. On the other hand, both doses of pregabalin significantly attenuated chemical allodynia. Lower dose of ethosuximide (100 mg/kg) did not reverse the CCI induced allodynic (mechanical and chemical) response.</p><p>In the case of hyperalgesia (mechanical and thermal), both doses of zonisamide were observed to be effective on thermal hyperalgesia while mechanical hyperalgesia was significantly attenuated by lower dose. Present data showed that the ethosuximide possessed limited antihyperalgesic activity at both doses. Pregabalin was exerted antihyperalgesic activity at higher dose while lower dose showed limited effect on mechanically induced hyperalgesia and delayed effect on thermal hyperalgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall profile of anti-epileptic drugs used in this study suggests that these drugs could provide an effective alternative in the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, zonisamide and pregabalin appear to have suitable efficacy to treat a wide spectrum of neuropathic pain condition. The present findings suggest that the inhibition of N-type calcium channels or voltage-gated sodium and T-type calcium channels provide better analgesic potential instead of T-type calcium channels alone. Further research is required to confirm these findings in a large group of animals with special emphasis on molecular mechanisms of these compounds.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
