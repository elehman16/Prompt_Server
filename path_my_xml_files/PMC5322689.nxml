Oral administration of symbiotic and Vitamin E has been proposed as an effective treatment in NAFLD patients. This study was carried out to assess the effects of symbiotic and/or Vitamin E supplementation on liver enzymes, leptin, lipid profile, and some parameters of insulin resistance (IR) in NAFLD patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned sixty NAFLD adult patients to receive (1) symbiotic twice daily + Vitamin E-like placebo capsule; (2) 400 IU/d Vitamin E + symbiotic-like placebo; (3) symbiotic twice daily + 400 IU/d Vitamin E; and (4) symbiotic-like placebo + Vitamin E-like placebo for 8 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Symbiotic plus Vitamin E supplementation led to a significant decrease in concentrations of liver transaminase (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Mean difference of apolipoprotein A-1 was more significant in symbiotic group compared to control. However, mean difference of apolipoprotein B100/A-1 was only significant in symbiotic group compared to control. At the end of the study, significant differences in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were seen between the symbiotic plus Vitamin E and control groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, intake of symbiotic plus Vitamin E supplements led to a significant decrease in concentrations of triglycerides (TG) after the intervention. Significant differences in leptin, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and insulin levels were seen between the symbiotic plus Vitamin E and control groups at the end of the study (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate quantities, confer a health benefit to the host.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the past two decades, a number of investigators have sought to determine that probiotics along with prebiotics have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and lipid-lowering properties. Besides, regarding fibrotic and steatotic characteristics of NAFLD,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] it was assumed that symbiotic supplementation might act as a novel therapeutic strategy in patients with this disease.</p><p>Cytotoxic FFA oxidation in liver can upregulate cytokines production, which, in turn, induces cytochrome P450 enzyme expression and reduces liver concentration of antioxidants.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, increased production of cytokines in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) leads to fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix protein deposition.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Vitamin E as a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production and attenuate hepatic fibrosis production.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Research on the NAFLD and probiotic supplementation has been mostly restricted to a limited number of some species of probiotics. In addition, far too little attention has been paid to synergistic effect of multiple strains of probiotic and Vitamin E supplements in NAFLD patients. The present study was, therefore, performed to investigate the synergistic effect of symbiotic and Vitamin E supplementation on some indicators such as liver enzymes, leptin, lipid profile, and glycemic status in NAFLD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Recruitment and eligibility screening</title><p>The present randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted in Tehran, Iran, during 2012&#x02013;2013 among sixty NAFLD patients (48 men and 12 women) aged 25&#x02013;64 years, who were recruited from Hazrat-e-Rasoul Medical Complex (Colorectal Research Center) in Tehran, Iran, which is only devoted to gastrointestinal (GI) and liver disorders. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, eligible patients signed a written consent form after a full review of the risks and benefits of the study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences (grant number: 90005246) in 2011 and registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT201111082709N22) and was funded by the Iran National Science Foundation.

The findings in this survey are the confirmation of the recent studies.</p><p>The intestinal mucosa as a defense barrier prevents the penetration and the systemic spread of bacteria and endotoxins, most of which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS). However, failing in this barrier under certain conditions leads to bacterial and endotoxin invasion into the GI tract, systemic organs, and tissues. These microbial products exert proinflammatory actions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Baldwin showed that activation of TLR4 by LPS has a distinct effect in promoting inflammation and injury in conditions such as alcoholic liver disease and NASH.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] On the other hand, small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) which is present in 50% of patients with nonalcoholic steatosis results in tight junction disruption and increased gut permeability, which may impact on NAFLD progression.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The first question in this study was meant to determine the synergistic effect of symbiotic and Vitamin E supplementation on changes of liver enzyme levels. NAFLD as the most common cause of chronic liver disease is often identified by asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes, especially serum ALT levels.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study, joint symbiotic-Vitamin E supplementation for 8 weeks led to significant reduction in serum ALT, AST, and ALP levels. In accordance with our result, Eslamparast <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized, double-blind study in NAFLD patients found that supplementation with symbiotic, in addition to lifestyle modification for 28 weeks, can decrease serum ALT and AST levels.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In a study by Aller <italic>et al</italic>., significant reduction in serum ALT and AST levels was observed following <italic>L. bulgaricus</italic> and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> supplementation in NAFLD patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similarly, VSL#3 supplementation in NAFLD patients significantly decreased these variables.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In line with these findings, symbiotic plus Vitamin E supplementation had more significant reduction in ALT, AST, and ALP levels in our study. Collectively, symbiotics exert their beneficial effects on liver functions and enzymes through manipulation of enteric flora, enhancing the barrier function of epithelial cells, decreasing intestinal permeability, and endotoxemia in patients with liver diseases.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies assessed the efficacy of Vitamin E in NAFLD adult patients. In the PIVENS trial, 247 nondiabetic and noncirrhotic adults with NASH received Vitamin E (800 IU/day), pioglitazone (30 mg/day), or placebo for 96 weeks. Compared with the placebo, Vitamin E led to a robust improvement in NASH.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, in one meta-analysis, Sato <italic>et al</italic>. showed beneficial effects of Vitamin E supplementation on liver function and histologic changes in patients with NAFLD/NASH.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Increased hepatic uptake and synthesis of FFAs led to increasing generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] ROS overproduction enhances lipid peroxidation and some cytokines production, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Lipid peroxidation and cytokine production generate more ROS production which have deleterious effects on HSCs. On the other hand, animal studies have shown that Vitamin E as a fat-soluble vitamin can decrease liver enzymes, diminish histological steatosis, and necroinflammation. Interestingly, Vitamin E downregulates the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1, a cytokine implicated in the development of liver fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>We also studied the effects of Vitamin E supplementation in combination with symbiotic on serum leptin levels. Leptin levels increase along with increasing fat mass as a compensatory mechanism, that limits the expansion of fat mass, and preserve insulin sensitivity. Expansion of adipose tissue as a result of obesity leads to detrimental effects of leptin, by acting as proinflammatory and profibrogenic adipokine.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Under some conditions, activated HSCs may produce leptin <italic>in vivo</italic> and express LepRb, which activation leads to increased expression of proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines and growth factors so triggering or augmenting fibrogenesis.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Besides, fatty acids and high-fat feeding can, even in the absence of obesity or systemic IR, induce TLRs that in turn trigger inflammation.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Some studies reported higher leptin levels in NAFLD patients[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] while others reported similar levels in NAFLD and controls.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, in literature, no study investigated the effect of symbiotic and/or Vitamin E supplementation on circulating leptin levels in NAFLD patients. Our results showed that combination of symbiotic and Vitamin E supplementation reduced leptin levels significantly. However, in just one study in NAFLD patients, ursodeoxycholic acid with or without Vitamin E did not affect leptin levels or BMI, despite an improvement in hepatic steatosis.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The mechanism by which symbiotics act is through suppressing TLR-related responses by altering the intestinal flora,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reducing inflammation, and improving the liver in animals and humans with fatty livers.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, the exact mechanisms by which Vitamin E supplementation might affect leptin levels are unknown. Vitamin E as an antioxidant may have favorable effects against leptin action on Kupffer cells.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>Abnormalities in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism along with chronic inflammation as a result of endotoxemia are considered to be the central pathway for the development of several obesity-related comorbidities such as NAFLD and CVD.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Moreover, the inability of the liver to regulate the changes in lipogenesis accompanied by insulin and glucose role in adipogenesis are major causes of fat accumulation in NAFLD patients.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In our study, symbiotic and Vitamin E supplementation simultaneously decreased TC, TG, and LDL-C levels significantly, but the results of this study did not show any significant increase in HDL-C levels after intervention. Furthermore, apo B100/A-1, which has a strong relationship with NAFLD, significantly decreased more in symbiotic group. To our knowledge, up to now, no study has examined the effects of symbiotic plus Vitamin E on lipid profile in NAFLD patients. Besides, among studies that assessed the effects of probiotic or symbiotic supplementation, none of them mentioned the lipid profile in NAFLD patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Meanwhile, no study investigated the positive effects of Vitamin E supplementation on lipid profile in these patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Lipid-lowering properties of symbiotic might be explained by other studies that were conducted in diabetic and obese patients. In these studies, VSL#3 along with prebiotic supplementation induced changes in the microbiota that was associated with an increase in the levels of short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, probiotic bacteria can remove or assimilate cholesterol and can hydrolyze conjugated bile acids, and so excrete them faster.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</p><p>IR, the physiopathological key to metabolic syndrome and to its clinically related diseases, is independently associated with NAFLD and its severity;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] however, no study has investigated the effects of symbiotic in combination with Vitamin E supplementation on IR. The results of our study showed a significant reduction in FBS and insulin concentrations but not HOMA-IR. These results agree with the findings of Eslamparast <italic>et al</italic>. that found a significant reduction in FBS and serum insulin levels following symbiotic supplementation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The present findings seem to be consistent with another research which found a significant reduction in serum FBS and serum insulin levels after treatment with <italic>B. Longum</italic> and fructooligosaccharide.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Yakaryilmaz <italic>et al</italic>., nine patients with biopsy-proven NASH were given oral Vitamin E (800 mg) daily for 24 weeks. At the end of the 6 months, fasting insulin improved, but serum TC, TG, and FBS levels remained unchanged.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] 800 IU Vitamin E supplementation in another study had no effect on IR. The possible reasons for this discrepancy might be explained by high dose of Vitamin E supplementation and duration of interventions.</p><p>Circulating LPS are present at higher concentrations in the blood of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or IR and correlate with insulin, glucose concentrations, and HOMA-IR.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Increase insulin hypersecretion along with SIBO and increased intestinal permeability; accelerate liver fat accumulation, which lead to NAFLD. Furthermore, gut microbiota has been shown to affect fat storage and energy harvesting, playing an important role in the development of IR.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The mechanisms by which symbiotics could improve IR and lipid profile are thought to be by modulation of the intestinal microflora composition, reduction of endotoxemia, increases in fecal pH, suppression of inflammation and reduction in the production and absorption of intestinal toxins.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] It was well established that Vitamin E reducing IR mechanisms are through suppressing oxidative stress and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha expression.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</p><p>The strengths of our study include its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, combination of symbiotic and Vitamin E supplementation, and the strong compliance and retention of patients to the experimental program.</p><p>The main limitation of this survey is its relatively small sample size and the measurement time which reduced our power to detect differences among subgroups. In addition, in our study, we had to convince the participants to be merely strict on consuming not probiotic products during the study although we could unravel the problem by regular weekly phone calls.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that the diagnosis of liver disease was not confirmed by liver biopsy as it is difficult to perform due to ethical reasons; hence, further studies, which take these variables into account, will need to be undertaken. Compelling of evidence has indicated that bacterial count and using fecal sample provide a better estimate of intervention with probiotics. In subsequent study, we will make every effort to collect fecal samples to evaluate changes in bacterial species and abundance in particular, among NAFLD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Significant findings emerged from this study are that 400 IU Vitamin E in combination with symbiotic supplements can decrease the liver enzymes, serum insulin, FBS, and leptin levels along with some lipid profiles in NAFLD patients.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This work was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>
