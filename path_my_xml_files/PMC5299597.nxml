Study 2 was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with healthy volunteers randomized to receive repeat doses (80 mg) of GSK2647544. The drug-drug interaction of GSK2647544 with simvastatin was also evaluated in study 2. <underline>Results:</underline> Across both studies GSK2647544 doses were generally well tolerated with no GSK2647544-related clinically significant findings. GSK2647544 was readily absorbed and its plasma concentration declined bi-exponentially with a terminal half-life ranging from 8 to 16 hours. Plasma exposure of GSK2647544 increased approximately dose-proportionally. There was GSK2647544 dose-dependent inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity, with a trough inhibition (12 hours after dose) of 85.6% after 7-day twice daily dosing. The administration of simvastatin concomitantly with GSK2647544 increased the overall exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) of simvastatin and simvastatin acid by 3.6- to 4.3-fold and 1.5- to 3.1-fold, respectively. <underline>Conclusions:</underline> GSK2647544 was generally well tolerated and had a reasonable PK-PD profile. The clinically significant drug-drug interaction led to an early termination of study 2. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GSK2647544</kwd><kwd>lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>phase 1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction </title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for 60&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;70% of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;47.5 million people affected worldwide by dementia [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease is characterized by cognitive deficits and over time affected individuals become profoundly cognitively and functionally impaired. AD remains an area of high unmet medical need as currently available treatment options for AD are limited and provide only modest, short-term symptomatic benefit [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase (Lp-PLA2), also known as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolyse (PAF-AH), is a calcium-independent phospholipase A2 with proinflammatory activities that is primarily secreted by monocyte-derived macrophages. The enzyme circulates in plasma as a complex with low-density lipoprotein and, to a lesser extent, with high-density lipoprotein [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lp-PLA2 has been studied extensively as a marker of cardiovascular risk, and inhibitors of the enzyme were developed to counter the atherogenic properties of oxidized low-density lipoproteins by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory and proapoptotic lipid mediators, lyso-phosphatidylcholine and non-esterified fatty acids. These proinflammatory lipids are thought to play an important role in driving the vascular inflammation [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. </p><p>Preliminary clinical evidence that targeting Lp-PLA2 may provide a novel treatment to slow the progression of AD comes from a phase 2a study with a non-central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant Lp-PLA2 inhibitor rilapladib, which demonstrated improved cognitive outcomes and changes to a number of mechanism- and disease-related biomarkers [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This study was based on findings from a diabetic mellitus (DM) and hypercholesterolemic (HC) pig model, in which treatment with darapladib (another Lp-PLA2 inhibitor) numerically reduced the extent of immunoglobulin-G brain parenchyma penetration suggesting a reduction in blood brain barrier leakage, and significantly lowered the total amount of brain amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide 1-42 deposition compared with untreated DM/HC pigs [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>Evidence indicates that Lp-PLA2 is also present in the human central nervous system (CNS) [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and that its specific activity can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Immunohistochemical evidence indicates that its expression is primarily associated with microglia [GSK data on file]. Pharmacological inhibition of this central pool of Lp-PLA2 has the potential to provide an additional interventional mechanism for the treatment of AD and other neurological indications. GSK2647544 is an orally available, selective inhibitor of Lp-PLA2 [data on file], and data from a human PET biodistribution study indicates that it is a brain penetrant in humans with a mean whole brain volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>) of 0.56 (Clintrials.gov: NCT01924858; http://www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com/study/117155#rs). </p><p>The aims of the present clinical studies were to assess (1) the overall safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of GSK2647544 in healthy subjects and (2) the potential for an in-vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) due to its potent inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 in pooled human liver microsomes, wherein IC50 values of 0.12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M (probe substrate atorvastatin) and 2.9&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M (probe substrates midazolam and nifedipine) were observed. Study 1 was the first-in-human (FIH) study that used single escalating oral doses of GSK2647544 (0.5&#x000a0;&#x02013; 750&#x000a0;mg) and had primary outcomes on safety and tolerability and secondary outcomes relating to plasma PK and PD. Although study 2 was designed with the overall intent to provide safety and PK data that would support patient studies in AD, the first part of the study was designed to address the potential cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) DDI liability noted above, as this had the potential to negatively impact on the overall developability of the molecule. As described in the current paper, GSK2647544 was found to be a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in the first cohort of subjects; this led to early termination of study 2. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods </title><p>Study 1 (GSK protocol number LPC116698; Clintrials.gov NCT01702467) was conducted at GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Unit, Prince of Whales Hospital, Randwick, Australia. Study 2 (GSK protocol number 200592; Clintrials.gov NCT01978327) was conducted at Parexel Early Phase Unit, Northwick Park Hospital, Harlow, United Kingdom. Both studies were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and approved by the institutional review boards of participating facilities, the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committees in Australia (study 1) and the National Research Ethics Service in London (study 2).

<bold>Study 1: single ascending dose FIH study </bold>
</p><p>This single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was designed to assess PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of single doses of GSK2647544. Three cohorts consisting of 24 healthy male volunteers (8 each cohort, 3&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1 ratio of active&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;placebo) were randomized to receive single escalating oral doses of GSK2647544 or placebo (all doses were provided fasted unless stated): cohort 1 (0.5, 2, 8, and 40 mg of GSK2647544 and placebo fasted), cohort 2 (8, 60, and 125 (fed) mg of GSK2647544 and placebo), and cohort 3 (250, 325 (fed), 600 (fed), and 750 (fed) mg of GSK2647544 and placebo). The allometric scaling based on rat, dog, and monkey PK data predicted a 686-fold safety margin for AUC<sub>(0-24)</sub> and a 1,882-fold safety margin for C<sub>max</sub> of 0.5 mg, respectively, relative to the mean exposure observed at the no observed adverse effects level in animals. </p><p>Subjects were screened for eligibility within 30 days prior to day 1, examined on day &#x02013;1 for baseline physical and laboratory assessments, and monitored for safety and tolerability endpoints after dosing at protocol defined intervals until the end of follow-up. Subjects were admitted and stayed in the study center until all assessments were completed for each dosing session. Safety assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters (including blood biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), electrocardiography (ECG), and Columbia suicide-severity rating scale (CSSRS). </p><p>Study drug was administered in capsules after a standard meal or after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours for the fasted condition. Dose escalations were initiated only after completion of the interim assessment and review of safety data from all subjects receiving GSK2647544 or placebo from the preceding cohort. Interim PK assessments were conducted to ensure maintenance of the safety margin. There was a minimum 7-day washout between dosing sessions and a follow-up 7 &#x02013; 14 days after last dose. </p><p>
<bold>Study 2: repeat ascending dose and DDI study </bold>
</p><p>This single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to assess PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK2647544. The study was originally planned to have four cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Figure1">Figure 1</xref>). The study was terminated at the end of cohort 1 based on interim analysis results which indicated a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibition. In cohort 1, 12 subjects were randomized to active (GSK2647544) or placebo (3&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1 ratio). All the subjects went through 2 treatment sessions separated by a minimum 2-day washout period and a follow-up visit 7 &#x02013; 14 days post last dose. Subjects were admitted and stayed in the study center until all assessments were completed for each dosing session. In session 1, the subjects received a single dose of 10 mg simvastatin in the morning. In session 2, the subjects received repeat doses of 80 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 7 days and a single dose of 10 mg simvastatin on the morning of day 7. </p><p>Screening and safety assessments were as described for study 1. Study drug was administered after a standard meal. The simvastatin clinical dose range is 5 &#x02013; 80 mg once daily; to ensure an adequate safety margin, simvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg was used in the study. </p></sec><sec id="sub-s2"><title>Study population </title><p>

</p><p>22 subjects (81%) reported at least 1 AE during the study. The most commonly reported AEs (&#x02265;&#x000a0;2 incidences) were headache (11 subjects (41%)), contact dermatitis (9 subjects (33%)), myalgia (4 subjects (15%)), presyncope (4 subjects (15%)), ventricular tachycardia (3 subjects (11%)), dizziness (2 subjects (7%)), fatigue (2 subjects (7%)), nasal congestion (2 subjects (7%)), and nasopharyngitis (2 subjects (7%)). All AEs were mild or moderate in intensity except 1 AE of severe nausea reported by a subject after placebo was administered. No apparent dose-dependent increase in frequency and severity of AEs was observed. Three subjects were noted on telemetry to have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting between 3&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;5 beats; 2 (7%) subjects were withdrawn from the study. </p><p>A 27-year-old male subject had a non-sustained, 5-beat run of ventricular tachycardia noted on telemetry ECG ~&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;hours after dosing with 0.5&#x000a0;mg of GSK2647544. Unscheduled biochemistry and troponins were normal, and there was no evidence of QT prolongation or any other morphological change on 12-lead ECG monitoring. This subject did not have any further episodes; however, as a precaution he was withdrawn from the study. In the investigator&#x02019;s opinion this was unrelated to study drug. </p><p>A 21-year-old male subject had brief palpitation with concurrent display of a short 3-beat run of ventricular tachycardia on telemetry ~&#x000a0;36&#x000a0;hours after dosing with 8 mg of GSK2647544. Unscheduled biochemistry and troponins were normal, and there was no evidence of QT prolongation or any other morphological change on 12-lead ECG monitoring. In the investigator&#x02019;s opinion this was unrelated to study drug. The subject continued and completed the study with no further occurrences in subsequent dosing sessions with 60&#x000a0;mg and 125&#x000a0;mg of GSK2647544. </p><p>A 28-year-old male subject had a 4-beat, non-sustained run of ventricular tachycardia ~&#x000a0;7.5&#x000a0;hours after dosing with 125&#x000a0;mg of GSK2647544. There was no evidence of QT prolongation, he was asymptomatic at the time, physical exam was normal and unscheduled biochemistry and troponin were normal. He later had a ventricular couplet at 11.5 and 37&#x000a0;hours postdose. As the event occurred a few hours after dosing, this event was considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator, and therefore the subject was withdrawn from the study. </p><p>There were no clinically significant changes that were considered to be related to GSK2647544 in 12-lead ECG. There were no clinically significant vital sign or laboratory parameter changes reported. No subject had episodes of suicidal ideation or behavior during the study. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths reported in this study. </p><p>

</p><p>9 subjects (75%) reported AEs during the study. The most commonly reported AEs (&#x02265;&#x000a0;2 incidences) were headache, abdominal discomfort, and application site rash, each in 3 subjects (25%). All other AEs were single occurrence. All the reported AEs were mild in intensity and resolved without treatment. None of the AEs led to withdrawal from study. The most commonly reported GSK2647544-related AEs (&#x02265;&#x000a0;2 incidences) were abdominal discomfort (3 subjects (33%)) and headache (2 subjects (22%)). No clinically significant findings of physical exams, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory assessments were found following treatments with simvastatin, GSK2647544, or placebo. No subjects had ventricular tachycardia events. No subjects had suicidal ideation or behaviors in any treatment groups. No SAEs or deaths were reported. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Pharmacokinetics </title><sec id="sub-s12"><title>GSK2647544 </title><p>

The direct inhibitory effect of PK on PD was well described by the E<sub>max</sub> model (Equation 1) and estimated the IC50 to be 11.6&#x000a0;ng/mL. Based on the established models, dose-response curve for the Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity inhibition from baseline at the steady-state trough concentration was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Figure7">Figure 7</xref>). A lower daily dose was required for a twice-daily regimen than a once-daily regimen to reach the same level of PD response. For example, 142&#x000a0;mg daily dose and 250&#x000a0;mg daily dose were required to reach 80% Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity inhibition for a twice-daily and a once-daily regimen, respectively. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion and conclusion </title><p>GSK2647544 is a potent and specific Lp-PLA2 inhibitor that was under investigation for the treatment of AD. Results demonstrated that GSK2647544 was generally well tolerated by healthy subjects for single oral doses up to 750&#x000a0;mg and repeat 7-day b.i.d. oral dose of 80&#x000a0;mg. There were no SAEs and dose-limiting AEs observed in the study population. All GSK2647544-related AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, with headache being the most frequent AE in the single-dose study and abdominal discomfort being the most frequent AE in the repeat-dose study. There were no clinically significant findings of physical exams, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory assessments. To our knowledge this is the first brain-penetrant Lp-PLA2 inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical studies, and there was no evidence for increased incidence of CNS-related AEs. </p><p>Episodes of asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, including unsustained ventricular tachycardia, are observed in healthy volunteers and the challenge in early clinical studies is to distinguish drug-induced effects from background incidence [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A number of factors (lack of preclinical QT liability, lack of QT changes before or after arrhythmias, lack of dose or exposure response, and lack of recurrence on repeat dosing) make it unlikely that the unsustained ventricular tachycardias were related to GSK2647544 pharmacology or dosing. However, this is a specific focus of evaluation for NCEs, and ECG monitoring would be maintained in any future studies. </p><p>After single-dose oral administration, GSK2647544 was readily absorbed with a t<sub>max</sub> of 1 &#x02013; 4 hours. GSK2647544 plasma concentration declined bi-exponentially for doses &#x02265;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;mg and mono-exponentially for doses &#x0003c; 8 mg. The dose-dependency for the shape of plasma concentration time-course was probably due to the second phase of concentration time-course decline mostly being below the limit of quantification for doses &#x0003c;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;mg. For the same reason, the terminal half-life was shorter for doses &#x0003c;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;mg compared with higher doses. Comparison of PK of GSK2647544 in the fasted condition and in the fed condition demonstrated increased exposure and decreased between-subject variability. However, t<sub>max</sub> was not affected by food conditions. The PK of GSK2647544 after repeat dose oral administration was consistent with the PK after single dose oral administration with t<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>1/2</sub> after repeat dose being similar to those after single dose. </p><p>In-vitro studies indicated GSK2647544&#x02019;s potential as a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Results from co-administration of GSK2647544 and simvastatin indicated that in-vitro potency against CYP3A4 has translated into a clinically significant effect. According to FDA guideline, GSK2647544 is defined as a moderate to strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on the observed 2.2- to 9.5-fold increase of AUC with the individual data [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>AD is associated with progressive deficits in cognitive function and, due to age, subjects are typically on a wide range of medications to address other underlying conditions. Several classes of medications that are likely to be prescribed in AD patients [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are also sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, including neuroleptics/antipsychotics, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, antidepressants, statins, and benzodiazepines. A number of drugs from these classes are contraindicated for use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., alprazolam, dofetilide, eplerenone, felodipine, nisoldipine, pimozide, quetiapine, simvastatin, thioridazine, triazolam, ziprasidone), and it would be anticipated that dose adjustment and/or additional safety monitoring would be required for other potential CYP3A4 substrates as part of a development plan. There is also the potential that despite these precautions clinically significant effects may only be unmasked at a late development stage or once the drug was on the market resulting in significant patient safety issues, delays to or additional regulatory filings, and/ or ultimately a withdrawal of the drug from the market. Although there is the potential to mitigate these risks through alterations to the dosing schedule of either GSK2647544 or potential &#x0201c;victim&#x0201d; drugs, the cognitive deficits and polypharmacy associated with AD were felt to effectively negate this approach. Considering the extent of the observed CYP3A4 inhibition and these additional factors, a decision was therefore taken to stop further dosing in study 2 and ultimately to terminate the study. </p><p>There was a clear correlation between the plasma GSK2647544 concentration and inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity with no temporal dissociation after single dose of GSK2647544. The PK-PD modeling further characterized the relationship quantitatively with a direct-effect inhibitory E<sub>max</sub> model. Based on the model prediction, twice-daily regimen was selected over once-daily regimen to be evaluated in study 2 because less total daily dose was required for twice-daily than once-daily regimen to reach the same level of Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity inhibition. In addition to the regimen selection, the model-based prediction also provided a useful guidance for the dose selection in study 2. The 80&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. was selected as the starting dose in study 2 because the model-based dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Figure7">Figure 7</xref>) showed that 80&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. (160&#x000a0;mg daily dose) of GSK2647544 would inhibit ~&#x000a0;82% plasma Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity at trough, which was considered as necessary for GSK2647544, an enzyme inhibitor to produce clinical effect. This model-predicted inhibition was consistent with the observation (86% inhibition). </p><p>In summary, GSK2647544 was generally well tolerated and had a reasonable PK-PD profile. The finding of a clinically significant DDI liability led to the early termination of study 2. </p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgment </title><p>The authors wish to thank Gang Xu for his contribution to the study. </p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conflict of interest </title><p>The studies were sponsored and funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
