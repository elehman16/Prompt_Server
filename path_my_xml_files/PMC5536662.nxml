Thus, PVCs are widely used in various medical facilities for clinical interventions such as drug infusion, nutrition and blood product administration.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Approximately 80% of patients in the USA have received intravenous administration via PVCs.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In 2009, a survey was conducted in 47 hospitals in Beijing, China, and found that 95.7% of these hospitals used PVCs as venipuncture tools.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>For intermittent infusion, PVC flushing and sealing are required to maintain the patency of the PVCs. To date, heparin saline (HS) and normal saline (NS) solutions have been mainly used in catheter sealing for clinical applications. Heparin is an anticoagulant. Therefore, HS can be used to prevent thrombosis and maintain the patency of the catheter for intermittent infusion.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, adverse reactions caused by heparin can be significant, including allergic reactions,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> bleeding<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> the latter of which has an incidence of 0.5%.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Another disadvantage of using HS for catheter sealing is the possibility of administering the wrong dosage of HS.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Compared with HS, NS is convenient and comparatively inexpensive.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>To date, results of studies that addressed the catheter sealing effects of NS and HS have remained controversial. In 1991, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of HS and NS in maintaining catheter patency, the incidence of phlebitis and catheter retention time.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> No significant differences were detected in the incidence of catheter blocking, phlebitis and catheter retention time.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Research subjects in the meta-analysis were from the Departments of Medicine and Surgery and from the Intensive Care Unit.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Based on this evidence, in 2011, the Infusion Nurses Society (INS) recommended the application of NS for flushing and sealing of catheters used in adult patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Several studies that have been published in this field have reported inconsistent findings. One examination included 73 pregnant women and compared the catheter sealing effects of HS (10&#x02009;IU/ml) and NS.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> No significant differences between the two groups were detected in maintaining catheter patency and the incidence of phlebitis.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In contrast, in 2012, a non-blind randomized controlled trial that included 214 research subjects was conducted in a teaching hospital in Italy.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Regardless of the numbers of patients or the number of catheters, the data analysis produced the findings, indicating that the utilization of HS as a catheter sealing solution resulted in catheter patency that was better than that obtained after the use of NS.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The benefits included the reduction in both the total and individual incidence of phlebitis and catheter obstruction.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>The American Association of Critical Care Nurses conducted an international survey on catheter sealing solutions in randomized samples (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1072).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Among the institutions surveyed, they reported that 77% of these institutions used HS for catheter sealing compared with 18% of institutions that used NS.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the remaining 5%, other diluents or solutions were employed for catheter sealing.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A survey revealed that in the study hospital, 88.7% of patients received heparinized saline as a flush fluid, whereas 11.3% received normal saline.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Although INS guidelines recommend using NS for catheter sealing,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> in China, there is a lack of guidelines or consensus on whether HS or NS is the optimal option as a flushing and locking solution.

Heparin sodium in glass bottles (2&#x02009;ml/12&#x000a0;500&#x02009;IU) were purchased from Nanjing Xinbai Pharmaceutical (Nanjing, China). NS in plastic bags (0.9%; 250&#x02009;ml/bag) were purchased from Cisen Pharmaceutical (Shandong, China). HS dilutions were formulated as follows: 2&#x02009;ml of heparin sodium (2&#x02009;ml/12&#x000a0;500&#x02009;IU) was withdrawn from the bottle using a 5-ml syringe and diluted in 250&#x02009;ml of NS. The HS solution (50&#x02009;IU/ml) was placed in a sterile tray and replaced every 4&#x02009;h. NS solutions were stored and replaced at the same time after opening, similar to that for HS.

Volumes of 3&#x02009;ml of 0.9% NS solution in the NS group and 3&#x02009;ml of 50&#x02009;IU/ml of HS solution in the HS group were used to seal the catheters using 5-ml syringes.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-0300060516685203"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The rate of catheter obstruction was regarded as the primary outcome in the investigation.

These students were not involved in PVC catheterization and extubation. Clinical nurses in the research wards recorded the basic patient information and PVC condition after the puncture, and the presence or absence of complications were also recorded in a timely manner for making decisions regarding extubation or PVC replacement. After extubation or PVC replacement, duration time, reason for extubation and condition of the complication were recorded for each patient. During their stay in the hospital, patients were monitored after the first indwelling puncture until PVC extubation or replacement. Further catheterization(s) (no more than five times altogether) were also investigated in this study.</p><p>In order to ensure the quality of the study data and maximize the validity and reliability of the conclusions drawn, clinical nurses were instructed to ask nurses specialized in intravenous therapy to help in the assessment of the complication and decide on the necessity of extubation, if they were not certain regarding the signs of phlebitis and catheter obstruction. This double assessment reduced the potential bias in the study.

The use of NS as a catheter locking solution did not increase catheter obstruction and did not increase the incidence of other complications. According to the above results, HS has no significant advantage, but it carries certain risk factors such as thrombocytopenia,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> haemorrhage<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and dosage errors caused by the HS dilution procedure.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thus, in order to avoid the adverse reactions of HS, this study supports using NS for catheter sealing. Performing NS catheter sealing is simple and convenient. It does not require solvent dilution, which facilitates the avoidance of dilution-related contamination during the procedure.</p><p>Although INS guidelines recommend the use of NS for catheter sealing,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> there are no guidelines or consensus for regulating the use HS or NS as a locking solution in China. The results of the present RCT indicate that the effects of NS used for catheter sealing are similar to those of HS, which is consistent with the recommendations of the INS guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>The results of this study reach the same conclusions as previous reports.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The median catheter duration time was 72 hours in both groups, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Moreover, there was a lower incidence of phlebitis in the NS group (37/317; 11.67%) compared with the HS group (43/292; 14.73%), but the difference was not statistically significant. For other complications, the NS group had a higher incidence of obstruction, infiltration, and accidental catheter removal compared with the HS group, but none of the differences were statistically significant. The usefulness of using HS as a catheter sealing solution has been questioned since the 1980s.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A study in 1992 demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the catheter sealing effect in surgical inpatients receiving HS and NS, while NS decreased the stimulation of blood vessels and reduced the incidence of phlebitis.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, two RCTs were conducted in 2011<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and 2007<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; and both reported that paediatric patients who received HS did not experience any significant catheter sealing benefit compared with paediatric patients who received NS.</p><p>This present study did not provide any evidence of significantly better catheter sealing effects and safety of HS compared with those of NS. However, many domestic studies in China have supported the use of HS as a catheter sealing solution.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr27-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In 2011, a meta-analysis performed in China evaluated the catheter sealing effects of NS and HS for peripheral venous catheterization.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The study included nine RCTs and a total of 1770 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The results indicated that HS, as a catheter sealing solution, had a better effect in reducing the rate of intravenous catheter obstruction than NS.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Used as a catheter sealing solution in paediatric patients, HS extended catheter retention time compared with NS.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, no significant difference in phlebitis prevention was noted between these two catheter sealing solutions.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the studies included in the Chinese meta-analysis did not specify the randomization methods and processes used; and they did not detail the reasons for sample loss.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not possible to completely rule out that the randomization processes used in the nine RCTs may have had an impact on the study outcomes.</p><p>This present RCT had several limitations. First, it did not monitor prothrombin time, because a previous study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in prothrombin time between NS and HS groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0300060516685203" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Future investigations that include the monitoring of prothrombin time would be necessary. Secondly, the present RCT employed an open-label design to reduce study costs. Thirdly, selection bias was difficult to completely exclude in this open-label study.</p><p>In conclusion, no significant differences in reducing the incidence of catheter obstruction and the other complications (e.g. phlebitis) between patients receiving NS and HS for catheter sealing were observed in this open-label RCT. As a result of these findings, NS is recommended as a sealing solution for PVCs, because it is safe, effective and easy to use. Moreover, NS is inexpensive and requires no configuration or a dilution step, as compared with HS; minimizing the workload of clinical nurses, the risk of contamination and the chances for error in dose configuration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the head nurses and all clinical nurses in the two wards for their support.
