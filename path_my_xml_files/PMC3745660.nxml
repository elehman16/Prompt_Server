A total of 1100 patients presented to the emergency endoscopy unit from January 2008 to December 2009 with hematemsis or melena, 600 of them were due to variceal bleeding. Out of these, 20 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were eligible for the study. Patients included were of either sex, aged from 18 years to 65 years, known to have chronic liver disease and presenting with acute ongoing variceal bleeding. The latter was defined as endoscopically proven ongoing (and/or spurting) active bleeding from esophageal varices. This included also the presence of cherry red spots as stigmata of variceal bleeding and or blood in the esophagus or stomach (verified by endoscopy) with exclusion of any other origin of the bleeding than from esophageal varices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Patients with end stage hepatic malignancy, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bleeding or active fundic variceal bleeding, patients participating in any other clinical trial in the preceding 3 months, pregnancy and/or breast-feeding patients were all excluded from the study. Patients with other contraindications for stent placement were excluded like patients with history of radiation therapy, esophageal strictures, tumors of the upper respiratory tract; esophagus or stomach and body weight under 40 kg. Informed and written consents were obtained for each patient after explaining the whole procedure and possible risks and complications. Four patients refused to participate in the study and therefore 16 patients were included.</p><p>All patients were exposed to the standards of care in emergency situations like vasoactive therapy (somatostatin), hemodynamic stabilization, and antibiotic treatment.

This study was designed to investigate the initial Egyptian experience with the safety and efficacy of using SEMS in the initial control of acute variceal bleeding. A secondary aim was the ability to convert an emergency situation to an elective one, where the patients were managed either by band ligation or sclerotherapy. We only included patients with active ongoing bleeding (that is defined as endoscopically proven ongoing (and/or spurting) active bleeding from esophageal varices).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] All patients were exposed to the standards of care in emergency situations and all of them underwent endoscopy within 12 hours from the onset of bleeding. Most of them exhibited poor prognosis as evidenced by ascites, advanced Child score, and low mean hemoglobin level.</p><p>The first 4 studies published about the use of SEMS in acute variceal bleeding Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>., Zehetner <italic>et al</italic>., Wright <italic>et al</italic>. and Dech&#x000ea;ne <italic>et al</italic>. had a small sample size except for Zehetner who had a study population of 39 patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] All of them concluded a favorable outcome regarding stent safety and efficacy. In our study, efficacy of the procedure as addressed by initial control of variceal bleeding was achieved in 87.50% patients. Failure to control bleeding was seen in 2 patients. Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>. and Dech&#x000ea;ne <italic>et al</italic>. reported intial control of bleeding in 100% of patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In the largest series of 39 patients reported, initial control of bleeding was in 97% of cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] On the other hand, Wright <italic>et al</italic>. reported initial control of bleeding in 7 (70%) of cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In that study, one patient (10%) had failure of stent deployment and in 2 (20.0%) patients, the source of bleeding originated from gastric varices. It is worth mentioning that this study protocol permitted stent deployment without index endoscopy.</p><p>All the adverse events encountered with SEMS such as dysphagia, chest pain, and hiccups were minimal and similar to those generally reported with other interventions such as band ligation and sclerotherapy. It is worth mentioning that patients were given the routine post-procedural care similar to that instructed to patients undergoing sclerotherapy or band ligation with the exception that these patients were additionally advised to maintain a semi-sitting position after meals.</p><p>Time counts in patients with acute variceal bleeding; we assume that introducing a new temporary technique as SEMS should address efficacy as well as ease and simplicity of its application. That is why we added the timing of endoscopy as an important entity to be addressed. The total time spent by the endcoscopist to put the stent was 10 (&#x000b1;6) mins. This time includes a standard of extra 3 mins spent after stent deployment (before the second check endoscopy) in order to allow full expansion of the stent and its optimal integration with the esophageal wall thus preventing stent migration. Furthermore, the growing experience with the stenting technique might have caused prolongation of time spent on that technique. None of the published studies reported the duration of stenting. In future, with better experience, stents may be applied in a relatively shorter time. Furthermore, the introduction of stents without the necessity of fluoroscopic guidance and without simultaneous endoscopic control adds to the simplicity of the technique.</p><p>In this study stents were removed using either a foreign body extractor or the specialized extractor. Wright <italic>et al</italic>. used the extractor in all his cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>. and Zehetner <italic>et al</italic>. didn&#x02019;t use the extractor for any of their cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In our experience removing the stent using the foreign body forceps is easier than the extractor. The stent is flexible, elongates as it is grasped by the forceps, its upper end tapers in a purse string fashion and is therefore extracted without trauma.</p><p>In the studies by Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>., Zehetner <italic>et al</italic>., Wright <italic>et al</italic>. and Dech&#x000ea;ne <italic>et al</italic>., they all reported small superficial ulcerations in the distal esophagus after stent extraction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] No other complications were reported. In our study, apart from indentation marks and trivial superficial ulcerations, a deep ulcer was observed in only one patient and was managed by conventional sucralfate, proton pump inhibition and oral fluids for 6 days followed by ulcer healing and with no reported ulcer bleeding.</p><p>As stated by De Franchis, bleeding related mortality is defined as bleeding within a time frame of 6 weeks after the onset of bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Four patients (25%) died, despite initial control of bleeding in 3 of them. Wright <italic>et al</italic>. 2010 reported a survival rate of 50% (5 patients out of 10), with only one related to bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>., Zehetner <italic>et al</italic>. and Dech&#x000ea;ne <italic>et al</italic>. reported no bleeding related mortalities in the patients. However, they didn&#x02019;t clarify in these studies the time-frame for the definition of bleeding-related mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Gastric extension was not an exclusion criterion to study enrollment. However, in one patient bleeding from a short gastric extension was linked to failure to control bleeding and later on mortality, this lead us to discourage the use of stents in the presence of gastric extensions.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Stent migration</title><p>Stent migration was by far the most common event related to stent insertion. Trying to minimize this incidence, we proposed delaying the second endoscopy (done to verify correct position of the stent) for 3 min; this is to give time for full stent expansion. All migrations except one (with partial proximal migration) were identified during the process of stent extraction. None of them were associated with re-bleeding. Hubmann <italic>et al</italic>., Zehetner <italic>et al</italic>. and Wright <italic>et al</italic>. reported 25%, 15% and 70% of cases of distal stent migration in their series. Similarly, none of them was associated with bleeding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to our experience, the use of SEMSs is a safe and effective means to control acute variceal bleeding. It can be used as a temporary procedure to control variceal bleeding as a bridge to the emergency situation till elective endoscopy is further arranged. Larger scale studies are recommended in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>D&#x02019;Amico</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Pagan</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Luca</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bosch</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatic vein pressure gradient reduction and prevention of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: A systematic review</article-title><source>Gastroenterology</source><year>2006</year><volume>131</volume><fpage>1611</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17101332</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jalan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>UK guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients.
