cerebral palsy (CP). Postural insoles can allow more efficient gait by improving
biomechanical alignment. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of postural
insoles on gait performance of children with CP classified as levels I or II of the Gross
Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). [Subjects and Methods] the study was a
randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial. After meeting the legal aspects and the
eligibility criteria, 10 children between four and 12&#x02005;years old were randomly divided into
a two groups: a control group (n=5), and an experimental group (n=5). Children in the
control group used a placebo insoles, and children in the experimental group used postural
insoles. Evaluation consisted of three-dimensional gait analysis under three conditions:
barefoot, shoes without insoles and shoes with postural insoles or shoes with placebo
insoles. [Results] Regarding the immediate effects of insole use, significant improvements
in gait velocity and cadence were observed in the experimental group in comparison to the
control group. [Conclusion] The use of postural insoles led to improvements in gait
velocity and cadence of the children with cerebral palsy classified as levels I or II of
the GMFCS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Orthoses</kwd><kwd>Postural insole</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a term to describe a permanent, mutable motor development disorders
stemming from a primary brain lesion that cause secondary musculoskeletal problems leading
to limitations in activities of daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor impairment is the main manifestation of cerebral palsy (CP),
and it has a consequent effect on the biomechanics of the body. Children with CP may also
exhibit cognitive, visual and hearing impairments, which, along with motor impairment, task
restrictions and environmental restrictions, have a negative effect on functional
performance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromotor impairment in this disease can involve different parts of the body, has led to
development of specific topographic classifications, such as quadriplegia, hemiplegia and
diplegia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, children with CP are
currently classified based on their degree of functional independence, which encompasses the
functions of the body, activities and social participation. The Gross Motor Function
Classification System (GMCFS) for Cerebral Palsy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> classifies children according to age (0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;6 and 6&#x02013;12 years)
and respective functional levels.</p><p>Three-dimensional gait analysis is used to assist in the functional characterization of
children with CP, allowing a detailed evaluation of kinetic and kinematic aspects of each
phase of the gait cycle. This form of analysis is an important tool in the evaluation of the
results of clinical interventions for CP sufferers, who have functional limitations due to
excessive muscle weakness and abnormalities in both joint kinematics and postural
reactions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Different therapeutic interventions have been employed in an attempt to favor selective
muscle control and coordination in children with CP. Lucarelli et al. <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the use of an ankle-foot orthosis assists with
gait improvement. In a systematic review of the influence of rigid and articulated orthoses,
Pasini Neto et al. <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported numerous
benefits are derived from the use of rigid orthoses. However, this type of orthosis is
directed at children with accentuated motor impairment, spasticity and contractures. On the
other hand, articulated orthoses offer the benefits of stability and freedom during gait,
raising the functional potential of children with CP.</p><p>The aim of postural insoles is to reorganize the tonus of the muscle chains and influence
body posture through correction reflexes. These insoles affect muscle proprioception and
lead to changes in the ascending proprioceptive chains<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Gagey and Weber<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, the stimulation of specific regions of the soles of the feet causes
a change in postural tonus, and repositions of the leveling of the pelvis and muscle
asymmetries along the spinal column. Postural reprogramming occurs when the mechanoreceptors
of the plantar region are activated by a deformation in the skin caused by the bars, wedges,
half-moons and shims incorporated into postural insoles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study of such postural insoles used by children with CP, the
kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic analyses revealed a reduction in plantar flexion as
well as better coordination between the tibialis and gastrocnemius muscles and improved
force distribution during the support phase<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The hypothesis guiding the present study was that postural insoles would generate a change
in sensory afference, stimulating a postural reaction which improves a gait performance.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of postural insoles on gait
performance of children with CP using the gait variables of cadence and velocity as the
primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was a preliminary randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial.
The study method was conducted, conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the Regulating Norms and Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects formulated by
the Brazilian National Health Council, Ministry of Health, established in October 1996. The
study received approval from the ethics committee of the Universidade Nove de Julho (Sao
Paulo, Brazil) under protocol number 436960/2011. All parents/guardians agreed to the
participation of the children by signing a statement of informed consent.</p><p>Twenty-five children were recruited and ten were selected based on the eligibility
criteria. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of spastic diplegic CP and classification
on levels of I or II of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). The
following were the exclusion criteria: surgical procedures or the administration of phenol
in the previous 12 months; neurolytic block in the previous six months; cognitive or visual
impairment that could have interfered with the performance of the procedures; and ankle
deformities that were non-reducible to neutral.</p><p>The participants were randomly allocated to two groups. The control group (CG) made use of
an insole without correction elements (placebo insole) and the experimental group (EG) made
use of an insole with correction elements (postural insole). Neither the children nor their
guardians were aware of the group to which the participants had been allocated; thus
conditions for a blind study for the placebo effect of the insole in the CG were satisfied.
During the randomization procedure, a set of sealed, opaque envelopes was used to ensure the
concealment of the allocation. Each envelop contained a card stipulating to which group the
child would be allocated.</p><p>The postural insoles used in the EG were composed of three layers. The aim of the surface
portion is to absorb sweat and provide comfort. The middle portion is made up of ethylene
vinyl acetate measuring 3&#x02005;mm in thickness. The lower portion is composed of material formed
by a weave of cotton fibers and resin measuring 1&#x02005;mm in thickness and contains wedges and
shims made of ethylene vinyl acetate<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The pieces used in the present study were half-moon and anti-valgus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Representation figure of the elements used in postural insoles A- half-moon; B- anti-valgus (Podaly<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1003-g001"/></fig>). The CG used placebo insole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>The representation of placebo insole used by the control group (Podaly<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-1003-g002"/></fig>).</p><p>Following the positioning of the pieces, the insoles were submitted to thermally molded to
fuse the different portions together.</p><p>The evaluation process was performed under three different conditions: 1) barefoot; 2)
wearing shoes without insoles; and 3) wearing shoes with placebo insole (CG) or postural
insoles (EG). The test order under the different conditions was randomly determined by lots
to avoid standardization of the behavior of the sample. The evaluation consisted of gait
analysis. The children were first shown the equipment and instructed on how to the
procedures would be carried out. A training session was then performed, simulating a regular
gait exam, but without data collection. In this, the children were instructed to walk
normally on a track demarcated on the floor measuring four meters in length and 90
centimeters in width that was marked on the floor. All the children wore bathing suits to
facilitate the placement of the markers. The markers were then fixed to the children in the
standing position, as suggested by Davis et al<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The markers were enveloped in adhesive tape lined with microscopic
glass spheres and attached to a plastic base with double-sided adhesive tape to the skin
allow better visualization by the infrared cameras. The equipment used for the gait
evaluation was the SMART-D 140<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system (BTS Engineering), with eight cameras
sensitive to the infrared spectrum. The images were processed using the same system. The
gait cycle was determined from the moment of initial contact of one foot (foot strike)
through to the foot strike of the second foot and toe-off of the first foot until the second
foot strike of the first foot (one complete stride). The children were instructed to walk
along the demarcated track six times for the data collection. This procedure was performed
under the three different conditions (barefoot, wearing shoes without insoles and wearing
shoes with postural insoles or placebo insoles). The researcher in charge of this phase of
the study was unaware of the group to which each child belonged (double-blind trial).</p><p>For data involving the analysis of the right and left legs (step length and stride length),
means were calculated and used in the statistical analysis. The data were first submitted to
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if they were normally distributed. As data were
parametric, the results were expressed as means and standard deviations or 95% confidence
intervals. The effect size was calculated considering the mean difference of between the
results obtained for the participants wearing shoes with postural insole. The independent
t-test was used for the inter-group analysis. Repeated-measure ANOVA was used for the
intra-group analysis under each condition. A p-value of &#x02264; 0.05 was considered significant.
The data were organized and tabulated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS v.19.0).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Among the 25 children recruited for the present study, thirteen children did not meet the

on temporal gait variables when the use of postural insoles were worn by children with CP.
However, the inter-group analysis revealed significant differences only with regard to
cadence and velocity.</p><p>A number of authors have demonstrated the importance of analyzing temporal gait variables
in children with CP<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Redekop, Andrysek and
Wright<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed computerized gait
analysis with regard to functional level on relation to the GMFCS and found adequate to
excellent reliability considering temporal, spatial and kinematic variables of the pelvis,
hip, knee and ankle.</p><p>According to Abel and Damiano<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>,
spatiotemporal variables reflect the end result of small adjustments and adaptations. Thus,
the positive results in the analysis of the effect demonstrated in <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, although individually not statistically significant,
reflect the significant increases in gait velocity and cadence when taken together.
According to Morita et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, enhanced
gait efficiency is directly related to an increase in velocity, and children with CP used an
increase in cadence as their main strategy for increasing velocity. This observation may
explain the findings of our present study, in which significant changes were only found with
regard to cadence and velocity.</p><p>Healthy children show greater spatiotemporal variables are found thant those with CP.
According to Holt et al. <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, healthy
four-year-olds have mean cadence and velocity values of 152 steps/min and 0.99 m/s,
respectively. In the present study, mean cadence when barefoot and wearing shoes without
insoles was 111 and 87 steps/min, respectively, and immediately increased to 124 steps/min
when using the postural insoles were worn, allowing the children with CP achieve a cadence
closer to the cadence demonstrated by healthy children. Likewise, mean velocity when
barefoot and wearing shoes without insoles was 0.89 and 0.83 m/s, respectively, and
increased significantly to 0.98 m/s when using the postural insoles, allowing the children
with CP to nearly reach the reference value for velocity of healthy children described by
Holt et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> (0.99 m/s).</p><p>It should be stressed that the present study offers preliminary findings on the effects of
postural insoles on the gait of children with CP. Considering the mean velocity of 0.98 m/s
(standard deviation: 0.13 m/s) in the EG and 0.84 m/s (standard deviation: 0.17 m/s) in the
CG, giving for a bi-directional alpha of 0.05 and an 80% test power, 12 children per group
would be needed to determine the effects of postural insoles more specifically in this
population. Thus, our research group is currently preparing a study with an adequate sample
size, three-dimensional gait analysis, and an assessment of function in children with
CP.</p><p>The use of postural insoles led to improvements in gait performance (velocity and cadence)
in children with cerebral palsy classified as levels I or II of the GMFCS.</p><p>The present investigation is a preliminary study and did not perform kinetic or kinematic
analyses of the gait cycle and did not compare the effect of postural insoles with different
types of orthosis during gait. Thus, further studies are needed along this line of
research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
