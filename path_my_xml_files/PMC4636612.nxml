Secondary prevention is multifaceted, including pharmaceutical interventions to manage blood pressure and cholesterol and interventions to change behaviour and lifestyle. Health systems in developed countries now invest considerable, and recurrent, resources in cardiac secondary prevention.</p><p>General practice plays an important role in secondary prevention. Two systematic reviews of cardiac secondary prevention programmes have demonstrated improved process (eg, cholesterol management) and outcome (eg, mortality).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, both noted that there was some evidence of a &#x02018;ceiling effect&#x02019; whereby interventions have a diminishing beneficial effect once certain levels of risk marker management are reached. Clark <italic>et</italic>
<italic>al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and McAlister <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> also recommended a rigorous evaluation of long-term clinical and economic outcomes.</p><p>An important contributor to the first review was our own SPHERE cluster randomised controlled trial. We found that a complex 18-month intervention with tailored plans for general practices and patients, which aimed to improve outcomes for patients with CHD, resulted in significantly reduced hospital admissions but showed no other benefits, possibly because of a ceiling effect. The current follow-up study is intended to contribute to an ongoing systematic review of long-term follow-up studies of primary care organisational interventions for the secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>We now report follow-up of the SPHERE participants after 6&#x02005;years to first determine if the positive impact of our 18-month intervention on hospital admissions for patients with established CHD persisted and, second, to determine the long-term impact on mortality and on blood pressure and cholesterol control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We reported full details of recruitment, randomisation and the intervention previously.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Briefly, in 2004&#x02013;2005, we recruited 48 randomly selected general practices in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In each practice, patients with established CHD, determined by documented myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, angioplasty or angina (confirmed by exercise stress test, isotope test or coronary angiogram), were identified. Patients with a major mental or physical illness that would impair their ability to take part in the intervention (as determined by the general practitioner (GP)) were excluded. Randomly selected eligible patients were invited to participate and were asked to return study postal questionnaires. Following baseline data collection, practices were randomised to intervention and control by an individual independent of the research team.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of: (1) tailored practice plans (action plans for practices were developed and reviewed; practices received a regular SPHERE study newsletter); (2) two training sessions for practitioners in medication prescribing and behavioural change; (3) tailored patient care plans (patient information booklet provided; patients identified one aspect of secondary prevention to focus on; goals and action plans developed; progress reviewed) and (4) regular patient recall system established where patients were invited to consult with the GP or practice nurse every 4&#x02005;months. The intervention was developed on the basis of a review of the literature and psychological theory, mainly social cognitive theory, and modelled following qualitative research and piloting.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Control practices continued with usual care<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and, following the intervention period, all supports from the research team to intervention practices ceased.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Follow-up</title><p>In 2012, 6&#x02005;years after randomisation, we traced the original participants through their general practices and obtained their consent to collect data from their practice records. For those who had moved practice within Ireland, we made every attempt to follow them to their new practices. Patients who moved abroad were lost to follow-up.</p><p>From the practice records, research nurses collected data on risk factors, medication prescribing, hospital admissions and length of stay and on coronary events and procedures. Owing to resource limitations, only four of the five research nurses were blinded to the group allocation. Blood pressure and cholesterol data recorded in the practice records within 12&#x02005;months of the end of the follow-up period were accepted.</p><p>For those who had died, we censored their data at the point of death and obtained confirmation of the cause of death from the General Registry Office (Republic of Ireland) or from the practice records (Northern Ireland). This study was approved by the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Office of the Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was hospital admissions from practice records. These were calculated for both all cause and cardiovascular related. An admission was attributed to a cardiovascular cause only if a cardiovascular diagnosis or procedure was stated as a primary reason for an admission. Secondary outcomes included mortality and blood pressure and cholesterol control. Mortality was also calculated for both all cause and cardiovascular related. A death was attributed to a cardiac cause only if the primary cause of death was cardiac. Lack of control was defined as follows: systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;140&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e;90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and cholesterol level &#x0003e;5.0&#x02005;mmol/L.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Sample size</title><p>Detailed sample size calculations for the original trial are described elsewhere.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We achieved the original intended sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The design employed was that of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial with inpatient hospital admissions, a count variable, as the primary response.</p><p>Initially, a Poisson regression model was used. Since many participants had no admissions in a given time period, two approaches were then used to adjust for overdispersion: a zero inflated Poisson regression model and a Hurdle model. All models incorporated random effects for clustering in the data due to randomisation by general practice and for the correlation due to the repeated measurements for each individual across time. The Hurdle model<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> splits the problem into two parts: initially, the presence and absence of admissions are modelled using a logistic component and then the mean count, for those with at least one admission, is modelled using a (truncated) Poisson regression. Therefore, whether a hospital admission occurs is considered first, followed by then describing the mean number of admissions observed. We only report the results of the logistic component of the Hurdle model in this paper; the zero inflated Poisson regression gave similar conclusions (data available from authors). There were no baseline data on cardiovascular admissions, so the total hospital admissions were used as a proxy based on the assumption that the proportion of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular admissions was the same in the intervention and control groups before baseline.</p><p>Linear and non-linear mixed models, which accounted for missing values, were used to model the variability in continuous (eg, blood pressure) and categorical (eg, proportions outside secondary prevention guidelines) responses, using prespecified variables (GP cluster, baseline response, practice size, practice location, age, gender, years since diagnosis and conditions at baseline: angina, MI, CABG, PTCA and diabetes). The log rank test was used to compare survival distributions. All analyses were carried out using R (2.15), using the nlme, lme4, glmmADMB, ggplot2 and survival libraries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015007807TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows that characteristics of the 48 practices and the 903 participants enrolled in the original SPHERE study were well balanced at baseline, apart from occupational status and educational level.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015007807TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the practices and patients at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/><col align="char" char=" " span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention number (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control number (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Practice factors</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Number of practices</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">&#x02003;Practice size</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x0003c;2 whole time equivalents</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (47)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (53)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02265;2 whole time equivalents</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (52)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (48)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Region</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Northern Ireland</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (33)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (33)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;Republic of Ireland</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (67)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (67)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Patient factors</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Number of patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">444</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">459</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Men</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">312 (70)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">321 (70)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (SD) age (years)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.5 (9.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5 (9.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (SD) years since diagnosis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.3 (6.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2 (6.5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Myocardial infarction</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">220 (50)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">233 (51)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Angina</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">390 (88)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">414 (90)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Diabetes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78 (17.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82 (17.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Coronary artery bypass grafting</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">114 (25.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">124 (27.1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;PTCA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">126 (28.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">149 (32.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Eligible for General Medical Scheme*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">234 (82.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">218 (73.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Married</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">288 (67)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">315 (70)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Manual occupation&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">134 (42)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">172 (51)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Completed secondary education&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">179 (42)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">145 (33)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Physiological variables</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (SD) systolic blood pressure (mm&#x02005;Hg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">136.2 (22.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">136.8 (21.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure (mm&#x02005;Hg)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.4 (12.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.5 (11.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (SD) total cholesterol (mmol/L)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.40 (0.90)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.34 (0.92)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Republic of Ireland only.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> it may be that with improved secondary cardiac risk profiles for both individuals and the general population, a ceiling has now been reached.

Policymakers need to continue to assess the effectiveness of previously efficacious programmes. From an economic perspective, the additional cost of delivering the intervention for 18&#x02005;months was offset by the savings generated from reduced hospital admissions, leading to an overall reduction in healthcare costs relative to control at 18&#x02005;months with no impact on patient health status.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Ongoing analysis for our upcoming paper on the cost-effectiveness of the SPHERE intervention at 6&#x02005;years will provide further insight on this question.</p><p>The ongoing effects of incentivising or supporting interventions need to be balanced with a consideration of the opportunity costs for such incentives.

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Research is needed into the potential benefit of intermittent incentives or support for interventions using some sort of &#x02018;turn on, turn off&#x02019; approach based on regular assessments of programme or incentive effects.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation to this study is that common to all trial follow-up studies: crossover between the intervention and control practices, in terms of the management of secondary prevention, could have occurred on study cessation at 18&#x02005;months. We simply do not know whether intervention practices ceased to provide the intervention, or control practices introduced similar approaches, or a mixture of both. This potentially could result in a significant difference being missed at the follow-up point and a type II error.
