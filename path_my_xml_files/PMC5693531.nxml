This programme, titled the Kusamala Program, aims to improve developmental and nutritional outcomes in children with SAM. Up to six primary caregivers and their children will be enrolled to groups each week, which will be randomly allocated to intervention or comparison arms. The intervention package consists of interactive counselling on three modules: 1) nutrition and feeding; 2) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and 3) psychosocial stimulation. Data collection will be performed at enrolment, at discharge from hospital, and at 6 months following discharge. The primary outcome is child development assessed with the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT), a validated measure of gross and fine motor, language, and social development.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This intervention programme is unique because it utilizes primary caregivers&#x02019; time spent in-hospital while children receive treatment for SAM.

Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is one type of malnutrition that manifests in two forms: marasmus, identified by severe wasting; and kwashiorkor, characterized by the presence of bilateral pitting oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Morbidities such as pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or diarrheal disease often complicate effective management of SAM and are associated with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Children with SAM are often admitted to hospital due to serious illness rather than malnutrition alone. Mortality in hospitalized children with SAM can be up to 35% even when World Health Organization (WHO) protocols are followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>SAM and child development</title><p id="Par19">Although most children survive episodes of SAM, there are limited studies that have examined long-term outcomes of SAM such as child growth and development. Children with SAM are known to be susceptible to nutritional problems such as growth faltering, and are hypothesized to have poor motor and cognitive outcomes due to maturation of the brain being constrained in malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The implications of impaired child development are major at the individual level due to reduced intellectual and physical capacity. The most prominent study on development in children with SAM was performed in a small cohort by Grantham-McGregor et al. beginning in 1975 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Results of this study suggested that children with SAM have long-term developmental delay compared to non-malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This can ultimately translate to decreased national-level economic progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In-patient treatment guidelines for SAM</title><p id="Par20">In-patient hospital treatment is required for children with SAM that have: 1) severe bilateral pitting oedema; 2) severe wasting with any bilateral pitting oedema or medical complications; 3) medical complications with any bilateral pitting oedema; or 4) no appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The duration of treatment is generally between 1 and 2 weeks. The WHO <italic>Guidelines for the inpatient treatment of severely malnourished children</italic> include instructions to provide an environment that is stimulating for children during their treatment and support for primary caregivers, as well as preparation for follow-up after discharge from hospital with basic instructions for care of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Despite the promotion of psychosocial stimulation by the WHO, a recently published systematic review clearly outlines the need for scientific evidence behind the provision of psychosocial stimulation for children with SAM to improve developmental and nutritional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Only two trials, one in Jamaica by Grantham-McGregor et al. described previously and a second in Bangladesh, examined the effects of stimulation activities for children during hospital treatment of SAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the Jamaican study, children with SAM were enrolled to either an intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21), receiving psychosocial stimulation 6 days per week in hospital and continuing weekly then bi-weekly over 3 years after hospital discharge, or to a comparison group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These children were compared to non-malnourished controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study, as well as the Bangladesh study, reported that psychosocial stimulation could help to recover some of the deficits in development in children with SAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some of the limitations of these studies were a small sample size and a high likelihood for selection, reporting, and attrition bias. In addition, the developmental tools used were not locally standardized and the types of interventions tested in both studies are unlikely to be feasible in most resource-constrained settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial and intervention rationale</title><p id="Par22">In order to justify the implementation of psychosocial interventions for children with SAM, further research is needed.

It will be a pragmatic trial aimed at replicating how this type of intervention could be delivered in a real nutrition rehabilitation unit (NRU) setting and its effectiveness in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The primary outcome is child development, which will be assessed using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT), a locally adapted and validated tool for evaluating multiple domains of child development (i.e. gross motor, fine motor, language, and social domains) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The design of the study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial (superiority design) that will be conducted at the Moyo NRU of the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi (NCT03072433). A cluster-randomized controlled trial design was selected because the intervention is most feasible if delivered to groups of primary caregivers rather than individual caregivers. This design will also prevent temporal overlap between the two study arms: 1) an intervention arm of primary caregivers and children with SAM participating in an intervention programme; and 2) the comparison arm of primary caregivers and children with SAM receiving standard care. All other clinical and nutritional aspects of care will be equivalent; children will be treated per hospital protocol and WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One day of each week will be used to recruit and enrol an estimated average of four primary caregiver-child pairs. Once formed, the group will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or comparison arm. Recruitment and enrolment will not overlap with the delivery of intervention sessions, although it is possible that children from different groups will be in the NRU at the same time depending on the duration of their in-patient treatment.</p><p id="Par29">An internal pilot study (exploratory design) will be conducted within the full randomized trial and will reflect the design of the full trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The internal pilot study will include at least the first 15 primary caregiver-child pairs recruited to each arm, for a minimum of 30 primary caregiver-child pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As there are few previous trials evaluating long-term development in children with SAM, this internal pilot study will inform the design of the larger randomized control trial by estimating the variance of MDAT scores. This will allow for a more accurate sample size calculation. The internal pilot study will also establish the adherence and engagement rates of participants to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participant recruitment and enrolment</title><p id="Par30">Children admitted to hospital with complicated SAM and their primary caregivers will be recruited at the NRU after being screened for eligibility within 3 days of admission to the NRU (<italic>&#x02013;t</italic>

Nutritional messages and materials for children above 2 years of age have been added since these UNICEF materials focus on infants and young children. Furthermore, there will be an additional emphasis on prevention and early identification of malnutrition.</p><p id="Par50">For the psychosocial stimulation module on the third day of the intervention, the WHO Care for Child Development Package will be used to promote sensitive and responsive caregiving for age- or ability-appropriate play and communication activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Psychosocial stimulation is an integral component of the Kusamala Program. For this reason, primary caregivers and their children are also involved in 45 min of supervised and interactive play on each of the 4 days after the counselling sessions. A basket of play items is available in the NRU for children and primary caregivers to use during the play sessions. There are traditional Malawian toys, including small drums, rattles, and shakers, in addition to &#x0201c;Western&#x0201d; toys, such as colourful stacking blocks. Primary caregivers can also make their own toys such as shakers by adding beans or bottle caps to empty plastic jars available in the basket. Nurses supervise these sessions and actively encourage primary caregivers to engage in play and communication activities appropriate for the age and stage of development of their children.</p><p id="Par51">Four behaviour change techniques including information, materials, media, and performance have been integrated into the Kusamala Program.

Firstly, nurses use a flipbook with coloured images to provide information to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Primary caregivers will be given: two take-home images of nutrition and WASH messages, respectively (i.e. media); a toy that is appropriate for their child&#x02019;s stage of development (i.e. materials); and a certificate of completion of the Kusamala Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

However, nurses will not be involved in the same interactive psychosocial stimulation sessions in which participants in the intervention groups partake. Participants will not be counselled about the importance of play; primary caregivers will not be advised which toys are appropriate and the play sessions will not be supervised. Having primary caregivers and children go to the back bay also acts as a method of blinding study personnel and participants so they are unaware of the allocation.</p><p id="Par53">At the time of discharge from the NRU, nurses counsel primary caregivers on nutrition and WASH for an estimated 15 min.

This study is the first to examine the developmental and nutritional outcomes of a combined psychosocial stimulation, WASH, and nutrition programme in children with SAM. This type of intervention is highly relevant due to a growing focus on policy to improve child health, growth, and development, as indicated by the Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, and 4, on reducing malnutrition, improving health and well-being, and promoting learning opportunities so children can achieve developmental milestones, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">The Kusamala Program aims to improve outcomes in children with SAM by giving primary caregivers the knowledge and skills to enhance the care for their children. The Kusamala Program is unique in that it is a hospital-based intervention that matches the average minimum duration of in-patient treatment of SAM. In addition to ascertaining the effectiveness of the Kusamala Program to improve participant outcomes, this trial will also examine participant engagement and adherence and delivery of the Kusamala Program.</p><p id="Par80">Although the Kusamala Program will first be implemented and evaluated in an NRU, the programme is novel and can also be adapted by other end-users for integration of psychosocial stimulation, nutrition, and WASH materials so that comprehensive programmes could be delivered in various contexts around the world such as refugee camps or other types of paediatric in-patient wards.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par81">One potential limitation of the Kusamala Program is that it was designed to account for potential short lengths of hospital stay of study participants, and therefore does not cover all information in detail from the original counselling packages from the WHO and UNICEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Certain key messages were selected to be emphasized for the target population, yet not all topics will be covered because of these time constraints. A more complete intervention package of longer duration would potentially show greater improvements in developmental and nutritional outcomes; however, to reiterate, one of the benefits of the Kusamala Program is its feasibility and applicability for implementation in low-resource NRU settings.</p><p id="Par82">Potential delays to the study are possible due to unforeseen circumstances that can suspend or extend the duration of the study. If there is a major event that delays the study, it is possible to postpone enrolment without causing disruption to the design or results. In this case, it would be important to still ensure that there is a 6-month period between discharge and follow-up for each group of the study to ascertain the effectiveness of the Kusamala Program as per the study protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par83">The Kusamala Program was designed with the goal of improving developmental and nutritional outcomes in children with SAM. This cluster-randomized controlled trial is a methodologically sound approach to assessing the effectiveness of this intervention programme. By also examining implementation outcomes, including fidelity and participant engagement and adherence, delivery of the intervention and receptiveness of participants to the intervention, respectively, will also be recognized. If results from this cluster-randomized controlled trial are encouraging, the Kusamala Program can be adapted and implemented in other SAM treatment centres and beyond to reach as many primary caregivers and children as possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par84">Recruitment of participants started on 28 November 2016 and is expected to continue until mid-2019.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par91">
