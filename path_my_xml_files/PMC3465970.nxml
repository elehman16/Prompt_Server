Background </title><p>
For almost 2 decades, CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has been widely used in laparoscopic surgery. In contrast, insufflation with room air has remained the standard of care in the vast majority of endoscopy centers in both Europe and North America. Unfortunately, many patients still experience pain and discomfort after colonoscopy with room air insufflation. Studies [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and one review [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] indicate that insufflation with CO<sub>2</sub> can reduce periprocedural pain in different endoscopic settings (e.g., endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], balloon enteroscopy [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and endoscopic submucosal dissection [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). However, in the setting of colonoscopy, current scientific data with regard to the safety of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation are limited. Small patient populations have characterized most studies, including those with sedated patients, and many physicians remain concerned that CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation might lead to CO<sub>2</sub> retention. In a previous randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial, we randomly allocated 219 patients to colonoscopy with CO<sub>2</sub> versus room air, patients in the CO<sub>2</sub> group experienced significantly less pain and bloating and a higher overall satisfaction score [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, this study was not designed to definitively demonstrate the safety of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in colonoscopy. In the present study, we sought to prospectively assess the safety of CO<sub>2</sub> colonoscopy in a larger sample of patients. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Patients and Methods </title><p>This trial included all 109 patients from our previous CO<sub>2</sub> colonoscopy study [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] plus 238 subsequent, consecutive, nonselected, patients who had a routine colonoscopy performed in a private Swiss gastroenterology practice and were enrolled from April 2008 through September 2008. All patients who were deemed medically fit for an ambulatory colonoscopy were included in this study. In order to maximize the generalizability (external validity) of our study, we did not initially apply exclusion criteria, although one exclusion criterion emerged (due to a small earlap, CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was not possible in 4 patients, which were excluded). All colonoscopies were done by the first author (M. G.) and carried out with standard Pentax endoscopes (EC-3885K and EC-380FKp) (Pentax Medical, Pentax of America, Inc., Montvale, NJ, USA) with an EPK 1000 processor. For CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation, the CO<sub>2</sub>-Efficent Insufflator device (EZEM Company, Westbury, NY, USA) was used. The insufflator was connected to a 10-litre CO<sub>2</sub> bottle and supplied over a tubing set connected with a branch connection to the water bottle tube, which was itself directly connected to the endoscope. The flow rate (basal flow rate 0.5&#x02009;L/min, increasing to 3&#x02009;L/min maximum) can be controlled on demand over the standard air valve. Oxygen was delivered to patients if the saturation dropped below 90% at a flow rate of 4 liters per minute.</p><p>All but 2 patients were sedated with propofol using standard procedures previously described [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The total dose of propofol was registered for later analysis. A level of conscious sedation (&#x0201c;moderate sedation&#x0201d;) was targeted. All patients were routinely monitored with transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> measurement on the ear, with the exception of those patients who were excluded due to insufficient earlap (<italic>n</italic> = 4). CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was performed with the SenTec capnograph (SenTec AG, 4106 Therwil, Switzerland) as described by Heuss et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our measurement technique followed that recommended by SenTec; internal validation was not performed as the system has been previously extensively validated [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Sensors were calibrated according to mandatory procedure and placed on the earlap after cleaning with 70% isopropyl alcohol solution and application of contact liquid on the sensor membrane.</p><p>In previous validation studies, correlation of partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (paCO<sub>2</sub>) and transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was as follows: <italic>r</italic> = 0.92; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.92; for arterial saturation of oxygen (SaO<sub>2</sub>/SpO<sub>2</sub>), <italic>r</italic> = 0.74; ICC = 0.73 [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Data for continuous transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> measurements were analyzed, as were baseline characteristics including age, propofol use, and CO<sub>2</sub> volume administered. To ensure validity of our measurements, we analyzed and compared the 238 consecutive patients separately, with the 109 patients derived from our earlier CO<sub>2</sub> study using an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test. Additionally the correlation of the insufflated amount of CO<sub>2</sub> with a possible increase of transcutaneously measured CO<sub>2</sub> was assessed using Spearman correlations. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, v. 11.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results </title><p>The first sample of 109 patients who received CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation for colonoscopy was drawn from our previous study, which was conducted from April to June of 2008. All subsequent patients referred for colonoscopy at this single practice were routinely examined with CO<sub>2</sub>, with the result that from June 2008 through September 2008, an additional 238 patients (second sample) were examined using CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation, for a final study population of 347. Of the 347 patients examined, 198 (57%) were female; the mean (SD) age was 60 years (12.8). Mean (SD) propofol dosage was 136&#x02009;mg (64) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>); mean (SD) duration of endoscopy procedures was 24 minutes (7.5). All but 2 patients in the second sample were sedated. Mean (SD) value for baseline CO<sub>2</sub> measurement was 34.7&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (5). Mean (SD) pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> recorded reaching the ileum was 38.9&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (5) and 36.9&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (5) at the end of the examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mean maximum increase of CO<sub>2</sub> pressure was 4.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). </p><p>Four patients in the second sample experienced transient pCO<sub>2</sub> values in excess of 50&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (three when reaching the ileum and one at the end of the examination), but these patients showed no signs of respiratory distress or O<sub>2</sub> desaturation and O<sub>2</sub> substitution was not deemed necessary. These four patients did not receive a higher propofol dosage or volume of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflated. </p><p>Among the total study sample, no correlation was observed between volume of CO<sub>2</sub> administered and an increase of CO<sub>2</sub> (correlation coefficient: 0.01; <italic>P</italic>-value: 0.84) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Parameters did not significantly differ between the first and second samples. None of the patients required ventilation or mechanical airway support, and no other complications (bleeding, perforation, loss of consciousness, hospital admission) were observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The present prospective study, which was based on one of the largest sample of sedated patients to date, provides compelling evidence that CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation colonoscopy is safe and is not associated with an increase in transcutaneously measured CO<sub>2</sub> or with adverse respiratory effects. Our findings add to mounting scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and superiority of CO<sub>2</sub> colonoscopy over room air [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given these findings, we believe that CO<sub>2</sub> colonoscopy should be considered the procedure of choice. </p><p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation has been used for different endoscopic procedures [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and was found to be associated with less postprocedural pain and bloating [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], most endoscopy units continue to use room air for screening colonoscopies and are unaware of the benefits of this relatively new technique [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. </p><p>In our first double-blinded randomized study&#x02014;hitherto the largest reported sample of sedated and CO<sub>2</sub> monitored patients&#x02014;239 patients were randomly allocated in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to colonoscopy with CO<sub>2</sub> versus room air. This study, which represented the first examination of sedated, unselected, and consecutive patients in this setting, yielded encouraging results: no difference in transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> values was observed with continuous capnography between groups, and there was no evidence of advanced hypercapnia as a possible problem with this technique [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, we felt that this initial experience from our group needed to be confirmed in a study with larger sample size. By incorporating patients randomized to CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in that previous study and an additional 238 consecutive patients, we achieved an even larger patient population, providing compelling evidence for the safety of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in sedated and monitored patients undergoing colonoscopy. Only 4 patients experienced a partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in excess of 50&#x02009;mm Hg (max. paCO<sub>2</sub> 52.8&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg). </p><p>Our study shows that sedated patients had a small increase in CO<sub>2</sub> during colonoscopy until the terminal ileum was reached, after which CO<sub>2</sub> levels fell. We speculate from these observations that sedation per se, but not CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in particular, appears to be the primary cause of the observed CO<sub>2</sub> increase during colonoscopy. </p><p>Many patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience CO<sub>2</sub> retention, an inherent phenomenon of this disease. Until now, no studies have been performed to assess whether CO<sub>2</sub> is also safe to use in this high-risk population. But although COPD patients included in our study suffered no relevant adverse outcomes, they constituted only a small percentage of the study population and larger studies of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in patients with COPD should be performed to confirm its safety in this subset of patients.</p><p>A particularly noteworthy finding of this study is the lack of correlation between volume of insufflated CO<sub>2</sub> and the increase of CO<sub>2</sub> as measured by transcutaneous monitoring. Because CO<sub>2</sub> is very quickly exhaled, paCO<sub>2</sub> never reached clinically toxic value. It might be influenced more by individual factors not yet fully understood than by the amount of insufflated CO<sub>2</sub>. </p><p>Because CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed into the bloodstream 150 times faster than room air and also exhaled with an elimination of 0.2&#x02009;L per minute [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], higher volumes of gas (e.g., 51&#x02009;L [&#x000b1;14&#x02009;L]) are usually needed when using CO<sub>2</sub> for colonoscopy insufflation, compared with room air [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some physicians who are already using CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation for colonoscopy believe that briefly switching from CO<sub>2</sub> to room air to obtain a faster and better colonic distension can be useful in certain circumstances. This may be due to the fact that the flow rates of all commercial available CO<sub>2</sub> insufflators are still below the usual rates achieved with air insufflators. </p><p>From a practical point of view, there are no clinically relevant problems in handling CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation with modern insufflators; further, we believe that no safety concerns remain in patients devoid of COPD. </p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion </title><p>The present prospective study, which was based on one of the largest sedated patient sample reported to date, provides compelling evidence that colonoscopy with CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation is safe in patients devoid of COPD. Neither a relevant increase in transcutaneously measured CO<sub>2</sub> nor adverse respiratory effects were detected. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Jonathan McCall, M.
