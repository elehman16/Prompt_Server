However, large doses of bupivacaine are relatively toxic and even moderate plasma concentrations can cause catastrophic cardiotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Ropivacaine is a new amino amide long acting local anesthetic similar in structure to bupivacaine. Ropivacaine is prepared as the S-enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture such as bupivacaine. The previous studies involving the isomers of local anesthetics suggest that the systemic toxicity of the S-enantiomer of various compounds may be lesser than that of racemic preparations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Pharmacologic studies in intact animals indicate that ropivacaine possesses an anesthetic profile similar to that of bupivacaine, but with lower cardiotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Ropivacaine also produces cutaneous vasoconstriction that restricts the systemic absorption of the drug and increases its local duration of action. Moreover, ropivacaine produces anti-inflammatory activity that may further reduce pain when administered locally.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Ropivacaine offers some advantages over bupivacaine, for example, less cardiac and neurological toxicity, less motor blockade, and prolonged sensory analgesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Both bupivacaine and ropivacaine have been shown to provide analgesia with wound infiltration in the first 3&#x02013;6 h after hernia repair.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Many patients either refuse neuraxial anesthesia or pose a high risk in view of comorbidities. In this group supplementing general anesthesia with local site infiltration preoperatively will help to reduce the intraoperative requirements, as well as provide the much needed postoperative pain relief. Ropivacaine being a long-acting drug as well as having vasoconstrictor and anti-inflammatory properties may well suit this purpose.</p><p>This study was designed to compare the intraoperative requirements and postoperative pain relief with preoperative infiltration of ropivacaine with bupivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was registered with Clinical Trial Registration of India (CTRI registration number: CTRI/2014/07/004789). This study was approved by scientific advisory and Institute Ethics Committee (letter number SEC/2011/4/49 dated February 02, 2012). A power analysis based on 95% confidence interval with 80% power and with the mean difference in the visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 5 h of 5 as being significant the sample size of 30 in each group was sufficient.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] After obtaining written informed consent, 90 patients were enrolled for the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II and those between the age groups 18 to 70, undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia, were included in the study. The patients with a known allergy to local anesthetics were excluded from the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT statement for the present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-71-g001"/></fig><p>A standard induction protocol consisting of intravenous (i.v.) propofol 1.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was used.

After skin preparation, a 22 gauge needle was blunted and was inserted perpendicular to the skin. Increased resistance was met as the needle encountered the external oblique muscle. A loss of resistance was appreciated once the needle passed through the muscle to lie between external oblique and the internal oblique. After the initial loss of resistance and negative needle aspiration for blood, 5 mL of local anesthetic was injected. The needle was then inserted further to encounter another resistance, which was the internal oblique muscle. A further loss of resistance was appreciated once the needle passed through the internal oblique to lie between internal oblique and the transversus abdominus muscle. After the second loss of resistance, another 5 ml of local anesthetic was administered. Then 5 ml of local anesthetic was given on either side of the site of skin incision.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Parameters studied</title><p>Intraoperatively, heart rate and mean arterial pressures were recorded every 15 min until the end of surgery and at the time of skin incision, at the time of cord pulling, and at the time of skin closure. Intraoperative increases in heart rate or mean arterial pressure 20% from the baseline was treated with fentanyl 25 &#x000b5;g and total fentanyl requirement in all the three groups were noted. Patients were reversed after the return of spontaneous respiratory efforts. Postoperatively, rest pain, pain on coughing, and pain on movements were assessed using VAS score immediately after the end of the surgery and then every 1 h up to 6 h. The time of the first request for rescue analgesia was noted and rescue analgesia was provided with injection tramadol 1 mg/kg i.v. on demand or when VAS score more than 5 whichever was earlier.

In our study, a total of 90 patients scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair were randomized into three groups - Group R 0.5, group R 0.25, and group B 0.25. None of the patients was excluded from the study after enrolment. All patients received either bupivacaine or ropivacaine as local infiltration. Though various studies have shown wound infiltration with local anesthetics to provide superior analgesia, the results are contradictory.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Few studies proved that local infiltration prior to skin incision is better than skin infiltration after the surgery.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, ropivacaine was used in concentration of 5 mg/ml (0.5%) and 2.5 mg/ml (0.25%) and bupivacaine in a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml (0.25%). A fixed volume of 20 ml was used for infiltration in all the three groups, whereas in the studies by Erichsen <italic>et al</italic>. and Pettersson <italic>et al</italic>. A volume of 40&#x02013;50 ml was used to provide pain relief after inguinal hernia repair.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The results from our study show that a volume of 20 ml was sufficient to provide effective analgesia, as evidenced from lower VAS scores in the postoperative period. It shows that the large volume is not necessary and can result in higher systemic absorption and potential toxicity. Pettersson <italic>et al</italic>. had showed that no toxic effects occurred up to 375 mg ropivacaine by estimating serum drug levels (if used for infiltration only).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] We had used only 100 mg of drug and we did not do serum drug levels as it was well below the established doses. Infiltration technique is also considered to be a factor in postherniorrhaphy pain relief. It is shown that inclusion of subfascial and muscle layers is critical in providing analgesia. In our study, the inclusion of iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves with infiltration of the surgical site was done. Tverskoy <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that preincisional infiltration and nerve block have a long-term effect and provided better analgesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In our study also, the infiltration was given before surgical incision, which might explain the lesser need for intraoperative opioids. As these infiltrations were performed in the patient under surgical phase of anesthesia, the adequacy of pain relief intraoperatively could be judged by the hemodynamic parameters and the need for additional analgesics. In our study, the hemodynamic parameters heart rate and mean arterial pressure were comparable in all the three groups' intraoperatively. One patient in group R 0.5 and two patients each in group R 0.25 and in group B 0.25 required additional doses of opioids. In these five patients, surgeons had difficulty in separating the different muscle layers and at the time of pulling the cord.</p><p>Our results are supported by Wulf <italic>et al</italic>. who reported that ropivacaine in a concentration of 0.5%, in addition, to general anesthesia provided adequate postoperative pain relief with the ilioinguinal block.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Our results are also consistent with those obtained by Johansson <italic>et al</italic>. who had shown that 40 ml of 0.25% or 0.5% ropivacaine injected preoperatively provided pain relief for 3 and 6 h, respectively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our study, ropivacaine 0.5% and bupivacaine 0.25% provided pain relief for 5&#x02013;6 h after surgery, whereas ropivacaine 0.25% provided pain relief for 3&#x02013;4 h.</p><p>Polley <italic>et al</italic>. estimated the relative potencies of epidural ropivacaine and bupivacaine and suggested that ropivacaine appears to be 40% less potent than bupivacaine at ED50 concentration but equipotent at a higher concentration.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This difference in potency seems to be true as evidenced from our study where ropivacaine in a concentration of 0.5% seemed to be equipotent to bupivacaine 0.25%. The time for rescue analgesia is shorter with ropivacaine 0.25% group. The VAS scores at rest, coughing, movements were similar between the groups; ropivacaine 0.5% and bupivacaine 0.25%. The VAS scores in group ropivacaine 0.25% were higher from the immediate postoperative period when compared with the other two groups.</p><p>Limitations of our study were, we did not assess the time to void in these patients, so the advantage of this infiltration technique over the feasibility of subarachnoid block for ambulatory surgery could not be commented upon. We did not measure the plasma concentration of the local anesthetic agents, as reported in other studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine at equal concentrations. About 0.5% ropivacaine provides excellent postoperative analgesia, which is comparable to the conventional use of 0.25% of bupivacaine. Ropivacaine though is said to have vasoconstrictive effects, prolonging the duration of action is less potent than bupivacaine at equal concentrations.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and
