It is unclear from these studies if anti-hypertensive management had been optimized prior to starting short daily hemodialysis. Also, the potential mechanism(s) of blood pressure improvement remain to be fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design, Setting and Participants</title><p>We undertook a randomized cross-over trial in adult hypertensive patients with ESRD treated with conventional hemodialysis to determine: 1) if short-daily hemodialysis is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure after a 3-month blood pressure optimization period and; 2) the potential mechanism(s) of blood pressure reduction. Blood pressure was measured using Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines. Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) was assessed with bioimpedance. Serum catecholamines were used to assess the sympathetic nervous system. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (T-BARS) were used as markers of inflammation and oxidative stress respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After a 3-month run-in phase in which systolic blood pressure improved, there was no significant difference in pre-dialysis systolic pressure between short-daily and conventional hemodialysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.39). However, similar blood pressures were achieved on fewer anti-hypertensive medications with short daily hemodialysis compared to conventional hemodialysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01). Short daily hemodialysis, compared to conventional hemodialysis, was not associated with a difference in dry weight or ECFV (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.77). Sympathetic nervous system activity as assessed by plasma epinephrine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0) and norepinephrine (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.52) was also not different. Markers of inflammation (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.42) and oxidative stress (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.83) were also similar between the two treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients treated with short daily, compared to conventional hemodialysis, have similar blood pressure control on fewer anti-hypertensive medications. The mechanism(s) by which short daily hemodialysis allows for decreased anti-hypertensive medication use remains unclear but effects on sodium balance and changes in peripheral vascular resistance require further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT00759967&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT00759967</ext-link>

Of the potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, greater than 80% of patients with ESRD have hypertension; 70% of whom are poorly controlled using conventional therapy <xref rid="pone.0097135-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. An expanded extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) due to hemodynamic/trophic effects of increased sympathetic nerve activity and inflammation are frequently quoted mechanisms contributing to hypertension in ESRD <xref rid="pone.0097135-Horl1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Common to these processes is increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species <xref rid="pone.0097135-Montezano1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The intermittent nature of conventional hemodialysis treatments (4 hours, 3 days/week) results in the majority of patients having a fluctuating ECFV that likely contributes to the activation of neurohormonal pathways <xref rid="pone.0097135-Zilch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, daily hemodialysis therapy including short daily (2 hours, 6 days/week) and nocturnal (6&#x02013;8 hours, 5&#x02013;6 days/week) improves or even normalizes blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0097135-Zilch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097135-Rocco1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Short daily hemodialysis reportedly improves blood pressure secondary to a reduction in ECFV <xref rid="pone.0097135-Zilch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097135-Nesrallah1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> whereas nocturnal hemodialysis appears to be associated with a reduction in PVR <xref rid="pone.0097135-Nesrallah1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097135-Chan2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This suggests that different mechanisms of blood pressure reduction may vary in different patient groups. In a study by Katzarski et al, patients who were normotensive and dialyzed for 7&#x02013;8 hours, 3 days/week were compared to normotensive and hypertensive patients whose treatment time was 3&#x02013;5 hours <xref rid="pone.0097135-Katzarski1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. There was no overall difference in the ECFV and inferior vena cava diameter between the two normotensive groups, which were lower than the hypertensive patients. However, 24% of the patients treated with long dialysis appeared to have an expanded ECFV such that the authors hypothesized that normotension in these patients might be explained by the removal of a vasoactive hormone. Their results are supported by a small randomized controlled trial of blood pressure control in 21 ESRD patients in which 7 patients had their dialysis time increased by 2 hours, 6 patients had their dialysis time increased by 2 hours and dry weight reduced, and 8 patients only had their dry weight reduced <xref rid="pone.0097135-Luik1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Despite a decrease in dry weight (and presumably ECFV) in only 2 of the groups, systolic blood pressure and use of anti-hypertensive medication use was reduced in all 3 groups.</p><p>In the majority of reported studies it is unclear if the patient's antihypertensive management, including achievement of the appropriate dry weight, had been optimized prior to the introduction of more intensive hemodialysis. A limited number of investigations have been undertaken to determine the mechanisms of blood pressure reduction. For this reason, we undertook a randomized cross-over trial in patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis. Our primary objective was to determine if short-daily hemodialysis, compared to conventional hemodialysis, is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure pre-dialysis after an optimization period. Our secondary objective was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of blood pressure reduction by assessing extracellular fluid volume and the sympathetic nervous system. The potential role of inflammation and oxidative stress were added to the study design because of the increasing evidence suggesting that these mediators may have an etiologic role in hypertension <xref rid="pone.0097135-Montezano1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097135-Ponnuchamy1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Overview</title><p>We undertook a 9-month randomized, crossover trial of adult prevalent hypertensive ESRD patients.

Patients were excluded if they were expected to switch treatment modality or die within one year or have known dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction &#x0003c;0.3. Eligible patients provided written informed consent to the study coordinator and then underwent a 3-month run-in phase. All patients were dialyzed with a Fresenius K machine, Optiflux 160 dialyzer, blood pump speed 300&#x02013;400 mls/min and a dialysate flow of 500 mls/minute. A protocolized blood pressure algorithm was followed to optimize blood pressure control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097135-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Briefly, all patients met with the renal dietician. The dietary sodium (&#x0003c;2 grams per day) and fluid restrictions (1L per day) as per unit policy were re-enforced. The dialysate sodium was reduced to 138 mmol/L from 140 mmol/L, the latter being the standard sodium concentration in our Ottawa Hospital hemodialysis units. At each hemodialysis treatment, a pre and post hemodialysis blood pressure was measured using techniques recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Education program. Changes were made to dry weight and/or antihypertensive medications every 2 weeks by the principal investigator if the 2-week average pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was greater than 140 mmHg. Forty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was also measured in the last week of the run-in phase. The number, type and strength of antihypertensive medications were recorded at study entry and at the end of each month. Intensity of anti-hypertensive medication use was estimated as multiples of the smallest available dose for that particular medication (eg. amlodipine - smallest available dose 5 mg&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1: 10 mg&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2, 2.5 mg&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5).

However, this control is associated with a decreased requirement for antihypertensive medications. Our results highlight the importance of a run-in phase using a protocolized blood pressure algorithm when treatment modalities cannot be blinded.</p><p>The decline in blood pressure at the end of the 3 month run-in phase, compared to baseline, was likely multifactorial. Although we did not demonstrate a reduction in average post dialysis weight, there was tremendous variability with some participant's weight being decreased and other participant's weight being increased. Similar changes were seen in the anti-hypertensive medication use. A reduction in dialysate sodium has been associated with a reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients without a change in pre-dialysis serum sodium concentration in some <xref rid="pone.0097135-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097135-dePaula1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> but not all studies <xref rid="pone.0097135-Thein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Post dialysis increases in serum sodium have been demonstrated for patients treated with conventional hemodialysis with dialysate sodium that is higher than the patient's serum sodium with a potential increase in thirst (occurs in 43% when dialysate sodium is 140 mmol/L, 20% when dialysate sodium is 138 mmol/L, <xref rid="pone.0097135-Penne1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>). It is unclear if the dietary instruction or the decrease in dialysate sodium in our study caused the small but statistically significant decrease in the total amount of ultrafiltration from the first month of the run in phase to the last month of the run in phase.</p><p>The mechanism for the decrease in antihypertensive requirements on short daily hemodialysis, compared to conventional hemodialysis, is unclear. A reduction in ECFV has been demonstrated in some <xref rid="pone.0097135-Zilch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097135-Nesrallah1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> but not all <xref rid="pone.0097135-Fagugli1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> studies as a mechanism contributing to the blood pressure lowering effect associated with short daily dialysis. Our study does not support this association for the population. There are a number of potential reasons for the differences in our results compared to other studies. To our knowledge a protocolized blood pressure management algorithm aimed at achieving an optimal dry weight prior to starting short daily hemodialysis has not been followed previously. Even during conventional hemodialysis &#x02018;probing dry weight&#x02019; as was done in the DRIP trial was associated with approximately 7/3 mmHg decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively <xref rid="pone.0097135-Oberleithner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Also, given the inability to blind these modality studies, the possibility of differential patient management is possible.</p><p>The activity of the sympathetic nervous system was found to be important in a study that included 11 patients treated with short daily hemodialysis <xref rid="pone.0097135-Zilch1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The investigators demonstrated a reduction in ultrafiltration volumes per session almost identical to those reported in our study. They hypothesized that large volume fluctuations could result in greater sympathetic nervous system stimulation. Greater amounts of ultrafiltration may also lead to increased post dialysis serum sodium which may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system <xref rid="pone.0097135-Agarwal2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We were unable demonstrate a difference in serum catecholamines with short daily compared to conventional hemodialysis but this does not rule out increase central sympathetic outflow.</p><p>In that last decade there has been an emerging evidence to support importance of oxidative stress in the development of hypertension <xref rid="pone.0097135-Hirooka1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097135-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Hydrogen peroxide production (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was higher in granulocytes of patients with CKD treated with hemodialysis compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0097135-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The magnitude of ROS production by granulocytes and monocytes in that study population was significantly related to the plasma concentration of the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), which is commonly used as an indirect marker of oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0097135-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels increased after hemodialysis with a cellulose acetate dialyzer highlighting the potential deleterious effects associated with the dialysis treatment itself <xref rid="pone.0097135-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We were unable to show a difference in serum T-BARs (measure of MDA) with short daily compared to conventional hemodialysis. Interestingly, phosphate has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell apoptosis which was characterized by increased oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0097135-DiMarco1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It is unclear if the effects of an increase in dialysis frequency and exposure to dialysis tubing and membranes is counterbalanced by the improvements in serum phosphate that have been reported with short daily dialysis.</p><p>A generalized increase in inflammatory markers including IL-6 may occur via a number of mechanisms including volume overload and oxidative stress. We were unable to show a difference in IL-6 or albumin with short daily compared to conventional hemodialysis. In a prospective cohort study of 26 patients treated with short daily HD in-centre, Ayus et al reported significant improvements in hs-CRP values after 12 months <xref rid="pone.0097135-Ayus1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In a cross-sectional study by Jefferies et al, lower CRP values were only seen for patients who were doing more frequent dialysis at home compared to those patients who were treated in-centre <xref rid="pone.0097135-Jefferies1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Post dialysis sodium, ultrafiltration volumes and ultrafiltration rates were much lower for the patients being treated at home compared to the patients being treated in-centre suggesting that post-dialysis increases in serum sodium and/or interdialytic ECFV expansion may explain these differences. They were unable to demonstrate lower IL-6 levels between patients undergoing conventional and short daily dialysis in-centre who had similar post dialysis serum sodium levels and ultrafiltration rates. The impact of more frequent dialysis on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation requires further study.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations including the inability to blind the patients and investigators to the treatment group. We did not measure residual renal function and therefore could not assess the importance of this variable. However, the dialysis vintage of the patients suggests that many of them may have been anuric. Lastly, we did not measure ECFV at baseline and again at the end of the run-in phase; we are therefore unable to comment on the role changes in ECFV in the blood pressure improvement that was seen in the BP optimization phase. Strengths of our study over others that have been published to date include the run-in phase and use of standardized blood pressure algorithm.</p><p>In summary after a 3-month run-in phase in which blood pressure was optimized by decreasing dialysate sodium, adjusting dry weight and anti-hypertensive medications,</p><p>patients treated with short daily HD compared to conventional HD require fewer anti-hypertensive medications to achieve the same blood pressure. This effect on blood pressure control was not related to a reduction in ECFV, sympathetic nervous system activity, oxidative stress or inflammation. The mechanism(s) by which short daily HD allows for decreased use of anti-hypertensive medication remains unclear but may be related to effects on sodium balance and changes in peripheral vascular resistance that require further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097135.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
