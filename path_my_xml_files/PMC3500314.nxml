The validity of postoperative pain assessment methods is uncertain with regards to responsiveness and the potential interference of analgesia. The hypothesis was that video analysis (as a reference), electrodermal activity, and two subjective pain scales (VAS and 4A-VET) would detect different levels of pain intensity in dogs after a standardized trochleoplasty procedure. In this prospective, blinded, randomized study, postoperative pain was assessed in 25 healthy dogs during a 48-hour time frame (T). Pain was managed with placebo (Group 1, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10), preemptive and multimodal analgesia (Group 2, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5), or preemptive analgesia consisting in oral tramadol (Group 3, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10). Changes over time among groups were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Multivariate regression tested the significance of relationships between pain scales and video analysis. Video analysis identified that one orthopedic behavior, namely &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; of the operated leg, decreased more in Group 1 at T24 (indicative of pain), whereas three behaviors indicative of sedation decreased in Group 2 at T24 (all p&#x0003c;0.004). Electrodermal activity was higher in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3 until T1 (p&#x0003c;0.0003). The VAS was not responsive. 4A-VET showed divergent results as its orthopedic component (4A-VETleg) detected lower pain in Group 2 until T12 (p&#x0003c;0.0009), but its interactive component (4A-VETbeh) was increased in Group 2 from T12 to T48 (p&#x0003c;0.001). Concurrent validity established that 4A-VETleg scores the painful orthopedic condition accurately and that pain assessment through 4A-VETbeh and VAS was severely biased by the sedative side-effect of the analgesics. Finally, the video analysis offered a concise template for assessment in dogs with acute orthopedic pain. However, subjective pain quantification methods and electrodermal activity need further investigation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by a grant from V&#x000e9;toquinol Laboratories, Lure, France (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vetoquinol.fr/">http://www.vetoquinol.fr/</ext-link>); an ongoing New Opportunities Fund grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (#9483) for the pain/function equipment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.innovation.ca">http://www.innovation.ca</ext-link>); a Discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (#327158-2008) as operating fund for pain biomarkers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca</ext-link>).

Spontaneous nociceptive pain has been associated with both skin incisions <xref rid="pone.0049480-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and deep surgery <xref rid="pone.0049480-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Using a rodent knee surgery model, Buvanendran <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0049480-Buvanendran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> also characterized some functional (behavioral) outcomes. In addition, nociceptive stimulation and neuronal changes might differ between those observed in models of acute postsurgical pain <xref rid="pone.0049480-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and chemical models of acute inflammation like sodium urate-induced synovitis in dogs <xref rid="pone.0049480-Budsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Punke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Schumacher1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In this context, a standardized and technically well-recognized canine orthopedic surgery might be a stronger surrogate of surgical pain than a chemically inflammatory pain model in dogs. Altogether, rodent models and chemical models would present a limited approach to the complex process of pain associated with orthopedic surgery. Veterinary surgeons, on the other hand, manage many natural painful disease processes that are common to both dogs and human beings <xref rid="pone.0049480-Quessy1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and they perform preclinical and clinical orthopedic procedures in dogs, some of which are directly derived from procedures used in human beings <xref rid="pone.0049480-Liska1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Consequently, we argue that common orthopedic dog surgeries, as trochleoplasty, are valid surrogates for the investigation of human surgical pain <xref rid="pone.0049480-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, methods of pain assessment in dogs are not extensively documented or standardized <xref rid="pone.0049480-Holton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Laboissire1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Inadequate pain assessment for dogs decreases the validity of canine pain models and hampers the comparison of pain studies.</p><p>Both owners <xref rid="pone.0049480-Visnen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and veterinarians <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hugonnard1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> associate orthopedic surgery with a high degree of pain. Behavioral (guarding, interaction with owner, reaction to palpation, etc.) and physiological (cardiovascular indices and stress response) indicators are commonly used to assess pain in non-verbal patients <xref rid="pone.0049480-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Composite pain scales and multidimensional questionnaires have been developed for use in a wide range of canine postoperative pain conditions <xref rid="pone.0049480-Holton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Laboissire1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. According to the Cohen&#x02019;s classification <xref rid="pone.0049480-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, both postoperative pain scales Glasgow Composite Pain Scale and University of Melbourne Pain Scale were developed in compliance with the psychometrics rules. However, these instruments did not differentiate the analgesic effect of the standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) from this of the Coxib <xref rid="pone.0049480-Gruet1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or fentanyl <xref rid="pone.0049480-Lafuente1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> in pain studies with canine orthopedic surgery. In contrast, kinetic gait analysis using a force plate or a pressure-sensing weight mattress decreased following sodium urate-induced acute synovitis in dogs <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hazewinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Borer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and improved following NSAID drug administration <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hazewinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Lipscomb1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hazewinkel2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Kinetic gait analysis did no correlate well with the subjective lameness scoring in dogs <xref rid="pone.0049480-Horstman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Waxman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Oosterlinck1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which supported the kinetic analysis to be a more sensitive indicator of joint pain than subjective lameness scoring. Even if kinetic gait analysis is a great asset in lameness study, it might not capture the broader aspects of pain <xref rid="pone.0049480-Melzack1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and is not available in every clinical center. Recently, the behavioral assessment of rodent pain has evolved with the use of semi-automated behavioral video analysis <xref rid="pone.0049480-Roughan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and standardized behavioral facial expression coding systems <xref rid="pone.0049480-Langford1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Previously, video analysis of spontaneous behaviors in dogs after ovariohysterectomy allowed unique discrimination between pain-related behaviors and drug side effects, such as sedation <xref rid="pone.0049480-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Kyles1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, but this pain monitoring method has not yet been used following canine orthopedic surgery.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate methods of pain assessment following canine orthopedic surgery. The hypothesis was that the effects of three different levels of analgesia would be reflected and therefore recognizable by the behavioral and physiological changes they elicit on a standardized canine postoperative pain model. Several methods (video analysis of spontaneous behaviors, electrodermal activity [EDA], visual analogue scale [VAS], and composite pain scale [4A-VET pain scale]) were used for the assessment of postoperative pain to evaluate their reliability and responsiveness. The concurrent validity of the behavioral pain assessment tools was tested using video analysis as the reference method.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rescue Analgesia</title><p>Rescue analgesia was provided for 25% of all dogs.

The results partially support this hypothesis although no behavioral or physiological assessment demonstrated the expected gradient of pain response (Group 1&#x0003e;Group 3&#x0003e;Group 2). Group 1 did present more pain than the other two groups, as demonstrated clearly by one video analysis criterion, namely &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; (Group 1 &#x02260; Group 3, at T24), as well as by 4A-VETleg (Group 2 &#x02260; Groups 1 and 3, at T0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12) and EDA (Group 1 &#x02260; Groups 2 and 3, at T0.5, and 1). Heavy sedation appears to explain the lack of specificity in pain detection by the other methods (namely VAS and 4A-VETbeh). Most interestingly, the multimodal analgesia group (#2) was higher than would be expected for VAS at T24 and for 4A-VETbeh at T9, 12, 24, 36, and 48. This was definitively a concurring and surprising discovery. Inclusion of anesthesia/drug controls would have assisted in determining the effects of sedation. In fact, video analysis confirmed that analgesic drug-induced sedation decreased some behaviors because dogs in Group 2 spent less time acting interested to their environment (&#x02018;Dog in front of the kennel&#x02019;), or trying to attract attention (&#x02018;Howling&#x02019;), and making facial expressions (&#x02018;Licking lips&#x02019;). With regards to our specific objectives, we observed good reliability for eleven behaviors in the video analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049480-t001">Table 1</xref>) and for the 4A-VET pain scale. We could not evaluate VAS reliability, and EDA reliability was poor. Establishing measurement reliability was an obligatory step before we could assess responsiveness and concurrent validity.</p><p>In animal video analysis, there are numerous methods for recording behavioral changes. In this study, we performed a microanalysis approach of events based on a quantitative description of an animal&#x02019;s normal behavior. The method generated a wide range of behaviors and occurrences. Only behaviors that demonstrated significant occurrence rates and high inter-observer reliability were selected as final endpoints. This selection method could be considered quite limiting, particularly as the duration of video was a one hour-period, and the inter-observer reliability was tested on 10% of randomized videotapes. We deemed that these strict behavioral criteria would be strongly representative of postsurgical orthopedic pain.</p><p>A decreased occurrence rate of &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; was demonstrated in all treatment groups following trochleoplasty compared to normal behavior. At T24, this decrease was higher in Group 1 than in Group 3, suggesting that tramadol in the latter group provided some analgesia-related use of the operated limb. Intuitively, it makes sense to measure the occurrence rate of &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing on the operated limb&#x02019; as a measure of orthopedic pain (or, at least as a measure of an absence of lameness) but no previous study has investigated this measurement as an indicator of pain.</p><p>So far, it was postulated that the degree of pain would correlate to the degree of weight bearing using force plate systems. Unexpectedly, the occurrence rate of the spontaneous behavior &#x02018;Standing/walking/trotting with no or partial weight bearing&#x02019; (as indicator of lameness) did not discriminate different levels of pain and indicated the lack of specificity of this measurement using video-analysis. It is also possible that the observer-reported behavior was less accurate in quantifying lameness than evaluating absence of lameness in dogs. This hypothesis would be in accordance with previous publications reporting a lack of correlation between subjective lameness scores and weight bearing measurements recorded through kinetic gait analysis in canine studies <xref rid="pone.0049480-Horstman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Waxman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hoelzler1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, postoperative pain was correlated to a decrease in the occurrence rate of a normal behavior &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing of the operated leg&#x02019;, suggesting that this latter behavior was a specific pain-free behavior. Our result supported that first, painful dogs were less active (walk, trot); second, the dogs were either lame or not lame when they were active; and third, the naturally occurring behavior of severity of lameness was not correlated to pain severity using video-analysis. Altogether, recording of a spontaneous behavior should not be interpreted in the same way as kinetic gait analysis. Kinetic gait analysis was currently performed when dogs were compelled to walk or trot, suggesting a sustained nociceptive firing during limb use. Indeed, video-analysis would summarize the way the dogs behaved and responded to postoperative pain, suggesting a cognitive adaptation to pain. Therefore the sensitivity of the behavioral quantification of &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing of the operated leg&#x02019; supports its use for further study as a new surrogate for assessing pain in clinical conditions.</p><p>&#x02018;Howling&#x02019; frequency differentiated Group 2 from Group 1 at T24, and the difference between Groups 2 and 3 approached significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006&#x02013; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049480-t003">Table 3</xref>). It is generally acknowledged that increased vocalization is associated with postoperative pain expression in the dog as reflected by the inclusion of this behavior in many canine postoperative pain scales <xref rid="pone.0049480-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Firth1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, a decrease in &#x02018;Howling&#x02019; in all three groups could indicate that postoperative pain decreased the occurrence rate of &#x02018;Howling&#x02019;, particularly for Group 1. That the decrease was more pronounced in Group 2 suggests that the use of a multimodal analgesic protocol may have contributed more to the decrease than did pain. Indeed, the occurrence rate did not return to its baseline value in any group. This finding supports vocalization&#x02019;s lack of sensitivity to postoperative pain intensity, as was observed in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0049480-Dzikiti1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The occurrence rates of both &#x02018;Dog in front of the kennel&#x02019; and &#x02018;Licking lips&#x02019; behaviors decreased in Group 2 when compared to Group 1 and decreased in both analgesic groups over time, while remaining stable over the same period in Group 1. Moreover, Group 2 spent less time &#x02018;Licking lips&#x02019; during the overall postoperative period. Altogether, the decreased occurrence rate observed in both pharmacologically treated groups, and mostly in Group 2, may simply not be related to a pain-controlling effect but rather may be related to a sedative effect of the different opioids (fentanyl patch, epidural morphine, and oral tramadol). Similar results were previously observed following administration of butorphanol in a canine pain study <xref rid="pone.0049480-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These results highlight the major interference of the neuropharmacological effects of commonly used analgesic (opioid) drugs in the apparent expression of postoperative pain. The frequency of these two behaviors did not change over time in Group 1, suggesting that they were not affected by postoperative pain. Thus, the observations regarding restlessness/interest in the environment indicated by &#x02018;Dog in front of the kennel&#x02019; and &#x02018;Licking lips&#x02019; behaviors should be analyzed with caution and may not demonstrate assay sensitivity for comparing analgesic protocols.</p><p>Altogether, video analysis was a powerful method that provided evidence of pain related behaviors and identified behaviors related to drug side-effects. The low number of selected and validated spontaneous behaviors is related to inter-subject variability in pain expression and to the difficulty associated with standardizing a behavioral observation for assessing pain. These results support the use of video analysis as a valid pain assessment tool because of its ability to test concurrent validity with subjective behavioral pain assessments. The concurrent validity analysis completed in this study confirmed sedation&#x02019;s major influence not only on video analysis but also on VAS and 4A-VETbeh scores.</p><p>In this study, EDA and 4A-VET were responsive to multimodal analgesia in the immediate postoperative period by reporting decreased skin conductance, a known method for indirectly quantifying sympathetic activity and decreased (4A-VET) pain scores, respectively, in Group 2. There were slight discordant responses between EDA measurements and 4A-VET scoring. With EDA, Group 1 demonstrated higher pain intensity compared to Groups 2 and 3, whereas with 4A-VET, the intensity of pain was lower in Group 2 than in both Groups 1 and 3 at similar time points.</p><p>The most plausible explanation for the decreased EDA intensity in Groups 2 and 3 was the analgesia/anxiolysis induced by either treatment. This analgesic detection is supported by a study where the EDA intensity correlated significantly with kinetic gait analysis, telemetered motor activity and subjective scoring to demonstrate analgesic effect of a bisphosphonate in an experimental dog osteoarthritis model <xref rid="pone.0049480-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Hypothetically, the EDA decrease could also be related to other pharmacological interactions with sympathetic activity <xref rid="pone.0049480-Guedes1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Valtolina1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Vettorato1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Moreover, the sensitivity of EDA was not important, as highlighted by the absence of a difference between Groups 2 and 3 and the short duration of its effectiveness to differentiate Group 1 from both Groups 2 and 3. This low psychometric quality added to the previously reported lack of specificity in a rodent model of surgical pain <xref rid="pone.0049480-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Further investigation is needed before considering increasing the clinical use of EDA.</p><p>Although other canine pain studies have validated the pain VAS <xref rid="pone.0049480-Shih1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Marucio1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, different treatment effects on mean VAS scores following trochleoplasty were not demonstrated in this study. The VAS might have provided systematic error, particularly when measuring pain at baseline (floor effect) and during the postoperative period (ceiling effect). The VAS observer could not be blinded to the presence or the absence of surgery because sham dogs were not included, and therefore this was an evident first source of bias (explaining the floor effect). Furthermore, increased VAS scores in Group 2 at T24 suggested that sedative side-effects of analgesics might interfere with VAS scoring. Confounding effect of analgesic side effect on VAS score (increasing it) was previously observed <xref rid="pone.0049480-KonaBoun1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Pacharinsak1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This could explain the lack of sensitivity in postoperative pain quantification using the VAS and the absence of a treatment effect using this method. Altogether, these findings urge for caution in the use and interpretation of observer-reported VAS pain scoring as a standardized pain assessment method with experimental animals as it could be biased and not specific for pain.</p><p>The 4A-VET pain scale showed acceptable reliability and, as reported earlier, was partially responsive to treatments. Nevertheless, like EDA, 4A-VET demonstrated weak performance because of its apparent low sensitivity (no difference between Groups 1 and 3) and short duration (initial 2 hours post-surgery) of effective responsiveness in favor of Group 2. Interestingly, the weak performance of the 4A-VET pain scale could be explained by the response divergence between its two main components, namely 4A-VETbeh and 4A-EVTleg. The 4A-VETleg scores indicated significantly lower pain in Group 2 compared to Groups 1 and 3 at T0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. Conversely, 4A-VETbeh scores indicated increased pain for Group 2 compared to Groups 1 and 3 at T9, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Considered together, these results suggest that non-analgesic effects of the multimodal analgesia protocol used in Group 2 may have been a potential confounder in pain assessment, as has been observed in previous canine postoperative pain studies <xref rid="pone.0049480-Dzikiti1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049480-Shih1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The differences between the mean scores of 4A-VETbeh and 4A-VETleg might also illustrate differences in scale construction. This is a strong argument for choosing 4A-VETleg as a standard measure of orthopedic postoperative pain. Nevertheless, 4A-VETleg had some limitations because it was not as responsive at T24 as was the video analysis, suggesting that 4A-VETleg was valid during at least the first twelve hours following surgery. At this point, the validity of behavioral pain assessment based on pain scoring systems is uncertain because many questions remain in relation to measurement errors and the difficulty of weighing the consequence of sedation against those of unrelieved pain, as has already been observed <xref rid="pone.0049480-Guillot1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>Using video analysis, &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; of the operated limb was the only validated behavior to support the analgesic efficacy of tramadol as well as to indicate the presence of pain in Group 1. Analgesic side-effects strongly associated with behavioral changes. Regression methods were used to test the concurrent validity of the pain scales scores with video analysis as the standard of the behavioral pain assessment. Of all displayed behaviors, &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing on the operated limb&#x02019; was the behavior that was most correlated with the VAS, 4A-VET and 4A-VETleg pain scores. It is possible that the relationship between the pain scales and &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; occurred for several reasons: 1) this behavior was more frequent; 2) this higher frequency could be attributed to a more conservative and well-understood definition, allowing it to be observed with more accuracy; and 3) recording during daytime might have improved the robustness of the occurrence rate of &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019; in relation to the dog&#x02019;s level of daylight activity.</p><p>Additionally, it appears this behavior (&#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing&#x02019;) is unconsciously linked to pain-free behavior for VAS and 4A-VETleg. Moreover, for the latter, pain intensity was clearly linked to lameness (reflected by &#x02018;Standing with no weight bearing&#x02019;), thus reinforcing the conceptual validity of 4A-VETleg scores. Interestingly, the regression analysis in this study confirmed the previously suspected limitations in the pain scoring systems. First, sedative side-effect of the drug(s) was a confounding factor for assessing pain with VAS because VAS was linked to the spontaneous behavior &#x02018;Dog in front of the kennel&#x02019; that changed in response to the side-effect of the analgesic. Second, the regression models revealed that 4A-VETbeh scores were related to two spontaneous behaviors, &#x02018;Immobile with head down&#x02019; and &#x02018;Sniffing&#x02019;, which were not validated by the video analysis and were assumed to be included in the communicative category. The video analysis confirmed that the present 4A-VETbeh was not an accurate method for pain evaluation in this study. The results also showed strong evidence that the large number of items in the composite 4A-VET pain scale introduces noise into this pain scoring system.</p><p>Pain expression may hypothetically differ when an animal is observed directly as opposed to being filmed without a person in the environment. This could, evidently, lead to differences in pain observation using various methods. The advantage of video analysis for pain expression is that it can be used as a reference method to introduce further development of pain scales <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hadjistavropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, as has been previously performed in dogs <xref rid="pone.0049480-Guillot1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It is important to consider that many factors can influence the measurement of pain. It has been proposed that not only the pain stimulus itself, but observer characteristics, environmental and social interaction effects, and intra-subject factors can all influence the measurement of pain. This can occur <italic>via</italic> effects on the pain experience, as well as on its expression <xref rid="pone.0049480-Hadjistavropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In this study, the standardization of procedures allowed us to control all of these aspects, except the intra-subject experience.</p><p>An important limitation of the study was the apparent moderate intensity of postoperative pain generated by the trochleoplasty procedure, as reflected by the low levels of pain scale scoring, as well as the low use of rescue analgesia in Groups 1 and 3. This could be related to an inadequate sensitivity of pain scales. A higher intensity of pain would surely have contributed to better discrimination in pain assessment method responsiveness.</p><p>In conclusion, the video analysis provided strong evidence of responsiveness and validity of the 4A-VETleg pain scale for assessing acute orthopedic pain. The alteration of normal gait behavior, as observed by changes in &#x02018;Walking with full weight bearing,&#x02019; is likely to be the best behavioral orthopedic pain assessment method. The current results will hopefully contribute to the generation of a refined and validated method of orthopedic pain assessment. This study also clearly establishes the major interference of analgesic side effects on dog behaviors. This is a major finding with regards to the use of opioid drugs as a staple in the surgical analgesic arsenal in veterinary and human medicine. Such interference could potentially contribute to the overdosing of opioids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement, Animals and Experimental Design</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the study protocol (# Rech-1220), and the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines were followed regarding care and handling of the dogs.
