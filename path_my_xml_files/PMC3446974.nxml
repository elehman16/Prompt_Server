The current study utilized samples collected in the PIVENS trial to identify: (1) baseline metabolomic profiles that could identify who would respond to vitamin E treatment and (2) end of treatment metabolomic profiles reflective of histologic improvement. A comprehensive analysis of metabolomics profiles (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;547) quantified by mass spectrometry was performed in vitamin E responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16), vitamin E non-responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15), and placebo responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15). At baseline, phenyl-propionic acid (Odds ratio: 29.4, p&#x0003c;0.01), indole-propionic acid levels (Odds ratio: 16.2, p&#x0003c;0.01) were directly associated with a subsequent histologic response to vitamin E treatment whereas &#x003b3;-carboxyethylhydroxychroman (CEHC) levels were inversely related to histologic response. Adjusting for baseline values by analysis of covariance, the end of treatment levels of gamma-glutamyl leucine (Fold change: 0.82, p&#x0003c;0.02) and gamma-glutamyl valine (Fold change: 0.8, p&#x0003c;0.03) were significantly lower in vitamin E responders compared to non-responders. The levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were not significantly different across the two groups. Subjects receiving placebo who demonstrated a histologic improvement also demonstrated lower levels of gamma-glutamylated amino acids (leucine, valine and isoleucine) compared to vitamin E non-responders. These data provide exploratory proof that there are measurable differences in the metabolic profile of subjects who are likely (vs unlikely) to respond to vitamin E treatment for NASH and in those experiencing histologic improvement (vs no improvement) on treatment and support further studies to validate these biomarkers.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) supplement to a contract (3UO1 DK 061731-08S1) from the National Institutes of Health, NASH R01 - NIDDK - 1R01DK08140 and a training grant (2T32 DK 007150-35) awarded to Dr. Arun Sanyal.

The &#x0201c;Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis&#x0201d; (PIVENS, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00063622.) was a multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial in non-diabetic, non-cirrhotic subjects with histologically-active NASH that targeted insulin resistance with pioglitazone (30 mg/day) or oxidative stress with vitamin E (RRR- &#x003b1;-tocopherol 800 IU/day) <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this trial, 43% of subjects receiving vitamin E met the primary endpoint of histologic improvement compared to 19% of those receiving placebo (p&#x0003c;0.001) <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These data provide hope for effective pharmacologic therapy for NASH.</p><p>Given that only some patients with NASH respond to vitamin E treatment, there is a need to develop methods to identify such individuals prior to starting therapy. Also, once treatment is started, one has to determine if a given individual is responding to treatment. In the PIVENS trial, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) declined in subjects receiving vitamin E but did not reliably predict histologic improvement <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A liver biopsy is thus needed to determine if a given subject is responding to treatment; however, liver biopsies are invasive, uncomfortable and occasionally associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0044106-Bedossa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Ratziu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, a need to develop non-invasive methods to determine the presence of an on-treatment response exists.</p><p>Metabolomic technologies allow measurement of a multitude of metabolites in a single plasma or tissue sample. An advantage of analyzing metabolomic datasets is that they can be used to identify unique &#x0201c;metabolic signatures&#x0201d; of disease states in circulation. They also provide an unbiased approach to identification of such signatures. These considerations have led to their utilization in biomarker development.</p><p>The objectives of this pilot exploratory study were to utilize the plasma samples collected during the PIVENS trial to determine whether there were significant measurable differences in the metabolomic profiles of subjects who did or did not respond to vitamin E treatment at baseline and at end of treatment. The goal was to generate pilot data to provide direction for future focused large scale studies to develop: (1) baseline predictors of histologic response to vitamin E and (2) biomarkers indicative of histologic response to vitamin E.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was approved by NASH CRN Steering Committee (SC). It was conceived as an ancillary study to the PIVENS trial that was performed by the NASH Clinical Research Network of the National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The protocol was approved by the ancillary studies committee and supported via an ARRA supplement to the institutional contract for the NASH CRN to Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). All participants involved in this ancillary study provided written consent to donate serum/plasma samples for the main study objectives and for future NASH CRN ancillary studies. The study was considered exempt from a separate formal institutional review because it involved retrospective analysis of samples collected during the study. Also, the scope of the analyses was covered under the original IRB approval for the study at all sites. The data were analyzed by the investigators and the manuscript prepared entirely by the investigators.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and samples</title><p>The PIVENS trial was conducted by the NIDDK NASH CRN from 2005 to 2008. The details of the study protocol and the main results of the trial have already been published <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Sanyal2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Briefly, non-diabetic, non-cirrhotic adults with active NASH were enrolled. Active NASH was defined by the presence of definite or possible steatohepatitis with a NAFLD activity score (NAS)&#x02265;5 as assessed by the CRN site pathologist or definite steatohepatitis with a NAS&#x02265;4 as assessed by a CRN site-pathologist and another NASH CRN pathologist <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Sanyal2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Subjects who had a liver biopsy within the previous six months were randomized to receive 96 weeks of treatment with one of three treatments: (1) pioglitazone (30 mg once a day by mouth) and vitamin E-placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;80), (2) vitamin E (800 IU once a day by mouth) and pioglitazone-placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;84) and (3) vitamin E-placebo and pioglitazone-placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;83). A liver biopsy was performed after 96 weeks of treatment and the treatments were then discontinued. 90% of subjects had both a baseline and an end of treatment biopsy.</p><p>For the purpose of this analysis, response was defined by a decrease in the NAS by two or more points with at least one point improvement in hepatocyte ballooning. This is identical to the primary endpoint of the PIVENS trial <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Non-response was defined as not meeting the primary outcome of the trial, no resolution of steatohepatitis (as determined by NASH CRN central pathology review) and ballooning score greater than zero. This was done to maximize the ability to identify differences in analytes by studying the extreme ends of the spectrum of histologic response in the trial.</p><p>Thirty six of the 84 subjects who received vitamin E met the primary endpoint; of these, 16 subjects were selected (group 1). This was based on the availability of paired plasma samples and also histologic data at end of study for analysis. For the metabolomic analyses, 15 subjects each from two control groups: (1) vitamin E nonresponders, and (2) placebo responders. The rationale for the former group was that it was the primary group for comparison while that for the latter group was to assess the specificity of potential analytes for response to vitamin E treatment. A stratified random sampling scheme was used to select the samples. The strata were determined by the subjects meeting each group's inclusion criteria and the availability of pairs of liver biopsy tissue and fasting plasma specimens for these subjects. For the vitamin E non-responder group, 15 of the 36 subjects who met the definition of non-response (group 2) were randomly selected. The placebo responder group included 15 of the 16 subjects in the placebo arm who had a histologic response (group 3).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>High-throughput metabolomic profiling</title><p>All samples were processed by Metabolon (Research Triangle Park, NC) using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms with the methodological details summarized as follows:</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Upon receipt of plasma samples, aliquots were immediately stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until time of analysis when samples were extracted and prepared for analysis using Metabolon's standard solvent extraction method.

For example, a random selection of samples was made on each run day choosing the same number from each group &#x02013; say 3 vitamin E responders, 3 vitamin E non-responders, and 3 placebo responders. Additionally, metabolites in each sample were normalized by dividing respective metabolite raw area counts by their median value for each run-day to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Missing values were assumed to result from areas falling below limits of detection. As such, missing values were imputed with the observed minimum for each metabolite after the normalization step.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical computing environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and SAS (V 9.2, Cary, NC). Categorical data were analyzed by chi-square test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were developed to analyze continuous variables followed by Tukey post-tests for multiple comparisons to identify specific differences between groups. Given the small sample size which precluded meaningful multiple comparisons analyses for the number of analytes (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;547), a smaller set of analytes that were significant on univariate analysis was included in a logistic regression model to identify those that predicted histologic outcomes of vitamin E treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 46 pairs of fasting plasma samples obtained at baseline and end of treatment were analyzed in vitamin E responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16), vitamin E non-responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) and placebo-responders (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044106-t001">

Specifically, both biases in treatment assignment and the sequence of sample loading for processing can be a source for potential bias in the data output <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Sanyal2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These data were collected in the context of the PIVENS trial and the population of subjects assigned to treatment with vitamin E was relatively homogeneous <xref rid="pone.0044106-Arun1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In our study, special efforts were taken (see methods section) to avoid analytic biases.</p><p>The study of metabolomic signatures of subjects on treatment with vitamin E also provides some insights in to the potential effects of vitamin E treatment on the biology of NASH. It is interesting to note that, in an unbiased evaluation of the metabolome, the principal metabolites that distinguished vitamin E responders and non-responders were related to glutathione metabolism. Glutathione is a principal intracellular anti-oxidant and helps maintain redox balance, especially in the liver <xref rid="pone.0044106-GarciaRuiz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Nobili1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044106-Colell1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Gamma-glutamylated amino acids are established markers of oxidative stress and reflect glutathione turnover <xref rid="pone.0044106-Teismann1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The drop in such amino acids in both those where NASH improves on vitamin E treatment or spontaneously (on placebo) indicates that histologic improvement in NASH under both these conditions is associated with decreased oxidative stress and glutathione turnover. Whether the improvement in oxidative stress improves NASH or vice versa now awaits experimental elucidation.</p><p>Sphingosine is released by the action of the tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-sensitive enzyme sphingomyelinase on cell membrane-bound sphingomyelin <xref rid="pone.0044106-Mar1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0044106-Mar3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While there is a relative abundance of literature of the potential role of sphingosine-1-phosphate in the metabolic syndrome and its biologic effects, very little is known about the regulation of sphingosine in circulation or its biologic implications. We hypothesize that the novel finding of decreased sphingosine in vitamin E responders reflects decreased TNF-&#x003b1; activity in responders and hope that these findings will provide impetus to future studies of the sphingosine-ceramide pathway in NASH. This is supported by a direct relationship between TNF-&#x003b1; and sphingosine levels in subjects receiving vitamin E; the dependence of sphingosine levels on TNF-&#x003b1; needs to be experimentally verified.</p><p>It is also intriguing to note that two of the metabolites (indole-propionic acid and phenyl-propionic acid) that predicted future response to vitamin E therapy can be derived from intestinal microbiota <xref rid="pone.0044106-Attwood1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The tryptophan- and indole-derived compounds have well-established free-radical scavenger and mitochondrial protective properties <xref rid="pone.0044106-Hardeland1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These novel findings open the possibility that vitamin E response may depend on the presence of these specific microbiome-derived metabolites or changes in specific microbiota to boost the net anti-oxidant effect achieved.</p><p>The principal limitations of this study are the small sample size and the lack of liver tissue for metabolomic analysis which prevent generation of definitive data about biomarkers for response to vitamin E and pathophysiological data about the role of oxidative stress in NASH. However, it is important to emphasize the exploratory nature of this study and that the primary objective was to generate pilot &#x0201c;proof of principle&#x0201d; data to provide direction and support for focused yet large-scale studies to develop biomarkers for response to vitamin E for NASH. By providing such focused data, one may avoid the need for prohibitively expensive large scale full metabolomics profiling to identify such biomarkers.</p><p>In summary, this exploratory study provides pilot investigation that there are differences in the circulating profiles of subjects with NASH who will or will not respond to vitamin E treatment and amongst those who are responding to treatment vs those who are not. They also provide several novel findings and insights about the mechanisms of action of vitamin E in NASH which now require further elucidation in specific hypothesis-driven studies. While much work needs to be done to translate these data in to models for personalized clinical care of patients with NASH, this study provides a first step in this direction with respect to the use of vitamin E for NASH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all the contributors from the NASH CRN that allowed this work to be possible.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0044106-Browning1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
