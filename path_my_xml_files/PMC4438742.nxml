Serum phosphorus concentrations were maintained during the extension study. Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) change in serum phosphorus concentrations from extension study baseline to Week 52 end point was 0.02 &#x000b1; 0.52 mmol/L with sucroferric oxyhydroxide and 0.09 &#x000b1; 0.58 mmol/L with sevelamer. Mean serum phosphorus concentrations remained within Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative target range (1.13&#x02013;1.78 mmol/L) for both treatment groups. Mean (SD) daily tablet number over the 28-week extension study was lower for sucroferric oxyhydroxide (4.0 &#x000b1; 1.5) versus sevelamer (10.1 &#x000b1; 6.6). Patient adherence was 86.2% with sucroferric oxyhydroxide versus 76.9% with sevelamer. Mean serum ferritin concentrations increased over the extension study in both treatment groups, but transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron and hemoglobin concentrations were generally stable. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events were similar and occurred early with both treatments, but decreased over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The serum phosphorus-lowering effect of sucroferric oxyhydroxide was maintained over 1 year and associated with a lower pill burden, compared with sevelamer.

It is formulated as a chewable tablet containing 500 mg iron. In Phase I clinical studies, sucroferric oxyhydroxide was well tolerated and associated with minimal gastrointestinal (GI) iron absorption [<xref rid="GFV006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A Phase II study showed that doses of 1.0&#x02212;2.5 g/day (based on iron content) substantially lowered serum phosphorus concentrations and reaffirmed its tolerability profile [<xref rid="GFV006C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A Phase III study in patients undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis showed that sucroferric oxyhydroxide was non-inferior to sevelamer, in terms of serum phosphorus control, after 12 weeks of treatment [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Treatment effect was achieved with approximately 62% fewer sucroferric oxyhydroxide tablets than sevelamer tablets and was maintained over 24 weeks. Patients who completed the Phase III study, and who were eligible, had the option of entering a 28-week extension study. In this paper, we present long-term efficacy and safety data from this extension study, including an examination of its effect on iron parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="gfv006_s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="gfv006_s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>The initial Phase III study (NCT01324128) and its extension (NCT01464190; date of registration: 12 September 2011) were multicenter, Phase III, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trials (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GFV006F1">1</xref>).

The efficacy of sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the extension study was largely unaffected by geographical region, sex, age and race (data not shown).</p><p>Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was generally well tolerated over 1 year. TEAEs with sucroferric oxyhydroxide were generally more frequent during the initial Phase III study [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] than in the extension study, indicating that those who better tolerated the drug at study start continued to do so for the remainder of the 1-year period. Hyperphosphatemia was the most common class of TEAE for both sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer, which contrasted with the first 6 months of treatment, in which GI disorders were the predominant class of TEAE [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Diarrhea and discolored feces were the most frequent GI-related TEAEs with sucroferric oxyhydroxide over the first weeks of treatment [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but their incidence decreased over time. Nausea, vomiting and constipation were reported more frequently with sevelamer than sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the first 6 months of treatment [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but their incidence also diminished over time. Moreover, fewer patients were withdrawn due to TEAEs during the extension study in both the sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer treatment groups (8.2 and 4.9%, respectively), compared with the first 6 months of treatment (16.1 and 6.6%, respectively) [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This indicates that, in general, patients who tolerated the treatments in the initial study continued to tolerate them for the next 6 months during the extension study. The incidence of serious or severe TEAEs and deaths were similar in both treatment groups during the extension study and over the 1-year period overall. It should be noted that a large number (one-third) of study participants were treated with sevelamer prior to inclusion in the initial Phase III study, so could be considered preadapted to this drug.</p><p>A representative proportion (9.3%) of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis was included in this long-term analysis of phosphate binders. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide appeared to be similarly efficacious and well tolerated in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients [<xref rid="GFV006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The pill burden over 1 year of treatment was 62% lower with sucroferric oxyhydroxide than with sevelamer, which may have implications for long-term adherence to phosphate-binder treatment. In this randomized study, there was a trend towards higher adherence (based on tablet numbers dispensed and returned) with sucroferric oxyhydroxide. However, assessing adherence according to number of tablets returned has limited reliability, so the findings should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, as adherence within a study is generally better than in daily practice, pill burden may influence adherence differently in the real-life setting. The association between higher pill burden and lower adherence was affirmed in a recent retrospective observational study of pharmacy management program data from 8616 hemodialysis patients in the USA [<xref rid="GFV006C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Findings also indicated a link between lower adherence and higher mean serum phosphorus levels [<xref rid="GFV006C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, long-term adherence to phosphate-binder treatment is an important consideration in order to avoid potentially harmful sequelae to raised serum phosphorus concentrations.</p><p>Generally, iron-related parameters remained stable during the extension study. During the first 6 months of treatment (i.e. initial Phase III study), increases from baseline in serum ferritin were observed in both treatment groups, and increases from baseline in TSAT and iron were observed in the sucroferric oxyhydroxide group [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The use of intravenous iron, which was higher in patients from the USA (who represented almost half of all randomized patients), may provide an explanation for the increase in these iron-related parameters [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A short-term Phase I study indicated minimal iron absorption from sucroferric oxyhydroxide in CKD patients [<xref rid="GFV006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding may explain an additional impact on the iron indices observed in the Phase III studies. However, iron-related parameters appeared to plateau during the extension study and hemoglobin concentrations remained stable during long-term treatment in both treatment groups, indicating no evidence of iron accumulation. The changes in iron status are consistent across early- and late-stage clinical studies and do not indicate a safety concern. In the initial Phase III study, pronounced differences were observed between geographic regions in the use of intravenous iron products and their impact on iron-related indices among study participants [<xref rid="GFV006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, sucroferric oxyhydroxide as a new, non-calcium-, iron-based phosphate binder demonstrated a maintained serum phosphorus control over the long-term (1 year), with good tolerability and a lower pill burden, compared with sevelamer carbonate. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide has the potential to improve adherence and, hence, clinical outcomes for patients when used in routine clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was sponsored by Vifor Pharma, Glattbrugg, Switzerland.
