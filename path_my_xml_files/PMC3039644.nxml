We
aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of plasmid DNA (pSG2.HBs) vaccine,
followed by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA.HBs), encoding
the surface antigen of HBV as therapy for chronic HBV. A secondary goal was
to characterize the immune responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Firstly 32 HBV e antigen negative (eAg<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) participants were
randomly assigned to one of four groups: to receive vaccines alone,
lamivudine (3TC) alone, both, or neither. Later 16 eAg<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>
volunteers in two groups received either 3TC alone or both 3TC and vaccines.
Finally, 12 eAg<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and 12 eAg<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subjects were
enrolled into higher-dose treatment groups. Healthy but chronically
HBV-infected males between the ages of 15 &#x02013; 25 who lived in the
western part of The Gambia were eligible. Participants in some groups
received 1 mg or 2 mg of pSG2.HBs intramuscularly twice followed by
5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu or 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> pfu of MVA.HBs
intradermally at 3-weekly intervals with or without concomitant 3TC for
11&#x02013;14 weeks. Intradermal rabies vaccine was administered to a negative
control group. Safety was assessed clinically and biochemically. The primary
measure of efficacy was a quantitative PCR assay of plasma HBV. Immunity was
assessed by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mild local and systemic adverse events were observed following the vaccines.
A small shiny scar was observed in some cases after MVA.HBs. There were no
significant changes in AST or ALT. HBeAg was lost in one participant in the
higher-dose group. As expected, the 3TC therapy reduced viraemia levels
during therapy, but the prime-boost vaccine regimen did not reduce the
viraemia. The immune responses were variable. The majority of IFN-&#x003b3; was
made by antigen non-specific CD16<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (both
CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The vaccines were well tolerated but did not control HBV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN67270384/">ISRCTN67270384</ext-link>

health burden in 5 to 10&#x00025; of the world population, causing slightly over
50&#x00025; of the cases of primary liver cancer worldwide <xref rid="pone.0014626-Kirk1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Montalto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wild1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therapeutic vaccination could
offer a curative treatment option. Two important questions arise for immunotherapy:
what kind of immune response is needed? What epitopes or antigens should comprise
the vaccine?</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Immune response to HBV</title><p>The immune response to HBV infection is complex and poorly understood in several
important aspects. The antibody response is first to the core antigen (HBcAg)
which does not predict control of the virus. HBV infection is clinically
heterogeneous, ranging from completely asymptomatic to fatal, fulminant
hepatitis, or to chronic liver failure, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is no simple, quantitative relationship between the level of viraemia and
the presence or severity of symptoms <xref rid="pone.0014626-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Nevertheless a
meta-analysis concluded that there are statistically significant correlations
between viraemia and histologic grading and biochemical and serological response
<xref rid="pone.0014626-MommejaMarin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The immune system is essential for HBV clearance <xref rid="pone.0014626-Rapicetta1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Bertoletti1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Bertoletti2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The
desired end point of therapy ought to be elimination of detectable viraemia
<xref rid="pone.0014626-MommejaMarin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Effector mechanisms</title><p>Resolution of HBV infection is associated with vigorous and polyclonal
HBV-specific CTL <xref rid="pone.0014626-Maini1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> activity directed against multiple HBV epitopes in
the viral nucleocapsid, envelope and polymerase proteins <xref rid="pone.0014626-Bertoletti3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Rehermann2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, whereas the CTL
response is weak or absent in chronic carriers <xref rid="pone.0014626-Chisari2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Chisari3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The impaired T-cell

Non-cytolytic mechanisms of
viral control are expected on theoretical grounds <xref rid="pone.0014626-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and are essential in a
chimpanzee model <xref rid="pone.0014626-Guidotti1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wieland1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Similar results were subsequently shown in humans in
a single-source outbreak <xref rid="pone.0014626-Webster2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Interferon-&#x003b3; plays a key role in the clearance
of HBV from chimpanzees' livers <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wieland1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Studies with transgenic
mice expressing HBV have demonstrated the importance of type I interferons
(&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;) <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wieland2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wieland3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, type II interferons (IFN-&#x003b3;) <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wieland2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and type
III interferons (IFN-&#x003bb;) <xref rid="pone.0014626-Robek1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as mechanisms for noncytolytic control. Most of the
antiviral effect of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs was shown to be mediated by
IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0014626-McClary1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Consequently, we used a cellular assay for IFN-&#x003b3;
as the primary measure of immune function in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Heterologous immunization for a CTL response</title><p>In animal models a CTL response can be elicited with DNA vaccination (reviewed in
<xref rid="pone.0014626-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0014626-Srivastava1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>).
DNA vaccination of humans has been reported for malarial antigens <xref rid="pone.0014626-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.
Mancini-Bourgine et al. reported the induction or expansion of T cell responses
in humans after only DNA immunization with 0.5 mg of a DNA vaccine encoding the
preS2 and S subunits of the HBV envelope protein in uninfected and in chronic
HBV-infected people <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Heterologous
immunization, in which boosting for one antigen is done sequentially using
different vectors, has been shown to be more effective than DNA immunization
alone <xref rid="pone.0014626-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0014626-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0014626-Woodland1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.
MVA's excellent safety profile and immunogenic properties make it a
promising human vaccine candidate <xref rid="pone.0014626-Mayr1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A prime-boost strategy using DNA followed by MVA has
been used in several other studies and shown to be highly immunogenic for the
induction of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0014626-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Goonetilleke1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>,

murine malaria model, DNA immunization followed by recombinant MVA boosting
induced a protective CTL response, whereas the vaccines in reverse order was
not, nor was either of the vaccines by themselves <xref rid="pone.0014626-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These initial studies
in mice have been extended to clinical trials. In a malaria vaccine study in The
Gambia strong CD4 and weak CD8 T cell responses were induced by two 1 mg doses
of a DNA vaccine given intramuscularly, followed by one dose of
3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu (plaque forming units) MVA vaccine given
intradermally at intervals 3 weeks apart <xref rid="pone.0014626-Moorthy1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Increasing the dose of
the DNA vaccine to 2 mg and the MVA vaccine to 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> pfu
increased the effector T cell frequencies <xref rid="pone.0014626-McConkey1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Dramatic loss of HBV
viraemia was seen in a chronically infected chimpanzee after priming with a DNA
immunization followed by boosting with a recombinant canarypox booster <xref rid="pone.0014626-Pancholi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Taken
together, these exciting results suggested that DNA priming with an HBV antigen
followed by boosting with recombinant MVA expressing the same antigen could be a
good choice for a therapeutic vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Which antigen to use, and why?</title><p>The HBV genome is small, consisting of only 4 overlapping open reading frames.
These encode 7 proteins: the large (L or pre-S1 &#x0002b; PreS2 &#x0002b; S), middle
(sometimes &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d;) (M or pre-S2 &#x0002b; S), and small (S) surface
antigens, the core (c) and pre-core (e) antigens (respectively known as HBcAg
and HBeAg), the X antigen (so named because its function was initially
enigmatic), and the viral polymerase. The antigenicities of these proteins
differ; the core antigen is a very potent antigen by both a T cell dependent and
a T cell independent mechanism <xref rid="pone.0014626-Milich1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and is important for cellular immunity. The HBV S
antigen (HBsAg), which is associated with viral adhesion, is also a very potent
and reliable immunogen when assessed by antibody production. Neutralizing
anti-HBs antibodies confer protection against future HBV infection, and all of
the highly efficacious HBV prophylactic vaccines to date use HBsAg <xref rid="pone.0014626-Whittle1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The
excellent safety record with HBsAg was the primary motivation in choosing the
middle surface protein (281 aa) from HBV genotype D as the antigen for
vaccination in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this work was to determine if a heterologous therapeutic vaccination
regimen was safe and effective in HBeAg negative and positive chronic HBV
carriers. Change in viraemia by PCR was the main efficacy endpoint and
sero-reversion the secondary one. The cellular immune response was measured by
IFN-&#x003b3; secretion in an ELISpot assay. Regarding safety, we already had some
supportive safety data from pilot studies in UK and The Gambia on these vaccines
(unpublished results).</p><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as

strain <italic>ayw</italic> (the most common serotype in The Gambia) into the
polylinker cloning region of vector pSG2. It contains the human cytomegalovirus

minimum number in order to meet the study objectives of assessing preliminary
safety of the vaccines and determining its efficacy at reducing HBV DNA levels
based on data about stability of HBV viral load in eAg positive subjects.
Experience with antiviral agents and with vaccines in general suggested that a
relatively large effect size might be expected if the treatment were successful.

rodents and non-human primates, then 8 per group would be adequate to find this
effect <xref rid="pone.0014626-Schneider2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. After gaining experience with likely numbers of dropouts

been enrolled in violation of the protocol. We then re-tested baseline screening
samples and found that 6 volunteers had incorrect HBeAg determination then. In
one case this was due to a borderline result, in two cases due to spontaneous
loss of HBeAg in the period between the screening assay and the beginning of the
study interventions, and in three cases to communication errors. Because the
interventions and monitoring in group G were identical to those in group C, we
reallocated the participant from group G to group C for the efficacy analyses.
This made it possible for this person's results to be analyzed with the
group that they should have been in, had the assignment been made correctly at
the outset. The results from the other 5 participants (4 in group I and 1 in

documented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0014626-t004">Table 4</xref>).
No changes outside of the normal ranges were observed in the vital signs
during 1 h post-vaccination. An episode of mild diarrhoea and one of mild
fever were reported which resolved without treatment within 2 or 3 days
respectively. Painful lymphadenopathy was found in one person in the first

A 1.5 cm right axillary lymph node was palpated ipsilateral to the
vaccination site in the skin over the deltoid muscle though there were no
other abnormal symptoms or signs and no restriction of arm movements. By day
10 the swelling had resolved.</p><p>A characteristic local reaction was observed after administration of MVA.HBs.
After the intradermal injection, a small vesicle developed at the site,
signifying correct intradermal injection technique. This disappeared within
30 minutes of vaccination. Induration developed during the first 2 days
after vaccination, in most cases, non-tender. There was no limitation of arm
movement. Subsequently, redness, induration and scaling were observed on the
2<sup>nd</sup> day post-vaccination which developed to maximal size by
the 4<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> day post-vaccination and gradually
disappeared, leaving a shiny plaque scar of 3 to 5 mm diameter by the
28<sup>th</sup> day post-vaccination as shown in the photograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014626-g003">Figure 3</xref>. This developed
by 4 weeks post-vaccination in approximately 1/2 of the cases and by 5 weeks
in approximately 3/4 of the cases, the remaining cases taking up to 14 weeks
to appear. The maximal diameter of the redness, induration and scaling
varied from 2 mm to 13 mm, 0.5 mm to 15 mm and 0.3 mm to 12 mm respectively.
These were similar for both dose regimens of MVA.HBs. However, a
significantly higher proportion of volunteers who received

However, the effect is interesting and it is biologically plausible that the

vaccination regimen: priming with a DNA vaccine encoding the HBV surface
protein and boosting with a recombinant poxvirus encoding the same antigen,
in HBeAg-positive (generally high viraemia) and HBeAg-negative (generally
low viraemia) healthy volunteers with chronic HBV, in some cases with
concomitant lamivudine antiviral therapy. The vaccination regimens were
well-tolerated but failed to achieve a reduction in HBV viraemia.
Importantly, although there were a small number of volunteers in each
treatment group, there was sufficient power to detect statistically
significant effects during the treatment period, as demonstrated in the
groups receiving lamivudine and as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0014626-t005">Table 5</xref>. Also, as expected, this
lamivudine-induced drop was greater in people with HBeAg-positive than in
those with HBeAg-negative infection, as the latter began with markedly lower
viral loads, and because the quantitative PCR assay performs less accurately
at or near its limit of quantifiability.</p><p>There was high variability in net spots in fresh <italic>ex vivo</italic>
IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assays. The reasons why the background spots were so high
are unknown, but the frequent bouts of malaria and other maladies which were
reported as unsolicited adverse events may have caused temporary increases
in nonspecific immune responses in the volunteers. ICCS in groups I and J
suggested that NK and NKT cells produced IFN-&#x003b3; in a peptide-nonspecific
fashion after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2"><title>Possible mechanisms and explanations</title><p>The optimal dose of an immunogen is very difficult to predict <xref rid="pone.0014626-Cavenaugh2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.
Initially doses of 1 mg pSG2.HBS and 5&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> pfu MVA.HBs were
chosen. Later higher doses were used based on immunogenicity results of
studies of similar malaria vaccines. That participants in the lower-dose
vaccine group had 5 times more mild to moderate adverse events than those in
the higher-dose group may be due to seasonal effects. Malaria was the most
commonly observed unsolicited adverse event and is highly seasonal in The
Gambia. Malaria season corresponded to the follow-up period for the
lower-dose groups.</p><p>No effects were observed on transaminase levels, anti-HBe seroconversion, or
HBsAg seroreversion after 9&#x02013;11 months of follow up. One person lost
HBeAg, but spontaneous loss of HBeAg occurs not infrequently, as
demonstrated by the 2 participants who lost HBeAg in the interval between
first screening and repeat baseline testing. The mean annual rate of
spontaneous seroconversion has been estimated at 8&#x00025; to 15&#x00025; in
individuals with active liver disease and 2&#x00025; to 5&#x00025; in those
with normal ALT <xref rid="pone.0014626-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In another recent study we reported that
86&#x00025; of HBV infected children in Gambia recruited between the ages of
1&#x02013;4 years, lost HBeAg by the age of 19 years, compared to 30&#x00025;
who lost HBsAg <xref rid="pone.0014626-Mendy2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.</p><p>One possible reason for vaccination failure is antigenic diversity. In Gambia
there are two HBV genotypes: about 87&#x00025; are genotype E, the rest A
<xref rid="pone.0014626-Dumpis1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.
pSG2.HBS and MVA.HBs contain a genotype D sequence, which is 93&#x00025;
identical amino acids to genotype E <xref rid="pone.0014626-Nakajima1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. It is unlikely that
this significantly affected T cell responses. This is not a likely
explanation for the failure of these vaccinations.</p><p>Another possible reason for the lack of efficacy is the profound immune
tolerance which most infected persons in The Gambia have towards HBV. It is
acquired in early childhood or at birth, in contrast to people in Europe who
mostly acquire it as adults. Thus, the efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents
may differ based on the epidemiology of the disease, associated with
circumstances of acquisition and immune tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s5a3"><title>Comparison with other published studies</title><p>Other studies have assessed HBV vaccine therapy for chronic HBV infection
<xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Couillin1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Dahmen1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Horiike1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Pol1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The low
efficacy found in this study contrasts with findings from some other studies
which show that vaccine therapy in combination with antiviral drugs
decreases HBV viral replication and HBV DNA to undetectable levels by
inducing HBsAg-specific T-cells. Horiike et al. <xref rid="pone.0014626-Horiike1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> describe intradermal
administration of HBsAg protein with 1 year lamivudine therapy and found
seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe in 5 of 9 participants. However, that
study was conducted in older people who may have acquired infection in
adulthood and have elevated serum ALT levels, which may favor HBV control,
in contrast to the young healthy chronic HBV carriers used in the present
study. Dahmen et al. <xref rid="pone.0014626-Dahmen1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> show that 4 of 14 (28.6&#x00025;) chronic HBV
carriers with unfavorable prognostic factors, such as pre-core HBV mutants
or previous interferon-&#x003b1; non-response, had viral clearance and
biochemical responses when given HBV surface protein with alumimium
hydroxide with lamivudine or interleukin-2 combination therapy. Yalcin et
al. showed no significant effects on HBV levels, HBeAg to anti-HBe
seroconversion or on transaminase levels following 3 intramuscular
injections of a recombinant DNA vaccine also coding for HBsAg <xref rid="pone.0014626-Yalcin1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. The
variability seen between these studies may be due to variability in the
populations and the stage of infection, different vaccines, frequency or
route of administration and other factors.</p><p>There are favorable reports <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> of using HBsAg in a DNA vaccine in chronically
infected individuals. One difference between the studies is the number of
DNA immunizations: four DNA immunizations with improvement seen after three
immunizations, compared to two followed by MVA vaccines. This does not seem
to be the sole explanation, however, in light of the human malaria DNA, MVA
studies in which we showed very high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; producing T cells
(which were mostly CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells) <xref rid="pone.0014626-McConkey1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The French group
<xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> reporting the
positive phase I trial result from DNA immunization alone used prolonged
cultured ELISpot (for 2 weeks), whereas in the current study all of the
ELISpots were ex vivo stimulated for less than 24 hours. The most important
difference between the current study and that of Mancini-Bourgine <xref rid="pone.0014626-ManciniBourgine2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> was that the current one included an untreated
control group.</p><p>Only weak correlation (e.g., &#x02212;0.117) was seen between any of the
ELISpot immunogenicity measures and viraemia, in contrast to the strong
correlation reported by Webster <italic>et al.</italic> using MHC-I
tetramers instead of ELISpot <xref rid="pone.0014626-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Besides the assay
differences (phenotypic marker versus functional assay), another possible
reason for this discrepancy is that Webster <italic>et al.</italic> measured
responses to core and polymerase proteins in addition to surface, which was
the only one in this current study. Neither study found any association
between markers of liver damage (AST, ALT) and cellular immune function,
although we did find a weak association between markers of liver damage and
viraemia. Thus, we conclude that HBV infection in Gambia is a heterogeneous
condition which defies finding a relationship easily between viraemia and
immune responses.</p><p>Strong net responses with low background spots, as seen in several cases in
the <italic>ex vivo</italic> ELISpot results in this study, indicate an
incomplete tolerance, and show that the ability to react to HBsAg
specifically is still present in HBeAg negative HBV infected subjects.
Suppressor T cells (also called regulatory T cells or Tregs) may modify the
responses and have been shown to be important in mediating the
immunosuppression characteristic of chronic HBV infections <xref rid="pone.0014626-Barboza1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.
Regulation in immunology seems to have become synonymous with suppression,
but activation and suppression are both forms of regulation. We prefer the
original term (suppressor T cells) as more descriptive.</p><p>Recently results of some similar prime-boost vaccine trials have been
published which were also disappointing <xref rid="pone.0014626-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. In contrast, another
study reports that <italic>in vitro</italic> and in HLA transgenic mice a
multiepitope heterologous prime-boost immunization with the plasmid DNA and
a recombinant MVA worked as a therapeutic vaccine insofar as providing
further enhancement of the immune responses <xref rid="pone.0014626-Depla1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. However, they did not
report any antiviral efficacy. Indeed, another vaccine trial that is similar
to aspects of ours (in particular, the Group F versus Group G comparison,
although with a different vaccine) also reported lack of efficacy of the
therapeutic vaccine to reduce viraemia despite induction of a vigorous
HBsAg-specific lymphoproliferative response <xref rid="pone.0014626-Vandepapelire1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Another earlier
study <xref rid="pone.0014626-Jung2" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>
also reported a lack of efficacy of HBsAg for clearing the virus; the
authors ascribed this to Th2 cytokines produced by HBsAg whereas they found
Th1 cytokines produced by HBcAg. Indeed, in hindsight the short answer to
our failure to generate an antiviral response may well be that we used the
wrong antigen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Generalizability</title><sec id="s5b1"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>This study is longitudinal, dose-ranging, with eAg<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and
eAg<sup>&#x02013;</sup> subjects across a wide range of viraemia, with and
without concomitant lamivudine therapy, in a total of 8 arms. The consistent
picture regarding efficacy that emerges from quantitative virological and
immunological data is that pSG2.HBS and MVA.HBV are unable to break the
profound tolerance of the immune system to HBsAg in HBV chronic carriers. It
is likely that similar results would be seen in other populations including
women, who were not included in this study. Likewise, expanding the age
range considerably would probably not affect the results, although HBV is
usually acquired at a very young age in The Gambia and the immune systems of
very young children may make these results inapplicable to that population.
The safety results of this study are also probably quite valid for a wider
population, since (i) the DNA plasmid had such paltry immunogenicity itself,
(ii) the HBV middle surface protein insert into MVA apparently did not
radically increase its immunogenicity, and (iii) MVA was widely used in the
final stages of the smallpox eradication campaign in Germany and has been
well tolerated in many other studies. It is, however, noteworthy that the
shiny plaques seen at the higher MVA.HBs dose were &#x0201c;completely
missing&#x0201d; after MVA itself administered predominantly to participants
with lightly or non-pigmented skin in Europe <xref rid="pone.0014626-Mayr1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5b2"><title>Research implications</title><p>Did our particular prime-boost vaccines fail because of the particular
antigen chosen, the dosage (typically much higher in animals), or for some
other reason? The most likely reason, we think, is that chronically infected
people are profoundly immunotolerant towards the middle surface protein (M
protein), which has been present in very high levels in blood and
extracellular fluid since early childhood. In contrast, when given as a
vaccine to non-infected people, it is very immunogenic and 2 doses of it in
alum predictably lead to high levels of antibody. The HBV core protein may
have been a better choice as it is strongly immunogenic by both T cell
dependent and T cell independent mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0014626-Milich1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. As pointed out by a
reviewer, better responses might have been achieved by adding in ubiquitous
T cell epitopes or possibly even slightly varying the HBsAg sequence (e.g.,
by 5&#x02013;7&#x00025; mismatches) to help break the tolerance. In the case of
the 3TC-treated volunteers, a longer pre-treatment interval (8&#x02013;12
weeks) might have allowed greater T cell recovery and possibly better
results.</p><p>How can one break the immune tolerance induced by HBV? Because a decrease in
viraemia (as for example during antiviral therapy) leads to increased T cell
responsiveness, and that this is reversible, indicates that tolerance is
actively maintained either directly or indirectly by the virus. There may be
a role of suppressor T cells <xref rid="pone.0014626-Franzese1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014626-Stoop1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. There
is evidence in mice that had been primed by DNA immunization that depleting
suppressor T cells can enhance the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response
against HBV <xref rid="pone.0014626-Yoshihiro1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Overall evidence</title><sec id="s5c1"><title>Limitations of the present study</title><p>The interpretations of the present study need to be limited by the fact that
small or moderate sized effects cannot be excluded by this study design. The
flow cytometry results in groups I and J indicated that most of the
INF-&#x003b3; producing cells were probably NK or NKT lymphocytes. One caveat to
this is that there were very few gated cells making IFN-&#x003b3;, and
statistics with few events are less credible than with many events. However,
these results are consistent with the few spots detected in ELISpot. This
problem was exacerbated by the limited amount of blood taken, the variable
recovery of PBMCs, and the fact that ELISpot had priority over ICCS for use
of PBMCs. Furthermore, NK cells are not uniquely defined by CD16, and the
CD16<sup>lo</sup>CD56<sup>hi</sup> subset of NK cells has been
identified as the subset that makes the most IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0014626-Fehniger1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. For these reasons we
do not claim that the majority of the IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells were
definitely NK or NKT cells, only that the preponderance of evidence &#x02013;
including the ELISpot data and the fact that IFN-&#x003b3; was also made with or
without antigen (peptide) stimulation &#x02013; indicates that this is
likely.</p><p>Finally, this study was not blinded, but that does not seem to have been a
problem given the laboratory nature of the data. We had no bias towards
negative results; all the investigators were optimistic that the study would
have demonstrated efficacy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Methods.</p><p>(0.15 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Results of Exploratory Analyses.</p><p>(0.44 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s003"><label>File S3</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Results of Individual Kinetics.</p><p>(0.19 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s004"><label>File S4</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Results of Unsolicited Adverse Events.</p><p>(0.09 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s005"><label>File S5</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Results of Epitope Screening.</p><p>(0.14 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s006"><label>File S6</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Results of Statistical Significance of ELISpot.</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s007"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(0.23 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s008"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.44 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s009"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.41 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s009.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s010"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.27 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s010.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014626.s011"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Supplementary Material: Dataset.</p><p>(1.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014626.s011.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>First, we acknowledge and thank the study volunteers for their participation.
