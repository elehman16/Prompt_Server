In these studies, Ovaleap&#x000ae; pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional and bioequivalent to the reference follitropin alfa product (Gonal-f&#x000ae;). The objective of the present study is to determine whether Ovaleap&#x000ae; is equivalent to Gonal-f&#x000ae; with respect to the number of oocytes retrieved in infertile but ovulatory women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multinational, multicenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled, assessor-blind, comparative study included infertile normally gonadotrophic women 18 to 37&#x000a0;years old with a body mass index of 18 to 29&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and regular menstrual cycles of 21 to 35&#x000a0;days undergoing ART therapy. During a 5-day fixed-dose phase, women received 150&#x000a0;IU/day of Ovaleap&#x000ae; (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;153) or Gonal-f&#x000ae; (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;146), followed by an up to 15-day dose-adaptation phase during which doses could be adjusted every 3 to 5&#x000a0;days, up to a maximum of 450&#x000a0;IU/day. Ovaleap&#x000ae; was to be deemed equivalent to Gonal-f&#x000ae; if the two-sided 0.95 confidence interval (CI) for the difference in the number of oocytes retrieved fell within the equivalence range of &#x000b1;3 oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Similar numbers of oocytes were retrieved in the 2 treatment groups. The mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD number of oocytes retrieved was 12.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.7 in the Ovaleap&#x000ae; group and 12.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.7 in the Gonal-f&#x000ae; group (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). Regression analysis estimated a mean difference of 0.03 oocytes between the treatment groups (95&#x000a0;% CI: &#x02212;0.76-0.82), which was well within the prespecified equivalence range of &#x000b1;3 oocytes.

Available FSH products include urinary-derived human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), purified urinary FSH, highly purified urinary FSH, and recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>r-hFSH was developed, in part, to increase FSH production independent of urine collection, to ensure greater availability, and to reduce the variability due to the inherent inconsistency of the starting materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. r-hFSH also offers the potential additional benefit of a reduced risk of immunological reactions due to impurities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Marketed r-hFSH products available in Europe include follitropin alfa (Gonal-f&#x000ae; and Bemfola&#x000ae;), follitropin beta (Puregon&#x000ae;), and a long-acting FSH, corifollitropin alfa (Elonva&#x000ae;).</p><p>Ovaleap&#x000ae; (follitropin alfa) is an r-hFSH manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It was developed as a biosimilar to Gonal-f&#x000ae; as recommended by the European Union in their guidelines for the clinical development of biological medicinal products that contain r-hFSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and was approved by the European Medicines Association as a biosimilar in 2013. Biosimilar formulations represent products with demonstrated similarity in physicochemical characteristics, efficacy, and safety to an approved product in comprehensive comparability studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Ovaleap&#x000ae; is primarily intended for use in controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing ART procedures and for the treatment of anovulation. It is also indicated to treat women with severe FSH or luteinizing hormone deficiency and to stimulate spermatogenesis in men. The amino acid sequence of Ovaleap&#x000ae; is identical to that of the follitropins currently registered in Europe, and its tertiary structure is also similar.</p><p>Two pharmacokinetic studies of Ovaleap&#x000ae; in healthy female subjects have provided preliminary evidence of its potential utility. In a dose-response study, Ovaleap&#x000ae; administered in single subcutaneous (SC) doses up to 300&#x000a0;IU to healthy pituitary down-regulated women (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40), demonstrated dose-proportionality and was well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A second study demonstrated the bioequivalence of 300&#x000a0;IU of Ovaleap&#x000ae; and 300&#x000a0;IU of Gonal-f&#x000ae; as assessed by peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In both of these pharmacokinetic studies, Ovaleap&#x000ae; was safe and well tolerated.</p><p>The primary objective of this phase 3 patient-study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Ovaleap&#x000ae; compared with Gonal-f&#x000ae; in terms of the number of oocytes retrieved and safety in infertile ovulatory women undergoing ART therapy. The number of oocytes retrieved is the primary endpoint recommended by the European Medicines Agency for studies evaluating the clinical comparability of Gonal-f&#x000ae; and the similar formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, historical data have demonstrated the strong association between the number of retrieved eggs and live birth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other efficacy parameters were also compared, as were safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multinational, randomized, active-controlled, assessor (ie, investigator and embryologist)-blinded, parallel-group patient study conducted between March 2010 and July 2011 in 20 centers in 5 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and Poland). The study protocol and informed consent documents were approved by the relevant independent ethics committees. The study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guideline, according to the International Conference on Harmonisation and the Declaration of Helsinki (1996).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Women aged 18 to 37&#x000a0;years were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were infertile but otherwise healthy, were normally gonadotrophic, had 2 confirmed normal ovaries, and were undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation with ART therapy. Women also must have had regular menstrual cycles of 21 to 35&#x000a0;days; body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and basal FSH, estradiol, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations in the normal range.</p><p>Women who had more than 2 previously completed consecutive unsuccessful in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles or more than 3 miscarriages were excluded from the trial; as were women with a history of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as defined by Papanikolaou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], primary ovarian failure or being categorized as poor responders to ovarian stimulation, or hypersensitivity or allergy to rFSH preparations. Also excluded from the trial were women who had any significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, hepatic, or renal disease; or neoplasm or a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy; or who had used clomiphene or gonadotropins within 30&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment.</p><p>To become eligible for inclusion in the study, participants were required to give written informed consent.

The randomization scheme was computer-generated and stratified by study center using a block size of 2. Women with ovarian cysts &#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mm, verified by ultrasound after down-regulation, could not be randomized to study treatment and were excluded from the trial. Investigators received no information about treatment allocation and the size of the randomization blocks was not disclosed in the protocol or to the study centers. The investigators and embryologists were kept blinded and performed all assessments without knowledge of treatment.</p><p>Ovaleap&#x000ae; (Merckle Biotec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) was supplied in glass cartridges containing 900&#x000a0;IU in 1.5&#x000a0;mL solution to be administered from a reusable semi-automated pen device. Gonal-f&#x000ae; (Merck Serono S.p.A., Modugno, Italy) contained 900&#x000a0;IU in 1.5&#x000a0;mL solution to be administered using a prefilled pen. Because the drugs were administered using two different and unique pen devices, a double-blind study design was not feasible. However, a single-blind design was maintained through the use of a &#x0201c;drug administrator&#x0201d; (eg, a physician or nurse) who instructed the patient how to use the study drug, but who was not involved in any study assessments. The drug administrator also instructed the patient not to disclose her assigned study drug (Ovaleap&#x000ae; or Gonal-f&#x000ae;) to the investigator and the embryologist.</p><p>Eligible patients were treated for 1 stimulation cycle with Ovaleap&#x000ae; or Gonal-f&#x000ae; as stimulating agent using a long GnRH agonist protocol. Patients received SC injections in fixed doses of 150&#x000a0;IU of Ovaleap&#x000ae; or Gonal-f&#x000ae; daily for the first 5&#x000a0;days. The first dose was injected by the drug administrator at the study center; subsequent doses were self-administered by the patient. To achieve adequate follicular development, doses could be adjusted (up or down) at the investigators&#x02019; discretion (based on their assessment of follicle count, size, and appearance) after Day 5 every 3 to 5&#x000a0;days through Day 20 in increments of 37.5&#x000a0;IU (but no more than 150&#x000a0;IU) to a maximum of 450&#x000a0;IU/day, based on serum estradiol levels and ultrasound examinations.</p><p>Women who had at least 3 follicles with a mean diameter of 17&#x000a0;mm, as assessed using transvaginal ultrasound, and estradiol levels below 5500&#x000a0;pg/mL then received human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Ovitrelle&#x000ae;, Merck Serono S.p.A., Modugno, Italy) to induce follicular maturation and trigger ovulation.</p><p>Oocyte retrieval took place 34 to 37&#x000a0;h after hCG administration. Luteal support was provided after oocyte retrieval at the investigators&#x02019; discretion. Evaluation of biochemical pregnancy (defined as a positive &#x003b2;-hCG test) occurred 16 to 19&#x000a0;days after oocyte retrieval, while evaluation of clinical pregnancy (defined as gestational sac with fetal heart activity) occurred 5 to 7&#x000a0;weeks post-oocyte retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary endpoint was the number of oocytes retrieved. Secondary endpoints included total r-hFSH dose, number of patients needing dose adaptations, duration of dosing, number of follicles, serum estradiol concentration, and endometrial thickness prior to dose adaptation (Stimulation Day 6) and on the day of hCG injection, and cancellation rate prior to oocyte retrieval. After oocyte retrieval and fertilization, fertilization outcome was assessed and recorded using the following categories: without pronucleus (PN), 1 PN, 2 PN, 3 or more PN, and other. The quality of all 2 PN oocytes (zygotes) was then evaluated using the zygote scoring system of Scott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Number of embryos obtained, transferred, and cryopreserved; biochemical and clinical pregnancy rate; and take-home baby rate (defined as the percentage of randomized patients with live births) were also assessed. Patients with clinical pregnancies were followed until birth for any complications during pregnancy and delivery.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were monitored by recording treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including OHSS; results of laboratory tests, including assessments of hematology, clinical chemistry, hormone levels, and immunogenicity (antibody levels); electrocardiograms (ECGs); vital signs; body weight measurements; local and overall tolerability, physical examinations, and patient satisfaction with the pen device.</p><p>Anti-FSH antibodies were assessed in all randomized patients at 3 time points: baseline, day of oocyte retrieval, and 3&#x000a0;months after the last administration of Ovaleap&#x000ae; or Gonal-f&#x000ae;. Serum samples were assessed for the presence of anti-FSH antibodies using validated assays at 2 central laboratories. The initial anti-drug antibodies assay was revised for sensitive detection of anti-Ovaleap&#x000ae; and anti-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (anti-Neu5Gc) antibodies in human serum samples. The sensitivity of the new assay increased by about 10-fold.</p><p>Patients evaluated injection-site pain after each injection using a numerical scale ranging from 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (the most severe pain). They also recorded the presence and intensity of injection-site reactions, such as redness, bruising, swelling, burning, or skin irritation. In addition, patients rated the convenience of the pen using a 3-point rating scale, as well as their satisfaction with the administration of r-hFSH using a pen by completing a questionnaire based on that used by Somkuti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate equivalence of Ovaleap&#x000ae; compared with Gonal-f&#x000ae; with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the number of oocytes retrieved. A sample size of 124 patients per group was determined to be necessary to achieve 90&#x000a0;% power (a two-sided level of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) for rejecting the null hypothesis that Ovaleap&#x000ae; is different from Gonal-f&#x000ae;. Ovaleap&#x000ae; was to be considered clinically equivalent to Gonal-f&#x000ae; if the difference in the mean number of oocytes retrieved between the 2 groups was &#x02264;&#x02009;3 (primary endpoint). The prespecified margin of 3 oocytes has been used in previous equivalence trials of Gonal-f&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The anticipated difference in the expected mean number of oocytes was &#x02264;&#x02009;0.5 with a common standard deviation of 6 oocytes. Assuming that about 10&#x000a0;% of patients would not be eligible for the analysis of the primary endpoint due to protocol violations or dropouts, 140 patients per treatment group were to be included in the trial.</p><p>A zero-inflated Poisson regression (ZIP) was used to assess the primary endpoint, with treatment and country as fixed factors and age as a covariate. The primary endpoint was evaluated in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) as well as in those who did not have any major protocol violations (according-to-protocol [ATP] population). The safety analysis included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of r-hFSH (Ovaleap&#x000ae; or Gonal-f&#x000ae;). A stratified post-hoc analysis of clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates by baseline and post-baseline characteristics was also performed.</p><p>Secondary endpoints, presented only for the ITT population, were assessed using descriptive statistics (eg, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD, median, and range). Stratified odds ratios and related <italic>P</italic>-values on secondary endpoints were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel tests. Since resultant <italic>P</italic>-values were regarded as supportive only, no adjustment for multiple testing was made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Subject disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 398 women screened, 299 were randomized (ITT population) to receive either Ovaleap&#x000ae; (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;153) or Gonal-f&#x000ae; (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;146), as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

In addition, the secondary study endpoints of follicle number and size and endometrial thickness were comparable between groups at the end of the fixed-dose phase, and the numbers of oocytes retrieved were similar in patients who did not require dose adaptation, suggesting the clear comparability of these formulations. Oocyte quality, as assessed by Z scores, was also similar between groups, with no clinically significant differences observed. The number of oocytes retrieved in patients treated with Ovaleap&#x000ae; and Gonal-f&#x000ae; were also comparable to those in previous studies of Gonal-f&#x000ae; in infertile patients who were treated with a long protocol and down-regulated with a GnRH agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The clinical pregnancy rate for patients associated with Gonal-f&#x000ae; treatment has ranged from 23&#x000a0;% to 39&#x000a0;% in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The clinical pregnancy rates with embryo transfer of 30.7&#x000a0;% for Ovaleap&#x000ae;-treated patients and 38.8&#x000a0;% for Gonal-f&#x000ae;&#x02013;treated patients in this study both are consistent with that range. The difference in clinical pregnancy rates between groups was not statistically significant and may be indicative of the substantial variability in clinical pregnancy rates we observed between study sites and countries of origin. For example, clinical pregnancy rates were as low as 20.4&#x000a0;% with Ovaleap&#x000ae; in Poland and as high as 35.9&#x000a0;% in Hungary. With Gonal-f&#x000ae;, clinical pregnancy rates were as low as 16.7&#x000a0;% in Belgium&#x02009;+&#x02009;Germany and as high as 44.7&#x000a0;% in Hungary.</p><p>Higher clinical pregnancy rates in the Gonal-f&#x000ae; group were seen in the Czech Republic (42.3&#x000a0;% vs 36.0&#x000a0;%), Hungary (46.0&#x000a0;% vs 36.8&#x000a0;%), and Poland (40.4&#x000a0;% vs 20.8&#x000a0;%). In Belgium&#x02009;+&#x02009;Germany, however, the clinical pregnancy rate was higher in the Ovaleap&#x000ae; group than in the Gonal-f&#x000ae; group (33.3&#x000a0;% vs 20.8&#x000a0;%). The stratified post-hoc analysis of clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates by baseline and post-baseline characteristics did not reveal any findings to explain the differences in rates among sites and countries.</p><p>An important goal toward improving ART is to lower the rate at which couples discontinue ART. Interviews with couples have revealed that the emotional stress or psychological burden involved with the treatment process is an important factor determining the risk of treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Research with regard to patient preferences during infertility treatment is scarce; although patient preference or perceived convenience may drive the choice of gonadotropic agent. For example, a recent questionnaire study conducted in Sweden showed that patients preferred ovarian stimulation treatments that they believed would reduce dose variability and were easy to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The authors of this study speculated that patients equate dose variability with poor quality and a greater risk of TEAEs, such as OHSS.</p><p>In the present study, the Ovaleap&#x000ae; pen device received high patient ratings in overall ease of use and confidence in accurate dosing. Patients were able to self-administer after only one demonstration on site. Although the majority of patients had previous experience using the Gonal-f&#x000ae; pen, patients assigned to Ovaleap&#x000ae; were similarly confident about the accuracy of dosing and administration, indicating the ease of use of the Ovaleap&#x000ae; pen. Taking patient convenience into consideration, using pen devices may be an important way to help reduce the psychological stress of fertility treatment and perhaps improve treatment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Ovaleap&#x000ae; was found to have a favorable safety profile, similar to that of Gonal-f&#x000ae;, with no new unexpected safety concerns identified. OHSS was the most common TEAE (11/153, 7.2&#x000a0;%), and all episodes (except in 1 patient who was lost to follow-up) resolved. The numbers of OHSS cases were small with no statistically significant differences between groups, and comparable to that seen with other FSH products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>One potential limitation of this randomized, multicenter, and otherwise well-designed study is that the lack of patient blinding due to the use of the patent-protected Gonal-f&#x000ae; pen device could result in bias. However, because this study design was similar to that of other comparative studies of ART using r-hFSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this potential bias was not considered to be a significant concern. It is also conceivable that regional variations in laws, practices, and preferences with regard to ART practices, which may have contributed to the differences in clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates from country to country, may have introduced bias. In addition, the relative leanness of the patients included in this study (mean BMI, 22&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) should also be considered when generalizing study results to other patient populations.</p><p>Although the primary endpoint of our study was the number of oocytes retrieved, live birth rates might have been a more clinically meaningful outcome to patients. However, the number of oocytes retrieved is the primary endpoint recommended by the European Medicines Agency for studies evaluating the clinical comparability of Gonal-f&#x000ae; and biosimilar formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and using live birth rates as a primary outcome would have required a much larger, more resource-intensive study. In addition, pregnancy rates and live birth rates are influenced by a variety of factors beyond the scope of r-hFSH treatment that are difficult to control. Moreover, a strong association between the number of retrieved eggs and live birth rates has previously been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found Ovaleap&#x000ae; to be a safe and effective r-hFSH for stimulation of follicular development in infertile women undergoing ART and similar to Gonal-f&#x000ae; in its safety and efficacy.
