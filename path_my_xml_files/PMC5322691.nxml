This condition occurs right before or during menstruation without any describable macroscopic pelvic pathology.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In general, 50% of women suffer from dysmenorrhea and 10% experience this condition for 1&#x02013;3 days a month.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] One study reported the prevalence of dysmenorrhea to be over 75%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In another study in Sweden, more than 72% of 19-year-old women suffered from this condition (34%, 23%, and 15% of the participants had mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This rate was reported as 71% in Iran.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Dysmenorrhea can reduce efficiency and production due to daily stresses and socioeconomic losses.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the US, at least 600 million hours and 2 billion dollars are lost due to dysmenorrhea every year. In addition, dysmenorrhea affects young girls' opinion about femininity and method of childbirth.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] For the treatment and control of dysmenorrhea, there are many ways:[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] common drug interventions for reduction of pain include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptive pills. Despite their usefulness, these medications are accompanied by side effects, drug dependency, and unnecessary costs.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Their side effects include diarrhea, stomachache, nausea,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] renal complications, hepatic complications, blood problems, edema, sleepiness,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indigestion, and fatigue.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Other treatment methods also include supplementary vegetarian diet, vitamins, minerals, nerve block, spinal manipulation, magneto-inertial fusion,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupressure, acupuncture, rest, muscle relaxation, reflexology, hand pressure, heat, aromatherapy, and physical therapy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Since the acupressure is a new therapy, the side effects of drug therapies are not readily acceptable.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, but the rationales for using complementary and alternative medicine have been widely used for many years, and they are accepted by many people and doctors.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Approximately 38.2 million adult people in America have used complementary medicine (herbs and supplements) in 2002. Moreover, more than half of them said that complementary medicine was important to their health and well-being,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] besides the points examined in this study. In reviewing the past 30 years, no article has been found. Hence, the acupressure points in this research are entirely new.</p><p>According to the gate control theory of pain, cutaneous stimulation through massaging, needling, and scratching can stimulate large fiber nerves that transfer nervous impulses to the spinal cord. In case this stimulation is continued, it can close pain gates, eventually reducing the feeling of pain. Evidence has shown acupressure as a noninvasive, inexpensive, safe, and simple method for reduction of labor pain.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In the study by Wang <italic>et al</italic>., (2010) acupressure was applied at Sanyinjiao (SP-6) acupoint for 20 min to assess its effect on menstrual pain and distress in young women suffering from dysmenorrhea. The results revealed a significant decrease in pain in acupressure and self-care training groups based on short-form McGill pain questionnaire.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In another study in Iran, acupressure at SP-6 acupoint significantly reduced the intensity of dysmenorrhea in the intervention group compared to the control group 30 min and 1, 2, and 3 h after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, our aim is to perform acupressure at Guan yuan (RN-4) and Qu gu (RN-2) acupoints located on the abdominal meridian between the navel and the symphysis pubis and compare its effect to that of using ibuprofen (control group). RN-4 acupoint is located on the midline, 3 cuns below the navel. Pressure is applied on this point in dysmenorrhea and irregular menstrual cycles. RN-2 acupoint is also located on the midline, 5 cuns below the navel, 1 cun between the two grooves of the interphalangeal joints of the massager&#x02019;s middle finger.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The rationale for using self-care education to increase awareness of one&#x02019;s own body and the adoption of appropriate health behavior and lifestyle modification such as diet and exercise will lead to the improvement of dysmenorrheal.</p><p>Considering the limited interventions in this regard and importance of complementary medicine, the present study aims to compare self-care behaviors training, acupressure at RN-4 and RN-2 acupoints, and ibuprofen consumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subject/participants</title><p>The present randomized clinical trial was conducted on 120 nonmedical students (three groups of 40) living in dormitories of Shiraz University Shiraz, Iran.

Chang and Chuang conducted a study to introduce the effective factors in dysmenorrhea. In that study, the participants with moderate dysmenorrhea received self-care behaviors training, and the results showed that training self-care behaviors at schools were one of the effective methods in reduction of dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Chen <italic>et al</italic>. also carried out a research on self-care behaviors using herbal medicines and complementary medicine in primary dysmenorrhea among Taiwanese adolescents. The results of the study by Chen <italic>et al</italic>. revealed the necessity to educate individuals regarding the effect of food diet and effective herbal medications on the treatment of dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In that study, the participants mentioned the reduction of physical activities as a self-care behavior, but the researchers modified this opinion and trained individuals regarding aerobic exercises as a self-care behavior to decrease their pain. The findings of our study were similar to those obtained by Kannan <italic>et al</italic>., who investigated the effect of heavy exercises on the treatment of dysmenorrhea using McGill pain questionnaire. The results of that study demonstrated that exercising was effective in reduction of pain without any side effects.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In contrast, Shafaie-Sehati <italic>et al</italic>. found no significant difference between athletic and nonathletic groups with respect to the frequency of dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In the present study, self-care behaviors training resulted in a reduction of pain and exercising was among the bases of this training. Exercising enters the body in the state of hypoxia where beta-endorphin levels increase. For instance, higher beta-endorphin levels were reported in newborns with hypoxia. Therefore, hypoxia and acidosis stimulate production of beta-endorphins, and the relationship between breathing and beta-endorphin production can be associated with the effect of acidosis on the two through different mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Reduction of pain after self-care training can also be attributed to the control of prostaglandins. In fact, aerobic exercises empty the uterus from waste materials and prostaglandins, which are the main cause of pain, eventually reducing the duration of pain through the menstrual cycle.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In another survey exercise after 6 weeks is created flexibility in the hamstring, back and hip muscles, and reduces pain.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Yoga has also been effective in reducing the severity and duration of pain.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>The current study at the second part findings showed a significant difference in the acupressure group&#x02019;s pain intensity before and after the intervention. Considering the limited number of studies conducted on RN-4 and RN-2 acupoints, the results of performance of acupressure at other points have been discussed in this section.</p><p>In the study by Yeh <italic>et al</italic>., pressure was applied for 1 min four times a day for 2 days, which is different from our study. Pain intensity was evaluated using VAS and McGill pain questionnaire. The results showed a significant difference in each group&#x02019;s pain intensity before and after the intervention.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] In the present study, however, the study groups' pain intensity was significantly different only based on McGill pain questionnaire. Other researches have also revealed the effectiveness of acupressure in treatment of dysmenorrhea and relaxation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>In a review study about efficacy of self-acupressure showed several studies (eight RCTs and two quasi-RCTs) have a positive effect and effective on primary dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] In another study concluded that enough evidence not exists for the effectiveness of acupressure or acupuncture and RCT larger studies are needed.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The analgesic effect of acupressure can be due to release of endorphins and glucocorticoids that block pain gates.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Acupressure, in fact, refers to the touch technique for balancing human body&#x02019;s energy flow or QI.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This method leads to the release of various neurotransmitters, which cut the nervous signals transferred by the nervous system. It also inhibits secretion of prostaglandins, reduces stimulation of cerebral cortex, and regulates secretion of endocrine hormones.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Based on McGill pain questionnaire scores, the control group&#x02019;s pain intensity scores were significantly different before and after the intervention. Similarly, the results of the studies by Zafari[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Witt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] indicated the effectiveness of ibuprofen. However, the results obtained by Salmalian were on the contrary to those of the present study.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] In general, NSAIDs are the first-line treatment, but their side effects, including gastrointestinal problems, make patients choose alternative therapies.</p><p>Overall, the results of the current study showed a significant difference among the three groups regarding the intensity of pain, and that training and acupressure were more effective compared to consumption of ibuprofen.</p><p>In this study, new and effective acupoints were employed, whereas the previous studies had not used such a combination of effective points. Furthermore, no similar studies were found on performing acupressure at these acupoints.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was the difficulty in obtaining the required permissions from dormitories and performing the procedures privately. Hence, probable physiological tolerance of pain in each people is different, so feel pain is different, as well as contrast to the reactions and feelings of loss pain after pain relief methods will be different, which is beyond the control of the researcher. Another limitation was to assess the severity of pain after intervention. In order to solve the problem and avoid bias in sampling, research assistant assessed pain intensity after intervention. Finally, due to the different time periods, research conducted at the same time for all units is not possible.</p><p>Future studies are recommended to compare the effects of acupressure at other acupoints and common chemical and herbal drugs on primary dysmenorrhea in larger populations.</p><p>Suggestions for future research: (1) comparison the effect of other point of acupressure on severity of primary dysmenorrhea with the RN-2, RN-4 points. (2) The application of educational models such as BASNEF models on knowledge and attitudes of people with primary dysmenorrhea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to the current study results, the most effective method in reduction of dysmenorrhea was self-care behaviors training followed by acupressure at RN-4 and RN-2 acupoints and consumption of ibuprofen. Considering the side effects of consuming ibuprofen drug, training and acupressure as nonpharmacological, easy, safe, and inexpensive methods can be incorporated into the curricula of girls' high schools. Considering the effectiveness of acupressure in reducing dysmenorrheal, obstetricians, gynecologists, and midwives have recommended acupressure not only in the treatment of dysmenorrhea but also in reducing labor pain and pain control. The effective nondrug method that is the responsibility of the midwifery, and in clinics and delivery room applications and even self-education is also applicable.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study is funded by the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors contributed to the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article is a part of Lala Ansaripour thesis (thesis number: 92-6900, IRCT: 2013071013940N1).
