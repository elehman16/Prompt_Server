Current convention selects sperm by vigour and morphology, but preliminary evidence suggests selection based on hyaluronic acid binding may be beneficial. The aim of the Hyaluronic Acid Binding Sperm Selection (HABSelect) trial is to determine the efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA)-selection of sperm versus conventionally selected sperm prior to ICSI on live birth rate (LBR). The mechanistic aim is to assess whether and how the chromatin state of HA-selected sperm corresponds with clinical outcomes&#x02014;clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), LBR and pregnancy loss (PL).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Couples attending UK Centres will be approached, eligibility screening performed and informed consent sought. Randomisation will occur within 24&#x02005;hours prior to ICSI treatment. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 to the intervention arm (physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection, PICSI) versus the control arm using conventional methods (ICSI). The primary clinical outcome is LBR &#x02265;37&#x02005;weeks' gestation with the mechanistic study determining LBR's relationship with sperm DNA integrity. Secondary outcomes will determine this for CPR and PL. Only embryologists performing the procedure will be aware of the treatment allocation. Steps will be taken to militate against biases arising from embryologists being non-blinded. Randomisation will use a minimisation algorithm to balance for key prognostic variables. The trial is powered to detect a 5% difference (24&#x02013;29%: p=0.05) in LBR &#x02265;37&#x02005;weeks' gestation. Selected residual sperm samples will be tested by one or more assays of DNA integrity.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>HABSelect is a UK NIHR-EME funded study (reg no 11/14/34; IRAS REF. 13/YH/0162).

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In 2012, almost 47&#x02005;000 couples in the UK alone were treated with ART, comprising 62&#x02005;000 treatment cycles, over half of which involved intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a technique originally developed to treat male infertility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Currently, live birth rates (LBRs) following ICSI treatment are at an average of &#x0223c;24% per treatment cycle, a rate that has remained virtually unchanged in the last 10&#x02005;years. Up to 50% of infertility cases are thought to have a male factor origin<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and with ICSI fast becoming the favoured choice for fertilisation irrespective of the male factor,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> there is a more urgent need for improvements in its efficacy. To date, however, compared with egg and embryo quality, relatively little effort has been expended on improving sperm quality beyond processing semen according to WHO guidelines.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Such processing may be less effective for ICSI where the egg itself offers no effective barrier to direct insemination by defective sperm, and sperm selection is subjectively dependent on the treating embryologist.</p><p>Sperm chromatin structure plays a vital role in protecting paternal DNA integrity by condensing the sperm DNA over 10-fold compared with somatic cell nuclei. Ordinarily, natural selection is effective at screening out defective sperm that have failed to maintain DNA integrity as they transport through the female reproductive tract. Importantly, as this &#x02018;triaging&#x02019; step is omitted in the direct sperm transfer of ICSI, a greater understanding of the relationship between sperm DNA integrity (and conversely DNA fragmentation) and embryonic developmental potential is needed. Numerous studies have shown clear inverse relationships between sperm DNA fragmentation anomalies in the ejaculate and clinical pregnancy (CPR) or live birth (LBR) rates in in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;10</xref> However, the relationship with ICSI outcomes is less clear. We, among others, have reported that miscarriage is a risk factor in ICSI in relation to sperm DNA fragmentation,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and this may result from an oocyte-mediated DNA repair process<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> that adequately supports clinical pregnancy (hence the lack of an association between DNA fragmentation and clinical pregnancy in ICSI compared with IVF), but may be inadequate to sustain it with resulting pregnancy loss (PL). There remains a need to develop more sophisticated techniques to identify functional spermatozoa from those that are immotile, have poor morphology, have poor DNA integrity or are simply incapable of fertilising oocytes. ART sperm preparation including differential density gradient centrifugation has been found to result in enrichment of sperm with intact chromatin, which in turn is likely to improve the chances of a successful clinical outcome.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While success rates are known to vary widely across clinics, further innovations are needed to improve the plateaued average LBR of 24% for IVF and IVF-ICSI.</p><p>Selecting sperm binding to hyaluronic acid (HA) for ICSI is thought to be one such innovation. HA is the natural, non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan secretion of the cervical mucus and the cumulus-&#x000f6;opherus complex.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Sperm reaching HA-coated surfaces can bind to and potentially digest the HA, and their subsequent hyperactivation may further facilitate their reaching the egg.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Immature sperm with excessive cytoplasm appear to have a lower affinity for HA and higher rates of aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Studies using a HA-selection procedure for ICSI reported higher numbers of grade 1 embryos following ICSI,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> an increase in clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) with a corresponding drop in miscarriage rate<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and most recently, a significant reduction in PL and a significantly improved LBR in this group.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These outcomes, while encouraging, were drawn from relatively small sample sizes that were insufficiently powered to conclusively test the efficacy of sperm selection by HA-binding for ICSI.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

The trial's main strength is its accommodation of clinical and basic science aspects that are fully complementary. Its parallel, mechanistic investigations will allow us to determine whether HA-binding mitigates for potentially genotoxic levels of DNA fragmentation in patients' sperm.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study design and objectives</title><p>HABSelect is of a phase III, two arm, multicentre, blinded, efficacy clinical trial with mechanistic evaluation.

The primary mechanistic objective is to evaluate whether HA-selection can compensate for poor sperm quality and investigate HA-binding score (HBS) in relation to chromatin integrity and LBR.</p><p>Secondary objectives will include a determination of the impact of the intervention on CPR based on detection of fetal heartbeat and/or fetal sac at 6&#x02013;9&#x02005;weeks' gestation and miscarriage rate defined as PL after confirmation of clinical pregnancy.

All participating sites will be recognised teaching institutions (or equivalent) accredited in the performance of ICSI fertility treatments and have been initially selected on the basis of potentially high recruiting capabilities using records held by the Human Fertilisation &#x00026; Embryology Authority (HFEA). Sites commonly have a mix of NHS and private facilities treating publicly funded and fee-paying patients. Ethical approvals will include recruitment not limited to couples receiving NHS reimbursed treatment. To facilitate and assist in achieving recruitment targets, four clinical advisors will be appointed who will oversee their own centres and those in their adjacent regional areas. They will be supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network, which collects recruitment data on a monthly basis. All issues arising during the conduct of the trial will be discussed in regular monthly management meetings and any unresolved issues referred to one of two independent trial overseeing committees. Couples will be identified as candidates for the HABSelect study by local clinical or research staff if they have opted for or been advised to make use of ICSI-based procedures. Normally, routine WHO-based assessment of ejaculate quality is sufficient for men to be selected for ICSI procedures over IVF.</p><p>The clinical team will check that the couple meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>), and only couples meeting these criteria will be approached to provide consent to participate. Screening, confirmation of eligibility and formal enrolment onto the study will be followed by the completion of baseline assessments, and the couple will enter the ICSI clinical care pathway. The female participant will then start a follicle stimulation regimen according to the treatment centres' locally approved protocol.

Hierarchical priority of testing will be Comet (3a)=TUNEL (3b)&#x0003e;HALO (4)=AO (5)&#x0003e;AB (6a)=CMA3 (6b). If sample is limiting, the revised testing priority requires at least one assay of DNA fragmentation (3a preferred) and one assay of chromatin compaction (6b preferred) to be carried out. If there is only sufficient sperm for one assay, then priority will be given to HALO (4) as its measure of DNA fragmentation is closely dependent on chromatin compaction. These priorities may change as more data become available. (B) In brief, the Comet, TUNEL and Acridine Orange assays measure sperm DNA fragmentation. The CMA3 and Aniline Blue assays measure sperm chromatin compaction. HALO is a measure of DNA fragmentation and chromatin compaction. These latent variables will be regarded as covariates in a regression model for HBS, which in turn is a covariate for the logistic regressions for each of the primary and secondary clinical outcomes. The HBS will vary in relation to DNA fragmentation and chromatin compaction and will then predict the key outcomes. Omitted from the diagram are other factors in this relationship that also influence outcomes, namely the treatment given (ICSI/PICSI) and the couples concerned: Nelson and Lawler provide details of nine factors, some of which are non-linear, but for which the chances of outcomes can be derived with an online routine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ivfpredict.com">http://www.ivfpredict.com</ext-link>). We propose to use the Nelson&#x02013;Lawlor log odds as a single predictor variable rather than the nine factors. Note that we anticipate the relationships between HBS, other factors, treatment and the key outcomes to be complex: potentially non-linear. To explore this possibility, the samples will be stratified by HBS as follows: &#x0003c;50%, 50&#x02013;65% and &#x0003e;65% (A). Note that for clarity, the path diagram (B) focuses on only those variables specific to the mechanistic work. HBS, hyaluronan binding score; ICSI, intracytoplasmic sperm injection; PICSI, physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012609f03"/></fig><p>Samples will be selected initially on whether a clinical pregnancy was reported or not (blinded to arm allocation but balanced numbers), and the process reiterated until &#x0223c;1200 samples have been tested with two or more of the same assays across three (&#x0003c;50% 50&#x02013;65%, &#x0003e;65%) sperm HBS strata. The precise number of assays will depend on sample quality, as measured by cytology, based mainly on the number of recovered sperm. A hierarchy of assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012609F3">figure 3</xref>A) also takes account of limited sperm numbers following cytological inspection that may be encountered in any sample, while making provision for maximising information content. In addition to cytology, should only two tests be possible, the hierarchy will always include one assay of DNA fragmentation (Comet or TUNEL) and one assay of chromatin compaction (Aniline Blue or CMA3). HALO overlaps both variables and will be used where only one assay is possible. The mechanistic sample size is based on the structural equation modelling (SEM) linking the clinical and mechanistic outcomes (&#x02018;Statistical considerations&#x02019; section).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec id="s3g1"><title>Clinical sample size and estimates</title><p>We estimate from HFEA audit data<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> that &#x0223c;6000 couples per annum undergoing ICSI will be eligible across all centres.

A 10% loss to follow-up is accommodated although it is anticipated that compliance will be high given the lateness of randomisation and the routine nature of collecting data on biochemical pregnancy (BP), clinical pregnancy (CP) and live birth (LB) data in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s3g2"><title>Clinical statistical analysis</title><p>Our unit of analysis will be the couple. Baseline characteristics will be tabulated. We have elected to focus on the outcome of the first fresh ICSI cycle in each randomised couple and powered the trial accordingly.

Numbers of couples at different stages of the trial are summarised in the CONSORT diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012609F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The primary outcome is the proportion of women who experience a live birth &#x02265;37&#x02005;weeks. Secondary outcomes are the respective proportions of women who experience the following: a clinical pregnancy (presence of a fetal heartbeat or fetal sac at 6&#x02013;9&#x02005;weeks' gestation); a PL; a live birth &#x0003c;37&#x02005;weeks. Outcomes in experimental and control arms will be compared using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for centre and for factors used in the minimisation, with effects summarised as ORs with 95% CIs. If there is evidence that the CPR differs between the trial arms, then secondary analyses will be carried out taking only women with a clinical pregnancy as the denominator. In all cases, results of primary analyses will be given more weight than those of the secondary analyses.</p><p>Every attempt will be made to gather data on all women randomised, irrespective of compliance with the treatment protocol.

Depending on numbers available, we may also compare very low (&#x02264;25%) and low (&#x0003e;25%, &#x02264;65%) HBS subgroups. In each case, an interaction test will first be used to determine whether there is a basis for investigating treatment efficacy within subgroups.

Similarly, chromatin compaction measured by aniline blue and CMA3 assays will be summarised through the latent variable, chromatin compaction. HALO provides a separate covariate of sperm nuclear integrity that contributes to both latent variables. These two latent variables will then be regarded as covariates in a regression model for HBS, which in turn is a covariate for the logistic regressions for each of the primary and secondary clinical outcomes. This model is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012609F3">figure 3</xref>B for clarity.

<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> the benefit of HA-ICSI may be greatest for couples with the lowest HBS and the relationships between HBS and the key outcomes will be non-linear. Hence, interpretation of results of SEM could be compromised without considering a balanced HBS stratification of the samples. The proportion of samples in the lowest stratum (estimated at 14% of all samples) is our most constraining variable and has the strongest influence on the final sample size. Our current estimate for the LBR within the lowest HBS stratum is 18%. Robust estimates of the coefficients within a logistic regression have been thoroughly explored in simulation studies by Peduzzi <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> where it was established that 10 events per covariate are required. Consequently, within this lowest HBS stratum we might expect 31 live births. The Peduzzi rule<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> requires at least 30 live births to robustly estimate the coefficients of three covariates; one for HBS the variable of interest, one for treatment (ICSI/PICSI) and one for the Nelson&#x02013;Lawlor log odds of live birth.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> These covariates are omitted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012609F3">figure 3</xref>B for clarity. Working back, we estimate that 1216 samples balanced across all strata will be required to record at least 30 live births in the lowest HBS stratum. This figure&#x000a0;is approximately half of all finally stored samples, giving ample room for adjustment.

Like most other studies, it has strengths and limitations (see above). However, its capability to address a significant unmet health need and also advance mechanistic understanding and impact of DNA integrity/fragmentation on clinical success in ICSI cannot be understated. In addition to HA-binding, alternative strategies to identify and select sperm for ICSI include biophysical and morphometric methods based on passive and active microfluidic chambers, zeta potential, high resolution imaging (IMSI and IMSOMI) and magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Recent systematic reviews with meta-analyses, however, found little evidence of efficacy with the caveat that all studies were either inadequately powered or were of low quality.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The most recent review of the literature on the efficacy with HA-selection also reported a lack of efficacy but with the same caveat applied.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>It may be difficult to exclude sperm with such genotoxic DNA fragmentation altogether from ICSI procedures; it is surely within our means, however, to sufficiently eliminate them from the pool of those prepared for ICSI. The HABSelect trial seeks to provide robust evidence to firmly accept or reject the recommendation of a prior HA-binding step in the selection of sperm for ICSI and to determine whether such selection does indeed mitigate for higher genotoxic potential in patient samples. The study complies fully with and extends on the NICE call for fertility guidance: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/pressreleases/NICEOutlinesReviewOfFertilityGuideline.jsp">http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/pressreleases/NICEOutlinesReviewOfFertilityGuideline.jsp</ext-link>) and the ESHRE call for new markers of sperm quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.eshre.eu/~/media/sitecore-files/&#x02026;/2012-January.pdf?la=en">https://www.eshre.eu/~/media/sitecore-files/&#x02026;/2012-January.pdf?la=en</ext-link>).</p><p>It is difficult to assess what impact the PICSI intervention might have on the overall cost of treatment. However, depending on the study outcomes, cost-effectiveness modelling alongside an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis may be considered.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was enrolled into HABSelect in December 2013, and recruitment is due to end in August 2016.
