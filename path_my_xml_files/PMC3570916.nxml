It involves cognitive and behavioral symptoms that include obsessive thoughts and ritualistic or avoidant behavior. Obsessions, in this disorder, are persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and inappropriate. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts, the goal of which is to prevent or reduce anxiety or distress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Individuals suffering from OCD often suffer comorbid disorders, the most common of which is major depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>In addition to intergenerational transmission of genetic vulnerability to heightened anxiety in children of parents with higher levels of anxiety,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] certain patterns of family interactions have been associated with anxiety in youth. Ginsburg and Schlossberg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] demonstrated that parental over-control and over-protection, less authoritative parenting, parental reinforcement or modeling of anxious or avoidant behavior, and negative parental expectations concerning their child, elevate the risk of anxiety disorders in children. Similarly, Johnson, <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] found that maladaptive early parenting contributes to psychopathology in children. This study indicated that family interactions contribute more than biological predisposition to the etiology of psychopathology. Other family interaction risk factors that predict the development of OCD include marital discord and family disorganization,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] family copying style, parent&#x02013;child enmeshment, and involvement of rituals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Given that childhood anxiety predicts adult morbidity, identifying effective interventions for dysfunctional anxiety in children is of major importance. Some interventions are biological in nature, such as, the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine), which are thought to reduce OCD symptoms through their impact on serotonin neurotransmission.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] A more popular approach has been cognitive-behavior therapy involving exposure prevention (EPR), which is one of the most effective interventions for OCD,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and is regarded as the treatment of choice for children and adolescents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In recent times, it has been observed that family cognitive behavioral therapy (FCBT) appears superior to individual cognitive behavioral therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Grunes, <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] reported that FCBT results in a greater reduction of OCD symptoms than does a treatment delivered without family participation. Furthermore, Ginsburg and Schlossberg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] found that 60 to 90% of the children who received FCBT did not relapse after treatment. An alternative to FCBT, proposed for treating OCD in children, is narrative family therapy, and the efficacy of this approach also has been experimentally supported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Maid, Smokowski, and Bacallao[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] advocated for experimental interventions that focus on maladaptive family roles, such as, communications approaches for families of children with anxiety disorders. Based on the assumed importance of attachment relationships, such approaches emphasize the role of parental acceptance, control, and modeling, in maintaining children's anxiety symptoms. Attachment refers to the emotional bond that arises early between infant and primary caregiver. This bond is marked by the child seeking out of this specific attachment figure in times of need (e.g. stress), and using this figure as a secure base in the exploration of the word. The attachment theory suggests that when parental behavior fails to make children feel safe, secure, and able to trust the parents in times of need, then children will be less able to regulate their emotions and fulfill their needs adaptively. Consequently, they tend to develop negative, insecure views of themselves and others, which puts them at a risk of developing psychological disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Bowlby[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] articulated the potential for an attachment theory to contribute to an understanding of the pathways through which early caregiving experiences could influence mental health or psychopathology. He maintained that the attachment theory could also provide a useful framework for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>There has been a growing consensus that attachment is an ongoing process, which becomes organized and reorganized at each stage of development, in keeping with new maturational and experiential opportunities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Research has demonstrated that insecure children and adults evidence higher rates of psychopathology than do secure children and adults, and has confirmed that the quality of the attachment relationship strongly predicts a variety of child outcomes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] It has been shown that insecurely attached children are more likely to experience anxiety disorders and symptoms than securely attached children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] There is also strong evidence that insecure attachment is a precursor for child anxiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Reviewing this evidence, Siegel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] concluded that attachment affects the child's developing mind.</p><p>Myhr, Sookman, and Pinard[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] postulated that insecure attachment may predispose children to develop OCD. Consistent with this proposal, Sunderland[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] has reported that attachment insecurity is a risk factor for pediatric OCD. Doron and Kyrios[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] found that insecure attachment in adults is also associated with OCD. Using a cross-sectional design, Doron <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] demonstrated that this association between attachment insecurity and OCD symptoms in adults is mediated by OCD-related dysfunctional beliefs.</p><p>The profoundly adverse effects of OCD on many aspects of individual lives, together with the evidence that attachment problems can heighten vulnerability to OCD symptoms, highlights the potential value of a therapy for pediatric OCD, designed to enhance the attachment relationship between such children and their parents. The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of attachment-based intervention in treating children's OCD. We hypothesized that attachment-based intervention would be effective in decreasing OCD symptoms in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHOD</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study included 24 female children aged between 10 and 12 years. According to Geller <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] (1998) the average age of onset for childhood OCD ranges from 7.5 to 12.5 years, with a mean of 10.3 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measures</title><p>The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive- Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) is a 10-item semi-structured inventory, assessing the severity of OCD symptomatology experienced during a one-week period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] The 10-items are divided into two subscales, respectively, measuring obsessions and compulsions, using the five-point Likert scale rating that ranges from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The obsession and compulsion severity scores are derived by summing the five items in each subscale, and a total score is derived by summing all the ten items.

Gullone and Robinson[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] revised the IPPA for use in children and younger adolescents, producing the IPPA-R. The IPPA-R is appropriate for use in youth aged between nine and fifteen years. It contains two scales: 28 items assessing parent attachment and 20 items assessing peer attachment. As the association between parenting and OCD symptoms is the focus of interest in this study, participants have been assessed using only the parent attachment scale. The items on this scale assess three dimensions of attachment: Trust, communication, and alienation. Respondents are required to rate how often each item is true for them, on a three point scale: Always true, sometimes true, or never true. Gullone and Robinson[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] demonstrated that the IPPA-R has good internal consistency for each of the subscales, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients for parent attachment being 0.85 for the trust subscale, 0.79 for the communication subscale, and 0.76 for the alienation subscale. According to Gullone and Robinson,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] the IPPA-R also has good convergent validity, established by comparing it with the Self-Esteem Inventory-School Form (SEI) and the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI).</p><p>The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Inventory[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] is a 10-item semi-structural clinical interview that measures the following five parameters of obsessions (Items 1-5) and compulsive rituals (Items 6-10). (a) time occupied/frequency, (b) interference, (c) distress, and (d) perceived control. Each item is rated using a five point Likert scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms), and the 10 items yield a total score ranging from 0-40.

The total scores range from 0-63 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

Children of those parents who filled in the consent forms were administered the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Those children who met the criteria for OCD on this questionnaire were referred to a psychiatrist for clinical interview, and the 24 children who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for OCD, on the basis of this clinical interview, were included in the study. These children had not been previously treated with either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy and they remained medication-free for the entire duration of the study.</p><p>Children were assigned randomly to either the experimental or the control group (12 children in each group). Children in the experimental group each received eight 60-minute sessions of attachment-based intervention, together with their mothers. Children in the control group were told to register their names on a waiting-list, and were informed that they would receive the intervention at a later point. There was neither any contact between the two groups, nor any experimental mortality among the participants over the therapeutic intervention.</p><p>To enable statistical control of variation in the attachment insecurity and depression in the children, they were initially administered the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment - Revised Version for Children, and the Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale. To enable statistical control of maternal attachment insecurity, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the mothers were initially administered the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. However, the main focus of interest was on the children's OCD symptoms, which were recorded at three different assessment points, using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). The first assessment was carried out before the experimental group commenced the intervention (Pre-test); the second was carried out after the experimental group had completed the intervention (Post-test); and the third was carried out four weeks later (Follow-up). This scheduling of assessment is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of assessment schedule</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-4-78-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The dependent variable in this study was the children's OCD symptoms, as measured by the CY-BOCS, and the independent variable was the group, reflecting participant assignment to either the attachment-based intervention or to the control condition. The level of children's attachment, insecurity, and depression, as well as the mothers&#x02019; OCD symptoms, depression, and attachment insecurity, were assessed, so they could be statistically controlled in the analysis of the CY-BOCS scores, by including them as covariates.

The children assigned to each of the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of their scores on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (F (1,22) = 3.375 <italic>P</italic> = 0.541), the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment - Revised Version for Children (F (1,22) = 0.171 <italic>P</italic> = 0.683), or the Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale (F (1,22) = 0.00 <italic>P</italic> = 1.00).

Consistent with our hypothesis, the findings demonstrated that attachment-based intervention was effective in decreasing OCD symptoms in children. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of attachment-based intervention on pediatric OCD. Our findings are compatible with the previously observed efficacy of pediatric OCD treatments that have targeted family members as well as children over the course of the therapy. For example, Grunes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] reported that compared to interventions that did not involve family participation, family treatment for pediatric OCD produced greater reduction in OCD symptoms.</p><p>The impact of attachment-based intervention on children's OCD symptoms plausibly may be explained by the effects of the intervention on parental sensitivity and responsiveness to their children's attachment needs, which in turn beneficially attenuated their children's sense of personal vulnerability, as well as their negative world perception, across the course of the therapy. Guidano and Liotti[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] have argued that perception of the world as being threatening, but controllable, translates into active attempts to control the environment, which can the symptomatology observed in individuals suffering from OCD. As we reviewed earlier, research has demonstrated that a subjective sense of security, and hence, the degree to which the world is perceived as threatening, is related to early attachment experiences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] It has been reported that individuals with OCD often experience thoughts that contradict valued aspects of self.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] Children with OCD are vulnerable to intrusive thoughts that trigger insecurity concerning their competence in those fields they consider as highly valuable. Sookman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>] have shown that greater perception of personal vulnerability, difficulty with unpredictability and a greater need for control, distinguishes OCD from other anxiety disorders.</p><p>Guidano and Liotti[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] suggested that insecure parent&#x02013;child interactions, which make children uncertain of the degree to which they are loved, wanted or worthy, can lead them to develop opposing self-perceptions, such as lovable or unlovable. This insecure or ambivalent self-worth may result in chronic self-monitoring and in rumination about one's relation to others. Perfectionism and compulsive behaviors emerge as a means of securing approval and stabilizing one's self-perception as lovable and worthy. Ehiobuche[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>] showed that students with high scores on obsessionality reported their parents to be more rejecting, more over-protective, and less emotionally warm, than did students with low obsessionality scores. Turgeon, O&#x02019;Connor, Marchand, and Freeston[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>] showed parental protectiveness to be more common in families of children with OCD than in the control families. Such styles of parental interaction may make children worry about experiencing strong feelings. Some parents who seek to avoid intense feelings may do so by becoming over-controlling. This can include controlling their children's time, space, beliefs, feelings, and wants. Essentially, they may communicate to their children, &#x0201c;No you don&#x02019;t feel this, you feel that. No you don&#x02019;t need this; you need that.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] It has been argued that this undermines the child's capacity to deal independently with emotional experience, and so when the child has no one to help him/her with his/her emotions, obsessive rituals or similar controlling behavior becomes his/her only way of making the world safe. Some theorists contend that checking rituals engaged in by children may represent an attempt to make at least part of the environment predictable and dependable, in order to make it feel safe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>During the course of our intervention, a range of overprotective behaviors were reported by parents, including providing reassurance, engaging in rituals for children, doing home work for children, making decisions for children, and promoting their avoidance of situations that might provoke their OCD symptoms. Therefore, early in therapy the possible relationships between children's symptoms and perceived threats to parental emotional and physical availability were addressed as potential factors that could block a safety relationship between child and mother. Also, parents were taught to increase their emotional openness and to show a more accepting behavior toward their children in order to help their children to see themselves as more lovable and the world as a safer place.</p><p>Given the beneficial effect that enhancing parent&#x02013;child relationship has on children's obsessive-compulsive disorder, it seems likely that if applied during the early years of childhood, attachment-based instructions may contribute to the prevention of OCD in children. This hypothesis could be profitably evaluated in future research studies. It would be appropriate for subsequent research, to not only seek to maximize the clinical efficacy of attachment-based intervention, but also to illuminate the mechanisms through which it exerts its therapeutic effect. The former objective can be pursued by investigating whether the attachment-based intervention approaches can be effectively combined with other established forms of treatment. For example, combining cognitive-behavior therapy with attachment-based intervention may produce especially powerful therapeutic benefits. Future studies designed to illuminate the mechanism through which attachment-based intervention ameliorates OCD symptoms should evaluate whether changes in the children's sense of security, or changes in their patterns of selective information processing, mediate the relationship between enhanced attachment and reduced pediatric OCD symptoms.</p><p>Of course, the present study has a number of limitations. Because this is the first study to show that attachment-based intervention may be effective in the treatment of pediatric OCD, we must be cautious about the reliability and generalizability of the findings. Another reason to treat the results as preliminary is the small sample size. Although the follow-up data are encouraging, we assessed the maintenance of clinical improvement only one month after completion of treatment, and more extended follow-ups should be included in the future studies to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of attachment-based intervention. As participants in this study were comprised of only female children, it would be necessary to replicate the work with male children, before concluding that attachment-based intervention was effective for both sexes. Finally, it would be useful to examine whether the inclusion of both parents in the therapeutic sessions, rather than mothers alone, would further enhance the positive impact of attachment-based intervention on the recovery from OCD in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summation, the results of the present study are promising and encouraging. They suggest that attachment-based intervention is effective in reducing obsessions and compulsions in pediatric samples. Therefore, attachment-based intervention can be considered as a useful component of therapy for pediatric OCD, and its inclusion may ensure that the treatment is effectively continued by parents after formal therapy has been completed. Given the important influence that parents&#x02019; behaviors have on children's OCD symptoms, it seems likely that attachment-based relationship instructions delivered to families with young children may also contribute to prevention of later OCD symptoms both in middle-childhood and adulthood.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by research chancellor of university of Isfahan as a dissertation project.
