The test quantifies the number of lactobacilli relative to BV-associated bacteria and provides a score (Nugent score) from 1 to 10 (normal flora = 1&#x02013;3, intermediate BV flora = 4&#x02013;6, definitive BV flora = 7&#x02013;10).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment with antibiotics is indicated in women with symptomatic BV and in those with asymptomatic infection who are undergoing abortion or hysterectomy procedures.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Metronidazole is an antimicrobial agent that has been US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x02013;approved since 1992 for treatment of BV. Both intravaginal and oral metronidazole formulations are available, and although both have similar efficacy, producing clinical cure rates of 70% to 80% at follow-up times of 4 weeks, intravaginal use is associated with fewer adverse effects.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Currently approved metronidazole regimens call for twice daily administration for 7 days (oral), or once or twice daily administration for 5 days (vaginal gel 0.75%).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Results of a recent dose-ranging phase 2 study demonstrated similar efficacy of a 1-day treatment with metronidazole vaginal gel (MVG) 1.3% as compared with the standard 5-day treatment with MVG 0.75%, with no safety differences.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the study, clinical cure rates were 37.2% and 28.6% in participants treated with single-dose MVG 1.3% and 5-day MVG 0.75%, respectively.

Gels were approximately 5 g, formulated to pH 4.0, and contained identical ingredients with the exception of metronidazole in vehicle gels. Study participants were evaluated at 3 time points: an initial screening (D0) to determine study eligibility, follow-up at D7 to ensure compliance with the protocol and assess therapeutic response, and test-of-cure (TOC) visit at D21.</p><p>At D0 visit, participants were screened for study entry with medical history, pelvic examination, and laboratory testing. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive MVG 1.3% or vehicle vaginal gel. Study drug was applied intravaginally by the participant once at bedtime (D0) using a prefilled applicator. At D7 follow-up and D21 TOC visits, pelvic examination and laboratory testing were conducted to determine therapeutic response. Laboratory tests included 10% KOH amine (whiff) test, pH, Gram stain for Nugent scoring, and saline microscopy to determine the presence of clue cells, fungal elements, and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>.</p><p>Females at least 18 years of age and in good general health were eligible for study participation. Participants were required to have a negative pregnancy test result and abstain from vaginal intercourse for the first 7 days of the study. Use of intravaginal products was prohibited for the entire duration of the study, and participants had to refrain from ingesting alcohol for 24 hours after treatment application. All participants had a clinical diagnosis of BV, determined by all of the following: (1) off-white, thin, homogenous discharge; (2) proportion of clue cells &#x02265;20% of total epithelial cells; (3) vaginal fluid pH &#x02265;4.7; and (4) positive 10% KOH whiff test result.</p><p>Participants with an infectious cause of vulvovaginitis other than BV (e.g., candidiasis, <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, or active genital herpes) or who had received systemic or intravaginal antifungal, antibacterial, or antiparasitic drugs; disulfram; or systemic corticosteroids within 14 days of randomization were excluded from the study. Participants receiving concurrent therapy with warfarin, undergoing treatment to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical carcinoma, or with a primary or secondary immunodeficiency were also excluded.</p><p>The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of participants achieving a clinical cure at D21, defined as follows: (1) a return to normal physiological discharge as assessed by the investigator, (2) negative 10% KOH whiff test result, and (3) clue cells less than 20% of total epithelial cells in saline wet mount. Secondary efficacy measures included the proportion of participants achieving a therapeutic cure at D21, defined as participants with both a clinical and bacteriologic cure (the latter defined as a Nugent score &#x0003c;4), the proportion of participants with bacteriologic cure at D21, and the proportion of participants with bacteriologic and clinical cures at D7.</p><p>Time to resolution of symptoms at D7 was based on daily diary entries made by the participant through D7. Participants were required to record responses to the following questions: &#x0201c;Did you experience leakage of the study drug?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Are your symptoms completely gone today?&#x0201d; Participants also completed a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication at D7, which documented the participants' view of the effectiveness, adverse effects, convenience, and global satisfaction with the treatments.</p><p>Data from 3 patient populations were used in the efficacy measures. The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population was defined at the initiation of the study (April 2012) and included all participants who were negative for <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> and had a Nugent score of 4 or higher at first visit, and whose D7 and D21 vaginal discharge was assessed as &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;absent.&#x0201d; Because some investigators interpreted present to describe either an abnormal or normal discharge, the study protocol was amended in July 2012 to change the assessment to &#x0201c;Has the original discharge characteristic of BV returned to a normal physiological discharge?&#x0201d; Under the new amendment, a new patient population was defined as a primary modified intent-to-treat (PMITT) population, which included the subset of the MITT population that was evaluated using the amended question. Data from the PMITT population were used for the primary analysis, and data from the MITT population were used for sensitivity testing of the primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>The per-protocol (PP) population included participants from the PMITT population who satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria, began study medication within 2 days of randomization, were compliant with study medication, used no antimicrobial drugs or intravaginal products during the study, and had the Nugent score result obtained between D21 and D30. Data were analyzed using this population because there was a 10% difference in the number of participants between the PMITT and PP populations and were used to support results of the primary efficacy measure.</p><p>For D7 assessments, only those participants evaluated using the postamendment question &#x0201c;Has the original discharge characteristic of BV returned to a normal physiological discharge?&#x0201d; were included in the analyses (considered the &#x0201c;D7 analysis population&#x0201d;). Fewer participants were included in this analysis than those in the D21 analysis (PMITT population), as the new criterion was applied after the study had already been initiated.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and significance was determined using a 2-sided type I error rate of 5% (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05). For proportion variables, data were summarized by treatment group along with 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs). Two-sided 95% CIs were estimated for cure rate differences based on binomial distribution. Missing cure values were imputed as failures.

A recent phase 2 study investigating efficacy of single, 3-, and 5-day doses of MVG 1.3% as compared with the standard 5-day regimen with MVG 0.75% used the more stringent FDA guidance to assess clinical cure.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the phase 2 study, clinical cure rates at the TOC visit (D21&#x02013;30) in participants receiving single-dose MVG 1.3% were 30.5% and 37.2% in the ITT and PP populations, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Despite the exlusion of pH in the criteria for clinical cure in the current phase 3 study, clinical cure rates on D21 in the MVG 1.3% group were similar to those found in the phase 2 study (37.2% and 40.7% in the PMITT and PP populations, respectively).</p><p>The phase 2 study was a multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded trial designed to test the higher concentration metronidazole (1.3%) as a single treatment versus the 5-day MVG 0.75% regimen.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The results indicated similar efficacy between the groups at the D21&#x02013;30 assessment, with clinical and therapeutic cure rates of 37.2% and 30.2%, respectively, in the 1-day MVG 1.3% group and 28.6% and 20.4%, respectively, in the 5-day MVG 0.75% group.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition, participants indicated the highest acceptability for the single-dose application based on ease of application, convenience, and treatment satisfaction.</p><p>The convenience of a single-dose use was also evident based on treatment satisfaction questionnaires administered to participants in the phase 3 trial, with responses equivalent between the treatment groups. However, responses regarding the effectiveness of and global satisfaction with treatment were significantly higher in the MVG 1.3% treatment group compared with the vehicle gel group. Together with the phase 2 trial, the current well-controlled phase 3 study provides additional confirmation that single-dose MVG 1.3% is safe and more effective for treatment of BV than vehicle gel, with all primary and secondary end points met, and safety similar to placebo. Overall, cure rates in both study arms were lower than have previously been observed with standard of care treatment. Nevertheless, MVG 1.3% may be an option for those patients who do not tolerate oral metronidazole or tinidazole. Further supportive studies comparing 1-day MVG 1.3% with active product are required to ensure that a reasonable treatment alternative is available for women desiring single-dose therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Conflicts of interest: Jane Schwebke is or has been a compensated consultant to Hologic (ongoing [O]), Akesis (O), Symbionix (O), StarPharma (O), and BD Diagnostics (past); has grants/grants pending paid to her institution from Hologic (O), Akesis (current [C]), Symbionix (C), StarPharma (C), BD Diagnostics (O), Biohelix (C), and Cepheid (O); and has received payment from Hologic (C) for development of educational presentations.
