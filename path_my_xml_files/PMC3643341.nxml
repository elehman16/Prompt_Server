Both <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> and permethrin lotions exhibited mild adverse effects in the same proportion of patients who had pruritus (<italic>P</italic> = 0.796), erythema (<italic>P</italic> = 0.553) and who had experienced burning sensation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.692) during treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Scabies is a highly contagious parasitic infestation which causes intractable nocturnal pruritus since the female mites burrow deep in the stratum corneum of the epidermis at night to lay eggs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Scabies has a long incubation period in which symptoms may develop in about four weeks following initial infestation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Toxins, saliva and other secretions secreted by mites are probably responsible for clinical manifestations of the initial sign and symptoms like vesiculopapular lesions with pruritus. Pruritus is the result of a hypersensitivity response to the antigenic molecules of the saliva, eggs and faecal material of the mites, normally experienced at night.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Initial predilection sites occur in warm, moist areas where there is a thin stratum corneum like the finger webs, wrists and anterior axillary folds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Secondary bacterial infections and lesions like erosions and excoriations usually develop from scratching with dirty fingernails.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>It is worth noting that majority of the scabies-infected patients belonged to the low-socioeconomic class in which overpopulation is predominant along with limited health education and inadequate sanitation. Moreover, the treatment is expensive because it requires the entire household to completely eradicate the mites. Hence, alternative, economical, and safe medications from local plants are being studied to provide cure for the disease. One of these promising plants is <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> which contains quaternary alkaloids like berberine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine and magnoflorine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Berberine and its salts have antibacterial, antifungal and antipyretic properties. Berberine has cytotoxic and neoplasm inhibitory effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] It also exerts spasmolytic action on muscles which may be responsible for the scabicidal activity of <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> stem extracts.</p><p>Berberine isolated from <italic>Berberis sp</italic>. exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by dose dependent inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, reduction of exudate production in Wistar rats carrageenan- induced air pouch, inhibition of vascular permeability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] and significant anti-inflammatory activity on serotonin-induced hind paw edema.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] It can reduce intestinal mucosal inflammation by downregulation of cyclooxygenase- 2 expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] These activities of berberine may lead to the reduction of inflammation and exudation in scabietic lesions and to the general improvement of the disease.</p><p>In 1983, Rivera <italic>et al</italic>., reported that Crotamiton and <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> aqueous extract are equally effective in the treatment of scabies. In a study done by Salazar <italic>et al</italic>., the aqueous stem extract stem has acaricidal property exhibiting a 31 % total cure and 69% partial cure when applied daily as a lotion for five days.</p><p><italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion is a non-irritating and safe topical medication as shown by phase 1 clinical trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In a comparative analysis of <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion with Crotamiton lotion and placebo, results showed same effectiveness with Crotamiton since there is no significant difference between the two while both lotions are significantly different to the placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>The age of the subjects ranged from 2 to 22 years with a mean of 15.58 (95% CI: 14.56 to 16.60). There was no significant difference in the age of the patients assigned to both lotions (<italic>P</italic> = 0.547). At <italic>P</italic> value of 0.999, the gender of the patients assigned to both lotions were statistically the same. Neither the age nor gender served as a variable in the study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>There was a gradual decline in the frequency of patients having moderate and mild scabies infestation after treatment with <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion. Improvement in the mean global evaluation score from baseline to day 28 was observed in both lotions. Significant decrease in the signs and symptoms of scabies infestation like pruritus, papules, pustules, vesicles, erythema, excoriation and erosion was observed. The clinical improvement seen in the patients were comparable to the results of the clinical trials done by Llamasares and Reyes <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Sixty patients who completed the five week clinical study were included in the evaluation post-therapy. These results were comparable to the initial clinical trial done in 27 patients who completed the course with 74.07% (20 patients) clearance of lesions and 11.1% (3 patients) treatment failure at 28<sup>th</sup> day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>The subjects were followed-up until 28<sup>th</sup> day, three weeks after the treatment period of two weeks. There were still significant reductions based on the location of the lesions, degree of infestation, global evaluation score and disease control.</p><p>Presence of erythema and few papules over the sites of predilection among six out of the 30 <italic>T. cordifolia</italic>&#x02013;treated patients may be due &#x0201c;post-scabeitic hypersensitivity&#x0201d; which persists for 2-4 weeks and represents the body's response to dead mites or toxins produced after treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Two subjects had treatment failure on 21<sup>st</sup> day. These patients had new pustules, erosion and pruritus at wrist and dorsum of the hand. The patients failed to iron their clothes and clean their respective beddings which may cause the treatment failure. Another patient was considered reinfested because marked improvement (50%) was seen on seventh day but only a mild improvement at 14<sup>th</sup> day (17%) and 21<sup>st</sup> day (17%) was observed while on 28<sup>th</sup> day, no improvement was noted and there was reappearance of new papules in the wrist, legs and interdigits and persistent papules on genitals from 14-28<sup>th</sup> days were noted.</p><p>Overall, the 50% <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion showed a significant decrease in all the parameters. It showed significant decrease in the degree of infestation, sites of predilection and global evaluation score while it demonstrated significant increase in the clinical improvement of the patients during clinical assessment.</p><p>The 50% <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion is a non-staining, yellowish brown product with an agreeable odor. Although, a bitter sensation was noted when the lotion is applied topically, patients were asked to apply the lotion after dinner and to washed hands after application. Aside from the mild side effects like erythema, pruritus and burning sensation, no reportable cases were noted that it is unsafe to use topically.</p><p>Results presented herein showed that, <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion exhibited a comparable anti-scabies activity with permethrin having the same cure rate [<italic>T. cordifolia</italic>: 70%, 53.60 to 86.94%; Permethrin: 50%, 32.11 to 67.89%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.187] and clearance time of 23<sup>rd</sup> days, 20.47 to 25.53 days. Since the <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> lotion is inexpensive compared to the commercially available drugs, it can be used as an alternative treatment to scabies infestation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The study was supported by research grants from the Science Education Institute, Department of Science and Technology, Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education, Philippines, the Fund for Assistance to Private Education, Philippines and the University of Santo Tomas Grants Office, Philippines.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fitzpatrick</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolff</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology.
