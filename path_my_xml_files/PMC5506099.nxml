Over the past two decades, a number of single-risk-factor intervention and post-trial studies have provided evidence for recommending multifactorial treatment of this common disorder (as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). Still, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have increased risk for early mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and may suffer from multiple organ damage with recurrent event rates of up to 15% per year during follow-up of various trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] even though recent surveys suggest favourable changes in diabetes-related complications including death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Therefore, this follow-up, a randomised trial of intensified vs standard multifactorial intervention for 7.8&#x000a0;years in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, was designed to address the median differences in lifespan with and without incident cardiovascular events between the originally intensified vs conventionally treated patients. We use the term &#x02018;years of life gained&#x02019; to emphasise the decreased life expectancy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria.</p><p id="Par11">In the present follow-up study the patients were observed for a median of 13.2&#x000a0;years after the formal interventional part of the study ended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par12">The Steno-2 study was initiated in 1993, enrolling 160 Danish patients of European descent with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Eighty patients were assigned to each group. Conventional-therapy patients were followed by their general practitioner, but at all times had the opportunity of being referred to specialist treatment. The treatment in the intensive-therapy group at a specialised diabetes clinic was target-driven with stepwise implementation of both behavioural and pharmacological treatment following a structured approach.

This follow-up study was done as an amendment to the original study protocol.</p><p id="Par19">The primary endpoint for the present study was the difference between the two treatment groups in the survival time after randomisation without and with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The secondary endpoint was defined as a composite of cardiovascular events (time to incident CVD and number of cardiovascular events) as well as mortality and CVD rates. The tertiary endpoints were rate of incident diabetic nephropathy, rate of end-stage renal disease and the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.</p><p id="Par20">For the follow-up examinations, all living patients were invited to an outpatient clinic visit assessing anthropometric, biochemical and physiological variables as well as detailed status on micro- and macrovascular complications. The examinations were conducted by a single laboratory technician who was unaware of the original randomisation assignments.</p><p id="Par21">Supplementary clinical evaluations were collected from nationwide registries when not obtainable at the study visit. All measurement methods were in accordance with previous follow-up protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">For endpoint assessment, all patients were tracked by their unique, static Central Personal Registration number using the Danish Civil Registration System. All hospital contacts diagnosed to possibly fulfil the pre-specified criteria (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">ESM</xref> Section 2) or relating to the criteria (including ICD-10 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/">www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/</ext-link>] observation-diagnoses [DZ0.3x] and symptom-diagnoses [e.g. DR0.74, chest pain]) were extracted from the Danish National Patient Registry and used as cases for the endpoint committee. Complete health records for cases were obtained from nationwide electronic health records and adjudicated for endpoints by an external committee masked for patients&#x02019; original treatment allocation. The registries have proven highly valid and complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Hospitals report mandatorily to the registries and the reported data on diagnoses and procedures translates directly to the funding of the hospitals. The data provide information from 1978 onwards. Hospitals mandatorily keep individual patient records related to hospitalisations and outpatient treatment for at least 10&#x000a0;years after the last record.</p><p id="Par23">Cardiovascular events were defined as a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation due to ischaemia and cardiac or peripheral revascularisation. If an event occurred as a direct consequence of, or as an adverse event related to another, immediately prior event (e.g. percutaneous transluminary coronary angioplasty immediately after acute myocardial infarction; see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">ESM</xref> section 2.1), this latter event was not considered in the analyses of separate endpoints. Self-reported cardiovascular events prior to randomisation were not considered. Microvascular complications were defined, measured and evaluated as described in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">ESM</xref> Section 3.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par24">All statistical analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat principle. Adherence to the treatment was assessed at study visits in both groups based on interviews with patients.</p><p id="Par25">Overall cumulative survival, as well as CVD-free survival, by time since randomisation was calculated for the two treatment groups by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimator. Median survival time from randomisation was compared between the treatment groups. CIs for the medians were calculated using bootstrapping. We specifically chose difference in median survival time between groups to make a clear statement in easily understandable terms in addition to the more extensively used, but more difficult to interpret, HR and RR reduction.</p><p id="Par26">Proportional hazards Poisson models were fitted for mortality (both from cardiovascular causes and from other causes) and cardiovascular events, taking treatment group, age, sex and current CVD status into account, using smooth underlying hazards (time since baseline). Current CVD status was included in models for all-cause mortality as 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more cardiovascular events after randomisation. Thus, we modelled both death and (extra) CVD events as outcome, and the models were used to compute the average years of life lived and the years of life free of CVD during the study period and thereby the average number of years gained by intensive treatment. Models were checked for proportional hazards between randomisation groups by likelihood-ratio tests. Diabetes duration at baseline, as well as the interaction with treatment allocation, was included in a model to assess the effect of diabetes duration on mortality.</p><p id="Par27">Except for end-stage renal disease (where exact date of transplantation or first dialysis treatment was known), the status of microvascular complications was only assessed at study visits, and the exact event date is therefore unknown. For analysis purposes a random date between the last day without and first day with the specified complication was imputed as the event date. When the progression between states jumped more than one category (e.g. from EURODIAB-score 2 to 5 between two observation points), random dates between the two observations for the steps were generated and used in analyses of transition rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed by repeating the random allocation of dates.</p><p id="Par28">Transition rates between states and group comparison were analysed as for cardiovascular events. For each of the four types of outcome (retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and albuminuria) we estimated the rates of transition between states of increasing severity and used these to construct plots showing the fraction of patients in each state at different times after randomisation.</p><p id="Par29">A fuller account of statistical approaches and detailing of analyses can be found in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">ESM</xref> Sections 4&#x02013;7. For the anthropometric, biochemical and physiological variables, the <italic>t</italic> test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistics were applied for the comparison of means, medians and proportions, respectively. In the results section all estimates are followed by 95% CIs in parentheses.

The reduced mortality was caused by a decreased risk of incident CVD and cardiovascular mortality.</p><p id="Par42">Absolute risk and RR reductions for all endpoints were well in line with earlier reported findings, confirming the durability of the intensified, multifactorial approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The frequency of recurrent events was high in both groups, but patients in the original conventional-therapy group experienced more than twice as many cardiovascular events per person than patients from the original intensive-therapy group. Only a few studies have reported results on recurrent events; none of these have been exclusively in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the follow-up periods were much shorter, hence direct comparison is difficult.</p><p id="Par44">In the Steno-2 study, we observed high rates of progression for microvascular complications with the vast majority of patients progressing in one or more complication types. Yet, we found significant and clinically relevant risk reductions for autonomic neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, as well as blindness, and a trend towards reduced risk for end-stage renal disease. Retinopathy grading was not corrected for cataract development and surgery, which made the longitudinal comparison less exact. For the rarer and later-onset complications (i.e. end-stage renal disease and blindness) competing risk from death might be a serious issue, underestimating the true effect of the intervention.</p><p id="Par45">The risk reductions reported are high compared with those reported in single-risk-factor intervention trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Concomitant treatment of multiple risk factors seems to be of profound importance. A recent report from VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial) demonstrated larger risk reductions in patients with diabetes mellitus achieving both HbA<sub>1c</sub> and LDL-cholesterol goals compared with patients achieving only one of these goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similar findings have been reported from the ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation) trial examining a combined approach of intensified blood pressure lowering and intensive glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as well as from registry-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, analysis of the relation between number of risk factors simultaneously in control and cardiovascular outcomes in the BARI-2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial found a clear beneficial effect of having more risk factors in control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], further supporting the concept of multifactorial treatment.</p><p id="Par46">Long-term beneficial effects of glucose-lowering treatment in reducing microvascular complications have been demonstrated beyond the duration of a clinical trial in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lipid-lowering treatment has proven long-term beneficial effects with regards to CVD reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes of blood pressure- and glucose-lowering treatments seem to attenuate when treatment is relaxed post intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Long-term beneficial effects in these trials have been termed &#x02018;metabolic memory&#x02019; or &#x02018;legacy effect&#x02019;. In these trials, intensified intervention according to protocol was stopped at the end of the trial and the subsequent risk factor control was relaxed or not reported. In contrast, patients in the Steno-2 study&#x02019;s intensive-therapy group continued treatment according to the original treatment goals while patients in the original conventional-therapy group started intensified treatment with identical targets during the follow-up period. Thus, from year 8 onwards all patients in both treatment arms in the Steno-2 study received identical treatment with similar post-trial risk factor levels in the two groups. We interpret the continuing beneficial effects seen in the trial as a direct consequence of early intervention intensification in patients at lower absolute risk for late diabetic complications compared with a situation wherein increased vascular damage is already present with intensification in later stages of the disease. This concept of early intervention in patients at lower risk has just proven beneficial for combined treatment of lipid and blood pressure lowering in patients at intermediate risk of, but without, CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The Steno-2 study is robust in the sense that data on endpoints are considered complete due to the quality of relevant databases combined with low dropout rate and endpoint adjudication by an external expert committee blinded for treatment allocation. Additionally, the study design resembles a real-life situation, where researchers did not have direct influence on medicine compliance or lifestyle.</p><p id="Par48">In conclusion, we found that intensified, multifactorial treatment of type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria for 7.8&#x000a0;years compared with conventional treatment increases median life length by 7.9&#x000a0;years over 21.2&#x000a0;years of follow-up, and that these gained years were matched by years free from cardiovascular complications.</p><p id="Par49">We must emphasise the significance of early, intensified risk factor control in patients with complicated type 2 diabetes. This approach is already broadly implemented according to clinical guidelines and the present findings should lead to even more focus on the potential preventive effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec5"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="125_2016_4065_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM</label><caption><p>(PDF 758&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
