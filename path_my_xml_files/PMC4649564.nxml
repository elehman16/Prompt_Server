Prediction says that asthma along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease become third leading cause of death by the year 2020. Despite the availability of a wide range of antiasthmatic drugs, incidence of asthma is increasing alarmingly because the relief offered by these drugs is mainly symptomatic and short-lived. Moreover, their side effects are also quite distressing. Hence, a continuous search is needed to identify effective and safe remedies to treat bronchial asthma.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>The present clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Shirishadi</italic> Polyherbal compound (given through nebulizer in Aerosol form) in the management of acute and chronic uncomplicated Bronchial Asthma and to propose a novel and safer Ayurvedic treatment modality.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods and Materials:</title><p>It is a randomized, open, control clinical trial in which the effect of the drug was compared with contemporary treatment and placebo medication (normal saline) in 60 adults with mild to moderate asthma.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>There was a (<italic>t</italic>&#x0003e;0.001) found in pulmonary function tests (including FEV1, FVC and PEFR)in the group treated with polyherbal drug.

Asthma deaths will increase in the next 10 years if urgent action is not taken.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Asthma cannot be cured, but proper diagnosis, treatment and patient education can result in good asthma control and management. Asthma occurs in all countries regardless of level of development. Over 80% of asthma deaths occur in low and lower-middle income countries. For effective control, it is essential to make medications affordable and available, especially for low-income families.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>On the basis of similar clinical features, Bronchial Asthma can be correlated with <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic>, a disease described under the heading of five types of <italic>Shwasa</italic> in Ayurvedic classics. According to Ayurveda <italic>Shwasa</italic> is a <italic>Kapha-Vataja</italic> disease, which is originated from <italic>Pittasthana</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] According to Ayurveda, formation of <italic>Ama</italic> is the seed for the development of future disease. The acute attack of disease appears whenever there is an obstruction of the normal passage of <italic>Pranavayu</italic>. Once the obstruction is removed, and <italic>Vayu</italic> start travelling in its normal path symptom, (breathlessness, cough etc.,) are abolished. Considering the Ayurvedic concept of treatment of <italic>Tamaka Shwasa</italic> it was decided to select an herbal Preparation &#x0201c;<italic>Shirishadi</italic> compound&#x0201d; for the management of bronchial asthma. The drug was decided to be given through nasal route followed by oral administration of the drug.</p><p>Administration of the drug through nasal route is known as <italic>Nasya</italic> in Ayurveda.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ayurveda emphasis more on Nasal delivery of drug in diseases related to <italic>Shira</italic> and <italic>Pranavaha Srotasa</italic>. The channels carrying <italic>Pranavayu</italic> are known as <italic>Pranavaha Srotasa</italic>, vitiation of <italic>Pranavaha Srotasa</italic> cause <italic>Shwasa</italic> (dyspnea). In the present trial, Nasal route of drug administration and its efficacy in the acute attack was assessed and compared with that of contemporary modern medicine. Desired to make some Ayurvedic preparation which is effective in controlling the acute attack of Asthma, having least toxic side effects, and efficacy equivalent to that of modern medicine inspire to plan the present research work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of drug: <italic>Shirishadi</italic> compound</title><p>The plants <italic>Albizia lebbeck</italic> (L.)

Moreover, no improvement was observed in recurrence of the attack on exposure to allergens.</p><p>In the patients of bronchial asthma, treated with Ayurvedic nebulizer statistically significant improvement on various parameters was recorded after the course of the therapy. The patients showed faster relief in symptoms with no apparent toxic effects. The improvement in pulmonary function remained constant even after 1-month of discontinuation of drugs, that is, there was no rebound broncho-constriction. There was &#x02265;20% improvement in PEER, measured just after the administration of the drug. The group treated with Ayurvedic medicine showed significant improvement in PFT evidenced by marked increase in FEV1, FVC and PEFR.</p><p>According to Acaraya Charaka <italic>Shirisha</italic> (<italic>A. lebbeck</italic>) is best <italic>Vishaghna</italic> that is, it is best antitoxin.

The trial gives a direction for searching new route of herbal drug administration. In spite of limitations, the present study conducted entirely from the new angle. The study has yielded several useful observations and result which would definitely open new vistas for the future research workers of Ayurveda in general and respiratory disorders as particular.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>World Health Organization.
