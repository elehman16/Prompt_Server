Resistance exercise included 5 exercise groups circuit training (50 repetitions of each) using barbells (1&#x02013;3 kg/exercise) and low-to-medium resistance bands. The control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) undertook their usual physical activity. Mitochondrial and cytosol fractions were isolated from human placental tissue by differential centrifugation. A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure NO production in cytosolic samples from placental tissue and Western Blot technique to determine eNOS expression. Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide were measured to determine oxygen metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training during pregnancy leads to a 2-fold increase in eNOS expression and 4-fold increase in NO production in placental cytosol (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05). Mitochondrial superoxide levels and hydrogen peroxide production rate were decreased by 8% and 37% respectively in the placental mitochondria of exercising women (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Regular exercise training during the second half of pregnancy increases eNOS expression and NO production and decreases reactive oxygen species generation in human placenta. Collectively, these data demonstrate that chronic exercise increases eNOS/NO production, presumably by increasing endothelial shear stress. This adaptation may contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on the vascular and antioxidant system and in turn reduce the risk of preeclampsia, diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog&#x000ed;a &#x0201c;Francisco Jos&#x000e9; de Caldas&#x0201d; COLCIENCIAS (Grant N&#x000b0; 1106-45921540).

These adaptations appear to be mediated to a great extent by an increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation. The endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as the main factor responsible for the decreased systemic vascular resistance observed during pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0080225-SierraLaguado1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition, a decreased production or an increased inactivation of NO has been linked to the endothelial dysfunction that characterizes pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and hypertension <xref rid="pone.0080225-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, while pregnancy is referred to as &#x0201c;a state of oxidative stress&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0080225-Wisdom1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, certain pathological conditions, such as pre-eclampsia further increase placental oxidative stress and may result in early pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and impaired placentation <xref rid="pone.0080225-Myatt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) <xref rid="pone.0080225-ACOG1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> recommend regular exercise for pregnant women, including those who are sedentary, for its overall benefits on physical and psychological health. Physical activity during pregnancy appears to be beneficial to the maternal-foetal unit <xref rid="pone.0080225-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and may prevent the occurrence of maternal disorders, such as preeclampsia <xref rid="pone.0080225-Genest1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, hypertension <xref rid="pone.0080225-Fortner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and gestational diabetes <xref rid="pone.0080225-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

An average of 32 training sessions per subject was planned for each participant, in consideration that delivery could occur before 40 weeks' gestation. All women had their heart rate monitored during the training sessions to ensure that the exercise was of a moderate-to vigorous intensity. A physiotherapist and a physical educator were present during the exercise sessions. Each session included 30-min of aerobic circuit training accompanied by an audio recording of music and instructions which guided the participants to exercise at each station for approximately 1 min and then move to the next station in three circuits of 10 stations. Participants wore a heart rate monitor (Polar Pacer, USA) in every exercise session which were checked at rest after 15 and 30 mins to ensure that they exercised in the prescribed target heart rate zone. Each session was preceded and followed by a gradual warm-up and cool down period which were both of 10 min duration and consisted of walking and light, static stretching (avoiding muscle pain) of major muscle groups (upper and lower limbs, neck and trunk muscles). The cool down period also included relaxation and stretching exercises.</p><p>Resistance exercises were performed through the full range of motion normally associated with correct technique for each exercise and engaged the major muscle groups (abdominal, dorsal, shoulder, upper and lower limb muscles). They included 5 exercise groups circuit training (50 repetitions of each) using barbells (1&#x02013;3 kg/exercise) or low-to-medium resistance bands (Therabands). Each type of exercise on the back was performed for 2 min. As a general rule and to reduce potential risks, we excluded activities that promoted that Valsalva maneuver, ballistic or plyometric exercises and positions of extreme muscular tension.</p><p>The control group received no intervention; that is, participants neither attended the exercise classes nor took part in an exercise program at home. Both groups continued with their normal prenatal care and physical activity.

Briefly, several placental cotyledons were removed from the maternal side of the placenta and placed immediately into an ice-cold medium containing MSHE buffer (210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 5 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). All steps were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C. Soft villous tissue (4&#x02013;7 g) was freed from connective tissue and minced into small pieces with scissors. The tissue was washed with the same solution and then filtered three times through a thin surgical gauze layer. The tissue was re-suspended in the same medium and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (7 up-and-down strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 15 min to pellet large mitochondria (predominantly cytotrophoblast mitochondria) was resuspended in a minimal volume of respiratory medium containing MSH buffer (210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) adjusted to pH 7.4. A part of the isolated mitochondrial fraction was frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the enzyme assays were performed.

Exercise training during pregnancy led to a 2-fold increase in eNOS expression and a 4-fold increase in NO production in placental cytosol. Exercised women also showed 6% decreases in mitochondrial O<sub>2&#x02212;</sub> levels and 26% decreases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production rate in placental mitochondria. NO generated by NOS has been demonstrated to contribute to the regulation of vascular tone by counteracting the actions of vasoconstrictors <xref rid="pone.0080225-Rossmanith1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. NOS in the placental villous vasculature also corresponds to the type III calcium-calmodulin-dependent endothelial isoform, and no such NOS was found in the cytotrophoblast layer or in small fetal blood capillaries of term placenta <xref rid="pone.0080225-Myatt2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. According to the present findings, a combined resistance and aerobic exercise training program leads to an increased eNOS expression and NO production in human placental tissue. Potentially, the underlying mechanisms may relate to an exercise induced increase in shear stress on the endothelial monolayer, in turn enhancing the activity of enzymes such as eNOS and extracellular superoxide dismutase and shifting the reactive oxygen balance toward the beneficial NO <xref rid="pone.0080225-Laufs1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, other vasoactive substances such as prostacyclin, or endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) could also be involved <xref rid="pone.0080225-SierraLaguado1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080225-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It has been reported that exercise produces a state of hyperemia and an increase of blood flow and shear stress with a consequent increase in the production and bioactivity of NO <xref rid="pone.0080225-RamrezVlez1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080225-RamirezVelez1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, parallel or subsequent events are less clear, and whether the improvement in endothelium function induced by exercise during pregnancy observed in the present study has a beneficial effect in the prevention of these disorders (i.e., reduced risk of preeclampsia, diabetes or hypertension), is yet to be determined.</p><p>The placenta generates reactive oxygen species which may contribute to the oxidative stress seen even in normal pregnancy, but this is increased in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia, IUGR and gestational diabetes where elevated oxidative and nitrative stress have been clearly documented <xref rid="pone.0080225-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Nitrative stress is the covalent modification of proteins and DNA by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formed by the interaction of O<sub>2&#x02212;</sub> and NO <xref rid="pone.0080225-Myatt3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In the present study, reactive oxygen species O<sub>2&#x02212;</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were significantly diminished in human placental mitochondria from exercised women as compared with control subjects, suggesting that chronic exercise training results in a lower level of oxidative stress. Studies by Bo et al. <xref rid="pone.0080225-Bo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> showed that during prolonged exercise, UCP2 mRNA expression and activity in rat heart can be upregulated, thereby reducing cross-membrane &#x00394;&#x003c8; and reactive oxygen species production. One of the important effects of increased UCP2 expression is to decrease the generation of oxygen free radicals in the mitochondria. These results were in agreement with studies by Venditti et al. <xref rid="pone.0080225-Venditti1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> who found that succinate-supported H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release was higher in skeletal muscle from trained rats in both State 4 and State 3, while training did not affect mitochondrial oxygen consumption with both complex-I- and complex II-linked substrates.</p><p>We also report that exercise training during pregnancy was associated with a decreased placental weight, but an increased placental efficiency (fetal weight: placental weight). Previous studies have reported a wide range of effects of chronic exercise before and during pregnancy on conceptus weight in both humans <xref rid="pone.0080225-ClappIII2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080225-Bergmann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and rats <xref rid="pone.0080225-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The underlying differences between these observations remain unclear but the wide variation in the amounts and types of exercise are likely contributing factors. Further studies are needed to determine if other indices of placenta function such as transport of amino acids and vascular density are improved by exercise training.</p><p>More laboratory based studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm and elaborate the effects of aerobic and resistance exercises as the small sample size, warrants caution in the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, these results may offer a plausible explanation for previous reports showing a decreased incidence of preeclampsia in woman participating in exercise training <xref rid="pone.0080225-Yeo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and are consistent with findings from previous studies in other tissues <xref rid="pone.0080225-RamrezVlez2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>As a general conclusion, regular exercise training during the second half of pregnancy increases eNOS expression and NO production and decreases reactive oxygen species generation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in placental mitochondria. This finding provides a pathophysiologic framework for the elucidation of the positive effects of exercise on placental human and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of exercise training to improve fetal oxygenation and in turn potentially reduce risk of gestational disorders associated with impaired endothelial function <xref rid="pone.0080225-Echeverri1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0080225-SierraLaguado1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
