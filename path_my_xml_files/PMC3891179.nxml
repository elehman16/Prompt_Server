World Health Organization and International League of Associations of Rheumatology launched Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases [WHO-ILAR COPCORD] study from the rural population of Western India has reported about 5.5% prevalence of osteoarthritis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Prevalence of osteoarthritis increases as the age advances. With an increase in aging population, the burden of this disease is going to be substantial on society at large. Currently palliative management through analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is the mainstay of pharmacotherapy. The use of which is also apprehended due to serious side effects; particularly on long-term use. Dependable disease-modifying anti-osteoarthritic drug is still a distant dream. Only option left for patients is either conservative non-pharmacological measures or radical surgical interventions. Hence; the search continues for safe, effective and convenient drugs.</p><p>ABFN02 is developed on the foundation of a classical Ayurvedic formulation which is indicated for degenerative diseases and arthritis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The formulation has two main ingredients <italic>viz</italic>. Bhallatak (<italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic>) and Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordipholia</italic>). Both these ingredients are reputed as &#x02018;<italic>rasayana</italic>&#x02019; (rejuvenative/reparative) drugs in Ayurvedic literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However; Bhallatak is known for its adverse effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The study is aimed at evaluating the long-term (six month) efficacy and safety of ABFN02 and compares it with glucosamine sulphate. Glucosamine sulphate is widely used natural product consumed world over for the treatment of osteoarthritis which has also demonstrated to have disease modifying benefits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Therefore it was thought appropriate to compare it with ABFN02 the natural product from Ayurveda.</p><p>This CSIR-NMITLI Government of India funded project was founded on the principles of Reverse pharmacology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] for the development of globally competitive herbal product inspired from Ayurveda.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Total 112 patients of osteoarthritis of knee were allocated at two clinical centers during the period July 2006 to March 2007. All patients were in the age group of 40 to 75 years, ambulant and seeking medication for their ailment.</p><p>This was a randomized comparative open clinical study of 24 weeks with the assessor blind. Patients were evaluated before treatment (baseline), at periodic intervals (2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 18 weeks) during treatment and after completion of treatment (24 weeks). The clinical study was conducted as per the Good Clinical Practices by International Conference of Harmonization guidelines, declaration of Helsinki and national regulatory norms.</p><p>Ethics Committee approval from respective institutions and patient's informed written consent was obtained before initiation of the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Criteria for Selection</title><p>Diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee was made using clinical classification of American College of Rheumatology Criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] All patients having knee pain, with visual analogue scale for pain (Pain-VAS) more than &#x0201b;4&#x02019; on scale of 10; either at rest or on activity in last 24 h and having radiological evidence of osteoarthritis were included for the study.</p><p>Pregnant or lactating women of child bearing potential and not following adequate contraceptive measures, patients with known hypersensitivity to Bhallatak and history of allergic diatheses with vesication and chronic alcoholics were excluded. Patients having severe disabling arthritis, active peptic ulcer, bleeding ulcer, severe renal, hepatic, hematopoietic disease or cardiac insufficiency were not included. Patients on treatment of anticoagulants, hydantoin, lithium, corticosteroids, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, methotrexate, colchicine and having received intra-articular steroid injection and any investigational drug within a month preceding the study were excluded. Subjects with positive Rheumatoid factor (RA test) were excluded since Rheumatoid arthritis on rare occasions may initially present as a single/pauciarticular disease.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Drug material</title><p>Investigational drug Amrut Bhallatak (ABFN02) was specially prepared at Shree Dhootpapeshwar Ltd. by a classical method described in Brihat Nighantu Ratnakar[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and were made available in the form of tablets of 750 mg each. Glucosamine sulphate (GS) was also made available by Meyer Organics in the form of 750 mg tablet each. The size, shape, color and texture of both these tablets of ABFN02 and GS were comparable and were supplied in a similar container with a coded label.</p><p>Purity of the product was ensured for heavy metal content, pesticide residue, microbial load and aflatoxins contamination as per WHO guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Acute animal toxicity Study carried under OECD Guidelines No. 423.

ABFN02 which has Bhallatak (<italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic>) as a main ingredient, known to produce intolerance and toxic effects was better adhered to than Glucosamine sulphate (GS) which is considered as a natural product/dietary supplement sold over the counter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Better adherence to ABFN02 may be attributed to abiding to the ancillary clinical instructions desired for the intake of Bhallatak-based formulations (<italic>vide supra</italic>), the improvisation of traditional dosage form (Avaleha-electuary) into the convenient tablet form and fidelity to the classical manufacturing process for the development of the product (ABFN02). The classical manufacturing process probably subdues the potential toxic phenols present in the pericarp of Bhallatak seed, mainly responsible for the toxic effects.</p><p>Total pain VAS (Visual Analogue Score) was calculated after taking an average of pain VAS of both the Knee (Right and Left) on activity and at rest has shown statistically significant improvement from baseline in all the three groups. Although ABFN02 had an edge over GS there was no significant superiority of one over other. Similarly proportion of patients with &#x0003e; 50% total pain VAS score reduction was found to be higher with ABFN02 (44/67) over GS (14/26). Total WOMAC index (semi-quantitative estimation of pain, stiffness and difficulty in activity measures) and HAQ score have also shown statistically significant reduction from baseline in all the three groups with higher reduction in ABFN02 over GS. In this study, we have observed consistently significant symptom modifying effects with ABFN02 as well as with Glucosamine sulphate. It has been reported that the symptomatic effect size of glucosamine varies greatly depending on the formulation used and the quality of clinical trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>All the three categories clinical, laboratory and imaging evaluated for secondary objective variables have shown improvement in all the three groups however notable are urinary CTX-II and MRI for disease modifying effects. The CTX-II values have demonstrated wide standard deviation in all the three groups&#x02019; pre and post treatment. However not withstanding with the statistical application the quantum of average drop in CTX-II value is larger in Group A (GS) than in Group B and C (ABFN02). This observation is difficult to explain in view of the conflicting clinical evidence against GS for disease modifying activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and traditional reputation of the ABFN02 ingredients having Rasayana (reparative and reconstructive) activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] as well as our exploratory study results of carryover effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Our previous exploratory study of six weeks duration in 45 patients of OA knee noted substantial pain relief in these patients. Also persistence of therapeutic effect was reported in majority of these patients after withdrawal of the drug. Patients who had reappearance of pain showed reproducibility of the effect on reintroduction of the drug.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism play important role in the bioavailability and eventual efficacy of GS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Interestingly in this study, patients were advised to take the medicines with milk and were also advised to abide with certain ancillary Ayurvedic instructions (<italic>vide supra</italic>) which are obligatory when a product has a <italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic> as a major ingredient. To avoid bias in this randomized comparative study these instructions were recommended to all the three groups including Group A receiving Glucosamine sulphate.</p><p>In the imaging modality of MRI although only eight patients could be evaluated before and after treatment of six months; four out of six patients taking ABFN-02 had improvement seen on MRI on account of bone marrow swelling, synovitis and bursitis indicating directionality towards disease modifying potential of the product. The study formulation ABFN02 which has only two ingredients Bhallatak (<italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic>) and Guduchi (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic>) have independently demonstrated their activity in degenerative disorders[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and arthritis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>No serious and severe clinical adverse event was reported by any patient in this six month study of 112 patients. All the laboratory investigations undertaken for assessment of safety profile were within normal range before, during and after treatment. However the liver aminotransferases had been raised in 18% of patients receiving ABFN02. Evidently the rise of SGOT and SGPT was primarily in the later visits of drug interventions. Although five patients (6.5%) had rise in aminotranferases to the tune of three to five fold of ULN; all these patients were asymptomatic and liver enzymes came back to normal within six weeks off the drug without any sequelae. In the earlier exploratory study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] of six weeks duration, we had observed similar asymptomatic and reversible rise in liver enzymes in 3/45 patients when the effective dose of Bhallatak had crossed the dose of 20 gms Bhallatak RM/day (Raw Material) beyond 5<sup>th</sup> week of the study. For the present study the precaution was taken by limiting the highest possible daily dose of 18 gms Bhallatak RM/day in a pulse dose regimen gradually stepped up over six weeks. It needs to ascertain whether this is cumulative dose liver toxicity? Do we need to give longer gap of more than six weeks of duration when drug is repeated in the pulse dose incremental regimen? Whether we should limit long-term continuous administration of Bhallatak formulations even for relatively lower dose? Other clinical study having <italic>Semecarpus anacardium</italic> and <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> in combination with other traditional herbs have demonstrated efficacy in osteoarthritis however here also 2/19 patients receiving Bhallatak in combination have shown rise in liver enzyme SGPT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It is imperative to remind <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> another equal amount of ingredient in the ABFN02 has well demonstrated hepatoprotective activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Notably our independent long-term (120 days) animal toxicity study has not demonstrated any significant liver damage on histopathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>Interestingly, Methotrexate the drug of choice amongst disease modifying antirheumatic drugs used conventionally in clinical practice is monitored for its liver toxicity and the effective dose is titrated against liver transaminases. Captivatingly the incidence of methotrexate induced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is approximately 14%, while the incidence of increases into the abnormal range of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is 8%in non-malignant diseases on oral use and the abnormality of liver enzymes usually resolves within one month of discontinuation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Current study, earlier exploratory study, other concurrent clinical study and congruent experimental evidence suggests promising role for Bhallatak based formulations in the management of osteoarthritis. However the potential hepato-toxicity demands thorough phytochemical analysis for identification and optimization of phyto-actives and minimization of phyto-toxic components. Experimental studies with identified <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> models for better insight in mechanisms of action would help further improvise this age old classical Ayurvedic product and evaluate its disease modifying role in the management of osteoarthritis.</p><p>Meanwhile those using Bhallatak based formulation should be vigilant about liver enzymes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank CSIR, Government of India, NMITLI cell and the office bearer particularly Dr. YogeshwarRao and Dr. Meenaxi Singh for managerial and financial support.
