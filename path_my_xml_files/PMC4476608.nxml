This longitudinal study&#x02019;s objectives were (a) to identify predictors of working alliance and (b) to investigate whether client and/or therapist reports of the working alliance predicted posttreatment motivation and then later treatment outcome. Client and therapist perceptions of the working alliance were assessed after the first treatment session using a short form of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) among 173 clients taking part in the United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT) and randomized to motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or social behavior and network therapy (SBNT) with complete data on all measures of interest. Structural equation models were fitted to identify predictors of WAI scores and investigate the relationships between WAI and measures of drinking during treatment, posttreatment motivation, and successful treatment outcome (abstinent or nonproblem drinker), and measures of drinks per drinking day and nondrinking days, assessed 9 months after the conclusion of treatment. Motivation to change drinking when treatment began was a strong predictor of client&#x02014;adjusted coefficient = 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.36, 4.06]&#x02014;but not therapist WAI. Client WAI predicted successful treatment outcome&#x02014;adjusted odds ratios (OR) = 1.09 (95% CI [1.02, 1.17])&#x02014;and had effects on drinking during treatment, and on posttreatment motivation to change. There was evidence for effect modification by treatment, with strong associations between WAI and posttreatment motivation, and evidence of WAI prediction of treatment outcomes in the MET group, but no evidence of associations for SBNT. Therapist WAI was not strongly associated with treatment outcome (adjusted OR = 1.05; 95% CI [0.99, 1.10]). The working alliance is important to treatment outcomes for alcohol problems, with client evaluation of the alliance strongly related to motivation to change drinking throughout treatment for MET. It was also much more important than therapist-rated alliance in this study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>working alliance</kwd><kwd>therapeutic alliance</kwd><kwd>alcohol treatment</kwd><kwd>treatment outcome</kwd><kwd>readiness to change</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Investigation of treatment processes is important for understanding how treatment for alcohol problems works and, in particular, which aspects of treatment are responsible for beneficial outcomes. A factor common to all treatments is the collaborative relationship between therapist and client, known as the <italic>therapeutic</italic> or <italic>working alliance</italic>. This has been shown to have an important impact on treatment outcomes for a wide range of psychological problems (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1">Barnicot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1">Horvath, Del Re, Fluckiger, &#x00026; Symonds, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1">Martin, Garske, &#x00026; Davis, 2000</xref>), though much less is known about the role of the working alliance in treatment for alcohol problems, both in terms of what factors are important for the development of a strong working alliance and the impact of working alliance on treatment outcomes.</p><p>In respect of factors promoting the development of a strong working alliance during treatment, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1">Connors et al. (2000)</xref> found the only consistent predictors in both the outpatient and aftercare arms of Project MATCH were readiness to change for client-reported working alliance and client gender for therapist-reported alliance. <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1">Wolfe et al. (2013)</xref> also found that baseline motivation was associated with aspects of client-rated therapeutic alliance in a sample of 77 clients referred for treatment to drug and alcohol services. Stage of change has previously been found to be an important predictor of developing a strong client-rated working alliance in treatment for other problems (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1">Emmerling &#x00026; Whelton, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1">Rochlen, Rude, &#x00026; Baron, 2005</xref>) although this has not been found when working alliance is assessed by the therapist (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2">Rochlen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>With respect to the importance of the working alliance for treatment outcomes, a review of substance use studies showed that working alliance had a small and consistent positive effect on treatment attendance but that findings for treatment outcomes themselves were variable (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1">Meier, Barrowclough, &#x00026; Donmall, 2005</xref>). Other drug users were necessarily the main focus of this review as only one of the 17 included studies (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1">Connors, Carroll, DiClemente, Longabaugh, &#x00026; Donovan, 1997</xref>) primarily addressed alcohol. Another substance use treatment evaluation study that included alcohol problems found that poorer outcomes were associated with therapists who had either very low or very high alliance scores (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1">Crits-Christoph et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>By its nature, working alliance can be assessed by both therapist and client, as well as by an observer. Generally, client assessments of the working alliance have been found to be more important than therapist reports for predicting treatment outcomes across psychological problem domains (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1">Barber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1">Fitzpatrick, Iwakabe, &#x00026; Stalikas, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>). However, this does not seem to be the case for treatment for alcohol problems in the few studies that have investigated this issue. Analyses of Project MATCH data (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2">Connors et al., 1997</xref>) found that whether working alliance predicted drinking outcomes after 12 months depended on study setting; both therapist and client working alliance predicted drinking outcomes among outpatients but in the aftercare arm the only statistically significant relationship found was between therapist-rated working alliance and percentage days abstinent at follow up. In a sample of 194 alcohol-dependent outpatients taking part in a three-arm placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone, therapist but not client ratings of the working alliance predicted drinking outcomes in one treatment arm (medication plus an intervention promoting pharmacotherapy) but neither client nor therapist ratings predicted treatment in the other two treatment arms (medication only; medication plus cognitive behavior therapy) (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1">Dundon et al., 2008</xref>). <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1">Long et al. (2000)</xref> found no evidence that client-assessed working alliance predicted drinking outcomes 12 months after cognitive-behavior therapy among 188 alcohol dependent patients, with the effects of therapist-rated working alliance not assessed in this study. Ilgen and colleagues (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1">Ilgen, McKellar, Moos, &#x00026; Finney, 2006</xref>) in a later Project MATCH study found that client-rated alliance predicted less drinking after 6 months but not 12 months and did not interact with motivation. Therapist-rated alliance, however, predicted lower alcohol use at both intervals, and interacted with motivation such that alliance was more important for those with low motivation (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2">Ilgen et al., 2006</xref>). Given the unclear picture that emerges from these sparse findings on the relative importance of client or therapist reports of working alliance for alcohol treatment outcome, alongside the fact that these findings conflict with those from the wider literature, further investigation of this area is warranted.</p><p>Some studies have indicated the importance of posttreatment motivation for longer-term drinking outcomes (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1">Carbonari &#x00026; DiClemente, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1">Cook, Heather, &#x00026; McCambridge, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1">Heather, McCambridge, &#x00026; the UKATT Research Team, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1">Hunter-Reel, McCrady, Hildebrandt, &#x00026; Epstein, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1">Korcha, Polcin, Bond, Lapp, &#x00026; Galloway, 2011</xref>). However, no studies have previously investigated how working alliance influences this variable. We hypothesized that working alliance affects posttreatment motivation to change drinking and subsequently impacts on longer-term posttreatment drinking outcomes.</p><p>In summary, there has been limited previous study of the role of the working alliance in the successful treatment of alcohol problems and its possible importance is unclear. This is surprising in light of the strength and consistency of findings available for other psychological problems (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-2">Barnicot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-2">Horvath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-3">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-2">Martin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1">Roos &#x00026; Werbart, 2013</xref>). The aims of this longitudinal study were (a) to identify predictors of working alliance and (b) to investigate whether client- and/or therapist-reported working alliance predicted drinking behavior during treatment, motivation to change posttreatment, and treatment outcome 9 months after treatment was concluded, and whether the relationships between these variables were in accordance with the hypothesis stated above. We also examined measures of drinks per drinking day and nondrinking days as secondary outcomes to provide additional information on the nature of any observed relationships.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Sample</title><p>The United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT) was a multicenter randomized controlled trial carried out in five treatment centers in the United Kingdom, comparing two different treatments for alcohol problems (Motivational Enhancement Therapy [MET] and Social Behavior and Network Therapy [SBNT]) delivered over a 3-month period, after which treatment was terminated (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1">UKATT Research Team, 2005</xref>). In total, 742 clients were recruited and randomized to receive either MET (<italic>n</italic> = 422) or SBNT (<italic>n</italic> = 320). Ethical approval was granted by all relevant local ethics committees. No differences in any outcomes were found between the two treatment groups in the main trial intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2">UKATT Research Team, 2005</xref>). Drinking behavior and stage of change were assessed pretreatment, posttreatment, and 9 months after treatment ended (i.e., 12 months after entry). Working alliance was assessed after the first treatment session independently by client and therapist. The confidentiality of WAI responses was stressed and clients placed their completed forms in a sealed envelope. Assessment of the working alliance by an observer was not undertaken in this study. This was the first session of the evaluated treatments, occurring after the completion of client assessments. Previous UKATT analyses found that neither client nor therapist WAI was associated with treatment attendance (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1">Dale et al., 2011</xref>); however, the relationships between WAI and treatment outcomes were not assessed. UKATT was a pragmatic trial and took place in busy clinic settings, so the working alliance was not assessed in all clients. Overall the working alliance was assessed by both therapist and client for 254 clients. To facilitate comparisons of the predictive validity of the different raters, only those with both client and therapist measures of working alliance available were included in this study. For the purposes of this study, analyses are also restricted to 173 of 254 clients for whom both the posttreatment assessment and longer-term follow-up data were available.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s5"><title>Alcohol</title><p>Drinking behavior and consequences were measured using the Form 90 (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1">Miller, 1996</xref>), the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1">Raistrick et al., 1994</xref>) and the Alcohol Problems Questionnaire (APQ) (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1">Drummond, 1990</xref>) pretreatment, after 3 months (i.e., immediately posttreatment), and at 9 months posttreatment. The Form 90 is a structured interview assessment of drinking and related behaviors over the previous 90 days. The LDQ is a 10-item questionnaire used to measure severity of dependence. The APQ is a questionnaire designed to measure the extent of alcohol problems (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-2">Drummond, 1990</xref>). In this study the 23-item common scale was used, excluding subscales that apply only to certain groups (those who were married, had children, or were in employment). Form 90 data were used to calculate two continuous measures of drinking behavior in the previous 90 days: percentage days abstinent (PDA) and average number of drinks per drinking day (DDD) with those who were totally abstinent given a score of 0. Form 90 and APQ data were used to construct a binary measure of successful treatment outcome at 9 months after treatment ended: abstinent or nonproblem drinker (no alcohol consumption in the past 90 days or some drinking with a score of zero on the APQ, indicating no evidence of any problems) versus the remainder of the sample. This binary outcome measure was derived from the composite categorical variable developed by <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1">Heather and Tebbutt (1989)</xref> for treatment outcome evaluation purposes, and has been used in earlier UKATT analyses (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-2">Heather, McCambridge, &#x00026; the UKATT Research Team 2013</xref>). This definition of treatment outcome was chosen for the main model as the most stringent of available candidates that did not require abstinence alone (in line with the nature of the treatments evaluated), to investigate in more detail pathways from working alliance to longer-term drinking outcomes (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1">B. Muth&#x000e9;n, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Motivation to change</title><p>The 12-item Readiness to Change Questionnaire (Treatment Version); <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1">Heather &#x00026; Honekopp, 2008</xref>) was used to allocate to one of three stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, and action. Respondents were asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with each item on a 5-point Likert scale, with each item scored between &#x02212;2 (strongly disagree) and +2 (strongly agree) so that scores for each stage range from &#x02212;8 to +8. Clients were assigned to the stage of change on which they had the highest subscale score with ties being decided in favor of the stage farthest along the continuum of change. As no clients were in the precontemplation stage pretreatment, and only two were posttreatment, stage of change was converted into a binary variable (action vs. preaction).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Working alliance</title><p>Working alliance was measured using a modified version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1">Horvath &#x00026; Greenberg, 1989</xref>). The 12-item short-form of the WAI has been validated and found to be interchangeable with the full form (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1">Busseri &#x00026; Tyler, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1">Tracey &#x00026; Kokotovic, 1989</xref>). However, this version of the WAI used seven response options indicating the frequency with which the experience described by an item had occurred (i.e., from &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;always&#x0201d;) and in UKATT it was thought inappropriate to ask participants how often statements about the working alliance applied after only one session of therapy. For this reason, response options in the UKATT version of the short-form WAI were changed to a 5-point agreement&#x02013;disagreement Likert scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). This approach has been strongly supported in a recent validation study using item response theory by <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1">Mallinckrodt and Tekie (2014)</xref>. They identified redundancy among the seven response options and improvements in psychometric performance with a 5-point agreement-based Likert response scale. In the UKATT version, scores were calculated by summing responses on each item, with a higher score indicating a stronger alliance up to a maximum score of 60. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha for this measure was 0.87 for client-ratings of WAI and 0.90 for therapist ratings.</p><p>Sociodemographic variables measured pretreatment were client age (coded in to 5-year age groups), gender, marital status (coded as married/cohabiting or not), education (coded as no qualifications; some qualifications [school leaving qualification, i.e., any GCSEs or A levels/commercial apprenticeship/Higher National Certificate/Higher National Diploma/Foreign or other qualifications]; and university/college degree or equivalent qualifications), employment status (coded as currently employed or not), and parenthood (client has one or more children).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Relationships between therapist and client WAI scores, posttreatment motivation, and treatment outcomes 9 months posttreatment were investigated using linear and logistic regression with models adjusted for (a) sociodemographic variables, treatment site, and treatment group, and then additionally (b) drinking behavior, LDQ score, and pretreatment motivation. Models were not adjusted for drinking behavior during treatment since working alliance (measured after the first treatment session) could influence drinking during treatment which would then lie on the causal pathway, resulting in overadjustment.</p><p>A structural equation model was then fitted reflecting hypothesized relationships between working alliance, motivation to change, and binary treatment outcome (abstinent or nonproblem drinker vs. the remainder of outcome sample). The client-rated WAI model for the primary outcome is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-1" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Hypotheses about the direction of relationships were based on temporality, that is, pretreatment variables must necessarily influence working alliance rather than the other way round. Using this explicitly longitudinal perspective to organize the assessment of relationships between variables, we included indirect pathways from WAI to treatment outcome via drinking behaviors during treatment and posttreatment motivation to change drinking immediately posttreatment. These pathways model the effect of WAI on treatment outcome due to changes during treatment. We also included a direct pathway from working alliance to treatment outcome 9 months later. This pathway represents the effects on WAI on drinking outcome at 9 months due to unmeasured factors not captured by changes in drinking during treatment or posttreatment motivation such as processes unrelated to treatment after the first session. We hypothesized that any effect of WAI on treatment outcome would be indirect, that is, due to within treatment changes in drinking behavior and motivation. Separate models were fitted for client and therapist WAI in relation to this primary outcome and then for two continuous drinking outcomes measured at 9 months (PDA and DDD) to assess whether there were differences between client and therapist reports. The primary treatment outcome model was also used to investigate which pretreatment factors were predictors of client and therapist WAI.<xref ref-type="fig-anchor" rid="fig1"/></p><p>Estimation was carried out using weighted least squares with mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV). This resulted in the estimation of probit coefficients for binary outcomes and regression coefficients for linear outcomes. Probit regression was used for the structural equation models to estimate both direct and indirect effects under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders for exposure-outcome, exposure-mediator, and mediator-outcome relations (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2">B. Muth&#x000e9;n, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1">VanderWeele, 2012</xref>). Indirect effects were calculated using the product of coefficients method. Model fit was assessed using the confirmatory fit index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). For the CFI and TLI, a value over 0.90 indicates acceptable fit and over 0.95 good fit (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1">Streiner, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1">Tabachnik &#x00026; Fidell, 1996</xref>). For the RMSEA, a value less than 0.08 indicates acceptable fit and less than 0.05 good fit (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2">Streiner, 2006</xref>).</p><p>For sensitivity analyses, we also included data in the logistic regression models for additional clients with follow up data where only one assessment of WAI was made (client only, <italic>n</italic> = 30; therapist only, <italic>n</italic> = 19) to examine if there was any selection bias resulting from our criterion that both measures must be included. Finally, the logistic regression models were stratified by treatment group to investigate whether there was any evidence of interaction. This was tested by including an interaction term between WAI and treatment group in the model. Given the small numbers of clients, particularly among those randomized to SBNT, results were not stratified in the structural equation model even if evidence of interaction was detected. Analyses were carried out using Stata 12 (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1">StataCorp., 2011</xref>) and MPlus 5 (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1">Muth&#x000e9;n &#x00026; Muth&#x000e9;n, 1998&#x02013;2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s9"><title>Results</title><sec id="s10"><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>This study included 173 of the 254 clients who had complete WAI data.

Therapist-reported WAI was lower in the 81 excluded clients (44.9 vs. 47.0, <italic>p</italic> = .03) but there was no evidence of a difference in client-assessed WAI (47.9 vs. 48.6, <italic>p</italic> = .30).

Consistent with the larger UKATT sample that saw both greater numbers randomized to MET (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3">UKATT Research Team, 2005</xref>) and higher levels of initial treatment engagement in clients randomized to MET (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2">Dale et al., 2011</xref>), the current sample included a greater proportion of MET to SBNT clients than the 569 clients who were excluded due to missing data: 76% (131/173) MET in study sample versus 51% (291/569) MET in those excluded (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). There was also strong evidence of a difference by study site where clients were treated (percentage of participants excluded per site ranged from 63&#x02013;91%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001).

There was good evidence that therapist WAI predicted PDA during treatment but the estimated size of this effect was smaller than the client WAI (1.08% vs. 0.72% increase per point increase in WAI).

We show here that, in a subsample of the UKATT study participants, client WAI predicted drinking outcomes during treatment and treatment outcome 9 months after treatment ended and was strongly associated with motivation to change drinking both immediately pre- and posttreatment. These associations with treatment outcome were observed in those randomized to MET but not those randomized to SBNT. Therapist WAI did not predict drinking outcome at 9 months or show any association with motivation to change drinking either pre- or post treatment. The pathway from client WAI to treatment outcomes seemed to be explained mainly through impact on drinking during treatment and posttreatment motivation. However, although there were few relationships with drinking variables during and posttreatment, there was good evidence of a direct effect of therapist-rated working alliance, once pathways through changes in drinking during treatment and posttreatment motivation were controlled for, on one of the three treatment outcomes (PDA at 9 months) and weak evidence for a direct effect for the main binary outcome investigated here. These findings suggest there are other pathways unrelated to change within treatment which may lead to an association between Session 1 therapist WAI and treatment outcome 12 months later (9 months posttreatment).</p><p>The findings on baseline predictors of client-rated working alliance are similar to those from the one other alcohol treatment study which has explored this question. <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2">Connors et al. (2000)</xref> also found stage of change consistently predicted client WAI in Project MATCH. These findings are also consistent with studies in areas other than alcohol treatment where later stages of change pretreatment are associated with higher client ratings of working alliance (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2">Emmerling &#x00026; Whelton, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-3">Rochlen et al., 2005</xref>). Older clients also rated working alliance more highly.</p><p>In the few previous alcohol treatment studies investigating this, therapist ratings of the working alliance have been more consistent predictors of outcomes (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-3">Connors et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-2">Dundon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-2">Long et al., 2000</xref>), whereas in the present study client WAI was a much stronger predictor of 9 month posttreatment outcome than therapist WAI for the primary outcome. Indirect effects were reflected in a stronger influence of client WAI on drinking during treatment and on motivation to change posttreatment, which has itself been found to predict longer-term drinking outcomes in UKATT (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-2">Cook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-3">Heather, McCambridge, &#x00026; the UKATT Research Team, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The specificity of the findings for MET, identified here, suggests that treatment content may play an important role in explaining discrepancies with previous alcohol studies. These data provide evidence that different alcohol treatments may work in distinct ways, such that positive client rating of first session WAI is a necessary condition for the attainment of benefit from MET, although this is not so for SBNT where therapists nonetheless have some capacity to identify nontreatment predictors of positive outcomes. This possibility is entirely congruent with the nature of the treatments themselves (e.g., SBNT may proceed without the client even being present) and is somewhat consistent with findings that treatment setting (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-4">Connors et al., 1997</xref>) and treatment given (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-3">Dundon et al., 2008</xref>) were effect modifiers of the relationship between working alliance and treatment outcome in the previous studies.</p><p>How treatment outcome is measured is likely also to be important, as in our study evidence for any associations between WAI and the secondary outcomes, DDD and PDA at 9 months, was much weaker than for the primary outcome. It is also worth noting that the 81 clients with missing posttreatment or follow-up data had lower therapist, but not client, ratings of WAI, which may have contributed to underestimation of the predictive capacity of therapist-ratings. The apparently discrepant finding in the present study of a stronger relationship between client-reported working alliance and alcohol treatment outcome compared to therapist report is nonetheless consistent with the wider literature on the WAI and treatment for other psychological problems (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2">Barber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2">Fitzpatrick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-4">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our findings suggest that the client&#x02019;s evaluation of the working alliance after the first alcohol treatment session is more important for whether treatment is successful than the therapist&#x02019;s rating, as it is for other problems. The reasons for this finding are unclear, however two possible explanations for these findings with regard treatment for other problems have been suggested by <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-5">Horvath and Symonds (1991)</xref>. The first potential explanation is that, because clients can compare their current alliance with their own past experiences, they may be better at judging how well they as an individual are collaborating with their therapist. The second proposed explanation is that some therapists may overrate the working alliance early in treatment, for example mistaking apparent compliance for genuine collaboration, and this may be associated with poorer treatment outcomes (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-6">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>). Given that therapist and client ratings of working alliance were very weakly correlated with each other in this and other studies (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-3">Horvath et al., 2011</xref>), they may actually be identifying distinct interpersonal processes.</p><p>This is the first study to investigate the relationship between working alliance and posttreatment motivation to change drinking. The finding that client WAI predicted whether clients were in the action stage of change posttreatment is important given recent evidence of the predictive ability of this variable for longer-term drinking outcomes (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2">Carbonari &#x00026; DiClemente, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-3">Cook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-4">Heather, McCambridge, &#x00026; the UKATT Research Team, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2">Hunter-Reel et al., 2010</xref>). It is also important that this association was stronger among the MET treatment group because this therapy is specifically designed to target motivation.</p><p>The possibility of selection biases should be borne in mind when interpreting these findings. This was a subgroup of the UKATT participants and there is a need to replicate these findings in further studies. This is particularly relevant to the evidence that the associations between client ratings of the working alliance and both stage of change posttreatment and longer-term treatment outcomes depended upon treatment group. It should also be borne in mind that the numbers included, particularly of those randomized to SBNT, were small, and also that the available literature is limited on how WAI may mediate relationships between problem severity and treatment outcomes. The different rates of inclusion in this study by treatment group are a product both of differences in numbers randomized and differential attendance at any sessions between the two treatment arms (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3">Dale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-4">UKATT Research Team, 2005</xref>). It is also worth noting that only 68% of those in whom the working alliance was measured had follow up data available. This is a further potential source of selection bias given the strong possibility that the strength of the working alliance may have influenced whether clients remained in the study, as well as influencing treatment outcome.</p><p>It should be noted that although the short form of the WAI has been previously validated, there is limited evidence on the validity of the 5-point Likert response scale used in this study, although internal consistency as measured by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was high and a recent study provides strong support for this approach (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-2">Mallinckrodt &#x00026; Tekie, 2014</xref>). The limited use of this version of the scale also means it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of actual scores on the WAI, although this does not affect the interpretation of changes in score.</p><p>Because working alliance was assessed after the first treatment session, in keeping with other studies (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-4">Horvath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-7">Horvath &#x00026; Symonds, 1991</xref>), only those who attended at least one session could be included. This also means that findings are applicable only to working alliance forged in this first session and not thereafter. The development of the working alliance throughout treatment should also be expected to have important effects on treatment outcome, but this possibility lies beyond the scope of the present study as such data were not collected in this pragmatic trial. For the same reasons, it was not possible to study whether factors predicting a strong working alliance changed over time. These possibilities offer key directions for further research which, we suggest, should more explicitly adopt a longitudinal perspective.</p><p>A further limitation lies in the nature of the analyses undertaken here. It is entirely possible that clients who were more inclined to rate the working alliance highly in the first session were also those who were more likely to have positive treatment outcomes for reasons unrelated to the actual forging of the working alliance. Even if such confounding is at play, however, the capacity for client-rated WAI to be a marker rather than a cause of successful treatment outcome is nonetheless useful. It permits the identification of those for whom treatment may have diminished likelihood of successful outcome and thus invites consideration of whether adaptations of treatment content may be helpful (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1">McKay et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these findings support ratings of working alliance as important in explaining differences in outcome following treatment for alcohol problems, and perhaps also differences in the mechanisms of effects of different treatments. This is the first study to include effects of the working alliance on posttreatment motivation to change, in addition to longer-term treatment outcomes. For all outcomes, clients&#x02019; perceptions of the working alliance were more important than those of therapists. Together these findings suggest that it is possible to develop more client-centered investigations of treatment processes that have some capacity to aid better understanding of whether and how treatments work, and for whom.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="c1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>J.
