Product-specific research is important for identifying efficacy of combined ingredients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a proprietary pre-workout dietary supplement containing creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, L-Tarurine, L-Leucine, and caffeine, on anaerobic power, muscular strength, body composition, and mood states.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomized, matched-pair design, twenty male subjects (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD; 22.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5 yrs, 76.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.2 kg, 22.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5% body fat), consumed either 30 g of a pre-workout supplement (SUP) or maltodextrin placebo (PLC) 30 minutes before a resistance training workout, after completing baseline testing. Body composition was determined via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Subjects completed 12 vertical jumps for height (VJ) and one repetition maximum (1RM) and repetitions to failure lifts on bench (BPM) and leg press (LPM). Finally, subjects completed a Wingate power test on a cycle ergometer [mean power (WMP) and peak power (WPP)]. After baseline testing, participants completed eight days of supplementation and four split-body resistance-training bouts. Side effect questionnaires were completed daily 30 minutes after consuming the supplement. Subjects completed post-supplement testing on Day 8.

Supplements taken before a workout are often used to improve energy, alertness, strength, power, and body composition. To date, little product-specific research exists on pre-workout supplements containing multiple ingredients. Consumption of various individual ingredients often included in proprietary pre-workout blends are known to effectively increase time to fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], allowing for an increased training volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] although it is uncertain which combinations of ingredients are most effective. The following scientific support serves as the basis for formulation of proprietary blends and the inclusion of specific ingredients.</p><p>Beta-alanine, a precursor to carnosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], has been used to improve performance of high-intensity exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] by increasing the muscle carnosine pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Carnosine serves as a muscle buffer during intense exercise and increasing carnosine stores through beta-alanine supplementation can enhance this buffering ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Research on beta-alanine has shown that supplementation improves the rate of fatigue in sprinters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and improves YoYo Intermittent Recovery performance (the ability to repeatedly perform and recover from exercise) for amateur athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, beta-alanine supplementation has increased the number of repetitions to fatigue and overall work capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Creatine, the most extensively researched ergogenic aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], has been shown to increase strength and improve body composition in most individuals when combined with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Creatine&#x02019;s ergogenic abilities are derivative of its ability to rapidly replenish ATP stores, allowing for quicker recovery and potential increased training volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To properly load creatine stores in the muscle, it is recommended that an individual consume roughly 0.3g/kg/day for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 3-5g/day after the first three days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Alternately, a lower dose of 2-3g/day may also be utilized to increase stores slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Supplementation of creatine is also beneficial for improving lean body mass when combined with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. According to the International Society of Sport Nutrition Position Stand on Creatine, creatine monohydrate is currently the most effective supplement for increasing anaerobic capacity and lean body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Research on branched chain amino acids (BCAA) has concluded that supplementation can result in increased protein synthesis and additional lean body mass in multiple populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. BCAA have also been shown to improve muscular strength as well as an increase thigh mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Muscle damage has been markedly reduced after exercise and BCAA supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intake of BCAA, and leucine in particular, can create an anabolic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] by reducing protein oxidation and promoting sarcomerogenesis in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The inclusion of BCAA before or after an exercise session will help the body maintain a positive nitrogen balance and support muscle growth.</p><p>Another well researched ergogenic aid, caffeine, is often a key component to pre-workout supplements due to its stimulatory benefits, and subsequent improvements in time to fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Caffeine has also been shown to have a potential glycogen-sparring effect during exercise, likely improving endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and chronic beneficial changes in body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A dose of 3-6mg/kg of body weight can improve sport performance in trained individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Multiple studies have resulted in increased upper body strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] while still others have not seen the same results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Based on varying results, it appears that more research is needed to determine caffeine&#x02019;s effectiveness in the area of strength and power performance.</p><p>Caffeine is also a thermogenic, which explains its inclusion in weight loss supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Although beta-alanine, creatine, BCAAs, and caffeine are frequently the active ingredients in pre-workout supplements, different amounts can be used depending on the specific goals of the target population. Additionally, the actual degree of success and time frame for effects of multi-ingredient combinations differ for every individual and some consumers are considered non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The variances among formulation, composition, and timing of response can cause varying results. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute (one week) effects of a commercially available pre-workout supplement containing a proprietary blend of caffeine, creatine, BCAAs, and beta-alanine on strength, power, body composition, mood states, and tolerance measures when combined with a selected resistance four day training protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty males (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD; 22.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5 years, 76.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.2 kg, 22.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5% body fat) volunteered for the study. Participants were recruited for inclusion if they were healthy, resistance-trained (participated in a structured resistance training protocol for the past 36 months) males, able to bench press 120% of their body weight and leg press 2.5 times their body weight. The study protocol and procedures were approved by the University IRB committee prior to the start of the recruitment process and participants completed medical and exercise history surveys, as well as signed the written Informed Consent prior to study initiation. Participants were screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria by laboratory assistants. Volunteers were excluded from the study if they had any known metabolic disorders, history of pulmonary disease, hypertension, liver or kidney disease, musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disease, neurological disease, autoimmune disease, or any cancers, peptic ulcers, or anemia. Exclusionary measures also included having taken ergogenic levels of nutritional supplements that may affect muscle mass or aerobic capacity (e.g., creatine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate) or anabolic/catabolic hormone levels (e.g., androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, etc.) within six months prior to the start of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><sec><title>Baseline testing</title><p>Participants completed all testing measures in the following order: dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), vertical jump (VJ), bench press one repetition maximum (BPM), bench press repetitions to failure (BPRep; as many repetitions as possible at 85% BPM), leg press one repetition maximum (LPM), leg press repetitions to failure (LPRep; as many repetitions as possible at 85% LPM), and Wingate. Baseline measurements were determined on Day 0 (T1) before beginning the supplementation and training protocol. Participants completed a 4-day baseline diet log prior to testing, reporting all dietary intake (food, method of preparation, and quantity). All subjects were required to refrain from exercise for the 24-hours prior to testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Body composition</title><p>A DEXA scan (Discovery QDR, Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA) was utilized to measure body composition. Participants were positioned on their back and required to remain still for the six-minute scan. Body fat percentage (%BF), fat mass (FM) in grams, and lean body mass (LBM) in grams were determined by and recorded from the DEXA scan report.</p></sec><sec><title>Vertical jump</title><p>A measure of power output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Vertical Jump (VJ) was determined using the Vertec Jump Trainer (Sport Imports, Columbus, Oh.) following guidelines established by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. While following standard VJ procedures, each subject was allowed 12 attempts to reach their peak height. Jump measurements for all 12 attempts were recorded by a trained lab assistant in inches. Participants rested for one minute after each jump attempt. Participants were given 12 attempts to reach a true vertical jump height as pre-testing indicated that participants were still increasing jump height after 8&#x02013;10 jumps.</p></sec><sec><title>Strength measures</title><p>Participants completed 2 sets of 8&#x02013;10 repetitions of bench press on the dynamic Hammer Strength bench press (Life Fitness, Rosemont, IL.) at approximately 50% of anticipated max to prepare for the upper body strength tests. Participants then performed successive lifts starting at roughly 70% of anticipated 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and increasing by 5 &#x02013; 10 lbs after each successful lift until reaching a 1RM. Bench press maximum was recorded as the most weight they were able to lift before failure or a lift requiring assistance. A one repetition maximum on bench press was reached within three lifts on average. Participants were allowed to perform the lift at a self-selected pace, as long as the bar was lowered to the chest and pressed upward until the elbows were fully extended. After resting for five minutes, participants completed maximal repetitions at 85% of established BPM for a repetitions to failure measure (BPRep). Participants were instructed to complete as many repetitions as possible while maintaining required points of contact, touching their chest (without bounce) with the bar before returning to the start position, and without resting between each lift. A lab assistant counted repetitions until the participant could no longer maintain a steady rhythm or was unable to perform the exercise, at which point the participant was instructed to cease lifting.</p><p>A warm-up on the plate-loaded leg press (Life Fitness, Rosemont, IL.) (2 sets of 8 &#x02013; 10 repetitions at approximately 50% of anticipated maximum) was completed before subjects attempted 1RM lifts. Starting at about 70% of anticipated 1RM, weight was increased by 10&#x02013;25 lbs until participants reached a leg press 1RM. Participants were required to keep both feet flat on the foot platform and to lower the weight until their knees were at a 90&#x000b0; angle (signaled by a lab assistant), as per standard procedures. Once reaching the 90&#x000b0; mark, participants returned to the starting position without the help of lab personnel or pushing on their legs with their hands. On average, participants reached their 1RM within three attempts. Subjects again rested for five minutes then completed maximal repetitions at 85% of 1RM for a measure of lower extremity muscular repetitions to failure (LPRep). Lab assistants counted repetitions and instructed the participant on when to stop the exercise in a similar fashion as was done with BPRep.</p></sec><sec><title>Wingate anaerobic power test</title><p>Following a 15 minute rest, subjects performed the Wingate Load Test on the LODE Excalibur Sport Ergometer (Lode BV, Groningen, Netherlands). The Wingate testing protocol consists of a two minute warm-up period in which the participant was instructed to maintain a cadence of 60&#x02013;80 rpm followed by a 30 second sprint. When five seconds remained in the warm-up period, the participant started pedaling as hard and as fast as they could for the next 30 seconds while remaining seated. Over the course of the 30 second testing period, the resistance placed on the fly wheel remained constant at 0.75 N&#x02219;m&#x02219;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Peak power in Watts (WPP) and Watts produced over the course of the test and averaged to create a mean power (WMP) measure were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Diet log</title><p>Participants turned in a nine day diet log to lab personnel containing all foods and beverages consumed (type, brand, method of preparation, amount consumed) for the duration of the study (Day 0-Day 8). Diet logs were analyzed by lab personnel utilizing The Food Processor (esha Research, Salem, OR) Nutrition and Fitness Software.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementation and training</title><p>The study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo controlled manner with participants consuming either 30 g of the placebo (PLC; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; maltodextrin) or 30 g of the active supplement (SUP; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; XPAND2X&#x000ae;, Dymatize Enterprises, LLC., Dallas, TX) dissolved in eight to ten fluid ounces of water for eight days. The placebo and supplement were matched for color and taste and both were in powder form. All participants were matched according to their T1 LBM (SUP: 62525.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8023.39 g; PLC: 64753.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7026.71 g) and randomly assigned to either PLC or SUP. The active supplement contained 8.4 g of creatine monohydrate-beta-alanine blend, 4.8 g of BCAAs, and 275 mg of total caffeine in the 30 g serving. Thirty grams (three scoops) was the suggested serving size for experienced users per the manufacturer.</p><p>All subjects reported to the Human Performance Lab and completed the resistance training protocol under lab assistant supervision on four different days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) within one week. Because the purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of the supplement combined with resistance training, four workout sessions within the testing week appeared to be the most effective number of training sessions for the given amount of time. Thirty minutes prior to their workout, participants were asked to come to the Human Performance Lab to consume their assigned pre-workout beverage. To allow for proper nutrient absorption after intake, participants were required to wait 30 minutes before beginning their workout. During the 30 minute waiting period, participants remained in the Human Performance Lab.</p><p>Participants completed four resistance-training, split-body workouts consisting of 10 exercises, each performed for 3 sets of 8 repetitions with as much weight as was tolerated to lift per set (targeting 80% of 1RM) and one core exercise with 20 reps for 3 sets (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The participant rested for 1 minute between sets and for 2 minutes between exercises. Workouts were monitored by a trained research assistant to ensure the quality of each workout. Three hours following completion of each training session, participants completed a side-effects questionnaire to monitor and assess tolerance associated with pre-workout supplementation.

The improvements in LPM (+14.09&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.94 kg) from T1 to T2 for SUP (PLC: LPM: +5.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.93 kg) were likely due to a delayed onset of fatigue, attributable to the beta-alanine and creatine content of the supplement. Hoffman and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] discussed the combined effects of creatine and beta-alanine supplementation on delayed fatigue and ultimately increased training stimulus. Although four training sessions may be seen as an insufficient amount of time to significantly increase strength, the supplementation of these two ingredients, combined with a hypertrophy-focused resistance training protocol, may have allowed for increases in lower body strength in the present study. This is supported by Derave et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in which dynamic knee extension torque was significantly improved after four weeks of 4.8 g/day of beta-alanine supplementation. The improvements in strength in the study by Derave et al. as well as the present findings could be linked to a potential increase in training volume often allowed by increased beta-alanine and carnosine in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Hoffman and colleagues also saw a trend toward significance for Wingate anaerobic power tests (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) with three weeks of supplementation.</p><p>The absence of a supplement loading period may have negatively impacted the study. Beta-alanine does require a loading period and while creatine does not, it is often recommended that users follow a specific protocol for the first few days of supplementing with creatine to decrease the time to results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Because the supplementation period was only eight days in duration, a loading period would likely have been beneficial for the SUP group. Buford and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], in a review, suggest that creatine benefits will likely occur without a loading period, but may take four or more weeks to happen. In a study investigating different levels of dosing for beta-alanine in untrained males, a higher dose (3.2 g beta-alanine/day for four weeks, followed by 1.6 g beta-alanine/day for four weeks) more quickly increased muscle carnosine levels compared to the low dose (1.6 g beta-alanine/day for eight weeks), providing supporting evidence that beta-alanine may be more beneficial in a more timely manner when received in higher doses initially (loading) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Caffeine contained in the supplement may have contributed to the increase in lower body strength, although this would be a contradictory finding as much of the caffeine research resulted in no significant lower body strength increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Supplementing with caffeine before a workout has been shown to increase the amount of weight lifted during the chest press exercise although not the leg press [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Lower body testing was again not affected by caffeine consumption in a 2006 study by Beck and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Bench press 1RM was significantly increased after caffeine ingestion, but lower body strength and power (Wingate) were not changed. Although caffeine may have ergogenic effects on upper body strength and during activities more aerobic in nature, it is unlikely that the caffeine content of the active supplement in the current study had any effect on the LPM variable. Despite this finding, caffeine likely played a role in the improvement of %BF. Supplemental caffeine is often used to increase lipolysis during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and spare glycogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], a benefit that could potentially be seen if the supplement used in the present study was taken for a longer period of time. In one study, overweight participants consumed a dietary supplement containing 240 mg/day of caffeine for eight weeks and achieved a significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.006) amount of weight loss and fat mass loss in addition to a decrease in hip girth measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>It is also plausible that the increased LPM was due to the actual combination of ingredients rather than one single ingredient in particular. A similar pre-workout supplement, when ingested for a period of three weeks, significantly increased leg press strength in recreationally-trained males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The particular multi-ingredient supplement used in Spradley and associates&#x02019; research contained 300mg of caffeine as well as beta-alanine, creatine, and BCAAs included in the supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Multi-ingredient pre-workout drinks containing a combination of caffeine, creatine, amino acids, and beta-alanine, commonly demonstrating a delay in fatigue and improved peak and mean power measures after acute supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. One such supplemental drink was consumed by 15 trained males before each workout for eight weeks and results revealed significant improvements in strength for the experimental group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This study conducted by Kudrna and colleagues demonstrates the possibility for improvements through pre-exercise supplement drinks with an adequate training and supplementation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Increased training volume (attributable to delayed onset of fatigue) was seen after trained individuals consumed 18g of a multi-ingredient ergogenic supplement drink before high intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions for three weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Ingredients in the active supplement were similar to those in the current study (BCAAs, caffeine, creatine) and although group by time interactions were not significant in Smith&#x02019;s study, 95% confidence intervals suggested that the supplement was beneficial on measures of aerobic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Considering the short duration of supplementation, comparable conclusions can be drawn, suggesting potential training benefits related to the supplement if doses of ingredients and supplementation duration are adequate.</p><p>Based on the current body of knowledge and the results of this study, the ingredients in the experimental supplement and hypertrophy-focus training regimen may have the potential to increase lower body strength in resistance-trained young males. It is likely that the participants in the SUP group would have seen a significant ergogenic benefit (improved LPM) related to the supplement and training protocol after an extended supplementation period. Data from another study investigated performance variables as well as body composition effects of the same commercially available product used in the current study but with an eight week supplementation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Results support the conclusions and findings of the present study (improved strength and anaerobic power), suggesting long-term use may have greater benefits. The time delay in measurable results between these two studies reiterates the need for analyses of longer duration on pre-workout supplements as well as acute studies to determine how quickly supplement benefits can be realized.</p><p>The lack of a crossover design is one limitation to this study. Future acute research may investigate the effects of the proprietary supplement in a crossover manner to gain further knowledge of the potential for improved performance and/or body composition. A crossover study using the supplement used in the present study would also provide higher quality side-effect information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It may be beneficial for resistance trained males to consume a proprietary pre-workout supplement containing beta-alanine, creatine, BCAAs, and caffeine when wanting to improve lower body strength.
