Compared with normal weight individuals, obesity is associated with increased all-cause mortality, primarily due to a strong association with cardiovascular deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Obesity is also associated with multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, and chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Obese individuals have increased comorbidities; therefore, medical costs for these people are significantly higher than those for normal weight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the cost differential rises as obesity worsens. Two independent observational US database studies reported cost increases of 25&#x000a0;% for class I obese individuals (body mass index [BMI] 30&#x02013;34.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 50&#x000a0;% for class II obese individuals (BMI 35&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared with normal weight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Increases were observed in both inpatient and outpatient categories of service and were also independently observed in costs and numbers of prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Data from the US Health and Retirement Study demonstrated a mean increase in medical costs of $US1829 per year (year 2012 values) for obese compared with normal weight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In 2012, the US FDA approved a combination of phentermine and topiramate extended-release (ER) for chronic weight management with lifestyle modification in patients with obesity-related comorbidities. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, this combination led to a&#x000a0;&#x02265;10&#x000a0;% weight loss at 1&#x000a0;year in 48&#x000a0;% of patients receiving daily phentermine (15.0&#x000a0;mg) and topiramate ER (92.0&#x000a0;mg) and 37&#x000a0;% of patients receiving daily phentermine (7.5&#x000a0;mg) and topiramate ER (46.0&#x000a0;mg) compared with 7&#x000a0;% in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In an extension trial that followed a subgroup of patients who continued the medication, weight loss was sustained at 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Few clinical trials of anti-obesity drugs have included an explicit economic component despite growing concern about the cost of new treatments. In the absence of trial data, most studies of the cost impacts of anti-obesity drugs have employed modeling approaches based on assumptions of weight loss maintenance and a linear relationship between BMI status and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A recently published analysis of phentermine-topiramate ER imputed direct medical cost reductions using 1-year patient-reported medication changes during the clinical trial along with assumptions about physician visits, reporting an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US48,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over a 3-year time horizon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We aimed to estimate the change in medical services and costs associated with the metabolic improvements achieved with phentermine-topiramate ER treatment by matching real-world patients to the metabolic profiles of subjects post- and pre-treatment from the CONQUER trial. However, instead of using assumptions about the impact of BMI changes, we used actual patient-level data across a 4-year period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient Selection</title><p>The primary analysis evaluated patient cohorts modeled on ITT subjects in the phentermine (15&#x000a0;mg) and topiramate ER (92&#x000a0;mg) [phentermine-topiramate ER] study arm of the randomized controlled CONQUER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A secondary analysis modeled &#x02018;responder&#x02019; subjects completing the CONQUER trial on phentermine-topiramate ER. Similar to previous work on orlistat and sibutramine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], &#x02018;responders&#x02019; represented the subgroup of subjects who remained on therapy and lost&#x000a0;&#x02265;5&#x000a0;% of their body weight by the end of the CONQUER trial.</p><p>CONQUER ITT phentermine-topiramate subjects were characterized by sex, age, and inclusion criteria (BMI, glucose status, blood pressure, and triglyceride level) at the beginning (pre-trial) and end (post-trial) of the 1-year CONQUER study. Missing data were handled using last observation carried forward, consistent with the original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>A set of de-identified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant medical records of patients aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;40&#x000a0;years having at least two values for BMI between 2007 and 2011 was obtained from Humedica, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.49 million). Though younger subjects represented 15&#x000a0;% of ITT subjects in the CONQUER study arm we modeled, records for patients under 40&#x000a0;years were not available for release. An index date was assigned to each patient&#x02019;s first encounter that included a valid BMI preceded by&#x000a0;&#x02265;6&#x000a0;months of clinical data. For inclusion, patients were required to have&#x000a0;&#x02265;3&#x000a0;years of follow-up data from the index date.</p><p>Next, CONQUER clinical exclusion criteria were applied to the database patients. Remaining patients were classified by sex, age, BMI, hypertension status, glycemic status, and triglyceride status on their index dates. To develop patient cohorts, up to three patients from the remaining pool of eligible database patients were matched (with replacement) to each CONQUER subject&#x02019;s post-trial and pre-trial states using the following six criteria: age (&#x000b1;3&#x000a0;years), sex, BMI (&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), hypertension status, glycemic status (normal, prediabetes, or diabetes), and hypertriglyceridemia status (for further details, see the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM] 1, Figure S1).</p><p>Hypertension was defined as diastolic blood pressure&#x000a0;&#x02265;90&#x000a0;mmHg (&#x02265;85&#x000a0;mmHg with T2DM), systolic blood pressure&#x000a0;&#x02265;140&#x000a0;mmHg (&#x02265;130&#x000a0;mmHg with T2DM), use of any anti-hypertensive medication, or a diagnosis code indicating hypertension.

Outpatient visits were defined as encounters that included a physical observation, diagnosis code, or a procedure other than specimen collection or lab testing on a day that did not include inpatient or emergency department care. We counted all outpatient care received by a patient on 1&#x000a0;day as a single outpatient visit.</p><p>Written prescriptions were categorized by generic name without regard to dose. That is, all doses of a specific medication were considered to be the same medication. Combination pharmaceuticals were classified according to major or first-listed ingredient, with the exception of acetaminophen/codeine and acetaminophen/oxycodone. When the number of refills was not specified, we used the mean number of refills for the specific medication calculated from the overall dataset. For medications without mean refill data, we used the mean number of refills of that medication&#x02019;s class or, in rare instances, the mean number of refills of all medications in the dataset.</p><p>To assess US private insurer costs, data from OptumInsight (Minneapolis, MN, USA) were obtained on calendar year 2011 private insurance plan costs for inpatient stays by diagnosis-related group (DRG), outpatient visits by type, and emergency department visits, along with 139 of the most common prescription drugs (representing 75&#x000a0;% of all prescriptions in the study period) and the 34 most common laboratory tests (representing 73&#x000a0;% of all tests). Cost is presented from a private insurance plan perspective. Throughout, the terms &#x02018;cost&#x02019; and &#x02018;costs&#x02019; refer to insurance-allowed reimbursements, defined as the amount payable after discounts but prior to application of any deductible, copay, co-insurance, or coordination of benefits.</p><p>Cost for each hospital inpatient stay was estimated using length of stay, DRG-specific cost per day, and the mean physician cost per inpatient day (details in ESM 1). For encounters or services that were identified in the data but could not be classified (e.g., an inpatient stay with no diagnosis code or a prescription with no medication name), we applied the weighted mean cost of that type of service from the overall dataset. Though the costs of laboratory tests were included in outpatient encounter costs, outpatient laboratory utilization was assessed separately from other outpatient encounters to avoid skewing utilization totals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Follow-Up</title><p>Healthcare utilization and costs were evaluated in patients matched to the CONQUER pre-trial and post-trial subjects for up to 4&#x000a0;years after a patient&#x02019;s index date, with no requirement with respect to weight maintenance, loss, or gain or any other metabolic changes. At the time of this analysis, long-term patient adherence, treatment efficacy, and safety of phentermine-topiramate are not known. Accordingly, our methodology did not exclude patients who gained weight during the 4&#x000a0;years of follow-up, nor did we attempt to adjust the outcomes to account for the possibility of weight rebound or further weight loss.</p><p>The non-discounted cost of phentermine-topiramate ER treatment, currently $US2868 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], was not incorporated into the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p><italic>P</italic> values and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences in means were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping to avoid distributional assumptions.

The bulk of estimated savings (94&#x000a0;%) originated from lower prescription medication costs as well as emergency department and outpatient visit costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Previous Research</title><p>Several cost-effectiveness analyses have been published for the anti-obesity drugs orlistat, sibutramine, and rimonabant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These analyses have generally modeled costs over the long term based on assumptions regarding weight loss maintenance and a linear relationship between BMI status and costs. When the weight loss drug cost was included, none of these modeling studies found drug treatment to be cost saving compared with standard care. Nevertheless, most found the drugs to be within the boundaries of what is generally regarded as cost effective. The majority of the studies used a treatment-responder approach, where patients not losing&#x000a0;&#x0003e;5&#x000a0;% of initial weight after 3&#x000a0;months were taken off drug. A recent study modeled the cost effectiveness of Qsymia versus diet and lifestyle using 1-year self-reported healthcare utilization and quality-of-life data and assumptions regarding maintenance of effects over an additional 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study found Qsymia to be associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US48,000 per QALY, but that the result was sensitive to assumptions regarding extrapolation of effects beyond the first year. The study did not investigate cost effectiveness according to the treatment-responder approach recommended for clinical use of the drug.</p><p>Our cost analysis entailed a design that identified actual patients in a US database matched to pre- and post-trial patient characteristics. Excluding intervention costs, we analyzed costs for all patients as well as for the subset of treatment responders defined as&#x000a0;&#x02265;5&#x000a0;% weight loss at 12&#x000a0;months. Our design does not allow direct comparisons with the modeled costs in previous cost-effectiveness analyses. However, given that the 12-month placebo-adjusted weight loss for phentermine-topiramate ER was approximately 9&#x000a0;kg (compared with&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;kg for sibutramine and rimonabant and&#x000a0;&#x0003c;3&#x000a0;kg for orlistat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], one would expect greater health improvements and cost effects with phentermine-topiramate ER.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Mechanisms</title><p>Voluntary weight loss and accompanying improvements in metabolic risk factors may result in lower drug use and reduced healthcare needs through several mechanisms, including better glycemic control and prevention of cardiovascular events. Bariatric surgery, which results in substantial and sustained weight loss, has been shown both to prevent T2DM in non-diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and to induce remission of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Also, lower incidences of stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, over up to 20&#x000a0;years of follow-up, healthcare use was similar or higher in the surgery group than in the control group in the Swedish Obese Subjects study, while prescription costs were lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Drug-induced weight loss is of lower magnitude than surgery-induced weight loss and has not been shown to be as sustainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Still, randomized placebo-controlled trials of both orlistat and phentermine-topiramate ER have shown lower incidence of T2DM over 4 and 2&#x000a0;years, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This is likely to translate into lower costs for medication and clinical follow-up of diabetes. In our analysis over 4&#x000a0;years, we found lower costs for anti-diabetes drugs in the post- vs. pre-trial ITT group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04).</p><p>Regarding cardiovascular events, no data exist for orlistat or phentermine-topiramate ER, although both drugs have beneficial short-term effects on intermediate measures such as lipids and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the only completed randomized trial to date of a weight-loss drug with cardiovascular events as primary outcome, a small but statistically significantly higher risk was observed in sibutramine-treated patients than in those receiving placebo, leading to withdrawal of market authorization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Rimonabant was also tested for prevention of cardiovascular events in a study enrolling more than 18,000 patients, but the trial was terminated prematurely due to neuropsychiatric effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to both orlistat and phentermine-topiramate ER, sibutramine has been shown to be associated with increases in blood pressure compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, like sibutramine, phentermine-topiramate ER has been reported to raise heart rate, although the clinical importance of this finding is currently unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Concerns about potential adverse events, including cardiovascular events, resulted in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rejecting the market application for phentermine-topiramate ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Long-term cardiovascular outcomes of phentermine-topiramate ER are being investigated in the AQCLAIM (A Qsymia Cardiovascular morbidity and Mortality) study, in accordance with post-marketing requirements of the FDA (ClinicalTrials.gov; EudraCT Number 2012-003946-34).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths</title><p>Our cost analysis used a different approach to estimate costs over 4&#x000a0;years than prior cost-effectiveness analyses of weight-loss drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Instead of assuming a linear relationship between BMI, body weight, or weight loss on the one hand and costs on the other, we matched real-world patients to six metabolic and demographic parameters of CONQUER trial patients before and after phentermine-topiramate ER treatment and observed actual medical service utilization and costs over 4&#x000a0;years. These cost estimates, based on observed resource use between 2007 and 2011 and average per-service costs for insured US patients in 2011, are likely more generalizable to the US setting than estimates from hypothetical cohorts of patients and modeled costs generated by other cost-effectiveness models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is an examination of resource use and related costs in patients with characteristics mirroring the characteristics of patients before and after 12&#x000a0;months of phentermine-topiramate ER treatment. Since 4-year follow-up data on patients taking phentermine-topiramate ER are unavailable, we were unable to assess the extent to which changes in weight and metabolic markers in the patients whose natural history we followed could differ from results in actual phentermine-topiramate ER patients over a similar period. Therefore, the results need to be validated, preferably in both observational and randomized intervention studies.</p><p>As we did not observe actual phentermine-topiramate ER-treated patients, we also did not include costs for potential short- or long-term adverse events. Both sibutramine (USA and Europe) and rimonabant (Europe) were withdrawn from the market because of their adverse event profile after initially being approved. The safety of phentermine-topiramate ER beyond 2&#x000a0;years is currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We also did not include phentermine-topiramate ER drug costs, which would require us to make assumptions regarding duration of treatment, compliance, and weight development over the 4&#x000a0;years of follow-up.</p><p>The patient groups we created did not fully reflect patients in the CONQUER trial. Specifically, we only had access to patients aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;40&#x000a0;years, representing 85&#x000a0;% of CONQUER ITT subjects in the modeled study arm; we did not match on race or smoking history because a large number of database records lacked these; we did not have information on mortality or direct information on when patients may have transferred their care to another provider system; and we did not have a full 4&#x000a0;years of follow-up data for all patients. However, these limitations applied to both the pre- and the post-trial patient groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this database study, which explored the potential 4-year cost effects of metabolic improvements observed over 12&#x000a0;months of phentermine-topiramate ER treatment, we detected some health resource utilization differences, but no statistically significant overall cost differences between patients representing post- versus pre-trial metabolic profiles in the ITT analysis. When restricting our analysis to patients losing&#x000a0;&#x02265;5&#x000a0;% of initial body weight, the threshold used in some countries for continuing weight-loss drug treatment and the threshold used by the manufacturer in its instructions to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], cost savings of about $US3400 were observed over 4&#x000a0;years, reflecting reduced utilization of all measured categories of medical services except inpatient admissions. Future analyses should factor in costs related to treatment of adverse events and compliance-based costs of the treatment itself. We recommend validation of these findings in observational and randomized intervention studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
