They have revealed the multi-mechanisms of its efficiency of HF as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Nowadays, lots of intravenous and oral preparations have been applied in treating HF, and confirmed that they're effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the formations of projects involving randomized clinical trials in TCM are recent and their designs are not as rigorous as the clinical trials in western medicine.

In 1995, the report of Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) of American mentioned that "the efficiency evaluation is the core problem" in traditional medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Through literature review, experts consultation and epidemiological survey, the investigators have made some essential conclusions which involved information obtained by TCM diagnostic method, syndrome types of HF and the optimized TCM medication program (TCM staging differentiation treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The information gives supports for the protocol making and evaluation index system building.</p><p>In the implementation process of the Study on the Evaluation for the Clinical Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Heart Failure (SECETCM-HF), the regular medication program follows the modern guideline of HF. The systematic and comprehensive evaluation information from clinical observing and follow-up are collected to abstract the clinical evaluation indexes. Not only death event, re-hospitalization and the general modern lab indexes, but also the TCM information will be included in the evaluation indexes system. In order to make the clinical effect predominance of TCM expressed properly, all information will be analyzed by both medical statistical and complex mathematical methods which make the establishment of integrated TCM and western medicine evaluation index system possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SECETCM-HF: Study on the Evaluation of the Clinical Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Heart Failure; TCM: Traditional Chinese Medicine; HF: Heart failure; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; NYHA: New York Heart Association; BNP: Brain Natriuretic Peptide; ACEI: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB: Angiotensin receptor blocker; ECG: Electrocardiogram; 6MWT: Six-minute walking test; OAM: Office of Alternative Medicine</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Each author has participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.
