To be successful, a microbicide not only needs to be biologically functional but also highly acceptable to users. User acceptability of microbicides can be incorporated early in the product formulation and design process. Previous qualitative research revealed women had strong preferences regarding product shape, while preferences related to size and firmness were less clear. Here, we explored the effect of size and firmness on the acceptability of semisolid ovoid microbicide prototypes intended for vaginal use. Sexually active women (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;74) were randomized to one of two conditions: with and without applicator. Nine different prototypes were evaluated; they were formulated to low, medium and high firmness using mixtures of kappa and iota carrageenan and potassium chloride. Three sizes were produced at each firmness level. Women manipulated all nine prototypes, rating them for perceived effectiveness, imagined ease-of-insertion and willingness-to-try on visual analog scales. The influence of size and firmness on these three outcome measures were assessed using ANOVA and response surface models. Results indicated size and firmness both influenced the outcome measures, but firmess was more influential than size. Also, the specific effects of size and firmness depended strongly on presence or absence of an applicator. Generally, women in the without applicator condition wanted a larger, firmer product. Collectively, these data suggest efforts to rationally design of microbicides for enhanced user acceptability must consider factors like size and firmness. Also, the decision to include or forego an applicator should be addressed early in the design process, as it strongly influences other design decisions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Institutes of Health grant number R21AI094514 from the National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases to JEH and GRZ.

Although new incidences of HIV infection have stabilized and AIDS-related mortality has begun to decline worldwide as of 2010, HIV will remain a major problem for years to come: about 34 million people were living with HIV worldwide in 2010, among which 3.4 million were less than 15 years old. Women accounted for 50% of the infected population. Estimates suggest 2.7 million people were newly infected in 2010, and approximately 1.8 million people around the world died of AIDS-related health problems in 2010 <xref rid="pone.0054975-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Thus, development of effective prevention tools remains a high priority for public health.</p><p>Transmission via sexual activity is a primary route for new HIV infections <xref rid="pone.0054975-Piot1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This pattern is not restricted to traditional high-risk groups, like men who have sex with men; rather, transmission via sex has also resulted in high prevalence among heterosexual women. In urban areas of Guinea, the incidence of HIV infection among women is six times greater than men; in Benin&#x02019;s largest city, Cotonou, HIV infection rates are 5 times higher in women than in men <xref rid="pone.0054975-Lowndes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. HIV infections among American women have also been increasing <xref rid="pone.0054975-CDC1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Providing women an effective means to prevent sexually acquired HIV infections is a priority in the global fight against AIDS.</p><p>Currently, effective HIV prevention methods designed for and controlled by women are quite limited <xref rid="pone.0054975-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Condoms are an effective means for preventing HIV and STIs if they are applied correctly and consistently during sex <xref rid="pone.0054975-CDC2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0054975-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, condom use is suboptimal in a variety of contexts due to cultural and social restrictions. In some African and Asian countries, women may lack the ability or power to negotiate condom use with their partners <xref rid="pone.0054975-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-Beksinska1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In China, 60% of commercial sex workers were unable to negotiate condom use during sex <xref rid="pone.0054975-UNAIDS2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This inability to negotiate condom use increases a woman&#x02019;s risk for HIV infection via unprotected sex. Therefore, alternatives to condoms, especially those that can be controlled and initiated by women, have a strong potential public health benefit. Topical microbicides have been proposed and pursued as a means to address these challenges <xref rid="pone.0054975-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A microbicide is an agent containing functional components that can block HIV transmission when it is applied to the vagina or rectum prior to sex <xref rid="pone.0054975-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-Severy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Although a commercially viable microbicide has not yet been developed, microbicides remain an active area of research: more than 40 formulations are being currently investigated as candidates for vaginal microbicides and 12 have been tested clinically <xref rid="pone.0054975-vandeWijgert1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-AMD1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Microbicide candidates can be formulated as tablets, capsules, creams, suppositories, pessaries, foams, ointments, gels, films, tampons, vaginal rings, and douches <xref rid="pone.0054975-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. From a rheological perspective, these candidates can be classified into two forms: solid and liquid. Current &#x02018;gel&#x02019; formulations are not gels in the technical sense; but highly viscous non-Newtonian liquids with little elastic character <xref rid="pone.0054975-Tasoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Likewise, so-called &#x02018;softgel&#x02019; capsules are only really soft when compared to hard gelatin capsules. Solid forms typically have the drawback of slow release, requiring a waiting period between insertion and coitus, which may be undesirable for the user. Imaging indicates that a traditional gelatin softgel requires an hour to fully dissolve and deploy API <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0054975-Menon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, women react negatively to products that have a &#x02018;plastic&#x02019; appearance <xref rid="pone.0054975-Hardy1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast, liquid forms may be immediately efficacious, but often have a limited period of activity and must be reapplied prior to each act of intercourse (which may not be feasible for some users). In addition, users often complain of leakage of creams and &#x02018;gels&#x02019;. This leaves a broad design space of viscoelastic materials that has not been adequately investigated.</p><p>Previous work indicates carrageenan-based microbicides are safe for vaginal use, as shown by the Carraguard trial in 165 women <xref rid="pone.0054975-Kilmarx1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We are exploring carrageenan as a potential delivery system for other active pharmaceutical ingredient (APIs), and not as a standalone microbicide by itself. Unlike other potential materials for delivery systems (e.g., lipid based suppositories), carrageenan remains a gel in tropical conditions due to the elevated melting temperature. Carrageenan is a sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed that has been widely employed as a thickener and emulsifier. &#x003ba;-carrageenan forms firm gels, while &#x003bb;-carrageenan is used to help with binding and retaining moisture and viscosity. &#x003b9;-carrageenan forms a heat-reversible gel, if calcium ions are present. Desirable properties can be designed by formulating carrageenan gels of varying composition and polymer content, and by adding appropriate ions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Notably, this feature facilitates rational design: once ideal sensory properties have been identified by users, formulations can be adjusted to simultaneously optimize user acceptability and biophysical characteristics such a osmolality and drug release <xref rid="pone.0054975-Morrow1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Drug release studies on our delivery system are underway and will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>The eventual success of microbicides will be determined by their ability to prevent new HIV infections. To achieve this goal, candidate microbicides need to be not only biologically functional and safe, but also highly acceptable to end-users <xref rid="pone.0054975-Severy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. That is, a microbicide requires more than clinical efficacy to significantly impact the global HIV epidemic, as user compliance is critical for success in the field <xref rid="pone.0054975-Elias1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-Padian1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. User acceptability is a primary consideration for product adherence and effectiveness <xref rid="pone.0054975-Elias1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-Nel1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Currently, user perception of microbicides or microbicide surrogates have been investigated using two different approaches: with product, where physical prototypes or surrogates are presented and evaluated ex vivo <xref rid="pone.0054975-Mahan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or intravaginally <xref rid="pone.0054975-Hira1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and without product, where hypothetical and conceptual product functionalities and features are described <xref rid="pone.0054975-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054975-Hammett1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Assessment of user acceptability can also identify key product attributes that drive consumer acceptability, and thus direct future product development efforts <xref rid="pone.0054975-Elias1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we formulated and tested carrageenan-based microbicide prototypes for user acceptability. Initial findings from our focus group research <xref rid="pone.0054975-Zaveri1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> showed 79% of participants (44 of 56) preferred oval-shaped prototypes over other shapes. The present study aimed to explore effects of firmness and size on user acceptability of microbicide prototypes quantitatively. In this study, the primary response variable used to assess user acceptability of the prototypes was willingness-to-try (<italic>willingness</italic>). Secondary measures of user acceptability include perceived effectiveness (<italic>effectiveness</italic>), and imagined ease of insertion (<italic>insertion</italic>).

This database consists of a large number (800+) of age diverse men and women who have previously expressed an interest in routine testing of consumer products in our facility. Due to the sensitive nature of the project, a two stage opt-in procedure was used. First, women in the database were sent an email message briefly describing the test, and asked if they would be interested in participating. If they said yes, they were sent a second email with a link to a web-based screening questionnaire. Based on answers to the screening questionnaire, eligible individuals were invited to participate. Inclusion criteria included: a) female; b) between 18 and 55 years of age; c) reported having had vaginal sex with a man in the last 12 months; d) were willing to manipulate prototypes with their hands and evaluate them using a computer-guided assessment in an isolated test booth; e) hadn&#x02019;t participated in focus groups or other studies on vaginal drug delivery system at Penn State in the past year.</p><p>Of the 74 participants, the majority (98%) self identified as white/Caucasian. Participant ages were broadly distributed: 22 were 18 to 29 years old, 9 were 30 to 39, and 43 were 40 to 55 years old. Most participants (67%) had completed at least a bachelor&#x02019;s degree; 16% of participants had achieved master, doctoral, or professional degrees, and 16% indicated High School or a GED was the highest level of education attained. Regarding martial status, 3 (&#x0223c;4%) women were divorced or separated; 19 (&#x0223c;25%) women were never married; and 52 (&#x0223c;70%) women were currently married. Number of vaginal deliveries varied across the sample: &#x0223c;48% (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;36) had not had any vaginal deliveries. For women who had delivered children vaginally, 13.5% reported one vaginal delivery, 32.4% reported two, and 5.4% reported three or more.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample Design and Preparation</title><p>As mentioned previously, women showed a strong preference for ovoid prototypes, but were less clear regarding preferred Size and Firmness. The goal of the present study was to obtain quantitative data on nine carrageenan-based ovules that differed in Size and Firmness. A single oval shape was prepared using a full factorial design in which Size (1 g, 3 g and 5 g) and Firmness (storage modulus G&#x02019; (Pa): 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;250, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12500, and 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;125000 at 25&#x000b0;C, frequency at 1 rad/s, stain 1%) were varied.

Ingredients were mixed dry, added to deionized water, and heated in an 80&#x000b0;C oven. These slurries were held hot for 2&#x02013;3 hours until the carrageenans were completed dissolved. During molding, the slurry was kept hot to avoid the gel setting prematurely. Hot slurries were injected into different sized molds (1 g, 3 g and 5 g) using plastic syringes. Filled molds were then moved to a refrigerator to set, which took about 15 minutes. Once the gel was set, samples were removed from the mold and put into 0.75-oz Solo transparent plastic cups (Solo Cup Company, Urbana, IL). Samples were kept at 16&#x000b0;C with the lids sealed tightly until the user test.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0054975-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0054975.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Formulations of gel solution.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0054975-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0054975.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Formulation/Firmness</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kappa (% w/v)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iota (% w/v )</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KCl (M)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Storage modulus G&#x02032; (Pa)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.06</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">125000</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Product Overview and Orientation</title><p>Prior to evaluating 9 ovules in isolated test booths, participants watched a short video about the product concept in the waiting room of the Sensory Evaluation Center (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0054975.s001">Video S1</xref>).

Again, the optimal product for the with-applicator group was near the edge of our design space, suggesting these results should be interpreted cautiously. Additional work with a broader design space would be needed to further optimize applicator based delivery systems.</p><p>Regarding <italic>effectiveness</italic>, Firmness influenced <italic>effectiveness</italic> in the without-applicator group, but not the with-applicator group. Presumably, this is because ability to insert a product is necessary (but not sufficient) for it to be effective. That is, <italic>effectiveness</italic> and <italic>insertion</italic> are decoupled in the with-applicator condition (r &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.37) whereas in the without-applicator condition, the relationship between <italic>effectiveness</italic> and <italic>insertion</italic> is much higher (r &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.65). This is consistent with the premise that you have to be able to insert a microbicide before it can work. Size was not a significant predictor in response surface models of <italic>effectiveness</italic> in either applicator condition. However, the ANOVA results paint a slightly different picture. Size predicted <italic>effectiveness</italic>, but in a non-linear fashion: the smallest Size (1 g) had lower effectiveness scores than the 3 g and 5 g prototypes.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the range of <italic>willingness</italic>, <italic>insertion</italic> and <italic>effectiveness</italic> scores are much larger in the without-applicator group than in the with-applicator group. This can be seen in the range of values in the contour plots. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0054975-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the largest contour is 25% higher than the lowest contour for the with-applicator group, whereas for the without-applicator group, the largest contour is 119% higher than the lowest contour. This difference in range across the two conditions is wholly consistent with a large influence for the presence or absence of an applicator on user acceptability.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Partial Redundancy of <italic>Willingness</italic>, <italic>Insertion</italic>, and <italic>Effectiveness</italic> Ratings</title><p>
<italic>Effectiveness</italic>, <italic>insertion</italic> and <italic>willingness</italic> scores were correlated within an applicator condition, suggesting some degree of redundancy among three outcome variables. However, as noted above, the correlations differed across two applicator conditions: generally, the correlations in the without-applicator group were stronger than those in the with-applicator group. This implies presence of an applicator moderates the perceived relationships between the outcome measures. These data support that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and microbicides need to be optimized separately depending on whether or not an applicator will be provided.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations and Conclusions</title><p>The current proof of concept study demonstrates that Firmness and Size of microbicide gels influence <italic>effectiveness, insertion</italic> and <italic>willingness</italic>, and the relative influence of each is contingent on whether or not the product is intended to be used with an applicator. However, the present cohort was predominantly middle aged, sexually active, white women in Pennsylvania. This convenience sample was recruited from a rural university campus, and most were married, so these individuals are presumably at low risk for HIV and other STIs. Therefore, the optimum values shown here may not generalize to other groups or populations (e.g., commercial sex workers, adolescents, cultures with different vaginal practices). Also, we did not assess how prior experiences with other vaginal products may have influenced present findings. Firmness and opacity were confounded in the present study, as different levels of carrageenan were required to achieve different levels of Firmness; how color and opacity may influence our outcome measures are unknown. Nonetheless, present data indicate that sexually active women care about product factors such as size and firmness. Future work should include women from more diverse populations, especially populations at high risk for STIs including HIV.</p><p>User acceptability of microbicides is a complex subject that is multifactorial and multidimensional. Current variables (shape, firmness and size) were suggested by our qualitative research, and systematically manipulated by our team through product formulation and design. However, design of an optimal microbicide gel need not be limited to these attributes. Additionally, this was a preclinical study and current evaluation was conducted among women who manipulated prototypes <italic>in mano</italic> (in the hand, rather than using them vaginally). Whether or not this generalizes to acceptability in the vagina is unknown. Nonetheless, any vaginal product must be &#x02018;good to think, before it is good to use&#x02019;. That is, a product with low willingness to try <italic>ex vivo</italic> is highly unlikely to be successful <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, to truly understand use acceptability, other external factors should be included in future research, such as culture and ethnicity, race, partnership types and partner opinion, as partners also play an important role in microbicide acceptability <xref rid="pone.0054975-Whitehead1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Moreover, assessment of user acceptability can not only guide product design but also help to establish strategies for effective product launches once microbicides are ready for market.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0054975.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>
