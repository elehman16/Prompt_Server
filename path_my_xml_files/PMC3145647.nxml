Two previous phase I clinical trials, one in na&#x000ef;ve European adults and one in malaria-exposed Gabonese adults showed that GMZ2 was well tolerated and immunogenic. Here, we present data on safety and immunogenicity of GMZ2 in one to five year old Gabonese children, a target population for future malaria vaccine efficacy trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Thirty children one to five years of age were randomized to receive three doses of either 30 &#x000b5;g or 100 &#x000b5;g of GMZ2, or rabies vaccine. GMZ2, adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide, was administered on Days 0, 28 and 56. All participants received a full course of their respective vaccination and were followed up for one year. Both 30 &#x000b5;g and 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 vaccine doses were well tolerated and induced antibodies and memory B-cells against GMZ2 as well as its antigenic constituents MSP3 and GLURP. After three doses of vaccine, the geometric mean concentration of antibodies to GMZ2 was 19-fold (95&#x00025;CI: 11,34) higher in the 30 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 group than in the rabies vaccine controls, and 16-fold (7,36) higher in the 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 group than the rabies group. Geometric mean concentration of antibodies to MSP3 was 2.7-fold (1.6,4.6) higher in the 30 &#x000b5;g group than in the rabies group and 3.8-fold (1.5,9.6) higher in the 100 &#x000b5;g group. Memory B-cells against GMZ2 developed in both GMZ2 vaccinated groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Both 30 &#x000b5;g as well as 100 &#x000b5;g intramuscular GMZ2 are immunogenic, well tolerated, and safe in young, malaria-exposed Gabonese children.

Recently, a decline in the incidence of malaria associated with scaling up of interventions has been reported in many countries <xref rid="pone.0022525-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, raising hopes that malaria could be eliminated in these countries <xref rid="pone.0022525-Feachem1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, before these goals can be achieved, significant political, economic as well as scientific hurdles need to be addressed. Malaria vaccines may have an important role in malaria control and elimination, in part because they can be readily integrated into existing health care structures. Two main lines of research on malaria vaccines have resulted in advanced clinical development programmes, the induction of immunity against pre-erythrocytic stages, and mimicry of naturally acquired immunity to clinical malaria through vaccination with blood stage antigens. GMZ2 is one representative of the second group which is currently under clinical development and RTS,S/AS01 is the most advanced of the first group <xref rid="pone.0022525-Ballou1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Naturally acquired immunity is not sterile but protects from severe symptoms and complications, and despite marked genetic and antigenic variability of the parasite, is remarkably robust. Several passive transfer experiments showed that antibodies are central to the development of natural immunity <xref rid="pone.0022525-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Sabchareon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Sotiriades1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Robustness of naturally-acquired immunity was most convincingly demonstrated when antibody preparations from one continent (Africa) were used to inhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of parasites in malaria patients from another continent (Asia) <xref rid="pone.0022525-Sabchareon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Unfortunately, the mechanism of protection and the targets of immunity are not known although several immunological surrogate markers of protection have been proposed. Analysis of sera from immune adults from endemic regions, including those from passive transfer experiments, led to the identification of merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) as a potentially important antigen for the induction of anti-malarial immunity <xref rid="pone.0022525-Oeuvray1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Another antigen that elicits antibodies in frequently exposed individuals is glutamate rich protein (GLURP). High anti-GLURP titers have been associated with protection from malaria in several studies <xref rid="pone.0022525-Meraldi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Soe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and it was shown that anti-GLURP antibodies induce antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) in a way similar to MSP3 <xref rid="pone.0022525-Theisen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A fusion protein of conserved parts of both proteins showed good immunogenicity. Since the presumed mechanism of protection of MSP3 and GLURP is similar, and partial protection in pre-clinical trials was documented <xref rid="pone.0022525-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, it was decided to develop a MSP3-GLURP fusion protein for studies in humans naturally exposed to malaria.</p><p>GMZ2 is the preparation of a recombinant GLURP<sub>27&#x02013;500</sub>-MSP3<sub>212&#x02013;380</sub> fusion protein, expressed in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, and mixed with the adjuvant aluminium hydroxide. The vaccine is given intramuscularly as three injections one month apart. The first trial in humans, in German malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults, showed good safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of three different dosing schemes of GMZ2 <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial in malaria-exposed Gabonese adults was done, where the higher dose of GMZ2 (100 &#x000b5;g) was compared to a control vaccine (rabies vaccine). In this study, the vaccine was well tolerated and boosted pre-existing immune responses against the vaccine antigen <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The vaccine induced strong responses to GMZ2 and to GLURP, but responses to MSP3 were low. The present trial was designed to provide first data on safety and immunogenicity of 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2, and a lower dose 30 &#x000b5;g GMZ2, in malaria-exposed children 1&#x02013;5 years of age, the group in which phase IIb efficacy trials would be done.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022525.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022525.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and interventions</title><p>The study took place from September 2008 to October 2009 at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;, Gabon, an area with year-round malaria transmission <xref rid="pone.0022525-Wildling1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Healthy children from Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9; between 1 and 5 years of age were screened and those who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1 1 1 to receive three doses of either rabies vaccine, 30 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 (GMZ2-30) or 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 (GMZ2-100). Vaccine doses were given one month apart (days 0, 28 and 56) intramuscularly, alternately in the left or right deltoid muscle. GMZ2 was produced as one clinical batch following Good Manufacturing Practice (Henogen SA, Belgium) and provided in aliquots of 12 &#x000b5;. Aluminium hydroxide (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) was provided in separate vials and mixed with the vaccine one hour before administration following a standard operating procedure in a separate preparation room equipped with a sterile flow hood. Rabies vaccine (Verorab, Sanofi Pasteur) was used as control vaccine. Each child was kept under observation for 30 minutes after vaccination. A physician examined participants on the day of vaccination and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after each vaccination. Participants were re-examined by a physician on Day 84 (one month after the last dose of vaccine) and on Day 365 (10 months after the last vaccine dose). Children were visited at home by a field worker 2, 4, 5 and 6 days after each vaccination and on days 140, 224 and 308 after the first vaccination to assess health and record the occurrence of adverse events. A 24-hour phone line was maintained for parents to contact the study team in the event of any adverse event.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of participating children. If the child's parent or guardian was unable to read, an impartial witness was present during the informed consent and signed together with the child's parent the informed consent form. The study was approved by the Comit&#x000e9; d'Ethique R&#x000e9;gional Ind&#x000e9;pendant de Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9; (CERIL) and the Gabonese Ministry of Health. A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) monitored subject safety during the trial. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki (5<sup>th</sup> revision) and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objectives and outcomes</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of three injections of either 30 or 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 compared to rabies vaccine in the target group for a clinical phase IIb efficacy trial. As secondary objective, humoral immune responses were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>A screening list of 39 eligible individuals was sorted on sex and age; 30 were required for enrolment, so 9 individuals (every 4<sup>th</sup> individual in the sorted list) were excluded to be used as reserves in case any selected individuals dropped out before the administration of the first vaccine dose. The 30 individuals in the sorted list were then allocated to vaccine group using randomly permuted blocks of 3 individuals per block. If a subject was withdrawn before vaccine dose 1, they were to be replaced with the reserve nearest in age. If a subject was withdrawn after vaccine dose 1, they were not replaced. The randomization list was sent by electronic mail by a study statistician (PM) to the study pharmacist who prepared sealed envelopes. A separate sealed envelope of the randomization codes was kept by the local safety monitor. The study pharmacists prepared the vaccines in identical opaque syringes; they had no other role in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p>Immunological assays were done as previously described <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> with minor modifications. For antibody measurement, enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISA) were done. Antigen-specific antibody concentration was assessed by solving a four-parameter logistic regression equation fitted to a serial dilution of a serum pool of highly positive adults according to published procedures <xref rid="pone.0022525-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore antibody data is expressed as fraction of antibody concentration compared to a positive serum pool prepared from high responders of a previous clinical trial on GMZ2 <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Memory B-cell enzyme linked immunospot assays (ELISPOT) were done on freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells using previously published procedures <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Anti-GMZ2, anti-MSP3, and anti-GLURP antibodies were measured by ELISA, whereas memory B-cell response was assessed by ELISPOT against the whole vaccine antigen (GMZ2) and anti-IgG as a positive control.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical methods and sample size</title><p>The aim of the trial was to establish safety of the vaccine doses with respect to very common adverse reactions. In the previous two clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> analysis of ten individuals per group sufficed to detect increases in anti-GMZ2 immune responses. Data was captured on paper case report forms and transferred to an electronic database. All analyses were done using Stata v10 and R v2.12.0. Data analysis followed a statistical analysis plan that was finalized before unblinding.</p><p>For analysis of antibody concentrations, zero values were considered as left-censored observations, and replaced with a constant value equal to the smallest non-zero concentration for that antigen in the dataset. For each antigen, the ratio of the geometric mean concentration at each time point to the mean concentration pre-vaccination, was calculated with a 95&#x00025; confidence interval. Analysis of covariance was used to compare humoral responses between the vaccine groups at each time point, with adjustment for the pre-dose-one value as a covariate, after transforming to logarithms, and the adjusted difference in means between vaccine groups was presented as a ratio in the original measurement scale, with a 95&#x00025; confidence interval.</p><p>As sensitivity analysis the log-transformed area under the curve (AUC) of antigen-specific IgG concentration against time was calculated for each subject from day 0 to day 84 and compared between vaccine groups. This provides a single test for each antigen to determine whether the vaccine induced an antibody response. ELISPOT data are given as number of GMZ2-specific cells per total number of antibody secreting cells (ASC). Non-parametric methods were used to calculate difference in AUC between groups in a hierarchical approach: Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of the three intervention groups and an exact version the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for pairwise comparisons if the first test rejected the null hypothesis. An estimate of the shift in location and its 95&#x00025; confidence interval was calculated using the method of Bauer <xref rid="pone.0022525-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Solicited local adverse events (pain, swelling, induration, erythema, or pruritis at the injection site, or contralateral reaction) and general adverse events (fever, irritability, drowsiness, loss of appetite, or diarrhoea) were graded as mild, moderate or severe following the guidelines of the Brighton Collaboration <xref rid="pone.0022525-Gidudua1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The number of local and general adverse events, and the number of non-solicited adverse events, within 14 days after each dose was tabulated for each vaccine group. Analyses were by intention to treat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participants flow and recruitment</title><p>Thirty-nine out of 55 children were eligible to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022525-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Several vaccine candidates have been evaluated in malaria-exposed individuals but only very few have proceeded to efficacy trials in endemic countries. Asexual blood stage vaccines that have been tested for efficacy in naturally exposed individuals (clinical phase IIb) recently, include AMA-1 <xref rid="pone.0022525-Sagara1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and MSP1<sub>42</sub> (FMP1-AS02A) <xref rid="pone.0022525-Ogutu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Unfortunately, these malaria vaccine candidates did not protect children in phase II efficacy trials. Two major difficulties in the selection of potential vaccine antigens are the lack of a surrogate marker for protection and the high degree of variability of antigens that are exposed to the immune system. GMZ2 is one of the latest vaccine candidates to enter clinical trials. Association studies suggest a prominent role of both antigens contained in GMZ2 in protection from malaria and showed partial efficacy in an animal model <xref rid="pone.0022525-Carvalho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, both antigen fragments used in the vaccine are conserved in clinical isolates <xref rid="pone.0022525-deStricker1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which may constitute an advantage over other candidates. Therefore a clinical development program for GMZ2 was developed that resulted in the present phase Ib trial to assess safety and immunogenicity in the target population for a subsequent clinical phase IIb efficacy trial.</p><p>GMZ2 has been developed under the premise that vaccination schedule should be compatible with the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), although it is being increasingly recognized that the EPI scheme may be unlikely to induce maximal immunogenicity. Nonetheless, GMZ2 was well tolerated and induced a robust immune response in its target population. No vaccine-related SAEs or grade 3 AEs were observed and all GMZ2 vaccinated participants developed either anti-GMZ2 antibodies or memory B-cells.</p><p>Both the 30 &#x000b5;g and 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 induced strong antibody responses to GLURP, as has been seen with GMZ2 in previous trials <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Both groups showed responses to MSP3, in contrast to the study in Gabonese adults, where there was no evidence of responses to MSP3. The rise in anti-MSP3 IgG concentration after three doses was somewhat greater in the 100 &#x000b5;g group than in the 30 &#x000b5;g group but the trial was not powered to be able to compare immunogenicity between these two groups, (a much larger trial would have been required to determine whether 30 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 was as immunogenic as 100 &#x000b5;g). Considering data from all phase I trials of GMZ2 <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022525-Mordmller1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the 100 &#x000b5;g dose is safe and well tolerated and was selected for further clinical development, although this does not rule out the use of other doses in the final product. In contrast to malaria-na&#x000ef;ve German adults <xref rid="pone.0022525-Esen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, antigen-specific IgG concentrations seemed to decrease by Day 365, but the confidence intervals were wide and the trial was too small to evaluate persistence of IgG response. If anti-parasitic immunity can be induced, it will be important to investigate kinetics of IgG responses and to consider alternative administration schemes, doses, or vaccine formulations to improve longevity of responses and of protection. Such trials will be extraordinarily helpful for understanding immune response patterns and their role in protection.</p><p>The number of GMZ2 vaccinated subjects is still low (a total of 70 people have been vaccinated with GMZ2, 40 of them with the 100 &#x000b5;dose), therefore it is too early to assess its overall safety with confidence. Nevertheless, the use of aluminum hydroxide, one of the most frequently administered molecules in vaccinations, as the adjuvant was a choice that minimizes safety problems and therefore the good tolerability is not surprising. We believe that this is an important issue and should be investigated with more emphasis in other vaccines that use novel and experimental adjuvant systems. This is particularly relevant for vaccines intended for widespread use in young children.</p><p>In conclusion, GMZ2 is immunogenic and well tolerated. Efficacy studies are now needed and a multi-center phase IIb trial in four countries has been designed to determine whether three doses of 100 &#x000b5;g GMZ2 can protect children from malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022525.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022525.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0022525.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0022525.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all participants, their parents and the teams in Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;, T&#x000fc;bingen, Copenhagen, and Dar es Salaam for their great help and continuous support.
