The purpose of this study was to evaluate single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg and to assess cardiovascular tolerability compared with baseline and placebo in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-eight adults were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, four-treatment crossover study. Subjects remained housed for 6&#x000a0;days to permit time-matched, serial measurements of pulse, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) for baseline and complete treatments on consecutive days. After fasting overnight, subjects were dosed with oral phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, or 30&#x000a0;mg or placebo. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected over 7&#x000a0;h, whereas pulse, blood pressure, and ECGs were measured over 12&#x000a0;h. Urine was collected over each 24-h period to 
quantify phenylephrine and metabolites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After oral administration, phenylephrine was rapidly absorbed with median times to maximum plasma concentrations (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) from 0.33 to 0.5&#x000a0;h. For phenylephrine&#x000a0;HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg, the mean (standard deviation) maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) was 1354 (954), 2959 (2122), and 4492 (1978)&#x000a0;pg/mL, and total systemic exposure [area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>)] was 955.8 (278.5), 2346 (983.8), and 3900 (1764) pg&#x000b7;h/mL, respectively. Both parameters increased disproportionally with increasing dose, as &#x003b2;&#x000a0;&#x0003e;1 in the power model. Negligible amounts of phenylephrine and phenylephrine glucuronide were excreted in urine. With increasing dose, percentages by dose of phenylephrine sulfate decreased, whereas percentages of 3-hydroxymandelic acid increased. Eight subjects reported nine mild adverse events; one (somnolence) was deemed to be treatment related. Means of time-matched differences in pulse and blood pressure from baseline showed similar fluctuations over 12&#x000a0;h among phenylephrine HCl doses and placebo, although small differences in systolic pressure were observed during the initial 2&#x000a0;h. No apparent dose-related effects were observed for Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) values, and individual changes from time-matched baseline (DQTcF).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Maximum and total systemic exposures following singe doses of phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg increased disproportionally with increasing dose.

As a vasoconstrictor, phenylephrine possesses both indirect and direct sympathomimetic effects. The dominant, direct effect is agonism at &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors located on capacitance blood vessels of the nasal mucosa, resulting in vasoconstriction, which limits the amount of fluid to enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, and decreases inflammation of nasal membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the USA and Australia, the adult dosage of phenylephrine HCl is 10&#x000a0;mg every 4&#x000a0;h, whereas in a few South American countries, the adult dosage in combination products may be 20&#x000a0;mg every 8&#x000a0;h. The total daily dose is 60 mg for both regions. In Europe and Russia, the adult dosage of phenylephrine HCl is 12&#x000a0;mg every 6&#x000a0;h, not to exceed 48&#x000a0;mg in 24&#x000a0;h.</p><p>The therapeutic dose of phenylephrine HCl 10&#x000a0;mg has no substantial stimulant effect on the &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors of the heart (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors), nor does it stimulate the &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptors of the bronchi or peripheral blood vessels (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although oral phenylephrine has a minimal direct effect on heart rate or cardiac output, as a vasoconstrictor, phenylephrine can increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure at high doses, and thus cause reflex bradycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A published review of single-dose studies in normotensive subjects with and without nasal congestion found that phenylephrine HCl 50&#x000a0;mg appears to be the minimum oral dose that will affect blood pressure, whereas 120&#x000a0;mg is needed to elicit significant blood pressure elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Keys and Violante [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported that single oral doses of phenylephrine HCl 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg are necessary for consistent clinically meaningful cardiovascular effects, such as increased diastolic pressure and reflex cardiac slowing.</p><p>Although phenylephrine HCl 10&#x000a0;mg has been used worldwide for over 50&#x000a0;years in decongestant medicines, published pharmacokinetic and metabolic data on this therapeutic dose, and other doses, are limited or non-existent. One early study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled phenylephrine in a few volunteers after intravenous and oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It showed that phenylephrine is rapidly absorbed between 45 and 75&#x000a0;min, and rapidly distributes into peripheral tissues, yielding a biphasic, or two-compartment, pharmacokinetic profile. The central volume of distribution (340&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;174&#x000a0;L) estimated from intravenous data considerably exceeds body weight, indicating storage in the peripheral compartment. Additionally, phenylephrine was found to have a short elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub>) of about 2.5&#x000a0;h and a relatively low oral bioavailability of about 38&#x000a0;% due to high first-pass metabolism in the intestinal wall.</p><p>A subsequent pilot study (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12) in which phenylephrine was assayed directly in plasma samples using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry found that maximum concentrations (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) were reached sooner, within an average of 36&#x000a0;min, and <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub> was shorter, about 0.5&#x02013;2.2&#x000a0;h, than previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, inter-subject variability of phenylephrine concentrations was high, as individual <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values ranged from 800 to 3400&#x000a0;pg/mL.</p><p>A published report on the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between phenylephrine and acetaminophen summarized and modelled data from four crossover studies, three of which included the phenylephrine HCl 10&#x000a0;mg dose as a single-ingredient treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values ranged from 873.8 to 1132&#x000a0;pg/mL, and mean extrapolated area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC&#x0221e;) values ranged from 1105 to 1916&#x000a0;pg&#x000b7;h/mL.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg doses of phenylephrine HCl in healthy adults and to assess the cardiovascular tolerability of these doses compared with time-matched baseline and placebo. In addition, the metabolism of phenylephrine was evaluated using urinary excretion data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was conducted at Biovail Contract Research (Toronto, ON, Canada) in September 2009.

These values served as time-matched baselines for the respective measures on Days 1&#x02013;4.</p><p>Seven subjects were randomized to each of four treatment sequences. On the morning of Days 1&#x02013;4, the pharmacist dispensed the assigned treatment for each subject into a dosing container marked with the randomization number to maintain the blind.

Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected over 7&#x000a0;h, whereas pulse, blood pressure, and 12-lead ECG were measured over 12&#x000a0;h. Urine was collected over each 24-h treatment period to quantify phenylephrine and metabolites. Standardized meals and beverages were free of apples, grapefruit, red grapes, spinach, broccoli, onions, and caffeine.

Because phenylephrine sulfate could not be synthesized and assayed directly in urine, the amount excreted was estimated indirectly. An aliquot of urine was digested with sulfatase, and the concentration of total phenylephrine (unconjugated phenylephrine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;phenylephrine from digestion of phenylephrine sulfate) was assayed. After multiplying the concentration by the 24-h urine volume and converting analytes to micromoles (&#x000b5;mol), the amount of phenylephrine sulfate was estimated by subtracting the amounts of unconjugated phenylephrine and phenylephrine glucuronide from total phenylephrine in the digested sample.

Phenylephrine plasma concentrations were interpolated for timepoints of QTcF values without coincident measured concentrations. Using the nonlinear trapezoidal rule in WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (version 5.2), partial AUCs of phenylephrine were estimated between ECG measurement timepoints. The plasma concentration at each ECG timepoint was then extracted from output generated from the analysis. Next, DQTcF for each subject, treatment, and timepoint up to 4.5&#x000a0;h were calculated as previously described. Finally, differences in DQTcF from time-matched placebo DQTcF (DDQTcF) were calculated for each subject, timepoint, and phenylephrine dose. The DDQTcF values were plotted against the logarithm of corresponding measured and interpolated phenylephrine plasma concentrations. Note that the definition of DDQTcF is the difference in QTcF values between each phenylephrine HCl dose and placebo because the baseline values are the same for each treatment in the crossover design.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-eight subjects (13 male and 15 female) enrolled in the study, of whom 27 subjects completed four treatments.

During the study, eight out of 28 subjects reported nine mild, treatment-emergent adverse events that resolved with no action. Following the placebo dose, elbow rash was experienced by one subject. Following the phenylephrine 10&#x000a0;mg dose, one instance each of dizziness, headache, and arm pain was experienced by three subjects. Following the phenylephrine 20&#x000a0;mg dose, one instance each of somnolence, arm bruise, and elbow rash was experienced by three subjects.

This was followed by a rapid decline in plasma concentrations due to phenylephrine&#x02019;s short <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub>, resulting in minimal concentrations beyond 4&#x000a0;h, when phenylephrine HCl would typically be re-dosed. Similar to previous studies of the 10&#x000a0;mg dose, inter-subject variability for maximum and total exposures of phenylephrine (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>) was high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At each dose, about a tenfold range in individual <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values was observed.</p><p>Both <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> increased more than proportionally with increasing phenylephrine HCl doses, although the disproportional increase was relatively modest. Given that phenylephrine is a drug with high first-pass metabolism, this disproportional increase in AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> suggests that more phenylephrine may bypass the intestinal wall at the higher doses. The increase in bioavailability (<italic>F</italic>) with dose is consistent with the observed decreases in CL/<italic>F</italic> and <italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>F</italic> with no change in the terminal <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;&#x003b2;</sub>.</p><p>Sulfate conjugation of phenylephrine in the intestinal wall is the main route of the first-pass metabolism following oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another major route of metabolism is deamination by the A and B forms of monoamine oxidase to aldehydes, which are further metabolized to 3-hydroxymandelic acid and m-hydroxyphenylglycol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Conjugation of phenylephrine by glucuronide was reported as a minor metabolic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The percentage of phenylephrine excreted unchanged in urine was very low at&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.5&#x000a0;% for the three phenylephrine HCl doses. Unlike a previous study reporting about 6&#x000a0;% phenylephrine glucuronide, this metabolite was excreted at&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.1&#x000a0;% for all doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although m-hydroxyphenylglycol and phenylephrine sulfate were not measured in this study, amounts of the sulfate conjugate excreted were estimated indirectly after sulfatase digestion of urine samples. The percentages of phenylephrine sulfate and 3-hydroxymandelic acid across doses were similar to the respective 47 and 30&#x000a0;% reported previously following oral administration&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. With increasing phenylephrine HCl doses, percentages of the sulfate conjugate excreted decreased, whereas percentages of 3-hydroxymandelic acid increased. This decrease in pre-systemic sulfation may partly explain the greater than proportional increases in phenylephrine plasma concentrations with increasing doses.</p><p>The categorical assessments of pulse and blood pressure outside reference limits were comparable among the single oral doses of phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg, placebo, and baseline. Means of time-matched differences in pulse and blood pressure from baseline showed similar fluctuations over 12&#x000a0;h among phenylephrine HCl doses and placebo. Initially, small increases in mean blood pressure up to 40&#x000a0;min coincided with small decreases in mean pulse up to 20&#x000a0;min. Maximum increases in mean pulse and blood pressure were observed between 6 and 7&#x000a0;h, respectively, for all treatments, reflecting the acrophase or high point of diurnal variation that typically occurs daily at around 16:00&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The main purpose of serial measurements of pulse, blood pressure, and ECGs was to assess cardiovascular tolerability of single doses of phenylephrine at the main therapeutic and two higher doses. As such, this study was not designed to thoroughly evaluate the QTc interval, which would require multiple dosing, inclusion of a positive control, replicate ECGs at each timepoint to lower variability, and ECG over-read by qualified cardiologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, these results do not appropriately address potential proarrhythmic risk due to phenylephrine.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of ECG data from baseline and placebo treatments in phase&#x000a0;I studies, the incidence and percent of male subjects with absolute QTcF values&#x000a0;&#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms and increases of 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;ms or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms from baseline were shown to increase with more occasions of ECG recordings per subject and greater variability in QTcF values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the current study, single ECGs were recorded at ten timepoints per subject during baseline and again on each subsequent treatment day. Standard deviations of QTcF means for 28 subjects across timepoints and treatments were relatively high, ranging from&#x000a0;&#x000b1;13.8 to&#x000a0;&#x000b1;28.9&#x000a0;ms. Therefore, in addition to the incidences of QTcF values within and above the reference limits being similar among treatments, the percentages of subjects with at least one observation within and above the categorical limits are consistent with the study design and QTcF variability.</p><p>Another consideration is that the QTcF categorical analysis included incidence counts of QTcF&#x000a0;&#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms as a conservative lower limit for the cardiovascular assessment. Female subjects were allowed to enroll in this study with a QTc interval&#x000a0;&#x02264;470 ms, which is often used as an upper reference limit for women because women have a longer QTc interval than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Twelve of the 13 QTcF values&#x000a0;&#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms were recorded in women and, of these, ten values were&#x000a0;&#x02264;470&#x000a0;ms. The remaining values were borderline (474&#x000a0;ms) and high (498&#x000a0;ms) in two female subjects and high (515&#x000a0;ms) in a male subject. Both high values were recorded 10&#x000a0;h after the dose when phenylephrine plasma concentrations were either negligible or non-existent, and within an hour of the evening meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the cardiovascular assessments showed no, or minimal, effects following single doses of phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg. A review of heart rate and blood pressure from a series of placebo-controlled, nasal decongestant studies showed statistically significant differences from baseline following doses of phenylephrine HCl 10 and 25&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, these changes were relatively small and inconsistent with regard to increases or decreases over the measurement interval, and did not account for diurnal variation with time-matched baselines. In a study on a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between phenylephrine and acetaminophen, researchers were unable to show any change in mean arterial blood pressure in the healthy volunteers for phenylephrine concentrations in the range expected for a 20&#x000a0;mg dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Finally, the cardiovascular assessments in this and other studies of therapeutic doses are in accordance with published reports that found higher single oral doses from 40 to 120&#x000a0;mg are necessary for consistent, clinically meaningful cardiovascular effects&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The single-dose pharmacokinetics of phenylephrine HCl 10, 20, and 30&#x000a0;mg in this study confirmed the rapid absorption and elimination of phenylephrine reported previously for the 10&#x000a0;mg dose. Maximum and total systemic exposures following the three doses of phenylephrine HCl increased disproportionally with increasing dose. The increases in plasma concentrations, along with decreases in urinary excretion of the sulfate conjugate, suggest that more phenylephrine may bypass intestinal-wall metabolism at the higher doses.

No serious adverse events were reported, and only one event, mild somnolence, was rated as possibly related to phenylephrine HCl. No incidences of pulse, blood pressure, or QTcF outside of reference limits were deemed clinically significant. In light of the study&#x02019;s design limitations and conservative limit for the QTcF categorical assessment, these results show that cardiovascular tolerability of the three phenylephrine HCl doses, which provide a wide range of phenylephrine plasma concentrations, was comparable.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Welch Allyn<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> CardioPerfect<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Pro Recorder or the HP M1770A/Page Writer 300 PI.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors acknowledge contributions of former employees: Dolly Parasrampuria, PhD, for study design and oversight; Katherine McGinley, BS, for clinical operations; and Hiral Mankad, PharmD, for manuscript development.</p></ack><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="d30e1902"><title><italic>Funding</italic></title><p>This study was sponsored and funded by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a Division of Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Consumer, Inc.
