We have followed 67 RA patients and 64 PsA patients for 1&#x02009;year to evaluate the effects of TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors on disease activity and on inflammatory anemia. Patients were divided into three different treatment groups, according to a randomized assignment to receive therapy with etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab. Treatment with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; resulted in a significant reduction in disease activity score-28 (DAS28) values both in RA and PsA patients, already from the third month of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). In both populations, there was an increase in hemoglobin (HB) levels already after 3&#x02009;months of treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), and HB levels were inversely proportional to the disease activity, regardless of the type of medication used. The increased HB values and the reduction of DAS28 values during the observation period suggest the existence of a negative correlation between them both in RA and PsA, regardless of the type of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; used. Our data suggest a pleiotropic action of anti-TNF-&#x003b1;, such as the well-known action on the activity of the disease, and the improvement in inflammatory anemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>anti-TNF-&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>arthritis</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-0394632017714695"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The block of these agents, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), represents an important therapeutic opportunity against chronic inflammatory diseases with an inhibitory effect on inflammatory cells recruitment, on migration of circulating leucocytes into inflamed joints, on angiogenesis, and on tissue damage by decreasing expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, primarily TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, play an important role in inducing inflammatory anemia. In particular, IL-6 induces the synthesis of hepcidin, the key regulator of iron metabolism in anemia of chronic diseases (ACD), which is involved in reducing the intestinal iron absorption and blocking its release from deposits;<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> TNF-&#x003b1;, on the contrary, is probably involved in altering erythropoiesis.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, anemia is an important extra-articular manifestation of RA and PsA, correlated to physical disability and increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Since TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of ACD, the use of biotechnological drugs, such as tocilizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor of the IL-6) and inhibitors of TNF-&#x003b1;, could potentially lead to increased levels of hemoglobin (HB). In fact, in several studies in patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, increased HB levels were observed after treatment with inhibitors of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>This study wants to evaluate the effects of three different TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors, etanercept (ETN), adalimumab (ADA), infliximab (IFX), in terms of clinical efficacy, effects on HB, iron, and ferritin levels, in patients affected by PsA or RA, not suffering from other co-morbidities and not treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or iron.

Nevertheless, less clear is the role of TNF-&#x003b1; inhibition in improving HB levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In our study, DAS28 and CRP values were significantly higher in RA patients than in PsA patients. Moreover, HB levels were significantly lower in RA patients than in PsA patients. These data can be explained by considering that the putative more intense inflammatory status may influence HB levels in RA. We have observed increased HB levels in patients with RA for all three anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents. At the twelfth month, patients treated with ETN had HB levels higher than patients treated with IFX and ADA. We have hypothesized that anti-drug antibodies probably play a role in reducing the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, such as IFX and ADA, on anemia compared to a soluble TNF <italic>receptor</italic> fusion protein, such as ETN.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The increased HB values and the reduction in DAS28 values suggest the existence of a negative correlation between HB levels and DAS28 values both in RA and PsA, regardless of the type of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agent used. Our data confirm the well-known action of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents on the disease activity, and the improvement in inflammatory anemia, demonstrated by the reduction in serum ferritin values. Ferritin value in this study was considered as discriminating between iron-deficiency anemia and inflammatory anemia and, given its function of acute phase reactant, the reduction of its value in the course of treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors does not contradict the expected results. Anti-inflammatory effects of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy may explain both the tendency of ferritin levels to decrease and the tendency of HB levels to increase. Ferritin is a cellular iron storage protein and increased ferritin levels usually are related to excessive iron storage as commonly found in inflammatory anemia. As demonstrated by Song et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0394632017714695" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> serum ferritin levels in chronic arthritis show a direct correlation with serum hepcidin levels, suggesting that increased hepcidin is responsible for increasing iron storage and for reducing the amount of serum iron. Thus, it is conceivable that anti-TNF-&#x003b1; treatment may be involved in reducing both hepcidin and ferritin levels and that improvement in anemia may be related to an improvement in serum iron available for HB synthesis and erythrocyte production.</p><p>In view of the fact that the literature is quite abundant about anemia in RA, improvement of HB values obtained in PsA patients was most surprising. Nevertheless, further studies are needed in order to better define the role of anemia even in course of PsA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All data are provided in the results section of this paper.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0394632017714695"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
