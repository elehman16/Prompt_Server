For humans dancing has been suggested to be analogous to such combined training. Here we assessed whether a newly designed dance training program that stresses the constant learning of new movement patterns is superior in terms of neuroplasticity to conventional fitness activities with repetitive exercises and whether extending the training duration has additional benefits. Twenty-two healthy seniors (63&#x02013;80 years) who had been randomly assigned to either a dance or a sport group completed the entire 18-month study. MRI, BDNF and neuropsychological tests were performed at baseline and after 6 and 18 months of intervention. After 6 months, we found a significant increase in gray matter volume in the left precentral gyrus in the dancers compared to controls. This neuroplasticity effect may have been mediated by the increased BDNF plasma levels observed in the dancers. Regarding cognitive measures, both groups showed significant improvements in attention after 6 months and in verbal memory after 18 months. In addition, volume increases in the parahippocampal region were observed in the dancers after 18 months. The results of our study suggest that participating in a long-term dance program that requires constant cognitive and motor learning is superior to engaging in repetitive physical exercises in inducing neuroplasticity in the brains of seniors. Therefore, dance is highly promising in its potential to counteract age-related gray matter decline.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neuroplasticity</kwd><kwd>VBM</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>dancing</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5663"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The current demographic change in Western societies, involving both a relative and an absolute increase in the number of older people, has sparked increasing scientific interest in geriatric issues. In this context, concepts of successful aging are becoming increasingly important. Several studies have indicated that physical exercise may play a key role in healthy aging and in the prevention of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases (Colcombe et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Erickson et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Recent reviews summarizing epidemiological, cross-sectional and interventional studies support physical activity as a propitious method to induce neuroplasticity in late adulthood (Gregory et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Voelcker-Rehage and Niemann, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Bamadis et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Erickson et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) have concluded that higher cardiorespiratory fitness and aerobic physical activity levels are associated with larger gray matter volumes in the prefrontal regions and the hippocampus. However, not only cardiovascular fitness but also coordinative exercise (Niemann et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and cognitive training (Bamadis et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have been shown to induce gray matter plasticity and enhance cognitive functions in older adults.</p><p>Animal research has suggested that a combination of physical exercise with sensory enrichment has the strongest effect on the genesis of new neurons&#x02014;predominantly in the hippocampus&#x02014;and that only this combination ensures the enduring survival of the newborn cells (Kempermann et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; van Praag et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Kattenstroth et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) have suggested that &#x0201c;dancing activities should be regarded as an equivalent of enriched environmental conditions for humans since they provide an individual with increased sensory, motor and cognitive demands.&#x0201d; Despite this encouraging statement, studies examining the effects of dance training on brain structure or function are scarce. After a 6-month dancing intervention, Kattenstroth et al. (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) have reported significant improvements in cognitive, tactile and motor performance in participating seniors. The results of a prospective study of 469 subjects older than 75 years over a median follow-up period of 5.1 years have indicated that dancing is associated with a markedly reduced risk of dementia (Verghese et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). However, H&#x000fc;fner et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) have reported reduced volumes in several brain regions including the anterior hippocampal formation and parts of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in professional dancers and slackliners compared with non-professionals. This finding may indicate that intensive and repetitive training of the same motor skills leads in context of specialization to reduced volumes of some brain regions. In this study, we therefore design a special dance training program that constantly required the participants to learn new movement patterns (M&#x000fc;ller et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To assess the specific benefits of this intervention, we compared our newly designed dance program to an active rather than a passive control group, which took part in a conventional health sport fitness program in which participants typically performed repetitive physical exercises such as bicycling on an ergometer. Furthermore, because we were interested in the temporal dynamics of the interventions, we assessed the effects on brain structure and function after 6 and 18 months of training. In doing so, we sought to assess whether it is beneficial to extend interventions, because some brain regions may require more training than others, or whether there is a limit after which more training becomes detrimental. Finally, in search of a potential mechanism underlying neuroplasticity, we measured the BDNF levels in the peripheral blood. Several studies have suggested that BDNF promotes the differentiation of new neurons and synapses (Huang and Reichardt, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Lessmann and Brigadski, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Park and Poo, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Edelmann et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). BDNF, therefore, has been proposed to be a mediator of adult neuroplasticity (Fl&#x000f6;el et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants and Experimental Design</title><p>The study was designed as an 18-month controlled intervention.

In the first period, the subjects trained twice per week in 90-min sessions for 6 months. For practical reasons (availability of participants and trainers), the second 12-month intervention period comprised a reduced training frequency of once per week. Both intervention programs were performed in a group context with music to control for psychosocial interactions. Conditional load was examined by recording the pulse values during the training sessions and by calculating the individual training heart rate according to Karvonen et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>) with a factor 0.6 for extensive endurance training. Hence, the two training programs were comparable in terms of intensity, duration and frequency. Both were supervised by experienced instructors.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Dance Group</title><p>Participants in the dance group attended a newly designed training program in which they were constantly asked to learn new movement sequences. These choreographies required the coordination of different body parts (i.e., legs, arms, trunk) in space under different strain conditions (physical strain, precision, situation and time pressure). The subjects had to learn the choreographies by heart, thus imposing high demands on memory as well. The program comprised five different genres (line dance, jazz dance, rock &#x0201c;n&#x0201d; roll and square dance), which were switched after every fourth session. Over the course of the intervention, coordinative demands and time pressure were increased by introducing more complex dance moves and choreographies and by increasing the beats per minute in the music.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Sport Group</title><p>Participants in the sport group completed a conventional strength-endurance training program with mainly repetitive exercises and low demands in terms of whole-body coordination and memory. Each session comprised 20-min units of endurance, strength-endurance and flexibility training. The endurance training was performed on cycle ergometers. In the strength-endurance unit, alternating movements (e.g., biceps curls, squats, sit-ups) were performed, but complex whole body movements were avoided to keep coordinative demands low. The flexibility unit mainly consisted of stretching exercises.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Cardiovascular Fitness</title><p>Cardiovascular fitness was assessed by the Physical Working Capacity 130 Test (PWC 130).

The dance program was a newly designed intervention that required constantly learning new dance choreographies. The conventional sport program focused mainly on repetitive motor exercises. As a main finding, we observed that after 6 months of training, the volumes in the left precentral gyrus of the dancers had increased more than those in the sport group. After another 12 months of training, an additional volume increase was observed in the right parahippocampal gyrus of the dancers. BDNF levels increased during the first 6 months of dance training and returned to the pre-treatment values after 18 months. In the conventional sport group, a similar increase in BDNF was not evident. Because the cardiovascular fitness levels over the course of the interventions remained constant in both groups, the observed effects could not be attributed to improvements in physical fitness but instead seemed to be related to the specific features of the dance program. These features included the requirement to constantly learn new choreographies (i.e., memory), to integrate multisensory information, to coordinate the whole body and to navigate in space.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Brain Changes</title><p>The precentral gyrus is essential for the control of voluntary motor functions. The increase in gray matter volume in the precentral gyrus in the dance group may, therefore, have been based on the complex and ever-changing movement patterns that the dancers had to perform. These movements required the simultaneous coordination of several parts of the body in different directions and adjustment to the varying rhythms of the music (polycentric and polyrhythmic). Reflecting on these complex coordination requirements, Brown et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) have reported dance-induced activations in the putamen, the primary motor cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA), as shown by PET. Other studies have indicated an association between coordination demands (e.g., balancing, juggling) and neuroplasticity in the precentral region (Boyke et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Taubert et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Hence, the dance-related volume increase in this area was consistent with expectations based on the literature.</p><p>The parahippocampal gyrus is part of the outer arc of the limbic system and plays an important role in working memory and episodic memory retrieval (Pantel et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). According to Bliss and Lomo (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>), the parahippocampal gyrus constitutes the interface between memory and the experiential consciousness of the present, because it is interconnected by the perforant tract both to regions of the frontal lobe, which are associated with working memory, and to the hippocampus, the central structure in episodic memory encoding and spatial navigation. Many VBM studies have reported an age-related volume loss in parahippocampal regions (Tisserand et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Furthermore, Ech&#x000e1;varri et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) have suggested that parahippocampal atrophy is an early biomarker of AD. The observation that engaging in a dance program for a longer period can induce neuroplastic processes in this crucial memory region, therefore, particularly encouraging in terms of developing prevention strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Temporal Dynamics of Gray Matter Brain Plasticity</title><p>The observed volume increases in the two brain regions developed at different times. Dancing led to a volume increase in the motor areas after 6 months (see also Rehfeld et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), which remained stable during the subsequent 12 months. The dance-associated volume increase in the parahippocampal gyrus emerged later and was observed only in the 18-month data. The different temporal dynamics in the evolution of the two brain regions may be related to differences in the underlying cellular mechanisms. Animal research has suggested that angiogenesis and the formation of new dendrites (Thomas et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) occur rapidly, whereas changes in the neuropil occur much slower (Black et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). In humans, rapid increases in gray matter volume in the prefrontal regions have been observed after only 2 weeks of motor learning in younger adults (Taubert et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To induce neuroplasticity in the hippocampus, longer training periods have been recommended (Erickson et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Niemann et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the aforementioned volume increases from our study are in contrast to the results of H&#x000e4;nggi et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), which revealed that professional ballet dancers have decreased gray matter volumes in the left premotor cortex, SMA, Putamen and superior frontal gyrus and the results of H&#x000fc;fner et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), which report reduced volumes in several brain regions including the anterior hippocampal formation in professional dancers and slackliners compared with non-professionals. However, these studies were cross-sectional observational studies which compared the brains of professional dancers to those of non-professionals. In addition, our dance group consisted of old aged novices. It has been shown that learning of a new skill first leads to recruitment of additional neural resources. Later, when the skill becomes more automatic, less neuronal resources are needed which may lead to volume decreases in those with long-term experience. Based on these initial conditions (novices, older adults) and our special designed dancing training program, which required constantly new learning of movement patterns, it is possible that effects of specialization induced volume decreases as reported by H&#x000e4;nggi et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) are not observed.</p><p>It is generally thought that motor training initially induces brain volume increases. However, prolonged training leads to automatization, which may have the opposite effects on cortical volume, because less cortical control is needed after the motor skills have been fully established (Taube, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Our dance training program, therefore, was specially designed to avoid such automatization, which may explain why, at least within 18 months, no cortical volume decreases were observed in our study.</p><p>Cognitive functions also showed nonlinear development, whereby verbal memory increased only during the second training period. Regarding attention performance, significant improvements were observable after only 6 months in both groups (Rehfeld et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These findings support prior reports regarding the beneficial effects of physical interventions on neuropsychological tests (Bamadis et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, in cognitive ability data, in contrast to the brain data, no group differences emerged. Others have reported superior effects of combined cognitive and physical training as opposed to single interventions (Oswald et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). We will extend our interventions further to test whether group differences in cognition might emerge at even later time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Underlying Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Gray Matter Plasticity</title><p>Although VBM is an imaging modality that reveals volume changes in the brain, this technique does not allow causal conclusions regarding the underlying neurophysiological processes. Neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis are just a few of the mechanisms that have been suggested to be the basis of brain volume changes (Zatorre et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As mediators of the effects of cardiovascular fitness on the brain, growth factors such as BDNF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) are being studied (Kirk-Sanchez and McGough, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, in our study, in contrast to previous ones (Erickson et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Maass et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), no differences in cardiovascular fitness were present between groups, and the fitness levels did not change during the interventions. The latter observation was probably related to our control of the individual heart frequency, which we aimed to maintain in the aerobic zone. However, BDNF changes have also been associated with physical activity, social interaction and positive stress (Mattson, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and not all studies have observed a BDNF increase after cardiovascular training (Vital et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Finally, animal research has suggested that coordination but not endurance training induces synaptogenesis and glial changes (Black et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). Together, the named additional factors that drive BDNF secretion may have been more crucial during dancing than during fitness activities, thus explaining why only dancers showed a BDNF increase in the first 6 months. The observation that BDNF levels returned to baseline in the following 12 months while volume increases were simultaneously observed in the parahippocampal gyrus, however, indicates that there must be other factors involved in adult brain plasticity than the ones represented by BDNF levels in the peripheral blood.</p><p>Regarding neurobiological mechanisms of exercised-induced plasticity also concept of brain reserve (Satz et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) should be considered. The concept of brain reserve describe individual differences in an increased baseline adaptive neuroplasticity, which provide greater dynamic capacity for remodeling cortical circuits to different stressors (Barulli and Stern, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Freret et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Perspectives</title><p>The results of our study suggest that a long-term dancing intervention could be superior to repetitive physical exercise in inducing neuroplasticity in the aging human brain. We presume that this advantage is related to the multimodal nature of dancing, which combines physical, cognitive and coordinative challenges. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal, randomized study to recommend dancing programs as a means of preventing gray matter and cognitive decline in the elderly. Further research is needed to clarify in greater detail the temporal dynamics and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of dance-induced neuroplasticity and whether this intervention truly has the potential to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PM designed and performed the research, analyzed the data, wrote the article.
