However, the evolving consensus is to define vitamin D deficiency (VDD) as a serum 25(OH)D level of less than 20 ng/L (50 nmol/L) and insufficiency as a level of 25(OH)D of 21-29 ng/mL (525 to 725 nmol/L). Vitamin D intoxication is observed when serum levels of 25(OH)D are greater than 150 ng/mL (374 nmol/L).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin D synthesis is affected by geographical location (latitude and altitude), atmospheric pollution, clothing, melanin pigmentation, and sunlight exposure. In addition, ageing is also associated with decreased vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D deficiency is rampant. In India, it has been reported from all over the country (both rural and urban), in all age groups including toddlers, school children, adolescent girls, pregnant women,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and postmenopausal women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommends daily intake of 600 mg of calcium in adults and 800 mg of calcium in postmenopausal age group.

The current study was planned to see the effect of two different daily doses (500 IU &#x02013; the standard and 1000 IU) of vitamin D supplementation added to standard calcium dose (1000 mg/day), on vitamin D levels and parameters of calcium homeostasis (calcium, phosphorus, and ALP) in postmenopausal women.

Post-menopausal women volunteers (mainly attendants of patients who presented in the out-patient department or medical and paramedical staff and their relatives, representing a relatively high socioeconomic strata relative to the national average) who were not taking calcium or vitamin D supplementation for minimum 3 months and were permanent residents of the city for past 3 months were enrolled. At induction, a detailed history including dietary history and history of daily sun exposure was taken. Subjects on calcium or vitamin D replacement or any drugs affecting vitamin D status, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, chronic smokers, and chronic alcoholics were excluded. A total 92 subjects were enrolled from the months of September to November. At induction, morning fasting samples were collected for serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and 25(OH)D after written informed consent.</p><p>The subjects were randomized in three groups by unrestricted sequential simple randomization. The enrolment and randomization were done by the same person. The study was an open label study. Each group received one tablet corresponding to their group twice daily for 3 months. The group A (<italic>n</italic> = 30) served as control and received only 1000 mg calcium carbonate daily in equally divided two doses, group B (<italic>n</italic> = 31) received 1000 mg of calcium carbonate and 500 IU of vitamin D (as a combination tablet containing 500 mg calcium carbonate and 250 IU vitamin D) daily in equally divided two doses, and group C (<italic>n</italic> = 31) received 1000 mg of calcium carbonate and 1000 IU of vitamin D (as a combination tablet containing 500 mg calcium carbonate and 500 IU vitamin D) daily in equally divided two doses. The tablets were procured from Eris Pharmaceuticals which were market preparations DeCal (a combination tablet containing 500 mg calcium carbonate and 250 IU vitamin D), D-500 Cal (a combination tablet containing 500 mg calcium carbonate and 500 IU vitamin D), while plain calcium tablets containing 500 mg calcium carbonate were manufactured for the study after appropriate approval.</p><p>Drugs were supplied every month, and compliance was ensured by weekly telephonic reinforcement. Compliance was considered as consumption of at least 80% of the supplied tablets. At the end of three months morning fasting samples were collected for measurement of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and serum 25(OH)D levels in subjects who were considered to be compliant.</p><p>Serum albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase estimation was performed on the auto-analyzer immediately.

The sensitivity of this assay was 1.5 ng/mL, within-run coefficient of variation (CV) was 10.5%, and the total imprecision CV was 8.2% at 22.7 ng/mL. Primary outcome was the change in the mean serum 25(OH)D level from baseline in the group receiving 1000 IU of vitamin D per day as compared to the group receiving 500 U of vitamin D per day and the group not receiving any vitamin D supplementation, at the end of three months of intervention.

It was carried out in New Delhi (location &#x02013;28.38&#x000b0;N, 77.12&#x000b0;E). This city experiences marked seasonal variation. The zenith angle is 84.5&#x000b0; in peak summer and 38.5&#x000b0; in peak winter. Subjects were recruited from September to November, prior to the onset of peak winter. Since the subjects were randomly divided into the three groups, any effect of season was equally distributed.</p><p>In the present study, 83.7% subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 77) had vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D &#x0003c;20 ng/mL), 8.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 8) subjects had vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D 20-30 ng/mL), and 7.6% subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 7) had normal vitamin D defined as 25(OH)D &#x0003e;30 ng/mL.

The percentage change in mean serum 25(OH)D level from baseline was significantly different in between the three groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) with percentage change being maximum in group C (178.78%) and group A actually showing a decline. The decline probably reflects the effect of season as the follow-up period was winters. Whatever the effect of season, it was presumed that it would be uniform in the three groups. Our results suggest that 1000 IU vitamin D is better as compared to the currently prescribed doses of 500 IU daily. However, even this dose is not sufficient to optimize the levels in a severely deficient population.</p><p>The number of subjects who attained serum 25(OH)D level &#x02265;30 ng/mL was four (22.2%) in group C, one (4%) in group B, and none in the control group. The percentage of subjects who attained serum 25(OH)D level of 20-30 ng/mL in the three groups was 38.9% (<italic>N</italic> = 7), 12% (<italic>N</italic> = 3), and 4.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 1), respectively.</p><p>There percentage change in the blood levels of corrected serum calcium, phosphorus and total alkaline phosphatase from baseline was not different between the three groups.</p><p>Our results are in line with the results of previous studies. In a study conducted among older adults, it was seen that there was no difference in the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among subjects who were and those who were not receiving vitamin D supplementation in dose ranging from 200 to 400 IU/day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In a previously conducted study from Delhi in healthy adults, the authors concluded that monthly oral administration of 60,000 IU cholecalciferol (~2000 IU/day or 50 &#x003bc;g/day) is effective in raising serum 25(OH)D to desired levels (&#x0003e;30 ng/mL) during summer. However, higher doses of cholecalciferol&#x02014;120,000 IU/month administered orally (~4000 IU/day or 100 &#x003bc;g/day)&#x02014;may be more appropriate during winter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] From their study among ambulatory elderly in Finland, the authors concluded that 10 &#x003bc;g/d (400 IU) is not enough to maintain 25(OH)D above 40 nmol/L in winter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] An optimal daily dose of 115 &#x003bc;g/d (4600 IU) was predicted statistically, to obtain 25(OH)D levels within the range of 75-220 nmol/L in the African- American population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>Our study suggests that even 1000 IU daily for 3 months may not be enough to attain optimum levels of serum 25(OH)D; and probably a higher dose is required to attain optimum levels. In our study, the mean 25(OH)D level in group C after 3 months of supplementation was less than 30 ng/mL (23.71 ng/mL) suggesting that even 1000 IU may not be sufficient to attain normal levels of 25(OH)D and a higher dose as much as 2000 IU/day may be required in special populations as postmenopausal women especially in the Indian subcontinent. As previously seen,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] the effects of calcium and vitamin D are not sustained and levels decline after some time. Thus, sustained duration of intake is desired.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. The subjects included in the study were based on convenience sampling and not population based sampling. Our study was a non-blinded and the subjects knew the nature of supplementation they were receiving. It sometimes could have affected compliance as the subjects were given the background information related to the study. The laboratory conducting the tests was however blinded. The number of subjects for final analysis after excluding the dropouts and subjects with less than 80% compliance was relatively small.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Standard dose of vitamin D available in calcium tablets (250 IU per 500 mg calcium carbonate) is not adequate for achieving optimum serum 25(OH)D levels. Higher dose of vitamin D supplementation with 1000 IU/day (500 IU per 500 mg calcium carbonate) daily was superior to the standard dose therapy and resulted in serum 25(OH)D values &#x0003e;20 ng/mL in postmenopausal women in our study. For achievement of optimum serum 25(OH)D levels (&#x0003e;30 ng/mL), still higher doses of vitamin D are likely to be required.</p><p>It is possible that the standard recommended dose may be adequate for maintenance in a &#x0201c;vitamin D sufficient&#x0201d; population. However, in the Indian population which is severely deficient, even 1000 IU daily cholecalciferol supplementation is not adequate. At this point therefore, it is recommended to make the population sufficient by giving therapeutic doses of vitamin D to the diagnosed cases. Further studies are required to evaluate higher doses in Indian postmenopausal women which will achieve and maintain optimal vitamin D levels without risk of toxicity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> The study was funded by Eris Lifesciences, India</p></fn><fn
