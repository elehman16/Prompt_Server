Nine male extreme conditioning program (ECP) practitioners with more than 6 months of experience (age 26.7 &#x000b1; 6.6 years; body mass 78.8 &#x000b1; 13.2 kg; body fat 13.5 &#x000b1; 6.2 %) completed two experimental ECP sessions. Cardiovascular variables were measured before, immediately after and every 15 min during a 45 min recovery following each experimental session. Compared with pre-exercise data, our results showed a SBP decrease at 30 min post exercise session 1 (P&#x02264;0.05) and at 45 min following exercise session 2. DBP decreased (P&#x02264;0.05) at 15 min and 30 min following exercise session 1 and at 30 min after the exercise session 2, respectively. HR remained significantly higher (P&#x02264;0.05) 45 min following the first and second exercise session compared with pre-exercise values. Exercise session 1 induced a higher increase in HR (86 &#x000b1; 11% of HR<sub>max</sub> versus 82 &#x000b1; 12% of HR<sub>max</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and RPE (8.8 &#x000b1; 1.2 versus 8.0 &#x000b1; 1.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) when compared to exercise session 2. In conclusion, post-exercise hypotension occurs following strenuous exercise sessions, regardless of the session design, which may have an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Strenuous exercise</kwd><kwd>physical fitness</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hypertension is considered a global public health problem, causing millions of deaths each year (<xref rid="b7-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This disorder has a multifactorial etiology, characterized by persistent elevation of blood pressure (&#x02265; 140/90 mm Hg) combined with deleterious metabolic changes, increasing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease progression (<xref rid="b7-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Age, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, race, smoking status, socioeconomic status and hyperlipidemia are common associated risk factors for hypertension (<xref rid="b7-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that lifestyle changes, reducing the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, appropriate dietary habits and body weight maintenance are recommended as preventative and non-pharmacological treatments for hypertension. In addition, to reduce the prevalence of hypertension, regular physical activity is strongly recommended (<xref rid="b13-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It has been shown that a single session of exercise induces an important phenomenon called post-exercise hypotension, characterized by systemic reductions in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to values below those observed at rest or pre-exercise (<xref rid="b4-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b8-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b14-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b16-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b21-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Significantly reductions on BP after exercise are seen in investigations with individuals with normal BP (<xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), hypertension (<xref rid="b14-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="b16-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b21-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These reductions are showed following aerobic exercises (AE) (<xref rid="b2-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), resistance exercises (RE) (<xref rid="b14-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b16-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b21-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and combined aerobic and resistance exercises (<xref rid="b10-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b20-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Extreme Conditioning Program (ECP) is a growing fitness regimen characterized by functional movements performed at high intensity and constantly varied movements (<xref rid="b15-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Olympic weight lifting (snatch, clean and jerk), gymnastic movements (Pull-ups, push-ups, handstand and sit-ups) and aerobic training (rowing, biking and running) combined in an allotted time are typical within ECP workouts (<xref rid="b15-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b17-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b19-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recently, investigators have demonstrated an additive post-exercise hypotensive (PEH) response following the combination of aerobic and RE when compared to a single type of exercise. Keese <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that adding aerobic exercise to resistance training resulted in a more pronounced PEH response than RE alone (<xref rid="b10-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Interestingly, Angadi <italic>et al</italic>. observed that aerobic interval exercise (4-minutes at 90&#x02013;95% HRmax repeated by 4-bouts, separated by three minutes) induced greater duration in the PEH response (&#x0003e;2 hours) when compared with 30-minute steady-state exercise (75&#x02013;80% maximum heart rate) and sprint interval exercise (30-second Wingate sprints repeated 6 times, separated by 4 minutes), respectively (<xref rid="b2-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These recent studies have sparked greater interest into cardiovascular adaptations following high intensity exercises.</p><p>Furthermore, recent studies identified low and/or nonresponders to BP after exercise, demonstrated that the training effects (health related and performance factors) varies widely. Interestingly, &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; to BP were identified after different exercise types, including maximal exercise test (<xref rid="b8-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), continuous moderate aerobic exercise (<xref rid="b11-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and resistance exercise (<xref rid="b12-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). On the other hand, to our knowledge, the effects of different ECP sessions on intraindividual variation in BP responsiveness has not yet been designed.</p><p>At a time when more individuals are practicing ECP, more studies need to be performed to evaluate the effect of this fitness regimen on the cardiovascular system for the control of blood pressure (BP). Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of two sessions on subsequent days of ECP on BP, heart rate (HR), rating perceived exertion (RPE) and intraindividual variation in BP responsiveness between the sessions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Nine ECP practitioners for at least 6 months (age 26.7 &#x000b1; 6.6 years) were recruited through advertisements.

(<xref rid="b1-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) [VO<sub>2</sub>max = (0.177 * 1600mV) + 8.101; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .89].</p><p>The ECP sessions were independent variables, while the dependent variables were the changes in BP, HR and RPE after 45 minutes of ECP (session 1 and 2). The ECP consisted of strength and gymnastic exercises paired with aerobic conditioning, however, metabolic conditioning session 1 was predominantly based on Olympic lifting and metabolic conditioning session 2 on body weight exercises. The experimental design adopted in this study was the same used by Tibana <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="b17-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Participants completed 2 training sessions 24 hours apart, as described in Tibana <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="b16-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The training sessions were described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijes-10-8-1165">table 1</xref> and were divided into strength, gymnastic and metabolic conditioning exercises. The values of maximal strength were based off reported values from the participants, which were experienced in ECP and performed periodic maximal strength measurements. Even so, after strength and gymnastic exercises, 5 minutes of rest was allowed and then metabolic conditioning was performed, according to the exercises described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijes-10-8-1165">table 1</xref> for each training session. The goal of the metabolic conditioning sessions was to complete the maximum number of repetitions in each training session, without compromising exercise technique.</p><p>All training sessions were performed between 10 and 11 am, and participants were instructed to have a meal at least 2 h before arriving at the ECP box (same meal in training session days). Participants were asked to refrain from alcohol, coffee, tea, cola or other stimulants. In addition, they were instructed to refrain from vigorous physical activity for the previous 48h of session 1 and from alcohol ingestion for the previous 24 h. Systolic and DBP were measured with an oscillometric device (Microlife 3AC1-1, Widnau, Switzerland) according to the recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (<xref rid="b5-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The cuff size was adapted to the circumference of the arm of each participant according to the manufacture&#x02019;s recommendations. All BP measures were evaluated in duplicate (1 minute apart) and the mean value was calculated and used for analysis. An HR monitor (Polar S810i, Polar Electo Oy, Kempele, Finland) was used to evaluate HR. Blood pressure and HR measurements were performed after 15 min of seated rest (rest), immediately after ECP sessions (0) and 15, 30 and 45 min after the ECP sessions. During BP and HR measurements participants remained seated quietly under a controlled room temperature (~22&#x000b0; C). Subjects were instructed to not drink water during the recovery period to avoid the potential effect of hydration on the post exercise BP responses (<xref rid="b6-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). According to the response of BP after training sessions, the participants were classified as: non-responders, no reduction in BP after training session; responders, greatest reduction in BP lower than 10 mmHg after training session; high responders, greatest reduction of BP higher than 10 mmHg after training session (<xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Participants were asked to rate their perceived exertion 5 min following the completion of each working set based on the CR-10 RPE scale (<xref rid="b3-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). They were asked to use any number on the scale to rate their overall effort. A rating of 0 was to be associated with no effort (rest) and a rating of 10 was considered to be maximal effort and associated with the most stressful exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check for normality distribution of the variables. A two way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare blood pressure and heart rate between the sessions. Compound sphericity of the variables was verified by a Mauchley test. When the assumption of sphericity was not met, the significance of F-ratios was adjusted according to the Greenhouse-Geisser procedure. Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc test with Bonferroni adjustment was applied in the event of significance. A paired sample t-test was used to compare RPE and HR immediately after the training sessions and area under the curve (AUC) of blood pressure at 45 min following the training sessions. A &#x003c7;2 test was used to compare the blood pressure responders between training sessions. The power of the sample size was determined based on the SBP and DBP post-exercise hypotension. Considering the sample size of this study and an alpha error of 0.05, the power (1 &#x02013; &#x003b2;) achieved for SBP was 0.99 for training session 1 and 2 and for DBP was 0.84 for training session 1 and 0.61 for training session 2.

Systolic BP was decreased following AE (&#x02212;6.3 mmHg), RE (&#x02212;4.2 mmHg, 3 sets at 80% 1RM in eight exercises) and combined exercise (&#x02212;5.1 mmHg) sessions in young subjects, with higher magnitudes for AE and combined sessions.</p><p>Furthermore, Angadi <italic>et al</italic>. found that aerobic interval exercise (4-minutes at 90&#x02013;95% HRmax repeated by 4-bouts, separated by three minutes) induced a longer-lasting PEH response (&#x0003e;2 hours) when compared with 30-minutes of steady-state exercise (75&#x02013;80% heart rate maximum) and sprint interval exercise (30-second Wingate sprints repeated 6 times, separated by 4 minutes), respectively (<xref rid="b2-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Similarly, in the present study, both ECP sessions, that were performed at 86 &#x000b1; 11% (session 1) and 82 &#x000b1; 12% of heart rate maximum (session 2), induced PEH.</p><p>It was recently shown that there is considerable interindividual variation in BP responses following a single bout of exercise, meaning that some individuals display PEH (&#x0201c;responders&#x0201d;), while others do not (&#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="b9-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b12-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Interestingly, &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonresponders&#x0201d; were identified following different exercise types, including maximal exercise test (<xref rid="b9-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), continuous moderate aerobic exercise (<xref rid="b11-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and resistance exercise (<xref rid="b12-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Hecksteden <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the PEH following maximal exercise (acute exercise) is associated with the chronic training-induced decrease of BP following a walking/running program (<xref rid="b9-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Moreover, Tibana <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that during RE the degree of BP reduction after acute exercise is correlated with the magnitude of change in resting BP observed after 8 weeks of resistance training in healthy untrained women (<xref rid="b18-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It is important to note that Whelton et al. (<xref rid="b22-ijes-10-8-1165" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) described that small decrements in BP had an important clinical benefit (2 mmHg reduce the risk of stroke by 14% and 17%, and the risk of developing coronary artery disease by 9% and 6%, respectively). When PEH magnitude was compared between sessions, different biological characteristics may be the cause of the variability in the BP responses. The mechanisms for the PEH was not observed in this study.</p><p>The present study recognizes limitations, such as the lack of a mechanistic approach and a control session without exercise was missing. The weight lifting during the exercise sessions were based on maximal strength self-reported, which could be a bias for the accurate %1RM used in the study. Finally, the acute response of BP was measured only 45 minutes following exercise. Future studies might include different interventions (ex.: AE, RE or combined AE and RE) to determine the impact of each training modality on acute cardiovascular responses.</p><p>Extreme conditioning program induces PEH regardless of the training session design in adult trained men, thus, this type of training is effective in decreasing acute SBP and DBP, which can prevent possible cardiovascular risk factors. Due to increasing popularity, ECP may be a viable alternative to traditional exercise modalities for optimizing BP control in normotensive adults. Moreover, RPE after metabolic conditioning predominantly based on Olympic lifting was higher than after a metabolic conditioning with body weight exercises. More studies should be designed to investigate the acute and, specially, chronic effects of ECP in different populations. Moreover, it is possible that due to the different individual responsiveness to training, subjects may require different dose-response prescriptions to obtain optimal BP results. For example, those subjects who did not present acute PEH with training based on body weight exercises could have their training modified to Olympic lifting metabolic conditioning based to improve their metabolic results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-ijes-10-8-1165"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
