Introduction</title><p>For decades, researchers have been looking for an improved treatment that could effectively and safely alleviate moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (LBP). Given the prevalence of this chronic pain condition, its economic burden, and its impact on work productivity and quality of life of those affected, improving this condition would have major societal impact.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Adequate pain management in chronic LBP remains challenging because of its complex pathophysiology, which is often characterized by a combination of nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms (mixed pain concept).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A correct balance between analgesic efficacy and acceptable tolerability is not easy to achieve.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Strong opioids are frequently used for chronic severe pain management, although they are often associated with poor tolerability and development of addiction and tolerance.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, neuropathic pain is often less responsive to opioid treatment than nociceptive pain. A therapeutic agent that addresses both pain components has the analgesic potential of strong opioids, but is associated with fewer opioid-type side effects would largely simplify the treatment of chronic LBP and would therefore represent a valuable new treatment strategy.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Cebranopadol is a novel, centrally acting, potent, first-in-class analgesic drug candidate with a unique mode of action that combines nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor and opioid peptide receptor agonism.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The endogenous agonist of the NOP receptor is nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), which does not bind to classical opioid peptide receptors. Although N/OFQ acts in a very similar way as opioids at the molecular and cellular level, it induces pharmacological effects that may differ from, and even oppose, those of opioids.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Preclinical studies demonstrated that, even after doses higher than those required to induce analgesia, cebranopadol affects neither motor coordination nor respiratory function and thus displays a better tolerability profile than opioids.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In rodents, functional interactions of the opioid and NOP receptor systems have been described, which result in either additive/synergistic analgesic activity or in antiopioid/pronociceptive activity, depending on the site of action (spinal or supraspinal, respectively).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In contrast, NOP receptor activation produced consistent antinociceptive effects in nonhuman primates, irrespective of the site of action.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Importantly, NOP receptor activation has been shown to counteract &#x003bc;-opioid peptide receptor agonist-mediated development of tolerance, addiction, and physical dependence in rodent models.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Given that cebranopadol is effective in animal models of nociceptive and neuropathic pain, it yields the potential for the treatment of mixed pain conditions. In addition, as a nonselective drug acting at more than one opioid receptor, cebranopadol could have several advantages over selective agents or bivalent compounds, including multiple-level targeting of the pain pathway, a small molecular size and as such a higher permeability into the central nervous system, and more predictable pharmacokinetics.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As such, it merited the conduct of this phase II trial. Its main objective was to assess for the first time the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cebranopadol in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic LBP, with extensive characterization of the trial population for the presence of nociceptive and neuropathic pain symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><p>We conducted the first human phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group trial with cebranopadol in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic LBP with and without a neuropathic pain component, recruited from 79 investigational sites in 11 European countries from November 2012 to July 2014. The clinical trial protocol, amendments, and informed consent forms were approved by the relevant regulatory authorities and ethical committees, and all patients provided written informed consent before entry in the trial. The Eudract trial number is 2012-001920-36 and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier is NCT01725087.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1. Trial population</title><p>The trial included male and female patients aged 18 to 80 years with a clinical diagnosis of chronic LBP of nonmalignant origin, with moderate-to-severe pain being present for at least 3 months. Patients had to be on stable opioid or nonopioid analgesic medication with regular intake for at least 3 months and had to be dissatisfied with their current analgesic treatment. An average 24-hour, analgesic medication-free, baseline pain score of &#x02265;5 on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) was required during the 3 days preceding randomization. Patients were not eligible for the trial if they suffered from chronic LBP potentially associated with a specific spinal cause, or conditions other than LBP that could confound the (self-) evaluation of pain. Patients who underwent a recent or more than 1 previous low back surgery, any invasive procedure aimed to reduce LBP, or any kind of neuromodulation were also excluded from the trial. Other analgesics (eg, opioids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, some antidepressants, etc.) or concomitant treatments that could interfere with the efficacy assessment of the trial medication or safety of the patients were either not acceptable or had to be given at a stable dose throughout the treatment period of the trial.</p><p>Patients were characterized at baseline with the painDETECT questionnaire,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the Quebec Task Force Classification (QTFC),<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and the clinical presence of lumbar radiculopathy. The broadly validated painDETECT questionnaire was used to determine the likelihood of a neuropathic component of the LBP based on 7 questions addressing the frequency and quality of neuropathic symptoms. Based on the final score, patients were considered painDETECT positive (likelihood of a neuropathic pain component &#x0003e;90%, score 19-38), painDETECT unclear (ambiguous result, score 13-18), or painDETECT negative (a neuropathic pain component is unlikely/&#x0003c;15%, score &#x02212;1 to 12). Patients in this trial were also classified into 4 groups according to the QTFC on spinal disorders: QTFC 1 (pain in the lumbar area without radiation and without neurologic signs), QTFC 2 (pain in the lumbar area with radiation proximally but without neurologic signs), QTFC 3 (pain in the lumbar area with radiation distally but without neurologic signs), and QTFC 4 (pain in the lumbar area with radiation to a limb and with neurologic signs). The presence of lumbar radiculopathy was assessed by the investigator based on a clinical examination and a series of questions on the symptoms and signs of lumbar radiculopathy. Patients were primarily recruited from pain specialists and primary care.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2. Trial design</title><p>A flow diagram of the trial is provided in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The trial consisted of 3 periods: an enrollment period, a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up period. During the enrollment period, patients' eligibility was assessed, previous analgesic medication was washed out, and the analgesic medication-free baseline pain intensity was determined.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram and trial medication. PR, prolonged release. Titration steps before up-titration to a next higher dose lasted for 3 days.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jop-158-1813-g001"/></fig><p>The double-blind treatment period comprised a 14-day titration phase and a 12-week maintenance phase. Randomization of patients took place at the Baseline Visit (start of the treatment period), based on computer-generated randomization lists provided by an external supplier and was implemented using an interactive response technology system. A block randomization with stratification factors (country and painDETECT subgroup) was applied, randomizing patients in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 5 treatment arms: a placebo arm, a tapentadol prolonged release (PR) 200 mg twice daily arm, and 3 cebranopadol arms corresponding to 3 target doses (200, 400, and 600 &#x003bc;g) given once daily in the morning. These cebranopadol doses were chosen based on data from previous trials, albeit without in-depth knowledge of the appropriate target dose and length of the titration phase. Paracetamol/acetaminophen was allowed as a rescue medication for unacceptable chronic LBP (maximum total daily dose of 2 g and maximum 20 days of use during the maintenance phase). Tapentadol PR was included as an active comparator as it is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic pain, including chronic back pain. Tapentadol PR was administered according to the labelling instructions, reaching the target dose of 200 mg twice daily on day 10. This dose was further taken during the remainder of the treatment period. Patients assigned to the cebranopadol 200 &#x003bc;g arm received fixed doses of cebranopadol 200 &#x003bc;g during the entire treatment period. Patients assigned to cebranopadol 400 or 600 &#x003bc;g were titrated in increments of 200 &#x003bc;g, starting with 200 &#x003bc;g and increasing to the target dose of 400 &#x003bc;g on day 4 (400 &#x003bc;g arm), and further to 600 &#x003bc;g on day 7 (600 &#x003bc;g arm). After reaching the target dose, patients stayed on this dose for the remainder of the treatment period. No dose adjustment of the trial medication in case of adverse events was allowed. Double-dummy methods were used to guarantee the blinding of patients and all personnel involved in the trial. Patients were instructed to take their trial medication twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening) with a glass of water. After the Baseline Visit, routine visits were scheduled during the treatment period, after week 1 and week 2, and then every 2 weeks until the End-of-treatment (EoT) Visit, which was scheduled 14 weeks after the Baseline Visit.</p><p>The follow-up period ran from the day after the EoT Visit until the Follow-up Phone Call, which was scheduled 10 to 14 days after the last intake of trial medication. The Follow-up Visit was scheduled within 3 to 5 days after the last intake of trial medication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3. Efficacy outcome measures and assessments</title><p>In support of a future marketing authorization in the European Union/other non&#x02013;United States (US) countries, and in the United States, 2 different primary efficacy endpoints were applied. These endpoints were, respectively, defined as the change from baseline pain to the weekly average 24-hour pain during the entire 12 weeks of the maintenance phase, and the change from baseline pain to the average 24-hour pain during week 12 of the maintenance phase. The primary endpoint for one region was considered as an additional endpoint for the other region. During the enrollment and treatment periods, patients once daily recorded their pain with a recall period of 24 hours (24-hour pain), using an 11-point NRS where 0 indicated &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 indicated &#x0201c;pain as bad as you can imagine.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Baseline pain was calculated as the average over the three 24-hour pain assessments recorded during the last 3 days before the Baseline Visit.</p><p>Additional efficacy endpoints included (1) the primary endpoints by painDETECT subgroup; (2) change from baseline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score; (3) change from baseline in the overall quality of sleep, based on the Chronic Pain Sleep Inventory (CPSI) scores; (4) responder rates, defined as achieving a predefined percentage improvement in 24-hour pain at week 12 of the maintenance phase compared with baseline; (5) the use of rescue medication during the treatment period; (6) change from baseline in the anxiety and depression subscale scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and (7) Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC).</p><p>The ODI questionnaire assessed pain-related disability and covered 10 items on pain and activities of daily living.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The CPSI questionnaire measured the direct impact of pain on the quality of sleep and included 5 items which measured trouble falling asleep (CPSI 1), needing sleep medication (CPSI 2), awakening by pain during the night (CPSI 3) and in the morning (CPSI 4), and overall quality of sleep (CPSI 5).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The HADS and PGIC questionnaires were used to assess the presence of depression and anxiety,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and the global improvement of the patient's condition and satisfaction with treatment,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4. Safety outcome measures and assessments</title><p>Safety-related endpoints and assessments included (1) the frequency of treatment&#x02013;emergent adverse events (TEAEs, defined as any adverse events that occurred after the first intake of trial medication) and percentage of patients discontinuing the trial because of TEAEs; (2) frequency of potential withdrawal symptoms using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>; (3) changes from baseline on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>; and (4) changes from baseline in vital signs, safety laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>2.5. Statistical analyses</title><p>A total patient number of 600 patients with 120 patients per treatment arm were determined before trial initiation to provide 80% power at a 0.05 significance level (2-sided test) to detect a treatment difference in the primary endpoint of 0.9 points on the 11-point NRS with an SD of 2.5 points.</p><p>The Safety Set included all enrolled patients who took trial medication. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all patients of the Safety Set who took trial medication and had at least 1 pain assessment after the first intake of trial medication. The FAS was the population of primary interest for the efficacy parameters.</p><p>The primary endpoints were analyzed by means of a mixed-effects model for repeated measures on the FAS (the primary analysis). The model included fixed effects of pooled sites (country), treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, baseline, and a patient-specific random effect. The primary analysis consisted of the contrasts of the individual cebranopadol doses vs placebo during the entire 12 weeks of the maintenance phase or during week 12 of the maintenance phase. To control the family-wise error rate, first the 400 &#x000b5;g cebranopadol arm was tested vs placebo. In case of significance, a Hochberg procedure to the 200 and 600 &#x000b5;g cebranopadol arms vs placebo was applied. Several sensitivity analyses were performed for the analysis of the primary endpoints, ie, multiple imputations such as placebo mean imputation/pattern mixture model with increasing delta, and more traditional methods such as Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and modified Baseline Observation Carried Forward (mBOCF). The additional efficacy endpoints were analyzed on the FAS in a descriptive manner only. The analysis of safety and tolerability parameters (eg, TEAEs, vital signs, safety laboratory, 12-lead ECG, COWS, and C-SSRS) was descriptive, and was performed on the Safety Set.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>This is the first human trial to demonstrate analgesic efficacy of cebranopadol in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic LBP. The population of patients enrolled in this trial provides a realistic representation of the clinical population of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic LBP, as shown by the demographic characteristics of the trial population, the proportion of patients in the subgroups (painDETECT and QTFC classification on spinal disorders), and the recorded baseline pain intensity levels. In addition, a substantial number of patients in this trial suffered from lumbar radiculopathy, which is the most common neuropathic pain syndrome experienced by patients with chronic LBP.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The baseline pain intensity levels were well balanced between all treatment arms. As reported before, the presence of a neuropathic pain component is associated with a higher pain intensity, greater numbers and severity of comorbidities, and reduced quality of life compared with nociceptive pain.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This became also apparent in this trial, with higher baseline pain intensity levels for patients scoring painDETECT positive.</p><p>Two primary efficacy endpoints were evaluated in this trial. Both primary endpoints were achieved, demonstrating analgesic efficacy of cebranopadol in chronic LBP. A statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement over placebo was demonstrated for all cebranopadol doses. Moreover, the analgesic effect was established quickly, with a numerical separation in pain intensity between cebranopadol and placebo during week 2 of the titration phase. These results are confirmed by the responder analysis, which showed that a higher percentage of patients in the 3 cebranopadol arms than in the placebo arm reported &#x02265;30% or &#x02265;50% of pain reduction at week 12 of the maintenance phase compared to baseline, both benchmarks being recommended to determine clinically important differences in pain intensity.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Tapentadol PR was included as an active comparator as it is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic pain, including chronic back pain. The estimated mean on the primary endpoints for tapentadol PR was within that of the 2 higher doses of cebranopadol thus confirming assay sensitivity of the trial and clinical relevance of the results.</p><p>When the presence or absence of a neuropathic pain component was taken into account by the use of the painDETECT questionnaire, clinically relevant differences to placebo were observed in painDETECT positive patients treated with cebranopadol 600 &#x000b5;g as well as for all patients scoring painDETECT negative and painDETECT unclear. Of note, the painDETECT questionnaire identifies patients with a likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in general, whereas this subgroup can be quite heterogeneous given that a variety of nerve-damaging stimuli affecting spinal nerve roots as well as peripheral nerves in tissues adjacent to the spine are likely to generate a neuropathic pain component. Also, subgroups were generally small and hence conclusions should be drawn with caution.</p><p>In addition to its analgesic activity, cebranopadol did show positive results for some of the additional efficacy endpoints of exploratory nature, including recommended key domains in chronic LBP such as physical functioning and sleep disturbance.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Cebranopadol treatment induced a reduction in the degree of disability in all active treatment arms compared to placebo, as measured by the ODI questionnaire. In addition to the unfavorable effects on physical functioning, chronic LBP is associated with disturbed sleep. Sleep disorders in people with chronic pain often do negatively affect mood, willingness to perform daytime activities, and even severity of perceived pain. Indeed, the association between poor sleep quality and pain might be bidirectional: pain disturbs sleep and sleep disturbance can enhance pain perception.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Persistent pain may lead to functional changes to the neural systems that regulate both sleep and pain, but the exact neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Results of this trial show that cebranopadol treatment improved the overall quality of sleep compared to placebo. In addition, a higher percentage of patients in the cebranopadol arms completing the trial rated their overall condition as very much or much improved compared to the placebo arm. These results clearly indicate that chronic pain has a huge impact on the general well-being and daily quality of life of patients. Not surprisingly, pain may affect the patient's psychological well-being, resulting in an increased risk of suicidal behavior<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and a high risk to experience anxiety and depression.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Consistent with its beneficial effect on chronic LBP, there is no evidence from results of the C-SSRS or HADS questionnaire that cebranopadol would increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behavior, or would have a detrimental effect on anxiety and depression.</p><p>In this trial, strong efficacy has been shown with cebranopadol over the 14-week treatment period. Moreover, higher efficacy was noted with increasing doses of cebranopadol. Overall, treatment with cebranopadol was safe at the tested daily doses of 200, 400, and 600 &#x003bc;g. However, higher doses led to higher treatment discontinuation rates with more than half of the discontinued patients in the 600 &#x000b5;g cebranopadol treatment arm. These were primarily because of TEAEs occurring during the 14-day titration phase, and may have been the result of the forced titration regimen imposed in this trial, resulting in doses being increased too quickly during the titration phase. As this was the first trial with cebranopadol in this patient population, the titration scheme was not yet optimized. This issue was not observed for the tapentadol treatment arm for which the established and well-tolerated titration scheme of the intake instructions of the marketed product was followed. The completion rate for the tapentadol treatment arm in this study was comparable to the results of the pooled analysis including data from three phase 3 studies in moderate-to-severe chronic osteoarthritis pain or LBP<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> with 56.5% tapentadol-treated subjects completing the trial. Data from more recent trials with cebranopadol in different indications provide new insights, suggesting that an optimized titration regimen of cebranopadol could decrease the discontinuation rates because of TEAEs, as well as the overall occurrence of TEAEs.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>A limitation of this trial was the use of a fixed-dose approach with predefined steps of dose increase and duration which impeded administration of optimal individual doses and length of titration. Given that the data from this trial with cebranopadol suggest its overall efficacy as well as higher efficacy with increasing doses, subsequent trials should focus on studying a more flexible dose regimen to potentially maximize the benefit for the individual patient throughout the trial.</p><p>In contrast to typical strong opioids, abrupt discontinuation of cebranopadol intake after up to 14 weeks of treatment did generally not result in withdrawal symptoms, as assessed using the COWS. Only few mild and single cases of moderate withdrawal symptoms were reported, and mild withdrawal symptoms were reported at similar frequencies in the 3 cebranopadol arms. Therefore, slow tapering off of the cebranopadol treatment seems not required.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This was the first clinical trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cebranopadol taken once daily in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic LBP, with and without a neuropathic pain component. Cebranopadol was effective at all tested doses, showing statistically significant differences from placebo for the primary endpoints. In addition, cebranopadol displayed other beneficial effects including improved sleep and functionality. In general, positive responses to treatment with cebranopadol and tapentadol were observed, irrespective of the presence or absence of neuropathic pain components in their chronic LBP. Cebranopadol in the tested dose range was safe. Higher cebranopadol doses led to higher treatment discontinuation rates which were primarily because of TEAEs occurring during the titration phase. Patients reaching the cebranopadol target doses presented with an acceptable tolerability profile. The incidence rate of most frequently reported TEAEs during the maintenance phase was &#x02264;10%. Although further optimization of the titration scheme to the optimal dose for each individual patient is essential, cebranopadol appears to be a new drug candidate with a novel mechanistic approach for the potential treatment of chronic LBP.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>Gr&#x000fc;nenthal GmbH funded and designed the trial, and analyzed and interpreted the data.
