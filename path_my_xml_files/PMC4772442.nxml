Given the strong association between post-surgery health behaviors and outcomes, aftercare intervention to address key behaviors appears to be a reasonable relapse-prevention strategy. As the burden of obesity rates increases in healthcare centers, an internet-based program appears to be a reasonable strategy for supporting bariatric surgery patients in the long term. The primary purpose of the current project is to develop and test the efficacy and perceived utility of APOLO-Bari.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a randomized control trial, which will be conducted in two hospital centers in the North of Portugal; it includes a control group receiving treatment as usual and an intervention group receiving the APOLO-Bari program for one year in addition to treatment as usual. A total of 180 male and female participants who underwent bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve or gastric bypass surgery) for 12 to 20&#x000a0;months will be recruited. Both groups will complete a similar set of questionnaires at baseline, every 4&#x000a0;months until the end of the intervention, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. Assessment includes anthropometric variables and psychological self-report measures. The primary outcome measure will be weight regain measured at the end of treatment, and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. The secondary aims are to test the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and to investigate psychological predictors and trajectories of weight regain. APOLO-Bari was developed to address the weight regain problem in the bariatric population by offering additional guidance to bariatric patients during the postoperative period. The program includes: (a) a psychoeducational cognitive-behavioral-based self-help manual, (b) a weekly feedback messaging system that sends a feedback statement related to information reported by the participant, and (c) interactive chat sessions scheduled with a trained psychologist in the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>APOLO-Bari may play an important role in broadening therapeutic reach to bariatric patients who would not otherwise have continuous support, with important implications for public health treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN37668662">ISRCTN37668662</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bariatric surgery</kwd><kwd>Internet intervention</kwd><kwd>Eating behaviors</kwd><kwd>Post-surgery interventions</kwd><kwd>Weight regain</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (PT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/MHC-PCL/4974/2012</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF/01219/2014</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (PT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/104159/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto-Bastos</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (PT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/104182/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramalho</surname><given-names>Sofia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e a Tecnologia (PT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/94490/2013</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bariatric surgery and its effect on weight loss</title><p>Long-term follow-up studies of bariatric surgery patients under treatment for severe obesity suggest that although most patients will achieve successful weight loss and weight maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a significant subgroup of patients regain weight in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite different studies reporting significantly different values, researchers estimate that approximately 30&#x000a0;% of patients experience long-term weight regain, although this value may be as high as 97&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent studies report that excessive weight regain (i.e., more than 25&#x000a0;% of the weight lost after surgery) is experienced by approximately 37&#x000a0;% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Weight regain appears to be a particular concern between 12 and 24&#x000a0;months after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] because this subgroup of patients presenting weight recidivism may find that the initial improvement of obesity-related comorbidities is mitigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although weight regain could result from physiological or anatomical factors, it is highly likely to result from the postoperative reemergence of maladaptive eating and lifestyle behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The greatest challenge for these patients may stem from a failure to embrace required lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other factors associated with poor outcomes include a lack of physical activity, low self-esteem, depression, or a low number of follow-up medical visits and postoperative self-monitoring behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, a growing body of literature suggests that poor outcomes can largely be predicted by the post-surgery reemergence or development of dysfunctional eating patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], such as patterns of uncontrolled or disordered eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], binge eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], grazing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or unhealthy food choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whereas anatomical factors may necessitate additional surgical intervention, the management of psychological or behavioral factors is primarily non-surgical, and the continuous monitoring of key factors is crucial for early detection of behaviors that place patients at risk of weight regain. In this context, aftercare interventions that aim to monitor risk behaviors systematically and improve adjustments to healthy lifestyles appear to be a reasonable relapse-prevention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strategies to optimize weight outcomes</title><p>Psychological or support group interventions have been suggested to promote weight loss and weight control after surgery, physical activity, and adherence to recommendations, resulting in less maladaptive eating behaviors and better psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Pre-operative interventions appear to have beneficial effects, including a reduction in body weight and anxiety or depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], binge eating, and maladaptive eating behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] before surgery. However, their impact on postoperative weight loss is questionable, as increased weight loss has not been associated with these interventions one year after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Other studies have investigated the role of postoperative psychological interventions and have shown promising results in reducing binge eating and eating behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], supporting weight loss or reversing the tendency to regain weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, a review and meta-analysis of postoperative behavioral management suggested that such interventions might optimize weight loss following surgery, although the results of some studies were not statistically significant. The conclusions of such studies should be interpreted with caution because they included small and heterogeneous samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The importance of post-surgery interventions has also been related to increased compliance with treatment requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], enhanced motivation and confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and increased awareness of problematic eating patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, greater weight loss was further associated with attending post-surgery meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Behavioral interventions appear to hold promise in inducing weight loss, but there is a lack of well-controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and most interventions require face-to-face sessions. Furthermore, given the genuine effect of bariatric surgery on weight loss that most patients experience immediately after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], research is needed to investigate the role of psychobehavioral interventions as an early prevention strategy for weight regain in the long term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Importance of using internet-based tools</title><p>With the demand of bariatric surgeries likely to continue its upward trend in the coming decades, the question remains as to how to continuously monitor and support these patients, particularly in the long term, in an environment with limited resources and rising rates of bariatric surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another major difficulty is the accessibility of specialized treatment centers, especially in areas with poor medical infrastructure. As obesity rates place an increasing burden on healthcare centers, the development of alternative healthcare delivery strategies is gaining attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Internet-based programs offer several advantages, including strong accessibility, portability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], easier dissemination and a reduced burden associated with clinical visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, such programs overcome the problem of isolation of users and allow access to relevant information when needed, which results in reduced costs for healthcare services and for users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. New technologies have been used to deliver psychological interventions with promising results for the treatment of binge eating disorder among obese and overweight patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and overweight children and adolescents, and to help bulimia nervosa patients control their eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Despite the potential of new technologies for behavioral assessment and interventions in bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], to date, no study has tested the effectiveness and feasibility of new technologies to prevent weight regain and optimize weight loss in bariatric patients. Nonetheless, much of what has been learned about effective strategies to support weight loss and weight maintenance can be incorporated into such interventions. Important strategies to be incorporated into internet-based interventions include self-monitoring to track a patient&#x02019;s key behaviors and personalized feedback on their progress. These interventions also represent a valuable communication channel between patients and health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>APOLO-Bari was developed to address the weight regain problem in the bariatric population by offering additional guidance, a monitoring system, clinical support, and a psychoeducational program to bariatric patients during the postoperative period. Such a program would also bridge the gap between the patient and clinical settings in a cost-effective format. APOLO-Bari is intended to work as an adjunct intervention to treatment as usual while investigating prospective predictors of weight regain. Although some commercial programs have been offered by manufacturers of bariatric surgery devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], to the best of our knowledge, this project is the first that aims to develop a specific, long-term internet-based program for bariatric surgery patients and to test its short- and long-term efficacy, utility and feasibility, and effectiveness as an aftercare strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention strategy of APOLO-Bari &#x02013; the rationale</title><p>After initial and dramatic weight change, patients can consolidate and build on their new and healthy lifestyles during the postoperative period. Handling post-surgery demands implies the need for behavioral modifications to engage in a healthy lifestyle and to comply with prescribed nutrition guidelines, especially at later follow-up times. However, as the follow-up time increases, the number of consultations with the medical team invariably decreases, resulting in a gap between health services and patients, particularly patients who might not otherwise have access to specialized treatment because of a lack of available resources outside of urban centers. With less frequent medical appointments over time, problematic behaviors might be overlooked and might not be clinically addressed, resulting in eventual weight regain.</p><p>The novelty and strength of the program APOLO-Bari are based on the ability to monitor key patient features related to outcomes continuously, to support and guide patients continuously, and to provide cognitive-behavioral-based support during the follow-up period, either to improve results or prevent poor outcomes. This approach attempts to narrow the gap between clinical services and patients by providing long-distance support to a large number of patients simultaneously, without the need for face-to-face sessions.</p><p>However, the disadvantages of internet-based programs have been noted; hence, the feasibility of the widespread utilization of such programs is called into question: weak adherence through the minimal use of internet resources, high rates of attrition, less education and less initial weight loss have been associated with dropout rates. In contrast, various studies have shown a positive association between log-in frequency and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To overcome some of these difficulties, APOLO-Bari includes interactive tools that are designed to enhance adherence to the program, such as a feedback messaging system that is based on the patient&#x02019;s input and a privileged channel (chat sessions) to contact a professional directly with specific concerns.</p><p>The APOLO-Bari components described here are not intended to replace necessary treatment or individual care targeting more complex problems when necessary (e.g., binge eating, bulimia nervosa, depression). Rather, the system enables the systematic monitoring of risk behaviors and refers patients to more intensive care when needed. APOLO-Bari is intended to be an adjunctive intervention to treatment as usual to improve outcomes by preventing weight regain and alerting the research and clinical team of patients who are at increased risk for weight regain.

Each of the three risk behaviors is divided into a symptomatic and non-symptomatic range and, each week, the system determines the pattern of change since the previous week: whether the participant improved (from symptomatic to non-symptomatic), remained unchanged and non-symptomatic (positive), remained unchanged and symptomatic (negative), or deteriorated (from non-symptomatic to symptomatic). A symptomatic state is indicated when a patient reports at least one of the key behaviors one or more times in the previous week. For this purpose, a comprehensive pool of feedback messages was formulated and integrated into the program. A total of 977 messages were pre-prepared, corresponding to the possible combinations of eating behaviors (3) and the possibilities of change (4) (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4). For each combination, 10 to 15 messages were formulated, to avoid the repetition of information. Furthermore, 112 messages were formulated for assessments in which no information was provided for the previous week (missing data). For each possible combination of symptomatic and non-symptomatic risk behavior, 14 different messages were formulated (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;14). One additional reminder message was included to motivate participants who missed a week&#x02019;s assessment. Each message is different and includes (a) praise for their progress, (b) a reinforcement statement, and (c) alerts or advice for alternative behavior in the case of deterioration.

Information about the hospital centers involved can be found on the current controlled trials website for our trial registration number.</p><p>All participants will be contacted by phone or during their medical appointment and screened for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients meeting these criteria will be invited for an orientation group session to inform them of the program and study procedures.

First, there will be a financial incentive: the participants will receive a &#x020ac;20 voucher to use in a main retail chain store after completing the program. To be eligible for this reward, the participants must complete at least 70&#x000a0;% of their required assessments. Second, the participants will be asked for two contact phone numbers or email addresses at registration. Third, reminder emails will be sent every time a questionnaire or activity is available.

To ensure concealment of allocation, the APOLO-Bari system will then automatically randomize (computer-generating random numbers) the participants on a 1:1 basis, matching for age, sex, and surgery type.</p><p>After randomization, intervention group members will receive full access to the three components of the APOLO-Bari program in their personal accounts. The intervention will last for 12&#x000a0;months, and a 6-month period will follow, with no program access possible.

Psychological symptoms assessed with self-report measures will also be tested. Differences between the intervention group and the control group will be tested at all assessment times. Additionally, midterm secondary outcomes will be tested as predictors of weight outcomes in later assessments.</p><p>Baseline (<italic>T</italic><sub>b</sub>), midterm (<italic>T</italic><sub>m4</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>m8</sub>), end of treatment (<italic>T</italic><sub>f</sub>), and follow-up (<italic>T</italic><sub>fu6</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>fu12</sub>) data on primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between the two groups. Repeated measures gathered for the intervention group during the feedback messaging system will be used to study the effect of behavior and psychological outcomes on weight. Repeated assessment enables testing of the course of relevant factors and their relation to weight.</p><p>Moderators and nonspecific predictor variables that can affect outcomes without stemming from the intervention are assessed at baseline (<italic>T</italic><sub>b</sub>); these variables include pre-surgery body mass index, type of surgery, sex, severity of general psychopathology, and frequency of maladaptive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistics</title><p>Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square tests will be used to analyze significant differences in the proportion of cases with weight regain and in specific outcome variables between the intervention group and the control group. Significant weight regain will be considered when higher than 5&#x000a0;kg. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier approach (together with the log-rank test) will be used to answer the main question of efficacy. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to explore differences between the participant groups for different key variables at various time points. The main effect for surgery type will be investigated. Variables such as log-in frequency, task submission, satisfaction with the program, socio-demographics, pre-intervention scores on self-report measures, and time since surgery will be tested as covariates and predictors of outcomes using Cox regression models. Relevant baseline differences will be included as covariates. Hierarchical linear models will be used to investigate different trajectories of relevant variables assessed from <italic>T</italic><sub>b</sub> to <italic>T</italic><sub>fu12.</sub> Hierarchical linear models are the models that best fit unbalanced designs with unequal number of observations (missing data) per subject. Self-report measures (for depression, impulsiveness, eating disorder and eating patterns, body image, and general distress) will be examined by conducting an analysis of covariance to explore interference with weight outcomes. Post-hoc comparisons will be conducted using Tukey&#x02019;s procedure.

The incremental cost-effective ratio will be calculated. Differences between the two intervention groups (control group and intervention group) in direct medical expenses related to the internet-based program include the time spent logged into the program for participants and therapists, the time that participants spend engaging in the activities recommended by the program, and the costs associated with data server maintenance and data storage. The value of the time spent in the program will be calculated by multiplying the time estimates by the median hourly wage of the therapists or of a population similar to the program participants. Time absent from work and contact with psychiatric, social, or general medical services will also be considered. Market values will be considered for this analysis.</p><p>Other expenses, such as those relating to the development of the internet application, programming costs, (psychoeducational) content development, and chat software are considered &#x02018;sunk costs&#x02019; and will not be included in the analyses because they are not expected to recur with dissemination of the program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Blinding and data access</title><p>Intervention and assessment are conducted exclusively in the APOLO-Bari program. The psychologist participating in the interactive chat sessions does not have access to the program information submitted by the participant. The statistician conducting the statistical analysis has not been involved in the implementation of the program. Treatment allocation has not been previously disclosed to the statistician.</p><p>Only the principal investigator and the statistician will have access to the final trial dataset. This is stated in the information for the participant sheet submitted to the ethical committee approval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Safety aspects and ethical considerations</title><p>The study is being conducted in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval from the ethical committees involved (Ethics Subcommittee for Life and Health Sciences, University of Minho; Ethics Committee for Health, Hospital of Braga; Ethics Committee for Health, Hospital Center of S&#x000e3;o Jo&#x000e3;o) were obtained and can be consulted found on the current controlled trials website for our trial registration number. Any trial modifications or the inclusion of new health centers as partners for data collection will be communicated to the ethical committees involved as well as to the trial registration organization. Participation in the research project is entirely voluntary. Participants are informed that their present or future medical treatment will not be affected by their decision to participate or not participate. Participants are informed that they can withdraw from the research project at any time without providing a reason. Participants are assigned a code number to maintain confidentiality. All personal data are stored and handled according to data protection principles. In practice, this arrangement means that the written material will be stored in secure locations, and data stored on the computer will be password protected and encoded (SSL technology) and regularly backed up. Additionally, any publication derived from the personal data will be presented in a way that ensures it is not possible to identify individuals. Communications via internet chat will be protected through encoding (SSL technology).</p><p>Our team also shares concerns regarding the identification (by our research team or internet program) of patients who might be under extreme distress. If so, the program or researcher will generate an alert, and the project coordinator will proceed to refer the patients to additional, more specific care in the medical center. Alerts will be generated if: (a) significant weight regain is experienced (&#x02265;10&#x000a0;kg since the beginning of intervention); (b) there are maladaptive eating behaviors for at least 3&#x000a0;months with a frequency of at least once a week. A participant under individual support may continue the program unless otherwise requested by the accompanying specialist.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to develop and test an internet-based intervention for long-term monitoring and support of bariatric patients. Although psychological interventions appear to have promising results in improving postoperative outcomes, no previous study has investigated alternative delivery strategies for weight regain prevention tools.</p><p>These interventions may play an important role in broadening the therapeutic reach to bariatric patients who would not otherwise have continuous support. An internet-based program format will overcome difficulties associated with the systematic assessment of health services and the addition of precise or additional guidance, clinical support, and a psych-educational program adapted to address the specificities of this population. Thus, APOLO-Bari is aimed at narrowing the gap between clinical services and patients in a cost-effective format, giving long-distance support to a large number of patients simultaneously, and allowing the allocation of intensive treatment for those in need. Furthermore, this project enables the collection of repetitive data and the study of fluctuations in the risk behaviors that precede weight regain. Targeting these variables in advance could be key for weight regain prevention.</p><p>As an important limitation of this study, internet access may not be evenly distributed across the bariatric population, particularly for those with lower socio-economic and educational levels. However, in 2014, 65&#x000a0;% of Portuguese citizens used the internet in the past 3&#x000a0;months, and approximately 58&#x000a0;% access the internet regularly, at least once a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, in 2013, approximately 42&#x000a0;% of the Portuguese population used the internet to seek health information, with rates likely to increase in the following years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although a growing number of individuals have regular internet access, we provide explanatory sessions in introducing the program, and most patients report that they are able to use such a simple and intuitive program.</p><p>Additionally, the self-reporting of weight is acknowledged as an important limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nonetheless, for the study of weight regain and weight loss as the primary outcome of our intervention, weight will be measured by the research team. Furthermore, intervention group participants will be instructed on how to measure their weight and advised not to provide information if their weight was not measured as instructed.</p><p>With variable outcomes, particularly long-term outcomes, systematic monitoring and long-term interventions may be critical to the long-term maintenance of weight loss after surgery. In parallel, developing cost-effective interventions to promote adjusted lifestyles and to prevent weight regain appears to be a reasonable approach. The APOLO-Bari study will investigate the role of a comprehensive program as an adjunct intervention to support and monitor patients in the long term following bariatric surgery.</p><p>Over the past decade, the digital revolution has provided novel ways for individuals to search for information and communicate. In fact, the digital age has led to alternative ways of accessing health information, monitoring and improving health, and communicating with healthcare partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Although the digital health revolution has shed light on alternative ways of delivering treatments, further research is needed to investigate their benefits and limitations. This project will add to the field of digital health by testing an adjunctive strategy to enhance weight loss outcomes of bariatric surgery in severely obese individuals and thus bridge the gap between patients and clinical settings. The results of this investigation may greatly affect the outcomes of surgical treatment for severe obesity and have important implications for public health treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>This is an ongoing trial that has not completed recruitment of patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSL technology</term><def><p>Secure Sockets Layer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>b</sub></term><def><p>baseline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>m4</sub></term><def><p>4-month midterm assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>m8</sub></term><def><p>8-month midterm assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>f</sub></term><def><p>final (end of treatment) assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>fu6</sub></term><def><p>6-month follow-up assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub>fu12</sub></term><def><p>12-month follow-up assessment</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EMC is the principal investigator of this project and is involved in every stage of the project from conception, including implementation and data acquisition, analysis, and submission for publication.
