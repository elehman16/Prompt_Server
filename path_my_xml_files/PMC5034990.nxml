INTRODUCTION</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>1.1. Hypertension</title><p>Hypertension is the most important chronic health problem (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is estimated that hypertension affects about one billion people, and the number will increase by 60% until 2025 (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). According to the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension, high blood pressure is defined when the systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg (18.7 kPa) or more, and/or level of diastolic blood pressure is 90 mmHg (12.0 kPa) or more, after repeated measurements. It can occur as isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension but it is usually case of elevated both systolic and diastolic pressure. Due to the changes that occur in the large arteries because of aging, systolic blood pressure after the age of 50 increases with every year of life by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.5 to 1 mmHg (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Most of the patients with hypertension have essential or primary hypertension with unknown cause, and in which the initially high blood pressure is the only manifestation of the disease. In other patients the hypertension is caused by disease of some other organs and therefore is referred to as secondary hypertension. The degree of clinical severity of hypertension is estimated based on the values of blood pressure and current changes in other organ systems (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic>For hypertension treatment today at all level of healthcare protection there are a lot of drugs based on different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic effects. Some of them are:</italic></p><p><bold>* Lisinopril:</bold> is a potent ACE inhibitor and a potent antihypertensives belonging to the third generation of ACE inhibitors. It represents a lysine analog of the enalapril, and unlike it is directly active. With such action it interferes with any component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system separately. From this derive all of its pharmacodynamics and therapeutic effects. It is used in treatment of hypertension and heart failure, as well as myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy prophylaxis (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p><bold>* Hydrochlorothiazide:</bold> is a diuretic from the group of thiazides. Its primary pharmacodynamics effect is as diuretic. The antihypertensives effect resulting from its diuretic effects and their direct consequences. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensives agent. Reduces the reabsorption of electrolytes in distal tubule of the kidney that increases urine output, reducing the volume of blood in the blood vessels and contributes to lowering blood pressure (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>* Our study confirmed high efficacy in the treatment of hypertension with the combination of ACE inhibitor Lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which provides an additional antihypertensives effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>2. Goals</title><p>Evaluate patients suffering from hypertension who were treated with a combination of Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide, in 5 health institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina with an emphasis on the effectiveness of it&#x02019;s antihypertensives effect. Determine the mean blood pressure values in the studied group patients by measuring blood pressure in the studied time period: two months (first, second and third measurement). Provide a cross section of the Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide antihypertensives effect based on three measurements</p><p>Identify the differences between the patients in our study in relation to gender, age and age groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>3. PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The data used in our study were obtained from the studies and analyzes carried out in 5 health care institutions at the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The study included 270 patients who underwent three consecutive medical examinations after being on Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Patients evaluated in our study underwent three examinations over a period of two months. The criterion for inclusion was hypertension. Every physician/doctor evaluated a group of patients. All doctors/physicians keep track of hypertension in a specially designed table. After collection, the data are converted into the group study which results we presented in tables and charts.</p><p>The necessary data for following Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide performance are collected on the basis of medical examinations and doctor&#x02019;s notes:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>History and status preasens;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Measuring blood pressure during the first, second and third examination;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maintaining records of adverse events during the three examinations;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Laboratory tests;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnostic tests.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The research results are presented in tables and charts by the number of cases, percentage, mean with standard deviation and range of values. Analysis of statistical significance of the differences is conducted by Pearson and Yates chi-square test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of all these tests with p&#x0003c;0.05 or the confidence level of 95% were considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed using the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics v19.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>4.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Our study included 270 patients. Review of gender structure of the sample indicated that women were slightly more prevalent with 165 or 61.1% cases compared to men with 105 or 38.9% of cases. The analysis of the sample according to the dose of Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide a 10 mg and 20 mg shows that the majority of respondents was necessary to introduce L/H a 20 mg (68.5%) while L/H a 10 mg was sufficient to regulate hypertension in 31.5% of respondents. This difference is attributed to the age of the respondents in the sample.</p><p>Analysis of the average systolic blood pressure during the first examination, the first control, and other controls showed a linear decrease and the difference between groups was statistically significant during the first and second measurement but not during third, which favors rapid action of the L/H. Analysis of the average diastolic blood pressure showed a linear decrease in the difference between the groups where there is a statistically significant difference in the first and second measurements.</p><p>The combination of ACE inhibitor Lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide provides an additional antihypertensives effect. Lisinopril is a potent ACE inhibitor, a potent antihypertensives belonging to the third generation of ACE inhibitors. It is used in treatment of hypertension and heart failure, as well as myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy prophylaxis (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic from the group of thiazides. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensives agent. It reduces the reabsorption of electrolytes in distal kidney tubule which consequently increases urine output, reducing the volume of blood in the blood vessels and contributes to lowering blood pressure (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The initial blood pressure during the first measurement averaged at 172.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 98.9 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. After one month of treatment with L/H a systolic blood pressure was reduced to an average of 153.8 mmHg and DBP to 87.7 mmHg. The reduction was also recorded during the third measurement, when the average systolic blood pressure was 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 81.8 mmHg. Total reduction in blood pressure in average was 32.8 mmHg for systolic and 17.1 mmHg for diastolic, which is consistent with previously published results. During treatment has been reported a total of 12 side effects, or in 12 cases (dry cough) of the total of 270 and these results are similar to those of which are reported in previous studies of Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide is because of that valuable therapy in the field of internal medicine. A study of this preparation confirmed its efficacy in the treatment of hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>6. CONCLUSION</title><p>Study was conducted on 270 patients in five health institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Criteria for introduction of L/H in therapy was newly discovered hypertension, hypertension that has not responded to previous treatment or could not be continued because of side effects. During treatment the patient&#x02019;s blood pressure, as the main indicator, was measured at the first examination of the patient, then the first control and the second follow-up examination. The average blood pressure in the first examination amounted to 172/98 mmHg, while in the first follow-up examination was 133/87 mmHg, and the second follow-up examination 140/81 mmHg. Based on these results we conclude that the L/H is effective drug in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.</p><p>Also was conducted evaluation of documented treatment adverse effects where it was found that there is no deviation from the previous study of treatment of hypertension with similar drugs. Data from this study indicate that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased after 8 weeks of treatment with L/H. Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide has proven as effective and safe antihypertensives drug in treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The total clinical efficacy was assessed as excellent which is interpreted as a reduction in blood pressure to the target value in most patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>&#x02022; Conflict of interest: none declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Antihypertensives effectiveness of low-dose Lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination</collab><article-title>A large multicenter study.
