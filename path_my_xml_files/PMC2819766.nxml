As a prerequisite for enrollment, subjects were required to have contact lens acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye, be in good health and to continue any pre-enrollment systemic medication regimens during the study. Attendance at all clinical study visits and completion of study questionnaires was also required. There were no restrictions to the currently employed contact lens care regimen, rewetting drop usage or lens type (planned replacement soft or GP).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included a history of allergy to any study product ingredient and current use of any topical eye medications (with the exception of rewetting drops or artificial tear products). Subjects who had modified their systemic medications within 30 days prior to enrollment were excluded as were subjects with significant active corneal, eyelid or anterior segment infection or inflammation.</p><p>The primary objective was to evaluate safety with the use of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra in contact lens wearers. A comparison to a currently available contact lens rewetting drop was included as a control. Safety was established by assessment of visual acuity, corneal staining, biomicroscopy examination and adverse events. The clinical study was performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>At the first screening visit (Visit 1 &#x02013; screening), after a subject&#x02019;s preliminary eligibility was established, demographic information, medical history and current usage of systemic medication and any topical ocular drops (including rewetting drops, artificial tears and Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [Allergan, Inc., Irvine CA, USA]) was recorded. Baseline measurements of safety parameters, including distance visual acuity with contact lenses and corneal staining score were recorded. Biomicroscopy findings (lids/eyelashes, cornea, and conjunctiva) were recorded as either normal or abnormal.</p><p>Subsequently, patients were randomly dispensed either Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra or Sensitive Eyes. Both the test and the control solutions were dispensed in 10 and 15 mL bottles with sterile closures and masked labeling supplied in prenumbered kits. Patients were educated in the correct administration of the drops and instructed to instill 1&#x02013;2 drops of the assigned lubricating eye drop in both eyes on a daily basis, approximately 15 minutes prior to contact lens insertion, at least one drop during the lens wear period and immediately following lens removal. Written instructions were provided.</p><p>Follow up visits (Visit 2 &#x02013; follow up) were conducted two weeks after the first screening visit. Results for distance visual acuity with contact lenses and corneal staining score were recorded. Any changes in biomicroscopy assessment of the lids, cornea, and conjunctiva were recorded. Biomicroscopy findings (lids/eyelashes, cornea, and conjunctiva) were also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Distance visual acuity</title><p>Contact lens visual acuity was measured for distance.

Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile when administered topically at least three times a day in conjunction with contact lens wear. Ocular assessments including visual acuity and corneal staining score showed no significant treatment-related changes and there were no serious ocular or systemic adverse events reported. The safety profile of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra was comparable to that of a currently marketed contact lens rewetting drop. These clinical findings add support for the use of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra by contact lens wearers.</p><p>These results provide contact lens wearers with increased confidence in the use of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra during lens wear for the treatment of contact lens-related dry eye. Given that dryness is the most frequent symptom in approximately 75% of contact lens wearers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-4-027">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-4-027">26</xref> and contact lens wear can increase the frequency and severity of pre-existing dry eye,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-4-027">25</xref> there is considerable opportunity for contact lens wearers to experience the relief of an effective dry eye therapy. Additional clinical benefits of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra in dry eye patients, namely, immediate patient comfort, enhanced lubrication and minimal blur on instillation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-4-027">27</xref> are likely to also apply to contact lens wearers. Conclusions drawn by Christensen and colleagues regarding the overall safety profile of an hydroxypropyl guar (HP-Guar)-containing lubricant eye drop in prior research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-opth-4-027">28</xref> add support to the findings of the current study.</p><p>Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra Lubricant Eye Drops is a new product in the Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> family of dry eye therapies. It is an aqueous solution comprising PEG (0.4%) and PPG (0.3%) as demulcents and incorporating the benefits of HP-Guar as a gelling agent. The above-mentioned ingredients have a history of use in ophthalmic preparations as well as contact lens care products and have demonstrated compatibility with the ocular surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-opth-4-027">28</xref> In addition, Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra includes borate and sorbitol as key ingredients. Sorbitol, a water soluble, nonionic compound, interacts with borate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-4-027">29</xref> to control viscosity in the bottle for optimal delivery in the eye. The presence of sorbitol facilitates the even distribution of the eye drop over the ocular surface upon instillation.</p><p>Ketelson and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-4-027">27</xref> demonstrated that this increase in viscoelasticity on-eye and between blinks correlates with a significant reduction in friction. This finding has implications for contact lens wear whereby the reduction in friction between the lens and the lids has the potential to improve lens-wearing comfort. Similar reductions in friction have been reported by Meyer and colleagues in connection with a similar HP-Guar containing ocular lubricant from within the Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> family.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-opth-4-027">30</xref> In addition, a study involving contact lens wearers showed that the use of an HP-Guar-containing ocular lubricant was associated with improved comfortable lens-wearing times and an improved overall lens-wearing experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-4-027">31</xref></p><p>The success of contact lens wear depends on the integrity and stability of the tear film. While Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra is not considered to be used a re-wetting solution for contact lens wearers, Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra is designed to rebuild the tear film for long-term lubrication and extended protection of the ocular surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-4-027">22</xref> A good tear film covering a contact lens is thought to provide comfort, vision, lubrication, prevent surface drying, remove debris, and counter infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-4-027">6</xref> Chalmers and Begley<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-4-027">8</xref> claim that tear film instability is present in almost all contact lens wearers with or without symptoms indicating that the benefits of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra can apply to asymptomatic as well as symptomatic lens wearers.</p><p>Moreover, an HP-Guar-containing solution reduced aqueous tear evaporation 30 and 60 minutes after application in dry eye patients. This antievaporative effect may also be achieved in normal eyes when in low relative humidity environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-opth-4-027">32</xref> and may therefore offer further advantages to contact lens wearers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra is recommended for the temporary relief of burning and irritation due to dryness of the eye. Use of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra Lubricating Eye Drops in successful contact lens wearers was not associated with any significant change in corneal staining or distance visual acuity and was not associated with any adverse events. While additional clinical evaluation should be conducted to further substantiate the compatibility of Systane Ultra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in this subject group, this clinical study provided evidence of safety and compatibility of Systane<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra Lubricant Eye Drops in contact lens wearers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This clinical study was funded by a grant from Alcon Laboratories, Inc., USA.
