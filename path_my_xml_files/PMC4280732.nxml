In recent years, the rate of CS has been increasing irregularly. Lack of appropriate knowledge and attitude among couples plays a major role in this regard. This study tried to compare the effects of a childbirth training workshop on knowledge, attitude, and delivery method.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The present study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in four stages on 180 subjects referring to Isfahan health care centers in three groups of mothers (alone), couples (mothers and their respective partners), and control.

This rate reaches 99% in some hospitals, which is very high, compared to national mean rate, and should be noted.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 10-15% of deliveries at the most as the acceptable rate of CS.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Based on modern midwifery science, CS with no indication imposes high costs to families and brings about problems for the hospitals with regard to personnel and medical equipments,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and influences the quality of life.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, its mortality rate is notably higher than in vaginal delivery.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] CS results in more acute and frequent complications including the risk of unconsciousness, puerperal infection and high hemorrhage,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] postpartum depression,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and birth of preterm infants,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] compared to vaginal delivery. Generally, the mortality rate is fourfold to fivefold more in CS compared to vaginal delivery. The mortality rate is 2.1 in vaginal delivery; 5.9 in elective CS (risk ratio = 2.84), and 18.2 in emergency CS (risk ratio = 8.48) out of 100,000 cases.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] One of the reasons that plays a major role for the high CS rate is clients&#x02019; own requests,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which is due to lack of knowledge about the trends of vaginal delivery and CS.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Planning prepares the pregnant woman and her spouse for facing delivery and reduces their concerns.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] As marital life is a common life, active cooperation and participation of the spouses in fertility is essential.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Participation of the men, who are strategy and decision makers in the family unit and society, is less observed in strategies related to lowering maternal mortality. They have no access to the information which help them make an informed decision and protect their spouses&#x02019; as well as their own health.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In maternal health promotion, men play a specific role and are a part of problem solving, although they were considered as an obstacle in the past.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Encouragement, involvement, and education of the men concerning stages of vaginal delivery, the advantages and disadvantages of different modes of delivery, and convincing them to transfer the data to their spouses affect pregnant women's knowledge, attitude, and practice.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, the root of women's negative attitude is their experiences of previous vaginal deliveries, concerns and depression, unpleasant memories of their childhood, and their difficult socioeconomic conditions.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Education is an activity through which the individuals increase their knowledge or change their methods of thinking and behavior.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Educational programs and selection of educational methods should be consistent with conditions, efficiency, applicability, and learners&#x02019; interest. One of the common methods of education is workshop method.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Workshop education is one of the advantages of group education, which is used for learners&#x02019; extracurricular programs and promotion of their families&#x02019; knowledge and participation.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Methods such as discussion, role play, and group work are selected based on their goals. In workshop education and discussion sessions, all members equally participate.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The Ministry of Health has tried to increase mothers&#x02019; knowledge in the past 5 years through different ways.

Sample size was calculated to be 25 subjects in each group, but was increased to 30 considering possible dropouts (&#x003b1; =0.05, &#x003b2; =0.1). Convenient random sampling was conducted in 18 health care centers in three groups: intervention group of mothers alone, intervention group of couples, and control. For random allocation of the subjects, the sequence of subjects&#x02019; allocation to either of the above-mentioned groups was made by draw as mothers, couples, and control.</p><p>The subjects were allocated to the related group based on their sequence of arrival to clinic during sampling and the groups were completed in number. A total of 90 couples attended the study (<italic>n</italic> = 30 randomly assigned to each group). Inclusion criteria were being primiparous in 26-32 weeks of gestational age, spouses&#x02019; literacy, having adequate physical and physiological health to actively attend the workshop, and absence of the following: Severe midwifery problems related to pregnancy, any baseline specific diseases, any diagnosable contraindication for CS during pregnancy, any psychological diseases, and an unexpected pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were absenteeism of the pregnant women or their spouses in educational sessions in the study groups, no complement of the questionnaire, occurrence of a specific disease or problem contraindicating subjects&#x02019; attendance in the study, and the need for a complete bed rest. Data were collected by a questionnaire that was completed during four stages (before intervention, immediately after intervention, 1 month after intervention, and within 6 weeks postpartum). This questionnaire contained three sections. The first section included eight fertility and personal demographic questions, i.e., mother's age, spouse's age, mother's occupation, spouse's occupation, mother's education, spouse's education, gestational age in weeks, and mode of conducted delivery (for postpartum stage). The second section contained 24 four-point questions on knowledge. Knowledge score was calculated by the points scored by the subjects for the correct answers to the questions in the questionnaire. Correct answers were given one point and wrong answers were given zero.</p><p>The third section contained 29 attitude questions scored on five-point Likert scale. Content validity of the tool was checked. The initial questionnaire was modified by using valid references and texts and through supervision of the supervisors and approval of 15 experts of medical and midwifery education, and its validity was confirmed. Reliability of the tool was confirmed by split-half method in a pilot study on 30 subjects (not attending the study) and through calculation of Cronbach's alpha for questions on knowledge (&#x003b1; =0.83) and attitude (&#x003b1; =0.76).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The subjects were explained about the design of research, method of education, and confidentiality of their data as well as the goal of study, and were asked to sign a written consent to enter the study.</p><p>The subjects in each group were invited to attend the educational workshop. The workshop was held in three 4-h sequential weekly sessions in groups of 30 members separately.</p><p>Lecture method, questions and answers, role play, problem solving, and educational pamphlets were used to teach educational materials to promote subjects&#x02019; knowledge and group dynamicity, as well as to attain the highest participation of the subjects. Educational content included issues on couples&#x02019; communication, parental role, the role of the spouse in mother's selection of delivery mode, attendance of the spouse or a relative at delivery stages, childbirth fear, delivery pain, delivery mechanism, medicational pain relief techniques and their effects, non-medicational pain relief methods, advantages and disadvantages of CS and vaginal delivery, indications and contraindications of CS, hemorrhage and infection after every mode of delivery, postpartum sorrow and depression, mother&#x02013;infant attachment, breast feeding, and infants&#x02019; intelligence, growth, and development. The control group received conventional and routine education during maternal care by the midwives in health care centers, gynecologists, and their other relatives. Stages one to four of the questionnaire complement for the subjects in the study groups were conducted before intervention at the beginning of the first educational workshop session and after intervention at the end of the last educational workshop session, 1 month after intervention, and 6 weeks after delivery, respectively. After the delivery stage, the details of delivery mode were asked and recorded in the questionnaire. All these four stages were conducted for the control group in the same time intervals. Questionnaires related to couples were given to pregnant women in the intervention groups of mothers alone and control group during all stages and were collected after complement by the couples.</p><p>Data were analyzed by Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and one-way ANOVA through SPSS version 15.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Mean (SD) of female subjects&#x02019; age in mothers alone group was 25.83 (2) years, in the group of couples was 25.93 (2) years, and in control group was 30.53 (2) years.

The present study showed that holding organized educational programs for pregnant women and couples could lead to formation of a positive attitude in pregnant women through knowledge transfer and spouses&#x02019; emotional support, and consequently, a reduction in the rate of CS. No similar study had been conducted prior to the present study to educate the couples simultaneously. Evidence shows that the related studies were conducted either on just pregnant women alone or on couples (only one study). In the present study, the levels of men's and women's knowledge about and attitude toward delivery modes and their advantages and disadvantages were low before intervention in the three groups of mothers alone, couples, and control, possibly due to inefficiency of the education provided in health care centers. There was a significant difference between knowledge and attitude scores of men and women in the study groups and control before and after educational intervention. Mean scores of men's and women's knowledge and attitude in the three groups of couples, mothers alone, and control increased after intervention, respectively, but this effect was more in couples and mothers alone groups compared to the control group. It should be noted that scores of knowledge and attitude were more in the group of couples than mothers alone group. It can be concluded that education was effective on promotion of women's and their spouses&#x02019; levels of knowledge and attitude. The education provided in the present study was more effective compared to the conventiona l education that is often imparted in health care centers for just the mothers as an official routine to be recorded in their medical files. Higher scores of men's and women's knowledge and attitude in the group of couples can be attributed to the fact that attendance of women accompanied with their spouses and mutual consultation could have increased couples&#x02019; motivation to learn educational material and have more appropriate function. Besharati <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in a study on 80 pregnant women in Rasht, Iran, could increase their scores of knowledge about and attitude toward delivery modes. Sharifirad <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in a study on 88 pregnant women and their spouses in Isfahan, could increase women's and men's knowledge about and attitude toward delivery modes by holding just one educational session for the pregnant women's spouses, which is consistent with the present study. In the present study, men's mean scores of knowledge were lower than women's mean scores in all three groups before intervention, possibly due to lower access of men to maternal education held in health care centers. Mortazavi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported poor level of knowledge about pregnancy problems among 77% of men. Mortazavi, in two other studies on men's participation in maternal care, showed that although men were interested in participating in maternal care, their poor awareness of appropriate health behavior and very low knowledge about pregnancy problems and delivery acted as a major obstacle in occurrence of their supportive behavior.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Another study reported that from women's viewpoint, men's participation in maternal care and delivery was essential, acceptable, and possible.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Ghafarifard <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Tofighi Niaki <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Rahimi Kian <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hosseini <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Direkvand <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are among the other similar consistent studies on the effect of education on women's and their spouses&#x02019; knowledge.</p><p>Contrary to the present study results, which showed a significant association between subjects&#x02019; education and the attitude change, Toghyani found a significant effect of maternal and pregnancy education given on pregnant women's attitude.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In another study, it was shown that the women who had undergone education had the same negative attitude toward vaginal delivery as before the study and selected CS (by threefold to sixfold) as their favorite mode of delivery,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] possibly due to the differences in the effect of educational contents on emotional domain and the adopted educational method. In these two studies, it should be noted that a slight increase in the levels of women's and men's knowledge and attitude in the control group could have resulted from subjects&#x02019; curiosity and personal search to find the answers to questions, followed by reviewing the questionnaire. Anyhow, this increase in knowledge and attitude is not as much as that in the study groups. Also, the changes in levels of knowledge and attitude had an ascending trend in all three groups immediately after intervention, 1 month after intervention, and after delivery, compared to before intervention. Therefore, it can be concluded that storage of information and attitude change remained until after delivery. Rate of vaginal delivery was high in mothers alone, couples, and control groups in that order, which showed a significant difference between the study groups (mothers alone and couples) and the control group. Number of vaginal deliveries in the couples group was one case (3.3%) less than that in mothers alone group, possibly due to a higher level of education, which consequently led to higher economic status, more referrals to private offices, as well as harder attitudes to be changed among the subjects in this group. Khorsandi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] could increase the rate of vaginal delivery after educating the women in intervention group, compared to control, which is consistent with the present study. Besharati <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] TofighiNiaki <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Ajh <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] RahimiKian <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Sharifi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] obtained results consistent with the present study. Contrary to the present study results, Ghafari <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] could neither increase the rate of vaginal delivery nor decrease CS despite promotion of subjects&#x02019; knowledge and attitude in the study group, possibly due to the method of education and lack of spouses&#x02019; attendance. Farzan <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in a study on CS and the related factors in governmental and private hospitals of Isfahan, reported the rate of conducted CS as 73.6%, which is consistent with the rate of CS obtained in our control group (73.3%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Generally, the results obtained in this study show the positive effect of workshop education.
