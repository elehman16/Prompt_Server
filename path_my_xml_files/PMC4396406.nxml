In each dosing group, six subjects received Iosimenol 340 and two subjects received placebo. Safety was assessed by physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiography, and laboratory tests. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study up to 14 days after dosing. Blood samples were collected from 10&#x02009;min before until 48&#x02009;h after the start of dosing and urine samples were collected from 15&#x02009;min before until 96&#x02009;h after the start of dosing. Iosimenol was quantified in plasma and urine by measuring iodine concentrations with X-ray fluorescence. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess iosimenol biotransformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean half-lives (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation [SD]) of iosimenol were 0.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08&#x02009;h (10.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8&#x02009;min) and 2.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.32&#x02009;h for distribution and terminal elimination phases, respectively.

More than 80 million doses of iodinated intravascular CM were administered in 2003 (<xref rid="bibr2-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The molecular structure of these compounds has undergone significant changes since their introduction in clinical practice, with changes being aimed primarily at increasing tolerability. Most modern CM are non-ionic (i.e. they do not dissociate in solution), but vary with regard to iodine content and physicochemical properties. They are all based on tri-iodinated benzene molecules and are either mono- or dimeric (i.e. based on one or two benzene rings). The viscosity and, in particular, the osmolality of CM has been considered as important for renal tolerance (<xref rid="bibr3-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr6-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The osmolality of monomeric CM is higher than that of the dimeric CM, which can be formulated as iso-osmolar relative to human plasma (approximately 290 mOsm/kg) at concentrations suitable for clinical use (<xref rid="bibr7-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Visipaque&#x02122; (iodixanol) (GE Healthcare; Amersham, United Kingdom) is currently the only iso-osmolar, dimeric CM commercially available for intravascular use. The viscosity of iodixanol, however, is considerably higher than that of most other CM, making it less suited for injection in very thin catheters (<xref rid="bibr3-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and it has been suggested that the high viscosity to some degree might counteract the beneficial effects of the low osmolality (<xref rid="bibr1-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Iosimenol 340 injection is a non-ionic, dimeric CM, under development for use in cardiac angiography. It is iso-osmolar but exhibits a lower viscosity than iodixanol at the same concentration (<xref rid="bibr9-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

For the highest dose group, mean plasma levels declined to less than 1.0% of the dose in total plasma volume 8&#x02009;h after administration. Plasma levels for the two lower dose groups were quantifiable up to 3 and 4&#x02009;h post-administration only. Individual differences in plasma concentrations showed an approximately two-fold inter-subject variability. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0284185114534414">Fig. 1</xref>, mean plasma concentration <italic>versus</italic> time curves suggest a dose-proportional increase. No urine was collected during the 2 to 4&#x02009;h interval from two subjects. Most of the injected iosimenol was excreted renally within the first few hours after administration. Six hours after dosing, 76.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.4% of iosimenol (over all concentrations) was recovered in urine, with 89.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.4% after 24&#x02009;h and 90.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.4% after 96&#x02009;h.

The elimination rate was independent of dose. C<sub>max</sub> was reached within 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;min after the beginning of dosing, with the exception of two subjects where C<sub>max</sub> was observed 5&#x02009;min after dosing.

The 95% confidence intervals of the slope parameters for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02192;t</sub> were all between 0.80 and 1.25, which is consistent with the assumption of a dose-proportional increase within the tested dose range of 0.5&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;mL equivalent to approximately 0.2&#x02013;1.0 gI/kg.

Three subjects, one in the 0.5 gI/kg and two in the 1.0 gI/kg dose groups, received medical treatment (anti-histamines or corticosteroids treatment). All AEs resolved without sequelae before the end of the study. No AEs occurred in the placebo group. Most AEs (56%) occurred on the day of treatment and were of short duration. Twelve subjects reported a feeling of warmth (coded in MedDRA as &#x0201c;feeling hot&#x0201d;), none reported pain, and five subjects reported rash and pruritus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0284185114534414">Table 3</xref>). The pulse rate increased slightly with dose immediately after dosing, but the observed changes in vital signs were not considered to be of clinical significance. There also were no clinically relevant changes in ECG morphology, atrioventricular conduction or ventricular repolarization. QTc prolongation &#x02265;30&#x02009;ms were evenly distributed between subjects that received treatment and placebo. Two subjects had QTc prolongation &#x02265;60&#x02009;ms, one after receiving placebo and one after receiving Iosimenol 3.0&#x02009;mL/kg.

With a consequent direct proportionality between the concentration of iodine and the concentration of iosimenol, pharmacokinetic calculations could therefore be based on measurements of iodine concentrations. Iosimenol 340 showed pharmacokinetic characteristics very similar to those of other available CM, such as iohexol, iopentol, ioversol, iodixanol, or iomeprol (<xref rid="bibr11-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr16-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Plasma concentrations of iosimenol increased dose proportionally and showed only little inter-subject variability. Maximal serum concentrations were detected 1&#x02013;5&#x02009;min after the beginning of dosing. The mean distribution half-life was approximately 10&#x02009;min. Reported variations between approximately 10 and 30&#x02009;min can, with such short alpha half-lives, be expected due to differences in the experimental set-up, primarily injection rates and sampling time-points. The concentration-time curves for iosimenol demonstrated characteristics of a first-order elimination process from plasma. Iosimenol was cleared from plasma at a rate similar to creatinine; therefore, creatinine clearance may be expected to be predictive for CL<sub>R</sub> of iosimenol. Approximately 72&#x02013;83% of the administered dose was recovered in urine within 6&#x02009;h, similar to the proportion reported for other CM (<xref rid="bibr11-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The mean recovery rate was somewhat reduced by an outlier in the highest dose group, for whom the calculated recovery was only 42.2% after 6&#x02009;h and was consistently low at all time-points. This was most likely due to incomplete urine collection. Taking into account losses in urine collection, the small proportion of extra renal excretion known from other iodinated CM and the limitations of the analytical method, the estimated recovery after 4 days indicates complete excretion (<xref rid="bibr12-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Similarly to previous findings in animals, iosimenol was not metabolized in humans (<xref rid="bibr10-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This lack of biotransformation is comparable to that reported for iodixanol administration (<xref rid="bibr11-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There were no clinically relevant findings from laboratory tests, ECG, or other monitoring of vital signs. The increase in heart rate in the highest dose group immediately after dosing (10.2 beats per minute) is comparable to what has been described in the literature (<xref rid="bibr17-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). AEs observed after administration of iosimenol were mild or moderate, and were transient. The most frequently experienced AE was a feeling of warmth (12 subjects), followed by rash and pruritus (five subjects), and headache and abnormal taste (two subjects each). The nature of AEs also seems similar to those observed with other CM (<xref rid="bibr18-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Overall all three doses of Iosimenol 340 were well tolerated and larger studies can be justified. In summary, the pharmacokinetic properties of Iosimenol 340 are similar to those of other currently used CM, confirming findings in preclinical testing (<xref rid="bibr10-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr16-0284185114534414" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>There are potential weaknesses of the trial. As this was the first human experience with the compound, focus was on exploring the pharmacokinetic profile and gaining necessary experience to ensure adequate subject safety in larger comparative trials. The sample size was limited and there was no active control. Definite conclusions regarding the safety profile of iosimenol are therefore limited by the nature of the trial. The trial only included healthy male volunteers. Although no gender differences are expected with this type of compound, inclusion of both men and women would have been preferable.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented demonstrate that iosimenol is well tolerated and safe to use in healthy human subjects, exhibiting an adverse event profile similar to that of other commonly used CM. Iosimenol is not metabolized, its distribution is exclusively extracellular, it is cleared by glomerular filtration and is eliminated by renal excretion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Suresh Mallikaarjun (Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) and Nobuhiro Ikei and Yuka Amou (Otsuka International Asia Arab Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for their insightful comments and assistance.
