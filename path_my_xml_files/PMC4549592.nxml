This study tested the extent to which a 12-week OT-CBSM intervention improved perceived activity performance and satisfaction as evidenced by occupational performance and QoL among the participants treated for MPC. In the current study, we found that participation in our OT-CBSM intervention was associated with significant improvement in activity performance and satisfaction level for the activity, which is important for the participant. Additionally, daily living activity training caused improvement in activity performance and satisfaction level. Also, CBSM and regular group participation can help stress management. Several studies<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> have attempted to address this disparity with different cancer groups and suggest that the participant may maximize the impact of occupational performance by activity participation and cognitive behavioral therapy. Some studies<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> documented the effects of OT on occupational performance, efficacy of stress management interventions in reducing distress, and the negative effect as well as improving global QoL among various cancer populations. Most of these studies have been conducted primarily among population with breast cancer and localized prostate cancer.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, some studies<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> have shown the effectiveness of CBSM interventions in improving, coping, and management skills among men with prostate cancer. In addition, a study reported<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> that male participating in stress management intervention improved across several indices, including mental health and perceived control, and reduced interpersonal conflict and distress associated with cancer-related intrusive thoughts.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These studies suggested that rehabilitation interventions on activity participation and stress management are beneficial in this population. According to Zhou&#x02019;s et al<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and Traeger et al&#x02019;s<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> 10-week CBSM studies, stress management interventions may improve QoL in males treated for localized prostate cancer. These studies suggested that the sequelae of prostate cancer treatment appears to have impact on QoL despite the fact that males indicate being distressed and bothered by cancer related impairments. Several study<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> have attempted to address this disparity, and suggested that men may minimize the impact of prostate cancer on their daily life. We know that individuals who have problems with participation in daily living activities show negative effects and self-image problems with decreased coping skills.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Thus, it also may be true that our findings on OT intervention, which include activity training with cognitive behavioral stress management skill education may improve physical role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning and reduce fatigue, dyspnea and insomnia, which may affect activity performance and satisfaction from the view of OT as evidenced by occupational performance and QoL. Consistent with previous studies<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in localized prostate cancer, we found that a 12-week OT-CBSM intervention lead to significantly greater improvements in occupational performance and global QoL of participants with MPC relative to controls. This suggests that our OT-CBSM intervention adequately addressed the global QoL needs and properly targeted activity participation. Our current findings expand prior work<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and suggest that OT-CBSM interventions can improve QoL among participants with MPC. effects of OT-CBSM intervention on prostate specific health related QoL. We found that men who were randomized to our OT-CBSM intervention demonstrated significant improvements in perceived hormone-therapy related problems such as urinary symptoms (limitation of activities due to urinary system, need to remain close to toilet, sleep deprivation due to urinary system), bowel system symptoms (limitation of activities due to bowel system), and treatment related symptoms (hot flushes) from the pre-intervention period to the post-intervention period. These changes were associated with some studies in the literature that shows the positive effects of activity participation and CBSM on therapy related symptoms and health related QoL.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although our hypotheses were supported statistically,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> week period of OT-CBSM training and the small sample size gives a sense of pilot study which we thought is the most important limitation of our study. For further studies longer OT-CBSM training period in bigger sample size is recommended. Also, the individuals that participated in our study were psychologically healthy and have no significant cognitive impairment, which limits the generalizability of our findings to more physically and psychologically compromised MPC populations. Although the CG participants recieved all the education material in written format, the lack of control at home is another limitation of the study.</p><p>According to the current literature,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> CBSM helps to reduce levels of stress in the MPC population. We suggest that in additional to the current literature on the effects of CBSM in MPC, OT-CBSM intervention can modify activity participation efficacy, which is the major component of being healthy from the view of ICF on one hand and that improvements in occupational performance are associated with improved QoL on the other. In this study, activity performance and satisfaction, which are a direct indication of occupational performance are improved with an increase in QOL.</p><p>In conclusion, OT-CBSM improves occupational participation, which helps to improve the QoL of patients with MPC. Occupational therapy experiences can be used in the development of a clinical practice guideline on the role of OT in assisting individuals with MPC undergoing hormone therapy. It is essential that future studies may include more individuals with different types of cancer to address the long-term impact of OT on occupational performance, QoL, and disease processes to establish the clinical significance of the benefits of OT among growing number of individuals treated for cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Ayd&#x00131;n Meric, Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University, Hacettepe, Turkey, for his valuable assistance in the statistical analysis of the data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
