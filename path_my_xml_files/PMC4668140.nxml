relation to the sleeping positions of the experimental subjects. [Subjects and Methods]
The subjects for this study were twenty randomly selected males and females from K
University. Measurements were taken in the supine position at three different pillow
heights: 0&#x02005;cm, 5&#x02005;cm, and 10&#x02005;cm. Pulmonary functions (vital capacity, tidal volume,
inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory reserve volume) were evaluated using a Fit
mate. [Results] These findings suggest that a pillow height of 5&#x02005;cm makes a significant
difference in vital capacity (VC). When the three pillow heights were compared,
significant differences were seen between 0&#x02005;cm and 5&#x02005;cm, and between 5&#x02005;cm and 10&#x02005;cm, in
terms of vital capacity for the pulmonary functions among the three positions.
[Conclusion] In conclusion, changing the positions of the subjects produces changes in
pulmonary functions. The greatest change occurred in the 5&#x02005;cm pillow height. Presumably,
ventilation is affected by the body structures. The results will provide objective data to
establish the most suitable positions for stroke patients when they perform respiratory
exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Pillow</kwd><kwd>Height</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Humans spend roughly one-third of their lives sleeping. Sufficient sleep helps reinvigorate
the body and mind, while insufficient sleep causes fatigue and disturbs our daily lives.
Lack of sleep causes symptoms like being in daze throughout the day, lows levels of
concentration, and slower speeds in performing tasks<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, restful sleep is essential for humans to live quality
lives and to enhance their health.</p><p>While sleep is affected by internal physical factors, it is also affected by external
factors, such as bedrooms, pillows, and beds. In particular, research reports that pillow
height and size is closely related to quality sleep<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a reclining position, pillows of appropriate height support the
body and head in a stable and natural condition, facilitating various bodily movements that
occur during sleep. However, when people use pillows of inappropriate height, blood
circulation in the neck is hindered, thereby increasing the risk of neurological disorders,
such as cerebral hemorrhage. The use of an ill-suited pillow during the long hours of sleep
can be counterproductive to rest and recovery from fatigue, the purpose of sleep. Indeed, it
may actually increase fatigue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reiterer
et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that hyperflexion in the
cervical spine in a reclined position can block the flow of air. Meanwhile, Beni Solow et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that increased cervical
region height can inhibit the in-flow of air by hindering the process of securing the
airway. Ultimately, the height of the pillow is a major factor influencing lung
capacity.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated the respiratory function of normal individuals in a
supine position. For example, Townsend<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>
stated that a reclining position causes blood congestion in the pulmonary blood vessels as
abdominal organs pressure the diaphragm toward the head and the venous return increases; in
this situation, lung volumes are relatively reduced. Allen et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in a reclining position, the amount of blood
in systemic circulation, which moves to pulmonary circulation, increases. This scenario
decreases the volume of the thorax, and abdominal contents press the diaphragm, leading to
labored breathing. As a result, the overall pulmonary function is reduced. Morgan et
al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that a reclining position
weakens back muscles, which subsequently reduces lung capacity. In addition, Song et
al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and Hong et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that normal individuals in a lying
position showed an overall larger increase in lung capacity than those in a standing
position. In terms of respiratory competence in a lying position, this finding indicates
that pulmonary function is reduced due to changes in physical structures and the effects of
gravity.</p><p>Through this body of research, it becomes clear that a number of studies have focused on
lung capacity according to postural changes in a lying position, but few have considered
lung capacity according to pillow height. Therefore, this study aimed to obtain concrete and
objective data on changes in lung capacity according to pillow height.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 20 university students attending N University in Cheonan, Chungnam.
The subjects were selected from among those who had no particular history of lung diseases,
had no accompanying damage, such as congenital deformation of the chest, and had not
received any particular treatment to improve pulmonary functions.</p><p>The subjects understood the purpose of this study and consented to participate in it. This
study was approved by the International Review Board of the Korea Nazarene University and
was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The
general characteristics of both groups are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subjects (n = 20)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.7 &#x000b1; 1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">171.7 &#x000b1; 5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.5 &#x000b1; 4.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.</p><p>In this study, the subjects lay down on a bed within a treatment room maintained at an
average temperature of 20&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. They relaxed in order to encourage expansion of the thorax and
movement of the abdominal walls. In addition, a curtain was drawn over the subjects to help
them maintain psychological stability. The subjects straightened out their legs on the bed
and kept their head and trunk straight. After they rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the supine
position without a pillow, their pulmonary function was measured. After this process, the
height of the pillow was changed. The subjects first lay on a pillow that was 5&#x02005;cm high and
then on a pillow that was 10&#x02005;cm high.</p><p>If a subject complained of fatigue or dizziness during respiration measurement, a break was
taken and the exercise resumed some time later. Prior to the measurement, the tester taught
each subject the proper method for respiration measurement 2 or 3 times in order to ensure
that the subject was comfortable performing it.</p><p>Pulmonary function of the participants was measured in a sitting position using a tool
called Fitmate (COSMED, Sri, Italy). To ensure accurate measurements, the tester explained
and demonstrated the exercise to each subject beforehand. Both the experimental and control
groups were instructed to use the mouthpiece and to block the nostrils during the
measurement so that air was neither inhaled nor exhaled through the nose. Starting from
exhalation, subjects slowly exhaled to maximum level following the tester&#x02019;s signal and then
slowly inhaled; tidal volume (TV), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve
volume (ERV), inspiratory capacity (IC), and volume capacity (VC) were measured at this
time<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data was analyzed using the SPSS Version 12.0 program for Windows. To compare and analyze
chest mobility and pulmonary function in relation to position, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed. For post-analysis, to show differences among positions, Fisher&#x02019;s
least significant difference (LSD) test was used. The statistical significance level, a, was
chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Here we review the comparison of pulmonary function during maximal inspiration according to

Meanwhile, bedding is a factor that affects sleep. Lung capacity is a fundamental measure in
evaluating respiratory function and can result in different values according to postures.
Therefore, it is essential to compare differences in changes in lung capacity according to
postural changes in order to accurately evaluate respiratory function<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of pillow height on the lung capacity of 20 normal
individuals, male and female university students in their twenties. Based on the research,
humans feel comfortable psychologically with pillows that are 4 to 10&#x02005;cm high<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study employed pillows with heights
of 0&#x02005;cm, 5&#x02005;cm, and 10&#x02005;cm for subjects in a supine position. By measuring pulmonary function,
this study intended to examine changes in vital capacity (VC), tidal volume (TV),
inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). Each variable for
lung capacity was measured three times for each subject, and the maximum value was adopted
based upon the standards developed by many previous studies<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the measurements showed statistically significant
differences in VC between 0&#x02005;cm and 5&#x02005;cm, and between 0&#x02005;cm and 10&#x02005;cm. The highest VC was
found at the 5&#x02005;cm height. However, statistically significant differences were not observed
in TV, IRV, and ERV. This finding may indicate that high pillows excessively bend the
curvature in the normal cervical region, which reduces the airway space through which air
flows into the laryngopharynx; this structural change reduces the capacity for
ventilation.</p><p>Previous studies also showed a number of cases in which the pulmonary function of normal
individuals was reduced in a reclining position. This body of research indicates that, along
with the vertical effects of gravity, the limited airway due to cervical curvature reduced
respiratory function<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Beni Solow et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that increases in the
height of the cervical region hamper the inflow of air by hindering the process of securing
the airway. Another study considered the respiratory mechanism of premature babies, finding
that excessive curves in the cervical region hinder the inflow of air by reducing the
airway<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The current study seems to exhibit results similar to those of other studies regarding the
pulmonary function of normal individuals. Therefore, based on the results of the present
study, using pillows of appropriate height for patients who stay in bed for long hours or
patients with cardiopulmonary diseases is likely to contribute to their stable respiratory
function. Future studies are required to directly evaluate the respiratory functions of
patients who stay in bed for long hours due to impaired mobility or patients with
cardiopulmonary disorders, thereby providing an accurate analysis of their respiratory
functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Sin</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name></person-group>: Study of neck fatigue and body pressure accoding to the pillow&#x02019;s type and
