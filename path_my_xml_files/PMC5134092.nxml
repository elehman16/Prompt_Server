Lung diseases are among the most frequently occurring and serious conditions in the western world, including Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The Danish Health Authority recommends spirometry every second year to all individuals older than 35&#x000a0;years with at least one respiratory symptom and/or exposure to any known risk factor (smoke, genetics, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust) in order to facilitate early case finding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, an estimated 200,000 Danish citizens (50%) with COPD remain undiagnosed and unknown to the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Preventive health checks including spirometry can be used to detect lung diseases at early stages. However, a well-known challenge is low uptake, especially in people at risk of developing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies of attendees in preventive health checks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported average attendance rates from 18 to 82%. They also showed that non-attendees were less healthy than the attendees and that those least likely to attend health checks were younger, single men with low income or low socioeconomic status, active smokers, or the unemployed or less educated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Little is known about what motivates the attendance to health checks.</p><p>In a systematic review by Jepson et al., interventions used to increase uptake in screening for a variety of conditions are compared in 190 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These interventions targeted individuals and revealed enhanced invitation procedures. An appointment in the invitation letter, telephone calls, and reminders seemed to increase the participation rate effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A few studies evaluated the effect of providing additional information in the invitation. Kiernan et al. examined three strategies of recruiting citizens into trials by personalizing the invitation letter and by adding additional information. They found that a personalized letter including heart disease risk statistics did not yield a higher response rate than the standard letter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Sallis et al. compared an enhanced invitation letter applying behavioral insights with a standard invitation letter and found a difference in the participation rate from 29.3% to 33.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Van Wonderen et al. found that neither the rank of the individual signing a subsequent detailed information letter nor the use of an official funding agency logo on the study&#x02019;s initial invitation made an impact on patient attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally Martinson et al. showed a difference in response rate from 55% to 69% using monetary incentives for recruiting adolescents to a trial focusing on smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In studies aiming to improve participation in colorectal cancer screening, enhanced invitation letters and leaflets have yielded an increase in participation of up to 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, Quaife et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] published a study protocol to test the hypothesis that targeted invitation strategy will increase the uptake in a lung cancer screening compared with a standard invitation. This population consisted of patients aged 60&#x02013;75 with a known smoking history. To our best knowledge, no trials aimed to increase the attendance in general health checks by including information on the benefits of measuring spirometry, and only a few studies have included spirometry in a preventive health check [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study is to examine whether focused information about spirometry in the invitation material will influence the attendance rate in preventive health checks. We also aim to describe the characteristics of the attendees and non-attendees. We hypothesize that information on spirometry as part of the invitation material for the preventive health check will increase the overall attendance rate by 5 percentage points and also that more people at risk will attend. The study protocol conforms to the Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Spirometry</title><p>Lung function will be assessed using the EasyOne Diagnostic Spirometer (Ndd Medical Technologies, Andover, MA, USA), which is calibrated daily. The spirometer measures forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Spirometer software calculates the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio and the predicted value of FEV<sub>1</sub> based on reference values. At each examination, the criterion for correct procedure performance is at least three measurements differing by less than 5%. Reversibility using a bronchodilator is not allowed. Abnormal spirometry is defined as FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;0.7 or FEV<sub>1</sub>% pred. &#x0003c;0.8 or FVC % pred. &#x0003c;0.8. The spirometric cut-off values used in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] will be used for classifying disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>The health check</title><p>In addition to spirometry, the clinical examination includes the following measurements: blood analysis of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, bodyweight, height, and Astrand&#x02019;s submaximal bike test (cardiorespiratory fitness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. After the health check, the results are presented in a profile pamphlet including recommendations for follow-up according to the citizen&#x02019;s risk profile. Citizens with abnormal spirometry are recommended to consult their general practitioner for further examination. Execution of the health check is standardized by a written standardized operational procedure (SOP), and adherence is monitored continuously.

Calculations are further based on the objective of being able to detect a difference of 5 percentage points in effect size based on an attendance rate of 53&#x02013;58%.

It is designed as a pragmatic and randomized study and will provide information which can be used directly by health care planners in the decision of how to implement health checks. The outcomes were chosen to mirror the aims of the intervention: the overall attendance rate and the attendance of people at risk for lung impairment.Our recruitment strategy is to reach the citizens in three different ways: by webpage, leaflet, and invitation letter in a randomized controlled design. Prior studies have shown an increase in attendance by enhancing invitation material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, we expect an increase in the attendance of 5 percentage points, and we also expect that more people at risk will attend. We believe it is a realistic goal, even though previous studies indicate that smokers feel ashamed and guilty of their self-inflicted disease and therefore hesitate to seek help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In order to avoid having smokers absent themselves, when we were designing the new material for the intervention group, we involved a communications consultant from the Danish Lung Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], who is an expert in content and comprehensibility.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Participants will be enrolled directly from the general population; therefore, they will not receive any screening prior to inclusion. Thus, the generalizability will not only reflect certain at-risk populations such as current smokers, prior smokers, or citizens with chronic disease. The high transferability of the invitation material and the application of the intention-to-treat principle provide a high external validity. Moreover, the objective measure of attendance contributes with a high internal validity. We chose cluster randomization by household to limit the expected contamination between attendees living together, because motivation to attend a health check will potentially impact the entire household. To avoid having attendees refuse to participate, households are invited together and two reminders are sent out. Furthermore, appointments are scheduled outside of work hours. Finally, we have the unique opportunity to use the Danish registers as a population-based health care database with information about the non-attendees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The present study has some limitations. Firstly, we are aware that both groups have the same accessibility to the webpage regarding how to prevent lung disease, and this may dilute the difference between the two groups. Secondly, the right level of extra information is difficult to achieve. Too much information may cause the participants to believe that the study is only about lung function and possibly scare some of the citizens at risk. On the other hand, too little preventive information may dilute the intervention. Thirdly, we have no spirometry measurements on the non-attendees, which complicates the comparison among the non-attendees and the attendees. Nonetheless, we have the opportunity to supply the characteristics of the non-attendees by redeemed medication and sociodemographic characteristics by the Danish registers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although our population is fairly young, the most severely affected and chronic patients will not show up for the examination as it requires some physical and mental effort, but we expect the effect to be equal among the two groups. Finally, there is a risk of misclassification among, e.g., citizens with flu or pneumonia, thus resulting in false positive outcomes. However, this risk is expected to be equal among the two groups due to the randomization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Lung diseases represent a significant burden for patients and health care systems worldwide. Optimizing early detection followed by pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can not only improve a patient&#x02019;s health status and quality of life, but can also reduce health care expenses. The results from the present study are expected to contribute important knowledge about the value of information on spirometry in invitations to health checks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission of this manuscript, the trial has enrolled approximately 3500 participants.
