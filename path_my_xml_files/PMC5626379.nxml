Some baseline characteristics have been demonstrated to be associated with the treatment outcome. In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study,<xref rid="b3-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> subjects who were Caucasian, female, and/or employed had higher remission rates, as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Subjects who had more education and/or larger incomes also had higher remission rates. Lower remission rates were associated with longer episodes of depression, more general medical and psychiatric disorders (especially, anxiety disorders or drug abuse), more impairment in work and social adjustment, and lower quality of life.<xref rid="b3-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>More recently, prediction of MDD treatment outcome by early response has been extensively investigated. It has been reported that early improvement in the HAM-D total score or subscale scores during the first 2 weeks of treatment could contribute to the correct prediction of remission later in treatment.<xref rid="b4-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent report suggests that improvement in the HAM-D retardation subscale even during the first week could help predict subsequent remission.<xref rid="b7-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Patients with MDD commonly experience painful physical symptoms (PPS).<xref rid="b8-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Unfortunately, in addition to the burden of the pain itself, PPS appear to have a negative impact on MDD. PPS severity is closely associated with depression severity at baseline.<xref rid="b9-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The presence of PPS prior to treatment and the severity of PPS are both associated with poorer treatment outcomes.<xref rid="b8-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, an association has been found between PPS improvement and depression improvement in cohort studies<xref rid="b11-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and case&#x02013;control studies.<xref rid="b17-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Pain can negatively affect efforts to treat MDD with antidepressants, reducing the probability of achieving depression remission/response.<xref rid="b18-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Fava et al<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported that a &#x02265;50% reduction in pain scores 2 weeks after treatment initiation was associated with a higher probability of remission (HAM-D total score &#x02264;7) at the end point. This result implies that the early improvement (within 2 weeks) in PPS is associated with subsequent remission of MDD. However, not all patients included in the analysis experienced pain at baseline, thus compromising the sensitivity of evaluating the association. In addition, Fava et al<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> used a visual analog scale (VAS) for assessing PPS, which is a simple tool to administer but can be highly subjective. Currently, many other scales for assessment of pain are available,<xref rid="b20-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and more developed scales such as the Brief Pain Inventory &#x02013; Short Form (BPI-SF) may better capture the severity of PPS and its improvement.</p><p>Duloxetine, a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in the central nervous system in vitro and in vivo,<xref rid="b22-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> has been approved for the treatment of MDD and various types of pain (diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain) in the US and other countries. Duloxetine showed effectiveness on PPS in acute treatment phases of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.<xref rid="b23-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, Harada et al,<xref rid="b25-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> in a pooled analysis of patients with MDD and PPS, found that duloxetine would directly improve PPS early in treatment. However, this result is not direct evidence that early improvement in PPS increases the likelihood of MDD remission.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the present analysis was to determine if early improvement in PPS, as measured using the BPI-SF, can be a predictor of remission when MDD patients with PPS are treated with duloxetine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Data sources, study selection, and patients</title><p>The studies used in the present pooled analysis have been previously described.<xref rid="b25-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Briefly, we screened the Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial database to identify studies that met the following criteria: 1) randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials of duloxetine (40&#x02013;60 mg/day) versus placebo for the acute treatment of MDD with associated PPS and 2) use of the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for depressive symptoms and the BPI-SF for pain symptoms.

Patients were mostly female (69.7%) and Caucasian (81.8%), and the mean age was 46.5 years.

PPVs and NPVs of the MADRS were mostly higher than those of the BPI-SF in all severity groups as observed in the whole group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ndt-13-2457">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Collectively, the predictive usefulness of the BPI-SF was generally confirmed across the range of depression severities studied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that early improvement in PPS can be a predictor for remission and response in MDD. Our data not only support the idea that PPS and depression are closely related but also suggest that PPS improvement could be a sign of subsequent depression state improvement in MDD patients with PPS.</p><p>The usefulness of this measure is evident as early as week 1, when the 50% PPV for remission and 69% PPV for response observed with early improvement in PPS were better than the overall remission rate (38.5%) and response rate (53.4%) in the duloxetine group. Although early improvement in the MADRS was found to be better for prediction, this was expected as the same scale was used for both predictive value and outcome measurement. It is striking that improvement in PPS as early as week 1 was associated with subsequent remission, even though PPS is not one of the 10 items of the MADRS.</p><p>The PPVs of early improvement in the BPI-SF scores for response and remission did not change very much from week 1 to 4, while the number of patients experiencing early improvement in BPI-SF increased. NPV was not evidently superior to overall nonremission rate at week 1, but, in general, the value increased over time. These changes in PPV and NPV suggest that early improvement in PPS, regardless of timing, can be a sign of positive outcome. However, when treating with duloxetine, it is worth waiting at least 4 weeks to see if PPS improves before predicting a negative outcome based on a lack of improvement.</p><p>Our results regarding the predictability of remission by early improvement in PPS are partly consistent with a previous report by Fava et al,<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> where it was reported that 35.4% of early responders (&#x02265;50% improvement in VAS score within 2 weeks) achieved remission of depressive symptoms, compared with 20.9% of patients without early pain response. These values are lower than those found in our study, most likely because their study population was not selective for patients with PPS, while our study population was restricted to patients with associated PPS. In addition, their estimation was based on a mixture of patients who were treated with duloxetine and placebo.</p><p>Another reason for the slight discrepancy between our results and those of Fava et al<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> could be the difference in assessment scales. Fava et al<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> used the VAS to measure PPS and the HAM-D to measure MDD symptoms. We used the BPI-SF to assess PPS because it is a more specialized scale for pain and is now commonly used for evaluation of PPS.<xref rid="b15-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b42-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Because of the focus on PPS in the present analysis, the PPVs and NPVs we demonstrated should be more appropriate estimations for patients with MDD having PPS and being treated with duloxetine.</p><p>Notably, early improvement in BPI-SF score even at week 1, which is earlier than reported in Fava et al,<xref rid="b19-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> can predict duloxetine treatment outcome. This treatment period in our study is quite early even compared with recent reports on early prediction using HAM-D scores at week 2.<xref rid="b5-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>At least one observational study supports the relationship between early improvement in PPS and remission. Schneider et al<xref rid="b16-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> showed that in patients treated with duloxetine, a 50% reduction in VAS overall pain score after 2 or 4 weeks was associated with greater improvement in depressive symptoms (as measured using the Kurz-Skala Stimmung/Aktivierung [KUSTA]) after 6 months. This finding partly complements our study by showing that the association between early improvement in PPS and remission of depression can be as long as 6 months.</p><p>Results of PPV and NPV derived from the placebo group showed the association of early improvement in PPS with remission and response, even in the absence of an active drug. Although the remission rate was lower in the placebo group than in the duloxetine group, PPV for remission at week 1 (40%) was much higher than the placebo remission rate (21.8%). Provided that the placebo response is thought to be a manifestation of resilience,<xref rid="b43-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> our data imply that early improvement in PPS can be a part of the natural process of recovery from depression.</p><p>When patients were subgrouped by severity of MDD symptoms by baseline MADRS score, patients with mild MDD showed a somewhat different pattern of PPV and NPV (higher PPV and lower NPV) from those of the moderate and severe subgroups. These differences are most likely because the overall remission rate in the mild subgroup was higher than other subgroups. In the moderate and severe subgroups, PPVs and NPVs were consistently better than the overall remission rate and overall nonremission rate, respectively. This tendency was also observed in the mild group, except at week 1. The apparently weaker association in the mild groups than in the moderate and severe groups may be due to a relatively smaller sample size or lower mean baseline BPI-SF scores. Alternatively, it may be because PPS in the mild depression group is not as closely coupled with other depression symptoms as in the moderate or severe depression groups. Even though there is some variation depending on baseline severity of depression, PPV and NPV can be useful for assessing treatment outcome across a broad range of depression severity.</p><p>Depressive disorders show many different types of symptoms. We recently reported that the improvement in many depression symptoms assessed by HAM-D can be useful in predicting the outcome of depressive disorder.<xref rid="b44-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Our results indicate that early improvement in PPS can be one of the useful signs for predicting subsequent remission. This sign is clinically relevant, given that PPS is often observed in MDD patients<xref rid="b8-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and pain severity is higher in patients with MDD than in healthy controls.<xref rid="b45-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Thus, PPS should be one of the symptoms that is routinely given attention during the treatment of MDD.</p><p>There are limitations to the present analysis that should be considered. First, our patient sample was mostly Caucasian (81.8%) and female (69.7%). Potential differences due to gender, ethnicity, or cultural considerations may be underrepresented in this sample. Second, BPI-SF average pain may not fully represent the complex character and severity of PPS, although it is commonly used for evaluation of PPS. Third, we only examined data from the acute phase of treatment and long-term results may differ. Fourth, because this is a post hoc analysis, results must be interpreted with caution. Fifth, only patients treated with duloxetine 60 mg/day or placebo were included in this analysis. Higher or lower doses of duloxetine and other antidepressants may have different effects on both PPS and symptoms of depression. Finally, the integrated database we used included only studies that were conducted by Eli Lilly and Company or its partners outside Japan; therefore, sponsorship bias may not be completely ruled out.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We recently reported that duloxetine directly improves PPS during the early treatment phase, while other depressive symptoms are improved partly by indirect effect through PPS improvement in MDD patients treated with duloxetine.<xref rid="b25-ndt-13-2457" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Together with this report, the present results suggest that early improvement in PPS can be a positive sign for remission of depression, and close attention can be paid to PPS from the earliest phase of treatment. PPS improvement can be a useful early clinical indicator in assessing treatment effectiveness for remission in MDD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Eli Lilly Japan K.K., manufacturer/licensee of Cymbalta<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which was involved in the preparation of the manuscript.
