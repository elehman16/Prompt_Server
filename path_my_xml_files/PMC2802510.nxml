 never treated and are still alive. Here we report that far fewer people with
 untreated phenylketonuria were detected than are thought to exist (about
 2000). The majority of those traced had high support needs, challenging
 behaviour and other symptoms of phenylketonuria. No significant differences
 were found between those who had or had not tried the phenylalanine-restricted
 diet. A randomised controlled trial is required to examine the effect of
 trying the low-phenylalanine diet for people with untreated
 phenylketonuria.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p></fn><fn><p>None. Funding detailed in Acknowledgements.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Phenylketonuria is a recessively inherited metabolic disorder which, unless
 it is treated early enough with a phenylalanine-restricted diet, leads to
 severe intellectual
 disabilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The
 overall prevalence of phenylketonuria in the UK is about 1 per 10
 000<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> and published
 guidelines suggest that treatment needs to be early and
 lifelong.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Neonatal newborn screening for phenylketonuria began in the late 1960s and
 those treated early had a very good
 outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> However,
 those born before neonatal screening began were not normally treated, as they
 already had severe intellectual disabilities, assumed to be irreversible. Our
 study aimed to trace all those with untreated phenylketonuria and severe
 intellectual disabilities in the UK and to examine their range of
 difficulties, as a prelude to a randomised controlled trial of
 phenylalanine-restricted diet in people with previously untreated
 phenylketonuria.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A letter and response form were sent to all UK professionals in a number of
 fields (psychiatrists, psychologists and managers of learning disability
 services; dietitians in mental health/learning disabilities services and
 metabolic services; metabolic paediatricians) asking whether they knew of
 anyone with untreated phenylketonuria and intellectual disabilities. The
 survey was also publicised through the National Society for Phenylketonuria
 website and at conferences. The study was approved by a multisite National
 Health Service ethics committee.</p><p>Professionals were asked for an anonymised list of people known to them
 with untreated phenylketonuria, plus a contact name of someone who could give
 further details. These &#x02018;primary contacts&#x02019; were then asked to
 complete a brief anonymised questionnaire (described below) regarding the
 person with untreated phenylketonuria. To ensure the maximum response rate two
 reminder letters were sent to primary contacts if there was no reply. In 11%
 of cases, two contacts completed the questionnaire regarding the same person
 to provide a measure of interrater reliability (72%).</p><p>The questionnaire included questions on: age and gender of the person with
 untreated phenylketonuria; their relationship to the respondent; and whether
 the person with phenylketonuria had ever tried a low-phenylalanine diet
 &#x02013; if so, for how long. Details of levels of skills, support required,
 challenging behaviour, and other symptoms were sought. (Copies of the
 questionnaire can be obtained from G.H.M.)</p><p>Most data were nominal or ordinal. Analysis was by non-parametric
 statistics, including
 chi-square.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of over 500 letters sent out, 194 replies were received. Of these, 77 were
 positive replies from professionals who knew of one or more adults with
 untreated phenylketonuria; 117 said they knew of no one with untreated
 phenylketonuria. Questionnaires were then sent to the primary contacts named
 in the positive replies and 98 completed questionnaires were returned (84%
 response rate), regarding adults who had all been untreated in early life.</p><p>Of these 98 people with phenylketonuria, none of whom had been treated in
 infancy, 50 had never tried the phenylalanine-restricted diet at all. The
 remaining 48 had tried the diet at some point in their lives: 29 had ceased
 the diet but 19 were still on it.</p><p>Of the 79 untreated people (i.e. 50 never on diet + 29 tried it but not on
 diet now), 44% were men. The overall mean age was 47.7 years (s.d.=9.6, range
 19&#x02013;72). The two youngest people were sisters, aged 19 and 22 years, who
 had come to the UK from a country that did not have neonatal screening for
 phenylketonuria; the next youngest person was 34 years old. Of the 29 people
 who had tried the phenylalanine-restricted diet at some point in their lives,
 about 50% had tried it for less than 2 years.</p><p>The characteristics of the 79 untreated people and their challenging
 behaviour are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>
 (cross-tabulated against whether or not they had ever tried the
 phenylalanine-restricted diet). There were no significant differences between
 those who had and who had not tried the diet in terms of their
 characteristics, challenging behaviour or symptoms.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics, challenging behaviour and symptoms of people with

 later tried the phenylalanine-restricted diet and were still on the diet. This
 group did not differ significantly from the 79 people who were not on the diet
 in terms of their age, gender, levels of skills, challenging behaviours or
 symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been calculated from the general birth rate (prior to neonatal
 screening for phenylketonuria), together with the known incidence rate for
 phenylketonuria, that there are about 2000 people with untreated
 phenylketonuria still alive in the UK, assuming a life expectancy of 65
 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
 Jancar<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> argued that
 actual life expectancy for this group is rather lower at 57 years, but even if
 this were the case, we would expect about 1500 people with untreated
 phenylketonuria. In fact, fewer than 150 people were found. Although it is
 possible that some people with mild phenylketonuria are living relatively
 normal lives and are not in contact with services, it is likely that many
 people with untreated phenylketonuria and severe intellectual disabilities
 live in the community, known to learning disability services, but are not
 recognised as having untreated phenylketonuria. An alternative possibility is
 that our survey strategy missed very large numbers of people with untreated
 phenylketonuria (for example, through non-response of professionals), but it
 is difficult to see what survey method might have been better.</p><p>This survey of a relatively large number of people with untreated
 phenylketonuria clearly documents the extent of their disabilities and the
 significant support needs they have. Their identification is important as
 specific intervention with a phenylalanine-restricted diet may potentially
 reduce these burdens, even at this late stage, as a number of single-case and
 small-scale studies have
 suggested.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
 In our study, there were no significant differences in the levels of
 disabilities, challenging behaviours and symptoms between those who had tried
 the diet at some point in their lives (whether or not they were still on diet)
 and those who had never tried it. However, neither ours nor previous studies
 were prospective randomised controlled trials with standardised measures.</p><p>There are two main implications of this study. First, general
 practitioners, psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists, community nurses
 and dietitians, who may see people with severe intellectual disabilities of
 unknown cause, should suspect and screen for phenylketonuria, especially if
 the person is more than 35 years old (or was born in a country without
 neonatal screening), needs 24-h support, and has challenging behaviours and
 symptoms of phenylketonuria (eczema, epilepsy, &#x02018;mousey&#x02019; body
 odour, and a fair complexion). The second implication is that there is a need
 for a properly designed randomised control trial to examine whether a
 phenylalanine-restricted diet really is of help to this very disabled group of
 people.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all at SHS International, especially Pat Portnoi, for
