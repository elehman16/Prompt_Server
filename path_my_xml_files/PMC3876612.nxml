It is composed mainly of a variety of sugars, traces of pollen and water. Honey was used to treat infected wounds as long as 2000 years before bacteria were discovered to cause infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It has been reported to have inhibitory action to around 50 species of bacteria and fungi (aspergillus, penicillium).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbial species has led to a re-evaluation of the therapeutic use of ancient remedies, including honey.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Honey rapidly clears infection from wounds, with no adverse effects to slow the healing process. Honey may actively promote healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have shown that, honey can be used as a supplementary material which takes much shorter time for healing, control of infection, use of antibiotics and hospital stay.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Swabbing of wounds dressed with honey has shown that infecting bacteria are rapidly cleared. The antibacterial activity of honey probably is attributed to its osmotic effect, oxidizing effect, acidity, phytochemical factor and intrinsic antibacterial potency. The major antibacterial activity of honey has been found to be due to hydrogen peroxide produced enzymaticallly in the honey.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Cancer patients already suffer from severe physical distress. Besides, the disease itself makes them broken psychologically, financially and socially. Since living with dignity is a fundamental right of every human being, role of palliative care is immense in terminally ill cancer patients. Bedsore in cancer patients adversely affects physical, mental, social and spiritual condition of these patients. So management of bedsore in cancer patients in an economic way is essential. Several materials like metronidazole, povidone iodine solution, and sucralfate are used in day to day practice for dressing of bedsores and ulcers. Metronidazole powder (after crushing metronidazole tablets) is economic and effective antibacterial agent. Moreover, it prevents malodor.</p><p>So, metronidazole powder is widely used for dressing of bedsores. Though honey is not routinely used for this purpose, yet we have performed our study using honey as a dressing material to prove its effectiveness in bedsore healing because it is economic, easily available ingredient with high astringent property.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>Objectives of the study were to find out the effectiveness of Honey in terms of rate of wound healing and pain control in bedsores in cancer patients. We compared honey with metronidazole powder in one group and metronidazole powder in another group. Normal saline wash was used in both the groups before application of above medicaments. Besides its anti-infective property, metronidazole prevented gathering of ants in honey due to its bitter metallic taste.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We performed our study with 40 cancer patients with bedsore attending Palliative clinic of our department in between July 2010 and September 2011. Approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee was taken before commencing of the study. Informed consent form signed from patients before recruiting of each patient. Those patients in palliative settings with bedsore wounds were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) for study arm 20 patients and control arm 20 patients. Twenty bedsore patients in the study arm were treated with honey with metronidazole powder. Twenty bedsore patients in the control arm were treated with only metronidazole powder. Washing of the wound with normal saline done daily before application of above medicaments. Change of posture and soft bed were encouraged in both groups.</p><p>For our study purpose we divided both the study and the control arm according to their demographic characteristics (age and sex); duration of illness, duration of bedsore wounds, types of therapy received [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>].

The patient is asked to choose a number as marked in the scale between 0 and 10, that best describes his or her pain and scored accordingly daily.</p><p>Wound assessment was done using standard and internationally accepted most common Bates-Jensen wound Assessment Scale. It consists of thirteen items; each scores from 1 to 5 according to severity. The items are: Size; depth; edges; undermining; necrotic tissue amount; necrotic tissue type; exudates type; exudates amount; skin colour surrounding wound; peripheral tissue edema; peripheral tissue induration; granulation tissue; epithelisation. A rating sheet was used to assess the wound status. Rating must be done according to each item by picking the response that best describes the wound and entering that score, in the item score for the appropriate date. After rating the wound on all items, determine the total score by adding together the 13 item scores.</p><p>Higher total score more severe wound status.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> it is found that no significant difference in bedsore wound when both the groups were compared (<italic>P</italic>=1.467).</p><p>Based on the modality of treatment received patients in both the groups were divided into four subgroups viz. only general treatment, only radiotherapy, only chemotherapy and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.
