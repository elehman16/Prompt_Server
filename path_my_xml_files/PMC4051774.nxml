Treating KCS often requires the daily application of more than one type of eye drop in order to both stimulate tear prodcution and provide a tear supplement to increase hydration and lubrication. A previous study demonstrated the potential for a crosslinked hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (xCMHA-S) to reduce the clinical signs associated with KCS in dogs while using a reduced dosing regimen of only twice-daily administration. The present study extended those results by comparing the use of the xCMHA-S to a standard HA-containing tear supplement in a masked, randomized clinical study in dogs with a clinical diagnosis of KCS. The xCMHA-S was found to significantly improve ocular surface health (conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular irritation, and ocular discharge) to a greater degree than the alternative tear supplement (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0003). Further, owners reported the xCMHA-S treatment as being more highly effective than the alternative tear supplement (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0024). These results further demonstrate the efficacy of the xCMHA-S in reducing the clinical signs associated with KCS, thereby improving patient health and owner happiness.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dry eye or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is a widespread problem in both the human and canine populations. The prevalence of KCS in humans may vary between 5 and 33%, in different reports and with different methods of ocular evaluation <xref rid="pone.0099766-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The prevalence in the canine species varies between 1 to 4% <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Topical cyclosporine has been developed as a widely efficacious lacrimogenic agent in dogs <xref rid="pone.0099766-Kaswan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and more recently in man, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Stonecipher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> but not all individuals in either affected population respond adequately to the drug by a higher rate of tear production. Also, the high price of the product puts it out of the financial reach of many dog owners. For these reasons an effective, less expensive tear replacement eyedrop is still required. Many of these are available as topical medications containing a wide number of lubricating agents, including polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, and hyaluronic acid (HA) <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Bron1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Since HA is a naturally occurring polysaccharide found as a lubricative agent in joint fluid, its use as a similar agent on the ocular surface is particularly appropriate <xref rid="pone.0099766-Barbucci1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Rah1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For tear supplements containg HA, previous reports have shown that the viscoelasticity of the polysaccharide leads to an increase in tear stability and a consequent reduction in many of the symptoms of dry eye <xref rid="pone.0099766-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099766-Guillaumie1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The viscoelasticity of HA-based products can vary significantly, depending on the molecular weight and concentration of the HA used, as well as the concentration of salts present due to interaction with the polyanionic HA <xref rid="pone.0099766-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Higashide1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Such variation in rheologic properties, such as viscoelasticity, can lead to differences in comfort and efficacy for a dry eye formulation <xref rid="pone.0099766-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Typical HA-based tear supplements have been a simple solution of high molecular weight, low concentration HA. However, by covalently crosslinking HA, such as the formulation documented herein, leads to a more viscoelastic material. This increase in viscoelasticity extends the contact time of the HA with the ocular surface and will thus allow for less frequent application, reducing the overall cost and burden on the patient, and in the case of dogs, the owner. The covalent HA crosslinking described here, acts in a different manner than the physical or ionic crosslinking occurring in solutions of simple high molecular weight HA.</p><p>The crosslinked modified HA, thiolated carboxymethyl HA (CMHA-S), used in the present study has previously been used in other formulations to treat skin and corneal wounds <xref rid="pone.0099766-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The hydrogel formulation used in this study was specifically developed as a tear supplement for the treatment of canine KCS. We have previously characterised the hydrogel rheologically to compare with non-crosslinked solutions of HA <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We also compared the ocular surface effects of this product to a previous study using a different tear replacement drop, evaluating tear production by use of the Schirmer tear test, conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular discharge and ocular irritation as determined by blink frequency and palpebral apperture narrowing <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although the previous study demonstrated promising results, it was neither masked nor randomised, and the comparison of the products relied on two populations of KCS-affected dogs. Here we present the results of a study in which KCS-affected dogs were randomly assigned to treatment with either the CMHA-S product or a commercial tear replacement drop. Importantly, the medication was dispensed in such a manner that the investigator could not know which medication was being provided. Only after completion of the study and all assessments made following medication was the treatment regime for each dog unmasked, thus allowing a truly masked study. The statistical analyses of the data were also blinded in that statisticians were provided only &#x0201c;treatment one&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;treatment two&#x0201d; identification for each dog.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Crosslinked CMHA-S hydrogel</title><p>CMHA-S was synthesized and analyzed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0099766-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

The advent of topical cyclosporine has substantially improved the lot of individuals in which this treatment is effective, but there are dogs in which the medication does not have the desired lacrimomimetic effects and for many owners the drug is too expensive, given as it must be used for the lifetime of the animal. Yet regular treatment with topical tear replacers can be difficult for owner and pet, and for human patients also.</p><p>In a previous study we reported the use of a crosslinked HA-based hydrogel as a tear supplement in a clinical study of 25 dogs with KCS <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although the study demonstrated the potential for the xCMHA-S to reduce the clinical signs associated with KCS, the study was not masked or randomized. Thus, here we conducted a masked, randomized study comparing the xCMHA-S hydrogel and a standard tear replacement eye drop containing HA.</p><p>The results show a statistically significantly better therapeutic efficacy, based on ocular surface health, with the xCMHA-S gel applied three times daily than with the standard tear replacement drop. ANCOVA analysis was necessary here, with the pre-treatment score as a covariate, since the pre-treatment score will affect the degree to which the score can improve. Because the pre-treatment score estimate is not equal to 1.0, it underlines the idea that the treatment cannot have the same effect if a component of the composite pre-treatment score is coded as 0 as it can if that component is coded 3.</p><p>Although ocular surface health was improved, there was no significant improvement in STT value with either treatment. This was expected since both types of drops are merely tear supplements and do not stimulate the production of tears <xref rid="pone.0099766-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Additionally, owners were happier with the outcome of using the xCMHA-S gel compared to the standard tear replacement drop. Since this clinical study involved canine patients, it was not possible to assess any potential disruption in vision due to the increased viscosity of the xCMHA-S gel compared to the ITRD drops. However, if the owners had observed any vision issues, it is likely that the owner happiness scores would have been lower.</p><p>These findings have important implications for the canine population where an effective ocular surface lubricant will be welcomed by owners and canine patients alike. This crosslinked CMHA-S hydrogel may have potential translational importance as well, as an effective tear replacement drop with a long ocular surface residence time and thus a low required dose frequency would be highly valuable for the sizeable population of humans with dry eye.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Barbara Thomson and Professor David Andrews of Thomson Data Analysis (Toronto, Canada) for their assistance with the statistical analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0099766-Smith1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
