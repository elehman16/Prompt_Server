A randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted. Cupping was performed on 0-6<sup>th</sup> day; 9-11<sup>th</sup> day and 14<sup>th</sup> day, i.e., 11 sittings follow-up to determine longer term carryover of treatment effects utilizing both objective and subjective assessment. The assessment was performed before and after treatment spreading over a period of 15 days. The results of this study shows significant and better results in the overall management of knee osteoarthritis, particularly in relieving pain, edema, stiffness and disability. The efficacy of treatment with cupping therapy in relieving signs and symptoms of knee osteoarthritis is comparable to that of acetaminophen 650 mg thrice a day orally, in terms of analgesia, anti-inflammatory and resolution of edema with minimal and temporary side-effects like echymosis and blister formation while as control drug has greater side-effects particularly on upper gastrointestinal tract. It is recommended that further studies are conducted with a larger study samples and of longer duration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cupping therapy</kwd><kwd>knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>regimenal therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regimenal therapy is a category of treatment modality that utilizes various mechanisms like massage, exercise and leeching etc., to change local and thereafter systemic hemodynamic. Cupping a component of regimenal therapy is utilized for local bloodletting and for local hemo dynamic changes. It ensures enhancement of tissue metabolism by increasing the blood circulation of that site.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>These chemical changes through physical procedures and subsequent diversion resulting in excretion from the site or body are known as Imala.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Cupping is of three types; dry cupping is caused by creating a vacuum through mechanical means.

This loss is a result of disturbance in the three dimensional framework that holds the proteoglycans in collagen. Hence, there is a failure in repair of both proteoglycans and collagen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Imala has the potential to change the chemical form of the compounds by breaking them into simpler ones and to change their chemical structure for example uric acid accumulated in tissues is changed to ureates or into uric acid excretable through urine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Osteoarthritis is the most common of all joint disorders and the most expensive in terms of productivity, both in terms of days lost from work and in terms of cost of treatment.

The erythema and ecchymosis were circular in shape and were directly proportional with symptomatic improvement. Blisters too appeared on the anterio medial aspect of the knee. The blisters gave the characteristic burning sensation and appearance of pressure blister. These varied in number from two to three to plentiful, i.e., 15 with straw colored fluid. The blisters were ruptured under aseptic conditions with a sterile needle. No further treatment was necessary for the blisters. The fluid from such blisters varied from 0.05 ml to 0.2 ml per sitting. The blistered site was given rest for a day or two for healing. The knee improved dramatically after blister formation especially in terms of edema, crepitations and stiffness. Blisters usually formed after 4 to 5 days of cupping. The blisters formed easily and larger in numbers during summers and under increased room temperature. Individuals reacted differently to the same amount of pressure, time of application and room temperature. Some gave severe ecchymosis where as others had blisters <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Graph 5</xref> while some other had no changes at all.

</p><p>The hemodynamic changes brought about through dry cupping are evident from ecchymosis and blister. These biochemical changes that resulted from vacuum are signs of imala. The vacuum pulls the muscle beyond its normal elastic limits and causes breeches in microvasculature of that area ensuring local hyperemia.

However, patients of acetaminophen responded well to nocturnal pain when compared to those on cupping therapy.</p><p>The ecchymosis and blister formation are directly related to the duration and volume of negative pressure created by cupping and are usually the only undesired effects of cupping therapy for the patient besides causing a mild pain during the cupping session due to indrawing of tissues because of suction effect. But when the patient is taken into confidence and informed in advance of such effects and ensured about their transient nature than the patients are not bothered by their occurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The study proved cupping to be a good analgesic and anti-inflammatory with efficacy better than acetaminophen. Thus, cupping can be recommended for other painful conditions besides being a line of treatment for osteoarthritis.</p><p>Cupping superimposes acute inflammation on chronic inflammation. The chronic inflammation of cartilage that is deep seated has acute inflammation on the skin and muscles. A study conducted by Pete <italic>et al</italic>. in Poland states that degenerative changes occurs as a result of decreased blood supply. Acute inflammation at a site 1-3 mm from the affected joint does improve the blood circulation of the site for a sustained period of 11 days shows the desired changes.</p><p>The effect of this at proteoglycans and collagen level needs evaluation to understand the pharmokinetics of vacuum of healthy and ailing tissue another aspect that needs further attention is the concept of healing by causing acute inflammation in tissue superior to chronic inflammation.</p><p>The initial increase in pain in Grade 3 and Grade 4 must be because the pain of osteoarthritis had restricted the use of these muscles and thereby causing a loss in their elasticity hence the additional burden on the elasticity caused pain.</p><p>Cupping also proved to be a good exercise to specific muscles besides improving their blood supply.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Nil.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arzani</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mufarreh Quloob</article-title><year>1915</year><publisher-loc>Lucknow</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Matba Nami Grami Munshi Nawal Kishore</publisher-name><fpage>583</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baghdadi</surname><given-names>IH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Kitab ul Mukhtaraat fit Tibb</article-title><year>1914</year><publisher-loc>Hyderabad</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Matbaul Jamia Dairaul Maroof Ul Usmaniya</publisher-name><fpage>297</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><comment>1326 H</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Masihi</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Kitab ul Umda fil Jarrah</article-title><year>1986</year><volume>1</volume><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>New Delhi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>CCRUM</publisher-name><fpage>194</fpage><lpage>200</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Razi</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Kitab ul Mansoori</article-title><year>1991</year><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>New Delhi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>CCRUM</publisher-name><fpage>283</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sinna</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Al Qanoon fit Tibb</article-title><source>Book I.
