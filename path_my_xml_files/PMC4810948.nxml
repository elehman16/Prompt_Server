Free radicals are highly active molecules with important biological functions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] They can act in redox signalling and antibacterial defence. In oxidative stress, production of free radicals exceeds the capacity of the mechanisms required to detoxify them, thus they can react and damage DNA, lipids, and proteins.</p><p>Surgical trauma elicits complex physiological stress response that involves the activation of inflammatory, endocrine, metabolic and immunologic mediators.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, it produces oxidative stress. Despite the controversies in the literature, whether the laparoscopic surgery reduces oxidative stress[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or not,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] most of them indicated a reduction in oxidative stress with minimal invasive abdominal surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, oxidative stress generation has been attributed to inflation-deflation related splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] hemodynamic changes,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and CO<sub>2</sub> pneumoperitoneum.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] On the other hand, exposure of the peritoneal cavity to room air with higher oxygen concentration and manipulation of the bowel are thought to be responsible for oxidative stress in open surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In acute appendicitis, it is not clear that whether oxidative stress is caused by an inflammatory response or the increase of free radicals are sufficient for the activation of the enzymatic defence system.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The association between acute appendicitis and oxidative stress has been showed in experimental[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, comparison of oxidative stress in laparoscopic or open appendectomy (OA) has not been established.</p><p>To date, there has been no report in the literature that compared oxidative stress markers between laparoscopic and open surgery for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The aim of this double-blinded randomized trial was to compare oxidative stress in patients who underwent laparoscopic and OA for uncomplicated acute appendicitis by analysing the level of serum markers of oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee. The patients who were diagnosed as acute appendicitis between October 2012 and January 2013 were included. Adult patients older than 14 years were invited to participate in this trial if they had the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Enrolled patients were randomised to OA (<italic>n</italic> = 50) and laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) (<italic>n</italic> = 50) groups. Before randomisation, patients were informed concerning the risks and benefits of each procedure and signed a consent form for participation in the study. The patients, who have American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of III or higher, presence of systemic inflammatory disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and patients otherwise incapable of providing informed consent were excluded. Furthermore, patients with complicated appendicitis and patients who underwent conversion to the open procedure were excluded from the study too. No additional port placement was required in any of the patients in LA group.</p><p>Randomisation was done by a research assistant who was not involved in the enrolment. Just before the surgery patients were assigned to the LA or the OA group by means of sealed envelopes containing random numbers. The operator was informed about the procedure type by opening the envelope assigned to the patient in the theatre.</p><p>All the operations were performed by stuff surgeons of our institution, who were experienced in laparoscopic and open surgical techniques. All the patients were administered antibiotics preoperatively (cefoxitin 1 g intravenous [IV]). All patients were premedicated with IV midazolam 0.07 mg/kg 30 min prior to operation. Anaesthetic induction was performed with thiopental sodium (4-7 mg/kg), fentanyl (1.5 mcg/kg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia maintenance was provided with sevoflurane (1-2%) and an air/O<sub>2</sub> mixture (30% O<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>All the OA procedures were performed through a McBurney's muscle-splitting incision. The base of the appendix was left uninvaginated (ligated 2 times with 2/0 vicryl). For the LA patients, 10mm umbilical trocar, and additional two trocars (10mm and 5mm) were placed in the lower abdomen. The appendicular artery was dissected and divided by a ligature device (Covidien LigaSure Advance Monopolar Tip Laparoscopic Sealer/divider LF5544, Valleylab, Boulder, CO., USA). The appendix was secured at the base by ligating two times intracorporeally with 2/0 vicryl, and divided above the two knots. The specimen was removed through the 10mm suprapubic trocar in a specimen bag. The base of the appendix was not invaginated. The resected appendix was routinely sent for histopathological examination. The operative time was calculated from the beginning of the incision to full closure of the wound.</p><p>Demographic characteristics, ASA score, operative time, length of hospital stay (LOS), intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. Blood samples for oxidative stress markers (total oxidant status [TOS]; and total antioxidant status [TAS]), C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells (WBC&#x02019;s) were collected by two authors, just before the surgery and 24 h after surgery. After coagulation (30 min) at room temperature, the serum was separated and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assay. Serum CRP level was determined by the nephelometric method (BeckmanArray 360 Protein System, Minnesota, Brea, CA, USA), and leukocytes were determined with an automatic haematology analyser (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Determination of serum total oxidant status levels</title><p>Total oxidant status levels were measured using commercially available kits (Rel Assay, Turkey). In the new method, oxidants present in the sample oxidized the ferrous ion-o-dianisidine complex to ferric ion. The oxidation reaction was enhanced by glycerol molecules abundantly present in the reaction medium. The ferric ion produced a coloured complex with xylenol orange in an acidic medium. The color intensity, which could be measured spectrophotometrically, was related to the total amount of oxidant molecules present in the sample. The assay was calibrated with hydrogen peroxide, and the results were expressed in terms of micromolar hydrogen peroxide equivalent perlitre (&#x003bc;mol H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> equivalent/L).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Determination of serum total antioxidant status levels</title><p>Total antioxidant status levels were measured using commercially available kits (Rel assay, Turkey).

The assay has excellent precision values, which are lower than 3%.

Underlying pathophysiology of the creation of free radicals and response of the organism is complex. Local and systemic factors can affect the tissue oxygenation, also, oxidant molecules could be taken from the outer environment.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In an inflammatory condition, such as acute appendicitis, mast cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are recruited to the site of inflammation, they subsequently causes to a &#x0201c;respiratory burst&#x0201d; due to an increased uptake of oxygen, and thus free radicals. Free radicals causes lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes, which resulting in increased microvascular permeability, interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and activation. Activated inflammatory cells produce soluble mediators, including metabolites of arachidonic acid, cytokines, and chemokines, and thus resulting in more free radical production, and this cascade may cause eventually cell death. To date, a variety of oxidant species have been measured to reflect the tissue oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the additive oxidant effect of different oxidant molecules and antioxidant balance; therefore we used TOS, TAS, and OSI. The association between acute appendicitis and oxidative stress have been showed in experimental[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and clinical studies.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to aimed to investigate the comparison of oxidative stress in laparoscopic or OA.</p><p>To exclude the effect of excessive inflammatory and infectious changes on oxidative status in complicated appendicitis, we included only uncomplicated cases. Preoperative values of WBC and CRP, which were predictors of inflammation severity,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were found to be similar in open and LA groups. Also, preoperative TOS, TAS, and OSI values showed no difference between the groups. Thus, the preoperative inflammatory, infectious, and oxidative status of the groups were proven to be similar. To exclude the pharmacologic effect on oxidative stress, sevoflurane anaesthesia was used in all operations rather than propofol, which was suggested as an antioxidant.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>TOS and OSI reduced postoperatively in open and laparoscopic surgery groups, however; they were found to be significantly higher in OA group in postoperative 24<sup>th</sup> h. Suggesting that, open and LA reduced acute appendicitis related oxidative stress, but open surgery was generated more free radicals than laparoscopic surgery. The association of the severity of oxidative stress and progression of inflammation to the perforation in acute appendicitis was showed previously,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] thus, the reduction in oxidative stress was an expected finding when the inflamed appendix was resected. Although, the literature have contradictory results[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] about the effect of laparoscopic surgery in oxidative stress, a recent systematic review[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have showed increased oxidative stress immediately following open surgery. The advantage of laparoscopic surgery on oxidative status was confirmed in different status of basal oxidative stress; Tsuchiya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] suggested an association between open abdominal surgery (sigmoid resection) and increased oxidative stress, also, Pappas-Gogos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed lower oxidative stress with laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer. Theoretically, the resection of the inflamed appendicitis and the resection of free radical generating tumor may show similar oxidative status, when it compared with surgery related oxidative stress induction. In both conditions, the changes in oxidative stress could be explained as a consequence of the removal of the pathological organ. Assuming that the resection of the inflamed appendix reduces oxidative stress in open and laparoscopic surgery. The lower oxidative stress observed in LA compared to OA may be attributed to the following factors: Minor surgical trauma in laparoscopic surgery and exposure of the peritoneal cavity to room air in open surgery. In both groups, preoperative antioxidant status reduced minimally in postoperative 24<sup>th</sup> h while oxidative status reduced significantly. This findings may be interpreted as meaning that the preoperative antioxidant status of the patients are in maximum limits of the host defense system, and they reduced with the combined effect of detoxification and the decreased response to decreased volume of the antioxidants. Also, this theory was supported by the significant reduction on CRP values in LA group in postoperative 24<sup>th</sup> h.</p><p>Assessing oxidative stress and the response of the human body is challenging. There are no single biomarker can objectively measure oxidative stress,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also there are no biomarker in peripheral blood that correlates with tissue oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The studies, which were compared tissue levels of oxidative stress in open versus laparoscopic surgery have showed greater oxidative stress in the laparoscopic group.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] On the other hand, Dumlu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] suggested that serum oxidative stress markers can better predict oxidative imbalance in acute appendicitis compared with tissue markers. It has been shown that oxidative damage in tissue level can occur without any measurable changes in the peripheral blood.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Furthermore, blood and tissue biomarkers of oxidative stress may not follow the same pattern of change.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Beside the absence of the ideal method for the measurement of oxidative stress, unknown clinical significance of the alteration of oxidative stress is seems to be the main limitations of oxidative stress measuring studies. Even in the settings of uncomplicated surgery in relatively healthy individuals with no measurement of clinical recovery.</p><p>As a conclusion, this double-blind, randomized clinical trial provides evidence that LA for uncomplicated appendicitis is associated with significantly lower oxidative stress compared to OA. Some of the advantages of LA may be attributed to the significant reduction of oxidative stress in these patients. TOS reduction in postoperative 24<sup>th</sup> h is correlates with the reduction of CRP, which was suggested as a reliable biomarker of inflammation, in laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of Interest:</bold> None
