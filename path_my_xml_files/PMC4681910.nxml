using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus on the ankle muscle strengths of subjects with functional
ankle instability. [Subjects and Methods] This study was conducted using subjects in their
20s who had functional ankle instability. They were randomized to a strengthening training
group and a balance training group with 10 subjects in each, and they performed an
exercise using Nintendo Wii Fit Plus for 20 minutes. In addition, every participant
completed preparation and finishing exercises for 5 minutes, respectively. [Results] The
muscle strengths after conducting plantar flexion and dorsiflexion significantly increased
at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; in the strengthening training group.
Furthermore, the muscle strengths after conducting plantar flexion, dorsiflexion,
eversion, and inversion significantly increased at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0;
in the balance training group. [Conclusion] The balance training group using Nintendo Wii
Fit Plus showed better results than the strengthening training group. Consequently, it is
recommended to add the balance training program of the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus to
conventional exercise programs to improve ankle muscle strength in functional ankle
instability at a low cost.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nintendo Wii Fit Plus</kwd><kwd>Functional ankle instability</kwd><kwd>Strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ankle sprain is the most frequent musculoskeletal disorder, which affects activities of
daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it can be
accompanied by a fracture and eventually has adverse effects on activities of daily
living<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Bendahou et
al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, ankle sprain is very frequent
among emergency room patients and generates considerable treatment costs. Functional ankle
instability (FAI) refers to the subjection state in which the subject feels giving way as a
result of repetitive ankle sprains<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The causes of FAI include lack of muscle force and lack of a sense of balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study on the relationship
between ankle instability and strength, Abdel-aziem and Draz<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the muscle torque ratio of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion
in chronic ankle instability increased compared to the control group, whereas the muscles
torque ratio of inversion and eversion decreased compared to the control group. Furthermore,
the eccentric muscle force was significantly lower in plantar flexion, inversion, and
eversion. Therefore, the recovery of normal ankle strength is a precondition for the
prevention and treatment of repetitive ankle sprains.</p><p>Exergames, which refer to video games that include elements for exercise, have been
developed recently, enabling subjects to participate actively in the games, unlike
conventional games in a sitting position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. As
exergames are gaining greater popularity among youth, they have become very influential in
health, education, and sports<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the most widely used video game these days is Nintendo Wii&#x02122;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nintendo Wii offers a wide variety of games, and Wii Fit
Plus is one of them. Wii Fit Plus is being used in various applications, including clinical
applications for subjects who need motor learning and feedback training<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in this study, the effects of a training
program in Nintendo Wii Fit Plus on the ankle muscle strength of subjects with FAI were
examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was conducted with subjects in their 20s (age = 23.3 &#x000b1; 2.4&#x02005;years) who had FAI
(gender = 4 male and 16 female; height = 163.1 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;cm; weight = 55 &#x000b1; 10.2&#x02005;kg). The
subjects were selected among those who had experienced an ankle sprain in the past, who
had no records of operations of their ankles, and who had not participated in other
rehabilitation programs. FAI was measured with the Cumberland ankle instability tool
(CAIT) and 20 subjects with a score of 24 or lower were selected (CAIT = 18.3 &#x000b1; 5.4
score). They were randomized to the strengthening training group and the balance training
group with 10 subjects in each, and they performed an exercise using the Nintendo Wii Fit
Plus for 20 minutes. Furthermore, every participant completed preparation and finishing
exercises for 5 minutes, respectively. The intensity of exercise was adjusted to the needs
of the subjects under the supervision of a physiotherapist.</p><p>This study was reviewed and received approval from the Gwangju Oriental Hospital of
Dongshin University beforehand (IRB No. DSGOH-019). The purpose and intent of this study
were explained to every participant who consented to voluntary participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus contains programs that aim to enhance muscle strength as well
as those that aim to enhance the sense of balance. For muscle strengthening exercise,
lunges, single leg extensions, sideways leg lifts, single leg twists, and rowing squats
were performed. In the lunges, a player began with a posture of lacing their fingers
behind his/her heads and had 90&#x000b0; flexion between the hip and knee joints of the former
leg, while keeping the torso straight. The rear foot was placed about two steps behind the
former foot, and the players had 90&#x000b0; flexion knee with the hip joint in slight flexion.
The more weight players put on the ankle, the higher the red gauge moved; the gauge had to
reach at least above the blue line. In the single leg extensions, players kept a flexion
condition of a single hip and knee joint while standing on the opposite leg. When moving
the bent leg in anterior-posterior ways, players naturally moved their arms in the
anterior-posterior direction while maintaining 90&#x000b0; flexion in the opposite side&#x02019;s elbow
and shoulder joints. In order to maintain the body&#x02019;s balance, the center of the body
needed to not deviate from the yellow part. In order to reinforce the ankle, the players
concentrated on the ankle when applying weight. In the sideways leg lifts, the players
began with a posture of standing on one foot and had an abduction of the arm and the
opposite side&#x02019;s leg as much as possible while maintaining the center of the body within
the boundary of the yellow part. To enhance muscle strength, the players concentrated on
their ankles. In the single leg twists, the players stood on one foot and maintained a
posture of bending the opposite hip and knee joints. At the same time, they lowered their
arms in a diagonal direction and twisted the body such that the back of the hand touched
the knee. In the rowing squats, the players repeated flexion and extension of both legs
concurrently with repetition of flexion and extension of both arms. The players flexed
their elbow joints as if gathering axilla in the center, while extending the shoulder
joint. The center of the body had to stay within the interior of the blue part, and the
knee had to avoid advancing before the toe.</p><p>For exercise that enhances balancing sense, participants headed soccer balls, tightrope
walked, table tilted, and slalomed on both snowboards and skis. In the soccer heading
activity, the players headed soccer balls by moving the center of the body left-right;
they could get higher scores in case of continuous headers. The players had to avoid any
objects other than soccer balls, and they were able to think ahead, as the number of
soccer balls remaining was displayed on the upper-left part of the screen. In the ski
slalom, the players passed flag marks in sequence by moving left-right and
anterior-posterior. The number of missed flags, elapsed time, and current speed were all
displayed on the screen. Moreover, the players could see how their center of gravity was
moving at the current time by looking at the screen. Time was measured upon reaching the
arrival point, and their final times were calculated by adding the time-converted number
of missed flags. In the tightrope walk, the players controlled the characters such that
they did not fall from the single stripe. When the body was tilted toward one side, the
player had to immediately balance toward the opposite side in order not to fall; they had
to do this as quickly as possible, since there was a time limit. Obstacles appeared
frequently in order to interrupt their progress, and their characters had to jump adeptly
to avoid them, after which balancing is important in the landing process. In the table
tilt, the players had to put a bead in holes by moving their bodies left-right and
anterior-posterior; the number of beads or difficulty level increased in the higher
stages. Moreover, the exercise required concentration, since there was a time limit. The
players could proceed to the next level once they cleared one stage. The snowboard slalom
began after standing the Wii Balance Board vertically, as if actually snowboarding; the
players could maintain their body balance by moving forward and backward while standing
sideways on the board. The players had to pass the flag marks in regular sequence in order
to obtain a high score; their final score was computed by adding up the times they took to
pass the flag marks, similar to the ski slalom.</p><p>The Biodex isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) was used to
measure the muscle strength of the ankle. For the measurement of plantar flexion and
dorsiflexion, the subject started from 40&#x000b0; plantar flexion, moved on to 20&#x000b0; dorsiflexion,
and then returned to plantar flexion in one cycle, and five cycles were measured for each
patient. For inversion and eversion, the subject started from 30&#x000b0; inversion, moved on to
20&#x000b0; eversion, and then returned to inversion as one cycle, and five cycles were measured
for each patient. The angular velocity was set to 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0;, and a one-minute recess
was given between different angular velocities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measure of ankle strength.

showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of plantar flexion at the angular
velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. This result was the same as the result of the
muscle strengthening exercise using Therabands for subjects with functional ankle
instability in their 20s, which increased plantar flexion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, this study found the muscle strength of plantar flexion could
be increased through Nintendo Wii Fit Plus training as well. The balance training group
showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of plantar flexion at the angular
velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. It seems the repetition of back and forth
movements in the balance exercises, such as Ski Slalom, Snowboard Slalom, and Table Tilt,
increased plantar flexion. This is also supported by previous studies that found the Ski
Slalom exercise allowed the repetitive learning of posture adjustment<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the gait analysis to determine the
importance of the exercise for plantar flexion, the delay of the maximum plantar flexion is
associated with ankle sprain. Therefore, continuous consideration of plantar flexion is
required for the effective rehabilitation of the ankle sprain<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The strengthening training group showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of
dorsiflexion at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. The weakening of
the muscle strength of dorsiflexion directly affects balance and gait, and the weakening of
the ankle muscle strength is the most common neuromuscular disorder<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it
is very meaningful that the muscle strength of dorsiflexion significantly increased in this
study from the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus training. The balance training group showed a
significant increase in the muscle strength of dorsiflexion at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0;
and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. This indicates the balance exercise of this study can help
strengthen the muscle strength of dorsiflexion. The weakening of dorsiflexion is a critical
element of recurring ankle sprain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Crosbie et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, the weakening of dorsiflexion slows down
the walking speed and shortens the step length and single support time, resulting in
asymmetry. Furthermore, it is particularly important as a predictor of the possibility of
gait<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering these facts, the
strengthening training of dorsiflexion is very important.</p><p>The balance training group showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of eversion
at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. This seems to be due to the
fact that the balance exercises of this study, i.e., Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Tight Rope
Walk, Table Tilt, and Snowboard Slalom, have many motions in the medial-lateral direction.
Son et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> insisted the ankle muscle
strength exercise had a positive correlation with balance, and this seems to be the reason
the balance training in this study improved muscle strength. However, the strengthening
training group showed no significant difference in the muscle strength of eversion at the
angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0;. The reason for this result seems to be that even though
Nintendo Wii Fit Plus can be used as a therapeutic tool for functional improvement, it was
originally designed for entertainment<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Among the five muscle strength exercises in this study, three exercises, i.e., Lunge, Single
Leg Extension, and Rowing Squat, seem to be related to the motions of dorsiflexion and
plantar flexion, whereas two exercises, i.e., Sideways Leg Lift and Single Leg Twist, seem
to be related to eversion, but these motions seem to be relatively insufficient. Therefore,
if programs to reinforce the motions of eversion, as well as those of dorsiflexion and
plantar flexion, could be added in the next revisions of Nintendo Wii Fit Plus, it could
achieve greater effects.</p><p>The balance training group showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of
inversion at the angular velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. Hess and
Woollacott<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
high-strength muscle strengthening training improved the balance of old people who had lost
their sense of balance. This indicates that muscle strength training and balance training
can influence each other. Therefore, it seems that the balance training games of Nintendo
Wii Fit Plus strengthened the inversion muscles by promoting movement in the medial-lateral
direction, as with the case of eversion in this study. The strengthening training group
showed no significant difference in the muscle strength of inversion at the angular
velocities of 60&#x000b0; and 120&#x000b0; after the exercise. This suggests the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus
training in this study has insufficient intervention effects on inversion and eversion.
Considering the results of this study, physical therapy approaches, such as Therabands and
resistance training, will be necessary to strengthen the muscles of eversion and inversion
in subjects with FAI. Even though the strengthening of eversion and inversion muscles was
insufficient in this study, the strength of these muscles is very important for gait. For
example, eversion must occur in the subtalar joint during the first 30&#x02013;35% of the gait
cycle, and inversion must occur in the subtalar joint for 15&#x02013;20% after the first 35% of the
gait cycle to allow for natural gait. Furthermore, the peroneus longus and brevis muscles
are often used for intervention in the inversion ankle sprain, because the eversion muscles
of the foot can give stability to the lateral surface of the ankle. However, these lateral
muscles need much attention because they are very weak for unexpected inversion, even though
they are at effective positions to resist inversion<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, further
studies on eversion and inversion are required to improve ankle instability.</p><p>This study has a few limitations. The natural ankle movement must occur at the oblique
axis, rather than separately in plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, eversion, and inversion, and
the terms pronation and supination are required for more accurate measurements. However, the
measurements of muscle strength in this study were insufficient because they were made on
the sagittal and horizontal planes. Future studies could present better results if they make
improvements in this regard. In conclusion, Nintendo Wii Fit Plus training increased the
muscle strength of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion in the strengthening training group, and
the muscle strength of plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, eversion, and inversion in the balance
training group. Thus, the balance training group showed better results than the
strengthening training group. Consequently, it is recommended to add the balance training of
Nintendo Wii Fit Plus to conventional exercise programs to improve ankle muscle strength at
a low cost.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by research funds from Gwangju University in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bridgman</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Clement</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Downing</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Population based epidemiology of ankle sprains attending
