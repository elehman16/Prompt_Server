<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) remains a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The incidence of CDI has increased over the last decade in the United States from 4.5 to 8.2 incidents per 1000 hospital discharges [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and epidemic strains, such as the North American pulsed-field type 1/restriction endonuclease analysis type B1/ribotype 027 (BI/NAP1/027) strain, have emerged [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, in a large US study, CDI recurrence occurred in ~14%&#x02013;21% of patients after treatment of the initial CDI episode [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a consequence of the incidence and impact of CDI, there remains a significant unmet need for additional CDI therapies, particularly those able to decrease posttherapy recurrence rates and increase sustained response.</p><p>Surotomycin ([SUR] CB-183,315; MK-4261) is a novel cyclic lipopeptide in development for the treatment of CDI. In phase 1 clinical trials, SUR &#x02264;1000 mg twice daily (BID) had only modest disruptive effects on healthy gut microbiota, sparing the natural barrier to <italic>C difficile</italic> colonization [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In phase 2 clinical trials, CDI cure rates were similar for SUR 125 mg BID, 250 mg BID, and oral vancomycin (VAN) 125 mg 4 times daily (QID). <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection recurrence rates were significantly lower after SUR 250 mg BID compared with VAN 125 mg QID [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The main objectives of this phase 3 clinical trial were to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of SUR 250 mg BID versus VAN 125 mg QID in adults with CDI.</p><sec id="s1"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial, consisting of 2 treatment arms (protocol MK-4261-005; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01597505), was conducted between July 28, 2012 and March 20, 2015 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the approval of local institutional review boards. All subjects provided written informed consent. The trial consisted of a 10-day treatment period (Day 1&#x02013;10) and follow-up visits 2 days after end of treatment ([EOT] Day 10&#x02013;13), Day 24 &#x000b1; 3 days, and Day 40&#x02013;50. During the treatment period, subjects received oral SUR 250 mg BID with alternate dummy tablets or the active comparator, oral VAN 125 mg QID. The primary endpoint of the trial was clinical response at EOT. Key secondary endpoints were clinical response over time and sustained clinical response 30&#x02013;40 days post-EOT.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Trial Population</title><p>Subjects were enrolled at 115 sites in North America (51 sites), Europe (62 sites), and the Middle East (2 sites). Eligible subjects were &#x02265;18 and &#x0003c;90 years of age, had diarrhea with a minimum of 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs), or &#x0003e;200 mL volume of stool (ie, for those with a collection device) over a 24-hour period before randomization/treatment administration. Furthermore, subject stool samples must have been <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin-positive within 48 hours of treatment administration, as identified by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or cell culture cytotoxin neutralization assay. Subjects with toxic megacolon and/or small bowel ileus or those who had received a fecal transplant or treatment for the current episode of CDI were excluded. Other exclusion criteria included subjects with &#x0003e;2 episodes of CDI within 90 days of trial therapy, a history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, or microscopic colitis), a positive stool culture for other enteropathogens, life-threatening illness at the time of enrollment as measured by a score of 4 using a modified Horn&#x02019;s index [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or a life expectancy of &#x0003c;8 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Randomization and Treatment</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment arms (1:1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) based on a centralized computer-generated randomization schedule and stratified by age (&#x0003c;75 or &#x02265;75 years of age) and number of prior CDI episodes (0 or &#x02265;1) in the last 90 days. Subjects, trial staff, and the sponsor remained blinded until the database was locked. An interactive voice/web response system was used for allocation of identification numbers and treatment kits.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Trial design.

In the SUR treatment arm, additional placebo dummy treatments were included to match the QID dosing regimen of VAN. Commercially available oral VAN tablets were backfilled with microcrystalline cellulose as a filler to prevent rattling and maintain the blind. During the 10-day treatment period, a single capsule was administered at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Clinical Outcomes</title><p>All subjects were evaluated for clinical response 2 days after the last dose of study drug, and all subjects continued to be assessed throughout the course of the study (ie, through the late follow-up visit, on Day 40&#x02013;50). A favorable clinical response (cure) was defined as resolution of diarrhea (ie, &#x02264;2 loose stools per 24 hours for 2 consecutive days) and no need for additional CDI treatment after the trial treatment period. If the treatment did not achieve a favorable clinical response, the outcome was deemed a failure. After initial cure, sustained clinical response was identified if there was no recurrence of CDI before the final follow-up visit (Day 40&#x02013;50). Recurrence was identified by a minimum of 3 UBMs over a 24-hour period (or &#x0003e;200 mL stool volume over 24 hours&#x02014;for those with a collection device) and positive detection of toxigenic <italic>C difficile</italic> from a stool sample.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Microbiology</title><p>Baseline and recurrent diarrhea stool samples were analyzed onsite for the detection of <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin. Stool samples were also analyzed for the presence of B1/NAP1/027-positive epidemic strains of <italic>C difficile</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Pharmacokinetic Evaluations</title><p>A selection of sites participated in an intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. At these sites, intensive blood and stool sampling occurred on Day 5&#x02013;7 over a dosing interval. Plasma and fecal SUR and VAN concentrations were determined by a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method (Tandem Laboratories, West Trenton, NJ and Salt Lake City, UT).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Adverse events (AEs), defined by the protocol as nonserious, were collected from first dose of trial treatment until 7 days after the last dose. Serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from the first dose until 30 days after the last dose. Vital signs (eg, heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature), physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory safety tests were measured throughout the trial. The safety population consisted of all randomized subjects who received any amount of study drug.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Data Analysis and Statistics</title><p>The 95%&#x02013;95% fixed margin approach was used to justify the noninferiority based on a meta-analysis of the medical literature. The selected clinically relevant noninferiority margin of 10% was demonstrated to preserve 51.7% of the active control effect. Assuming an 83% clinical response rate for both treatment arms, 258 subjects per arm would have at least 85% power to demonstrate SUR noninferiority versus VAN based on the 10% noninferiority margin and at a 1-sided significance interval of 0.025. Given that an expected 85% of randomized subjects would meet criteria to be included in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat population ([mMITT] all randomized subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI), a total of 304 subjects per arm were enrolled.</p><p>Noninferiority and superiority tests were conducted for clinical outcomes in the mMITT population. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for favorable clinical outcomes associated with the treatments. Noninferiority was identified when the difference between SUR and VAN arms 95% CI was &#x02265; &#x02212;10% and superior when the difference was &#x0003e;0%. Analyses were stratified by age (&#x0003c;75 or &#x02265;75 years of age) and previous episodes of CDI in the last 90 days (0 or &#x02265;1). The Kaplan-Meier method with a stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic> value was used to determine clinical response over time. All statistical tests were 2-sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level. Descriptive statistics were provided for continuous data. The PK analysis population consisted of subjects who provided at least 3 serial plasma samples postdosing on Day 5&#x02013;7. Individual plasma PK parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (version 6.3 or higher; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s11"><title>Trial Population</title><p>A total of 606 subjects were enrolled and randomized, 570 of whom had confirmed CDI (ie, 290 in the SUR arm and 280 in the VAN arm) and were included in the mMITT population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

The data from this phase 3 trial, which was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of SUR relative to VAN, demonstrated that SUR did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint (clinical cure at EOT) of noninferiority compared with VAN, nor did it meet the key secondary efficacy endpoints of clinical response over time and sustained clinical response superiority over VAN. Surotomycin demonstrated reduced CDI recurrence rates and improved clinical response for subjects with baseline BI/NAP1/027-positive samples compared with VAN, but these differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>Compared with the SUR phase 2 trial results [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the CDI clinical cure rates in the current trial were lower across treatment groups (86.6% and 89.4% for SUR 250 mg and VAN, respectively, in the phase 2 trial; 79.0% and 83.6%, respectively, in the current trial). In addition, the CDI recurrence rates were lower and clinical failure rates were higher in the current trial for both treatments compared with the SUR phase 2 trial [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The observed differences in these efficacy parameters may be due to the different inclusion criteria of the trials (phase 2 trial: &#x02265;4 UBMs were required for inclusion; current trial: &#x02265;3 UBMs) as well as differences in the definition of cure (phase 2 trial: defined as &#x0003c;4 UBMs per 24-hour period for at least 2 consecutive days; current trial: &#x02264;2 UBMs per 24-hour period for at least 2 consecutive days). Furthermore, in both the phase 2 and current trials, CDI diagnosis required only 1 toxin-positive result. More importantly, these diagnostic 1-step procedures reflected recommended methods at the time of protocol development. The most current CDI diagnosis recommendations include a 2-step procedure [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the cure rates at EOT, sustained clinical response, and CDI recurrence for VAN were similar to those of a previous phase 3 noninferiority trial for fidaxomicin [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this current trial, the sustained clinical response for both VAN and SUR was ~61% by the end of the trial (Day 40&#x02013;50); however, in the SUR phase 2 trial, sustained clinical response rates of 66.7% and 70.1% were reported for SUR 125 mg BID and 250 mg BID, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The lower sustained clinical response rate in the current study may be due to the longer follow-up period used in this trial (30&#x02013;40 days) compared with previous investigations (28 days) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of subjects from whom the epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain was isolated (~25%) was slightly lower than in previous trials, which report values closer to one third [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the current trial, among BI/NAP1/027 strain-infected subjects, there was a higher clinical cure rate at EOT, sustained clinical response at the end of the trial, and lower recurrence rate in the SUR group than the VAN group. Vancomycin administration was associated with more favorable outcomes for these 3 efficacy parameters than SUR for non-BI/NAP1/027-infected subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). In contrast, in the phase 2 trial, a numerically higher clinical cure rate was seen in the VAN group than in the SUR 250 mg group for subjects infected with BI/NAP1/027 strain (91.3% vs 71.4%); however, the clinical cure rates were comparable for non-BI/NAP1/027 strain-infected subjects in both groups (SUR, 91.5%; VAN, 89.5% [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). The differences in the BI/NAP1/027 strain-specific efficacy results may have contributed to the overall differences between the phase 2 and phase 3 SUR trial outcomes.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Clinical responses in subjects with infections deemed to be caused by (A) <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> BI/NAP1/027 and (B) non-BI/NAP1/027 <italic>C difficile</italic> strains at baseline (microbiological modified intent to treat population).

However, in this trial, the in vitro SUR spectrum of activity and modest perturbation of gut microbiota in vivo [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] was not associated with decreased CDI recurrence rates.

Approximately 40% of subjects ultimately failed CDI therapy for both SUR and VAN at the end of the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s17"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
