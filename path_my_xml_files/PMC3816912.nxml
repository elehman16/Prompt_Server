Clinical intervention trials using different agents in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients have shown various efficacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which indeed highlights the complexity of translation from animal models to human type 1 diabetes. A phase II trial with GAD<sub>65</sub> formulated with aluminum hydroxide (GAD-alum) showed efficacy in preserving residual insulin secretion in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, subsequent GAD-alum phase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and III trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) with different designs failed to reach their primary outcomes. Significant efficacy was shown in some prespecified subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), so it cannot be excluded that treatment with GAD-alum might be beneficial in certain patient subgroups, alone or in combination with other therapies.</p><p>A large number of different potential therapies have been evaluated in humans, but the effects on disease mechanisms remain unknown, and few immune correlates to clinical efficacy have been identified. Thus, to improve autoantigen treatment, it is of utmost importance to increase the understanding of the immunomodulatory effect of antigen-specific immunotherapy. In the previous phase II trial, GAD<sub>65</sub> antibody (GADA) levels increased and remained elevated in patients who received two injections of GAD-alum compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and a transient increase of GADA IgG4 and IgG3 subclasses was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In addition, the treatment induced an early Th2-associated response to GAD<sub>65</sub>, followed by a wide range of Th1- and Th2-associated cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These results suggest that an effect of GAD-alum could be mediated by induction of an early Th2-skewed immune response and generation of persistent GAD<sub>65</sub>-specific cellular and humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In the phase III trial, two additional doses of GAD-alum were administered to one of the treatment groups to evaluate whether this could improve the clinical effect.</p><p>Since the phase III study failed to reach primary outcome, a main question is why the efficacy differed from the previous phase II study. It is also important to assess if differences of the immunomodulation induced by GAD-alum could explain the variable outcomes in the two trials. Although the phase III trial was closed after 15 months, a majority of the Swedish patients completed their 21-month visit, and a subgroup of patients completed the 30 months of follow-up, and those patients were included in the current study. Here we aimed to characterize GADA and insulinoma antigen 2 autoantibody (IA-2A) levels, GADA IgG1&#x02013;4 subclass distribution, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine secretion, and proliferative responses.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects</title><p>The design and characteristics of the trial have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

The results of the trial showed that treatment with GAD-alum did not significantly reduce the loss of stimulated C-peptide or improve clinical outcomes over a 15-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The lack of clinical efficacy in the study was disappointing, but other recent trials have also failed to show efficacy, which highlights the difficulties to translate findings from animal models to humans. Indeed, the failure of recent GAD-alum III trials does not preclude the possibility that the treatment might be useful during prevention of type 1 diabetes in high-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and/or in combination therapies with complementary agents at onset of type 1 diabetes. Better understanding of the immunological effect of the treatment is crucial for further development of successful intervention or prevention therapies.</p><p>In line with our previous results from the phase II trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), GAD-alum had a specific immunomodulatory effect, indicated by in vitro cytokine production and proliferation upon GAD<sub>65</sub> stimulation. Cytokines play a key role in modulation of immune responses, and previous studies have suggested a shift from Th1 to Th2 as a mechanism of action of antigen-based immunotherapy in murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and human type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In contrast to our previous results showing an early Th2 immune deviation in response to GAD<sub>65</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the cytokine profile in the current study rather tended to switch from a wide spectrum of cytokines toward a more pronounced Th2-associated profile over time. Variations in the cytokine secretion between the studies could be explained by shorter time for in vitro antigen stimulation and usage of cryopreserved cells in the phase II study. However, when assessing the relative contribution of each cytokine, the cytokine profiles were similar in both trials. Thus, even if the early cytokine response differed between the two studies, the overall cytokine profiles resembled each other.</p><p>Treatment with GAD-alum raised GADA levels both in 2D and 4D patients, and after peaking at 3 months, the titers remained elevated throughout the study, which is in agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In addition, GADA IgG1&#x02013;4 subclass distribution remained similar in all groups until 9 months, when the proportion of IgG4 in the 4D group drastically increased in parallel to a decrease of IgG1, supporting the notion of an enhanced humoral Th2-like response by additional GAD-alum doses. Previous studies have shown that higher levels of GADA IgG4 were associated with slower progression to clinical onset of disease in at-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Furthermore, immunization with insulin promoted IgG4 in type 1 diabetic patients, an event interpreted to be associated with a Th2-like response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In the previous phase II trial, a transient IgG1 decrease together with an increase of IgG3 and IgG4 was detected in the 2D group compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the current study, a similar effect was observed only in the 4D group, but not in 2D patients. This inconsistency might be due to considerably shorter disease duration at inclusion of the patients in the phase III trial, and perhaps additional GAD-alum injections are required to affect the transforming humoral immune response observed close to disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Another difference was the significant increase of the GADA titers after receiving the first GAD-alum injection both in the 2D and 4D groups during the phase III trial, whereas in the previous phase II trial, enhancement of GADA was first detected after the second GAD-alum injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>During the current study, four doses of GAD-alum were administered to one of the arms, aiming to reinforce the effect of treatment. Even though absolute GADA titers followed a similar pattern in the 4D and 2D groups, the higher GADA fold change from baseline to 15 and 21 months observed in the 4D group suggests that additional doses amplify the GADA response. Another effect of additional doses was an increased proliferative response to GAD<sub>65</sub> in 4D compared with 2D at 15 months. In addition, cytokine levels were also higher in 4D at 9 months, i.e., 6 months after their third injection, and the levels continued to increase after the fourth dose. However, even though the levels of GAD<sub>65</sub>-induced cytokines were increased by extra injections of GAD-alum, the relative proportion of each cytokine was similar in the 2D and 4D patients. Thus, although additional doses of GAD-alum resulted in a stronger immune response, the phenotype of the immune response was similar in the 2D and 4D groups, and increased cytokine secretion was not related to clinical outcome. Further, the persistence in these GAD<sub>65</sub>-specific immune responses needs to be validated through future studies. Interestingly, a correlation between GADA fold change and the in vitro GAD<sub>65</sub>-stimulated cytokine secretion at 15 and 21 months in the 2D group suggests an association between GAD-alum&#x02013;induced humoral and cellular responses. However, this correlation was only observed in the 2D group, which might indicate that the two extra doses administered to 4D patients enhanced the GAD<sub>65</sub>-specific humoral immune response without simultaneously affecting the specific cellular response.</p><p>Although the European phase III study failed to reach primary end point, the treatment showed efficacy in some prespecified subgroups, including the non-Nordic countries, but not in the Nordic patients, completely dominated by Swedes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Immunological studies within the trial were, for practical reasons, only performed in the Swedes. However, since baseline characteristics of the Swedish patients did not differ from the complete cohort, results from this group should be representative for the entire study population.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment of recent-onset type 1 diabetic children and adolescents with two and four injections of GAD-alum had a specific effect on the immune response, including enhancement of GADA levels and a Th2-associated deviation of the cytokine profile<sub>.</sub> No specific immune marker associated with clinical efficacy could be identified.</p></sec>
