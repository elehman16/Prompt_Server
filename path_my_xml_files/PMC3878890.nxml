Despite its increasing popularity and safety, the abdominal donor site remains a major source of postoperative pain. Conventional postoperative pain relief protocol consists primarily of a patient-controlled anesthesia device delivering intravenous opioids. Opioids can cause numerous side effects such as sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and bladder and bowel dysfunction. A promising approach to provide postoperative pain control of the abdominal incision is the newly developed transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial designed to rigorously test the effectiveness of a transversus abdominis plane catheter delivering intermittent local anesthetic in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction. The primary objective of this study is compare the mean total opioid consumption in the first postoperative 48&#x000a0;hours between the control and study groups including the patient-controlled anesthesia amounts and oral narcotic doses converted to intravenous morphine equivalent units. The secondary outcome measures include the following parameters: total in-hospital cumulative opioid consumption; daily patient-reported pain scores; total in-hospital cumulative anti-nausea consumption; nausea and sedation scores; and Quality of Recovery score; time to first bowel movement, ambulation, and duration of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Autologous breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue is rapidly becoming the reconstructive option of choice for postmastectomy patients across North America. A substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after this abdominally based procedure is derived from the abdominal wall incision.

A substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after abdominally-based autologous tissue breast reconstruction is derived from the abdominal wall incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The conventional postoperative analgesic regimen following abdominally based autologous tissue breast reconstruction still primarily utilizes systemic opioids, which can cause sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, respiratory compromise, pruritus and bladder and bowel dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that adequate analgesia decreases the incidence of cardiopulmonary complications and in-hospital deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several authors have investigated methods of improving postoperative analgesia with the use of a local anaesthetic (LA) infusion catheter in the donor site following abdominal flap reconstruction of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date, the results have been mixed in these studies aimed at decreasing pain in the donor site following free muscle-sparing transversus abdominus myocutaneous (MS-TRAM) flaps or deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The use of peripheral nerve blocks has become increasingly popular over the past two decades. With the use of anatomical landmark-based techniques, novel types of nerve blocks have been designed to deliver effective and directed analgesia. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a newly developed block involving the T6-L1 intercostal nerves, which supply the anterior abdominal wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the TAP block, the lumbar triangle of Petit is used as a landmark for injecting LA into the neurovascular plane of the abdominal wall (the TAP plane) between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The triangle of Petit is configured with the iliac crest forming the base, the external oblique muscle being the anterior border and the latissimus dorsi muscle being the posterior border of the triangle. The floor of the triangle is made up of superficial fascia covering the transversus abdominis muscle. Both the blind TAP block and ultrasound-guided TAP block have been associated with minimal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recent published clinical trials involving patients who have undergone major abdominal and gynaecological surgery have demonstrated promising results with the use of this technique as part of multimodal postoperative pain treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our group recently published the results of a prospective cohort study that compared the total intravenous <italic>patient-controlled analgesia</italic> (PCA) opioid consumption between a group of 45 consecutive patients who received intermittent postoperative bolus injections of 0.25% bupivacaine through the TAP catheter and a group of 80 historic control patients who underwent the same abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction without TAP blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We found that the 48-hour PCA-delivered opioid requirement was significantly less (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in the TAP block group (17.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17.23&#x000a0;mg intravenous morphine equivalent) compared to the control group (48.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;39.53&#x000a0;mg). Although we concluded on the basis of data derived from our study that intermittent delivery of bupivacaine through the TAP block significantly reduced postoperative parenteral opioid requirements following abdominally based breast reconstruction, there are inherent biases associated with using historic controls. Therefore, we designed our present double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to rigorously assess the efficacy of reducing postoperative donor site pain by intermittently delivering a LA agent through the TAP catheter in patients undergoing breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue microsurgical reconstruction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT is a two-group parallel superiority trial.

The randomization allocation list will be developed by the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University Health Network Research Institute. Randomization allocation will be equal between the study groups and stratified by laterality of abdominal flap harvest (unilateral vs. bilateral) and the timing of breast reconstruction (at the same time as mastectomy (immediate) vs. at a later time, after the mastectomy (delayed)). Sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes containing the treatment assignments will be prepared and given to the study pharmacist.

This catheter will be introduced into the TAP incision and advanced into the transversus abdominis fascial plane. The fascial defect in the triangle of Petit will be repaired using a Polysorb 0 suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). The catheter is secured to the skin using OpSite Flexigrid tape (Smith &#x00026; Nephew, St Petersburg, FL, USA) to prevent accidental dislodgement.

With the use of anatomical landmark-based techniques, novel types of nerve blocks have been designed to deliver effective and directed analgesia. Because a substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after abdominally based autologous tissue breast reconstruction is derived from the abdominal wall incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], our study is designed to evaluate the analgesic usefulness of TAP blockade inserted under direct vision in the abdominal donor sites following free MS-TRAM or DIEP flap harvest. In contrast to other studies that have investigated methods of improving postoperative analgesia with the use of a local anesthetic infusion catheter in the donor site following TRAM or DIEP flap reconstruction of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], our study is the first to apply a true peripheral nerve block under direct vision. Furthermore, in our previously published prospective cohort study, we found the use of the TAP block to be both safe and efficacious in postoperative pain control of the abdominal donor site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. There were no surgical complications associated with the placement of the catheter, and no incidence of local anesthetic toxicity was observed. The TAP catheters were well-tolerated by patients, and there was only one patient request for early TAP catheter removal. The intervention was cost-effective at approximately $100 per patient. However, this earlier study was limited by several shortcomings. First, there was an inherent bias in the use of historic controls as the comparison group. Second, the loss of patients to analysis due to major postoperative complications was relatively high for a small series (11.1% in the TAP block group and 17.5% in the control group). Third, the large range of opioids consumed in both groups indicates that responses to pain, as well as the need for analgesics, are highly variable and difficult to compare between individual patients.</p><p>The strength of our current double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT design lies in its innovative approach by applying a well-studied, anatomically based peripheral nerve block to the novel setting of autologous breast reconstruction using the most scientifically rigorous methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. By potentially decreasing the need for systemic opioids and their associated side effects, this trial will have the potential to improve both clinical care and health outcomes in patients undergoing abdominally based breast reconstruction in North America. Furthermore, this proposal represents innovative collaborative work between the reconstructive surgeons and anesthetists on this project. The anesthetists introduced the novel technique of TAP block as a form of postoperative analgesic method, but it is the surgeons who are most familiar with the anatomical planes of the anterior abdominal wall. Another advantage of using the TAP block in the donor site following a free TRAM or DIEP harvest is that the TAP catheters can be inserted into the triangle of Petit under direct vision. In addition, Clinical equipoise exists in this trial because no prior RCTs have evaluated the efficacy of the TAP block in improving pain symptomatology following abdominally based, autologous tissue breast reconstruction.</p><sec><title>Risks and benefits</title><p>There are potential surgical risks associated with the insertion of a TAP catheter into the transversus abdominus plane. The minimal access incision over the triangle of Petit will be repaired using the same technique as that used for the rectus sheath repair, which is a part of the autologous tissue reconstruction procedure. Furthermore, the insertion of the TAP catheters under direct vision should theoretically be safer than the blinded technique or ultrasound-guided technique that is currently practiced by some anesthetists. To safeguard against possible bupivacaine toxicity, all patients with cardiac or liver disease will be excluded from the study. In addition, a member of the pain service as well as the study coordinator will check for early signs of central nervous system toxicity, such as perioral numbness and tingling, restlessness, anxiety, lightheadedness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, drowsiness and incoherent speech at 15&#x000a0;minutes, 30&#x000a0;minutes and 1&#x000a0;hour following each TAP bolus dose delivery. It has been found in previous studies that peak serum concentrations of LA in TAP blocks in most patients occurred at 30&#x000a0;minutes after injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>To avoid having a group of patients who will receive only the placebo fluid through the TAP catheter, we contemplated the use of a cross-over study design. Unfortunately, this design is not feasible in our study, because our local anesthetic, bupivacaine, is long-acting and requires at least a 12-hour washout period. Because the primary objective of our trial is to measure opioid consumption in the first 48&#x000a0;hours postoperatively, it is not possible to build into our study design a 12-hour washout period between administration of the study and placebo agents.</p><p>The proposed TAP block, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT represents the first RCT to assess the efficacy of the TAP block in improving pain symptomatology following abdominally based, autologous tissue breast reconstruction. The results of this trial have the potential to improve postoperative analgesic control for breast cancer patients undergoing this common type of major reconstructive surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The TAP Block RCT study began enrolment in September 2011 at Toronto General Hospital. At the date of manuscript acceptance, the trial has been enrolling participants for 24&#x000a0;months and close to accrual of the required sample. A total of 129 patients were eligible for participation, and 86 patients have been enrolled into the trial. Eligible patients who declined to participate were similar in all respects to the patients who agreed to participate. About 50% of the patients who declined to participate in the study did not provide a reason, 30% were ambivalent about being randomized and unsure about participation in the study and 10% to 20% indicated that they were too anxious and upset to consider entering a trial in addition to undergoing major reconstructive surgery. To date, there have been no major TAP catheter-related surgical complications and no instances of local anesthetic toxicity However, three patients experienced blocked TAP catheters that could not be used to deliver bolus injections, and two study patients received bupivacaine instead of the study medication in error.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DIEP: Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstruction; LA: Local anaesthetic; MS-TRAM: Muscle-sparing transversus abdominus myocutaneous flap reconstruction; OR: Operating room; PCA: Patient-controlled anaesthesia; QoR: Quality of recovery questionnaire; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; TAP: Transversus abdominis plane.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors do not have any competing interests, financial or otherwise, to report.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TZ conceived of and will co-lead the proposed trial, screen eligible patients, insert TAP catheters, participate in the analysis and interpretation of data and draft the manuscripts.
