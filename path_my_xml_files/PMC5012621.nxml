There is general agreement that ASD should be identified early so that adequate intervention can be initiated.<xref rid="b3-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement strongly recommending universal screening for autism in children by the age of 24 months.<xref rid="b6-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The rationale of the US Academy of Pediatrics recommendation about general autism screening is to establish a coordinated and effective organization of services. When establishing an ASD diagnosis, medical/genetic counseling, medical management, family support, educational interventions, and guidance to appropriate intervention programs for the child should be initiated.<xref rid="b6-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, in a UK statement by the National Health Service, there is a recommendation against universal screening.<xref rid="b7-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Allaby and Sharma<xref rid="b8-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> discussed many concerns against early screening for ASD; the main argument being that it is still unknown if interventions after early screening lead to significant improvements later in childhood, or greater independence and improved vocational and social functioning in adulthood. In addition, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force<xref rid="b9-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits of screening for ASD in children, that evidence is lacking for the population to be screened, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p><p>The most disseminated comprehensive intervention programs for children with autism are based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).<xref rid="b10-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The core elements of ABA include strategies such as discrete trail training, use of 1:1 adult to child interaction, implementation in either home or school settings for a range of 20 to 40 hours/week.<xref rid="b14-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>ABA is a frequently used intervention program within the Swedish Child Habilitation Services. The Early Start Denver Model integrates ABA with developmental and relationship-based approaches for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior<xref rid="b15-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and emphasizes the role of parents in the intervention program. This model has given important ideas to the Swedish Child Habilitation Services.<xref rid="b17-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), based on ABA, as an augmentative communication (ACC) system is frequently used in children with autism.<xref rid="b18-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Another early intervention program focusing on autism, centered on structured education, is the Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication handicapped CHildren subsumed under the TEACCH acronym.<xref rid="b19-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Up until recently, this was probably the most widely disseminated educational program for children, adolescents, and adults with autism and related social communication disorders.</p><p>Due to the heterogeneity of ASDs,<xref rid="b20-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> several factors will affect outcome. Ben-Itzchak et al<xref rid="b21-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> studied an Israeli research cohort of 46 children with ASD &#x02013; without genetic syndromes and with different cognitive levels &#x02013; who had received center-based intensive behavioral intervention (ABA) over a period of 2 years. When the impact of baseline cognitive ability on outcome trajectories was assessed, significant gains in adaptive skills were found only in the group of children with ASD and high cognitive scores (DQ &#x02265;70). Also, a Swedish study evaluating the outcome of early intensive behavioral intervention found that the subgroup of ASD without intellectual disability had a better 2-year outcome with regard to adaptive functioning compared to the group with ASD and concomitant intellectual disability.<xref rid="b22-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There was no association with intervention intensity either in this group or in the group with lower IQ.</p><p>Although randomized controlled trials are generally the most optimal method to evaluate treatment effects, there is also a need for outcome studies based on representative samples, studied in naturalistic settings.<xref rid="b23-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The aim of this prospective naturalistic study was to evaluate outcome in terms of adaptive behavior and global functioning. Another aim was to analyze the association with IQ and type of intervention (provided in a naturalistic setting within Child Habilitation Services) in a cohort of children who had been diagnosed with ASD after screening at the age of ~2.5 years and who had received 2 years of one of three different types of intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study area and original study cohort</title><p>The study area was the city of Gothenburg with ~500,000 inhabitants and about 6,000 births per year.

Data collection was made weekly with a view to increase naturalistic training possibilities and the child&#x02019;s need of support in 1:1 training. Protocols were used to control hours of training, based on individual plans and goals, and defined in collaboration with parents and preschool teachers. The intervention was planned and implemented for 2 years per child. IL was used in two different settings. The first was the regular form, which was implemented for parallel use at home and at the child&#x02019;s preschool. This program included sessions twice a month with supervisors, and the &#x0201c;1:1 intervention&#x0201d; included 10 hours at home and 15 hours at preschool/week (total 25 hours/week). The second setting was the modified form, which was implemented only at home and offered sessions once a month with supervisors.

The study had the advantages of ecological validity<xref rid="b23-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and consisted of the typical clinical process where cases referred from CHC had a comprehensive assessment and had been offered intervention within a short period from their first visit to the habilitation center.</p><p>The main finding of this study was that the type of intervention was not critical for outcome of adaptive and global functioning according to the results of Vineland adaptive composite score and C-GAS. Thus, treatment based on ABA did not differ from other types of interventions provided by the habilitation center or preschool. This is in accordance with the finding from a previous Swedish study, ie, type and intensity of intervention were not decisive for adaptive functioning outcome.<xref rid="b22-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, this is somewhat in contrast to a review by Leaf et al<xref rid="b34-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> highlighting the effects of early intensive behavioral intervention with regard to meaningful outcomes.</p><p>Our results differ from studies by Howard et al<xref rid="b42-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> comparing early ABA and eclectic interventions, reporting ABA to produce substantial improvements in young children with autism compared to common eclectic interventions, even when intensive. However, our findings accord with conclusions put forward by Odom et al in their review.<xref rid="b43-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> They reported a comparison of intensive behavioral treatment programs with eclectic interventions and concluded that eclectic programs had a positive impact on development, learning, and life outcomes in children and youth with autism when being well implemented. The recent large systematic review, including 65 unique studies of behavioral intervention for children with ASD, by Weitlauf et al<xref rid="b44-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> summarized that a growing evidence base suggests that behavioral interventions are associated with some positive outcomes in children with ASD; however, they also suggested that there is a need for studies of interventions across settings and with continued improvements in methodological rigor. The Cochrane report by Reichow et al<xref rid="b14-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> on early intensive behavioral intervention for young children with ASD emphasized the importance of different designs when studying outcomes, and that randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal, or only, design (also refer Fernell et al<xref rid="b24-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> for further details).</p><p>ASDs are complex and heterogeneous disorders and in the majority of children other coexisting developmental disorders are present, ie, &#x0201c;autism plus&#x0201d;,<xref rid="b45-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and sometimes these disorders are of greater importance for prognosis than the ASD per se. This means that outcome will be dependent on the total clinical presentation, including intellectual level,<xref rid="b21-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b46-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b47-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and on the underlying medical etiology. The diagnostic complexities were discussed by Volkmar and Reichow<xref rid="b48-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> who emphasized that even though the evidence-based research on treatment has increased in this young age group, the state of knowledge is limited.</p><p>Although the mean adaptive composite score did not change significantly between T1 and T2, the variance increased significantly. This probably reflects that gain and loss of adaptive skills varied considerably between children at the follow-up. This finding underscores the need for regular monitoring of the child&#x02019;s functioning and developmental progress/no progress during the intervention period and the necessity to consider a change or modification of the program in use.</p><p>Five of the children (7% of the total group) no longer met criteria for ASD at the 2-year-follow-up. However, it is important to note that these children were not necessarily less impaired than those who still met such criteria.<xref rid="b49-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> To minimize the stress of parents and children, it would be preferable to give children with developmental disorder access to clinical support for long periods regardless of diagnosis affiliation.</p><p>There are considerable clinical experiences and research supporting the importance of early identification, information to parents and preschool staff, and the need for appropriate interventions in all children with ASD to provide support to children and families, ie, an autism-friendly environment.<xref rid="b50-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>In our original cohort of children assessed at CNC after their 2.5-year screening at CHC, the group of children not meeting full criteria for ASD, but who had other Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations problems,<xref rid="b52-ndt-12-2255" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> did not get access to habilitation services. These children have also been followed up clinically and a substantial number have been found to meet ASD criteria at their T2 assessment (data will be detailed in a forthcoming study). This highlights the importance of providing all children with developmental disorders/problems/Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations problems with targeted interventions by a multi-professional team, along with clinical and medical follow-up, first of all to school age but also into school age.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study lie in the representativeness of the sample that was not selected, and that the study was conducted in a naturalistic setting. Moreover, all the children were assessed by the same research team using the same test methods at both T1 and T2, and the research group was blinded to the type of intervention given within the habilitation services. The limitations are mainly due to the relatively small intervention groups, attrition, and some parents declining intervention from habilitation services and/or declining the follow-up assessment. Other limitations are that the children were not randomized to the type of intervention, but the intervention was implemented according to clinical considerations and to parents&#x02019; and professionals&#x02019; assessment of the child&#x02019;s needs. Moreover, the therapists, ie, licensed child psychologists and licensed speech and language pathologists at the habilitation centers, provided interventions in a naturalistic clinical setting and there was no procedure in place to specifically assess treatment integrity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study of children, diagnosed with ASD after screening at the age of 2.5 years and assessed before and after intervention, showed a wide variability in terms of outcomes of adaptive and global functioning. Intervention group status was not associated with any of the chosen outcome variables. The variability in outcomes demonstrates the need for continuous assessments and evaluation of the child&#x02019;s function and behavior throughout the intervention period, and that programs and methods may need modification.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the children and their parents for participating in the study.
