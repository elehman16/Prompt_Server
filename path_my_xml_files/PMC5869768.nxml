Both an acute bout of exercise and chronic endurance training can have beneficial effects on outcomes that are important for health, such as insulin action. Earlier work by Hagobian and Braun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported rapid metabolic dysregulation following 3 days of overfeeding without structured exercise in a cohort of habitually active participants. Importantly, however, a single bout of moderate-intensity exercise restored insulin responses to baseline despite additional overfeeding on the final day to match energy expended during exercise. This finding presents the interesting possibility that exercise has the potential to impact metabolism independent of any effect on energy balance. In order to understand and isolate how exercise exerts its effects on metabolism, it is critically important to conduct studies where energy status is carefully controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Human models where physical activity/exercise and energy balance are manipulated offer an opportunity to tease apart the impact of exercise above and beyond its impact on energy balance and/or adiposity. One of the most powerful ways to examine this question is through a deliberate attempt to create an energy surplus with and without various forms of physical activity.</p><p id="Par16">Various studies have investigated the impact of reduced physical activity on health outcomes in healthy, active individuals. Both short-term and longer-term physical inactivity, induced by restricting structured exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or by reducing the daily number of steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have consistently led to a decrease in insulin sensitivity. More extreme bed-rest studies have also shown how complete physical inactivity can reduce insulin sensitivity and alter the skeletal muscle transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Numerous studies have investigated the impact of positive energy balance induced through overfeeding of varied duration and composition on metabolic outcomes. Excessive energy intake impairs insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and alters adipose gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome result from a chronic state of energy imbalance created by low physical activity and/or an excessive energy intake. It is remarkable that very few studies have used experimental models to investigate the joint impact of both factors applied concurrently.</p><p id="Par17">The combination of overfeeding and decreased physical activity can impair glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our previous work has shown that short-term overfeeding combined with reduced physical activity induces a state of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and altered expression of key genes within adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The addition of daily <italic>vigorous-intensity running</italic> mostly prevented these changes independent of any net effect on energy imbalance. Whilst running involves a large muscle mass and has the potential to expend many calories (potentially providing a route of disposal for excess glucose), it is unknown whether other forms of physical activity have the same impact. Alternative forms of exercise may be more appropriate for or preferred by specific populations.</p><p id="Par18">The objectives of the proposed study are to evaluate three alternative but energy-matched physical activity/exercise models:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">To establish whether a daily bout of <italic>vigorous-intensity upper-body exercise</italic> can prevent negative changes in metabolic function induced by short-term overfeeding and reduced physical activity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">To establish whether a daily bout of <italic>moderate-intensity treadmill walking</italic> can prevent negative changes in metabolic function induced by short-term overfeeding and reduced physical activity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">To establish whether <italic>several short bouts of walking</italic> throughout the day can prevent negative changes in metabolic function induced by short-term overfeeding and reduced physical activity</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par22">To address these objectives, a cohort of 48 healthy young men who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below will be recruited via advertisement from the local community.

Participants will then be assigned a specific number of steps to complete each day of the intervention period to match the energy expended during exercise if they had been allocated to the SUR + MOD group. This will be achieved by intermittent short bouts of walking during waking hours in the SUR + BREAKS group instead of a single bout for the SUR + MOD group and an additional allowance of 4000 steps day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to account for permissible residual physical activity as in the other groups. To monitor this, pedometers will be worn each day during the intervention period to record the total step count. Pedometers will be worn by all other groups to measure adherence to the permitted 4000 steps day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Main trial day protocol</title><p id="Par58">The same experimental procedures will be completed on both baseline and follow-up trial days. During 3 days leading up to the intervention week, volunteers will be asked to adhere to their habitual lifestyle (i.e. diet and physical activity/exercise), and all participants will be asked to perform a 30-min bout of running the day before starting the intervention before 1400 h at their usual running pace. This will ensure that the last bout of exercise will have been standardised for all participants. On the morning of the baseline trial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), participants will report to the laboratory at 0700 &#x000b1; 0.5 h following an overnight fast (&#x02265;10 h).

Importantly, the addition of daily vigorous-intensity running mostly prevented these changes independent of any net effect on energy imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The three exercise models in the present study will enable us to compare the benefits of different physical activity/exercise approaches in the context of increased caloric intake and reduced physical activity. Specifically, the comparison of the SUR + ARM group versus the SUR group will help us establish whether vigorous upper-body exercise has the ability to prevent negative changes in metabolic function induced by short-term overfeeding and reduced physical activity, which may be relevant to wheelchair users. Furthermore, the SUR + MOD and SUR + BREAKS groups will allow us to determine whether moderate-intensity exercise has a similar impact on metabolic health as vigorous-intensity running and whether the same benefits can be gained from distributing that amount of exercise throughout the day. These alternative forms of exercise may be more appropriate for or preferred by specific populations. This study will provide a novel insight regarding the potential of different forms of daily exercise at preserving metabolic function at the whole-body level as well as within adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in the face of a standardised energy surplus. Our analysis will focus on genes and proteins known to be significantly impacted by a week of overfeeding and/or reduced physical activity within both tissues. This approach will help elucidate the mechanisms by which exercise benefits physiological function and human health even in the face of a considerable energy surplus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par66">Protocol version 1 dated 13 November 2014.
