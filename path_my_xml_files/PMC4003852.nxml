However, no large randomized, controlled studies providing scientific evidence of the benefits of their use have been made. The aims of this study are to develop and validate a smartphone application, and to evaluate the effect of adding this tool to a standardized intervention designed to improve adherence to the Mediterranean diet and to physical activity. An evaluation is also made of the effect of modifying habits upon vascular structure and function, and therefore on arterial aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group clinical trial will be carried out. A total of 1215 subjects under 70&#x000a0;years of age from the EVIDENT trial will be included. Counseling common to both groups (control and intervention) will be provided on adaptation to the Mediterranean diet and on physical activity. The intervention group moreover will receive training on the use of a smartphone application designed to promote a healthy diet and increased physical activity, and will use the application for three months. The main study endpoints will be the changes in physical activity, assessed by accelerometer and the 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) interview, and adaptation to the Mediterranean diet, as evaluated by an adherence questionnaire and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Evaluation also will be made of vascular structure and function based on central arterial pressure, the radial augmentation index, pulse velocity, the cardio-ankle vascular index, and carotid intima-media thickness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Confirmation that the new technologies are useful for promoting healthier lifestyles and that their effects are beneficial in terms of arterial aging will have important clinical implications, and may contribute to generalize their application in favor of improved population health.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02016014">NCT02016014</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Food</kwd><kwd>Information and communication technologies</kwd><kwd>Arterial aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Benefits of physical activity</title><p>There is abundant scientific evidence of the biological and psychological benefits of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the other hand, low cardiopulmonary fitness is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity-mortality, while improved physical fitness is associated with a decrease in mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The results of a metaanalysis on the influence of physical activity upon blood pressure indicate a mean reduction of 3.8&#x000a0;mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 2.6&#x000a0;mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aerobic exercise could attenuate arterial hardening as observed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, in which male athletes had a lesser pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx) and SBP than sedentary individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Improvement in carotid artery elasticity has also been recorded in previously sedentary subjects who started a physical exercise program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Aerobic exercise has been related to a decrease in atherosclerosis progression in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The results of the first phase of the EVIDENT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have demonstrated an association between physical exercise and improved vascular structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An association has also been reported between the time people spend seated and mortality. However, the results are even more relevant on combining the time spent seated (6&#x000a0;hours a day) with low physical activity (&#x0003c; 24.5 METS/hours/week), yielding a relative risk (RR) of 1.94 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.70-2.20) for women and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.33-1.65) for males, as opposed to those who spend less time seated and have greater activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The EVIDENT study has also found increased arterial stiffness to be related to the number of hours spent watching television [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, physical activity shows an inverse correlation to the concentrations of fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions for increasing physical activity</title><p>Although there is abundant evidence of the benefits of physical activity, the percentage of individuals who may be considered active is low in our setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of sedentarism reaches 60% in males and 74% in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while in Spain the PEPAF (Experimental Program for Physical Activity Promotion) recorded a 75% sedentarism rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Different methods have been used in an attempt to promote physical activity, though with conflicting results. A Cochrane review concluded that there are no data to support the hypothesis that multiple-component community-based procedures are effective in increasing the physical activity of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A recent metaanalysis of studies in the primary care setting has concluded that the promotion of physical activity in sedentary subjects increases the number of individuals who are classified as active subjects after 12&#x000a0;months (odds ratio (OR): 1.42; 95% CI: 1.17-1.73), though the effect has not been demonstrated over the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The PEPAF study intervention resulted in an increase in physical activity versus the controls of 18&#x000a0;min./week (95% CI: 6&#x02013;31&#x000a0;min./week), with a rise in METS/hours/week of 1.3 [95% CI: 0.4-2.2]. The proportion of individuals reaching the recommended minimum physical activity was 3.9% greater in the intervention group (1.2% to 6.9%) than in the control series. Few randomized, controlled clinical trials have evaluated the impact of interventions in terms of a decrease in sitting time, though an intervention designed to promote walking while working was able to reduce the daily sitting time by 21&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Evidence is even more limited in populations with chronic diseases, though an intervention in type 2 diabetics has recorded a reduction in daily sitting time of 23&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Benefits of the Mediterranean diet</title><p>The Mediterranean diet is presently regarded as the model of most healthy diet. It reflects the traditional eating habits of countries such as Greece, southern Italy and Spain. The main characteristics of this diet are: a) important consumption of cereals, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables; b) use of olive oil for cooking purposes and for the dressing of salads and vegetables (representing the main source of fat in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids); c) moderate to high consumption of fish; d) moderate to low consumption of chicken and dairy products; e) low consumption of red meats and meat products; and f) moderate alcohol consumption, mainly in the form of red wine with meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is convincing evidence that the Mediterranean diet may have a positive effect upon endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and can lower peripheral blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A correlation has also been established with vascular structure, as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], as well as with decreased mortality due to any cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and, more specifically, due to coronary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The results of the EVIDENT I study found obese males to show the poorest adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions for improving eating habits (Mediterranean diet)</title><p>Few intervention studies with the Mediterranean diet have been carried out. A randomized clinical trial (the Lyon Diet Heart Study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], involving a modified model of the Mediterranean diet versus a control diet, concluded that the Mediterranean diet is associated with a marked reduction in cardiovascular mortality and in the incidence of cardiovascular complications among patients who have suffered myocardial infarction. However, prior to publication of the PREDIMED (Prevention with Mediterranean Diet) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], no randomized clinical trial had investigated whether the effects of the Mediterranean diet are superior to those of a low-fat diet in relation to the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The PREDIMED study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was designed to determine whether the Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts prevents the development of major cardiovascular complications in high vascular risk individuals, compared with a low-fat diet. In its initial phase, this study recorded an average increase of 1.8 points on the 14-point scale assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet, versus an increase of 0.3 points in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. During the first year, this implied a decrease in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components and in the incidence of diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, after four years of follow-up, the subjects in the intervention groups (Mediterranean diet) showed a 30% decrease in the incidence of major cardiovascular complications versus the control series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of arterial aging</title><p>Aging is associated with increased arterial stiffness, which can be evaluated with different clinical and biological tools. The accepted gold standard for assessing arterial stiffness is the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which has been correlated to increased morbidity-mortality in both patients with cardiovascular disease and in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Central arterial pressure has also been shown to be more strongly correlated to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than peripheral blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The central and peripheral augmentation indexes are markers of arterial stiffness which together with aortic systolic pressure and aortic pulse pressure complement the information afforded by pulse wave velocity. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) also evaluates arterial stiffness, and is able to estimate the risk of atherosclerosis and vascular age. This parameter moreover is independent of arterial pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Information technology as a support for improving health</title><p>Considering the trend in recent years in the use of mobile telephones, and the recent introduction of smartphones, it can be estimated that within 10&#x000a0;years, a full 80-90% of the population in developed countries will have one of these devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and probably with many more applications than are available today. Information technology is finding many applications in the field of health and Medicine. Recently, short message service (SMS) communication has demonstrated its usefulness in helping people to stop smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Smartphone applications designed to assist healthcare personnel both in training and in decision making processes in daily clinical practice and in emergency care are increasing, and there is already some evidence of their usefulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Such applications have also been used in patient care for monitoring biological parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], detecting falls in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], preventing cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and monitoring diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], as well as in cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and also in the promotion of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and the management of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Communication based on the use of mobile phones, and especially smartphones, has a strong potential to transform healthcare and clinical interventions in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, its effectiveness needs to be evaluated in multicenter clinical trials, as recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in a way similarly to what is done with drug substances. A metaanalysis of the use of information technology in dietetic evaluation has concluded that it could improve dietary assessment in some population groups, though improved validity and reliability is required in evaluating micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Many applications have been developed in the field of health, and specifically in relation to diet and exercise, destined for use by the general population. Although the acceptance and ease of use of such applications has been evaluated among young adults for the registry of eating habits and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], they have not been tested in other population types, and little is known of their effectiveness in relation to health outcomes. Few studies have validated these tools, though some investigations are presently in course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Even less work has been done to explore the impact of such applications in relation to increased physical activity and improved eating habits, and hence in terms of improvement of the health of the people who use them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>The present study aims to provide evidence of the effect which the new information and communication technologies, and specifically smartphone applications, could have as tools supporting changes in favor of more healthy lifestyles. An evaluation is also made of the effect of such changes upon arterial aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The first objective of this study is to develop and validate a smartphone application supporting standardized counseling to increase physical activity and adapt eating habits to the recommendations of the Mediterranean diet. The second and central objective of the study is to quantify the effect attributable to the developed smartphone application in terms of the modification of habits, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and increased physical activity. Lastly, an evaluation is made of the effect of the modification of habits upon vascular structure and function, and therefore on arterial aging.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial involving two parallel groups, designed to evaluate the possible effects of adding an information and communication tool (intervention) in support of behavioral and educational counseling (control) to promote increased physical activity and adaptation of eating habits to the Mediterranean diet.</p><p>The study will include 6 groups of the Research Network on Preventive Activities and Health Promotion (REDIAPP) in Bilbao, Cuenca, Zaragoza, Valladolid, Barcelona and Salamanca (Spain), as a continuation of the EVIDENT project developed in 2010&#x02013;2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><sec><title><italic>Study population</italic></title><p>The study population will be selected from the EVIDENT project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], comprising 1,553 subjects randomly selected in the primary care setting.

The rest of the subjects will be randomised on a centralized basis from Salamanca using the Epidat 4.0 software package to intervention (IG) and control groups (CG) with a ratio of 1/1. Of the 1553 subjects, it is estimated that 10-15% will be excluded; the resulting sample therefore will comprise 1,350 individuals. We estimate that another 10% will reject participation, i.e., we expect to include at least 1,215 subjects in the final sample.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Sample size</italic></title><p>Estimation of sample size has been made for the main study endpoints.

The tool is a smartphone application with a user-friendly environment that is easy for adults to handle. It can be used to quickly evaluate the adaptation of living habits to healthy lifestyle recommendations referred to both eating and physical activity. An evaluation will be made of the quantity and quality of food intake according to standardized references, with the purpose of assessing adaptation of the eating habits of the individual to the Mediterranean diet. Based on adequate proportions of primary food elements, a personalized recommendation will be produced, depending on the entered intake characteristics. The application will generate detailed information on the eating deviations (diet composition and calories), with a view to facilitating changes in habits. Physical activity also will be evaluated, using an accelerometer included in the smartphone application, and which will count the steps taken over a period of 24&#x000a0;hours. The activity reported by the subject during periods in which the device is not used (e.g., swimming and other sports) also will be considered, assessing compliance with the exercise objectives and providing recommendations to increase activity and reach the target of 10,000 steps a day defining an active individual. A balance of activity and diet compliance will be made at the end of the day, and specific recommendations will be produced for the next day/days. The information will be stored in the device and will be downloaded on occasion of the control visits for subsequent analysis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Smartphone application (APP) EVIDENT II</bold>, <bold>main screen and physical activity.</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-14-254-1"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Smartphone application (APP) EVIDENT II, nutrition screens.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-14-254-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title><italic>Physical activity</italic></title><p>Physical activity will be measured by an accelerometer and by the 7-day physical activity recall (PAR).

ActiGraph is a monitor that uses a piezoelectric acceleration sensor to filter and convert the signals produced from the sensor in samples collected at a preset frequency in hertz. The samples are summed over a user-specified time sampling interval, called an &#x0201c;epoch&#x0201d;. Output from the ActiGraph is in the form of activity &#x0201c;counts,&#x0201d; where one count is equivalent to 16 milli-g per second, and where g is equal to 9.825&#x000a0;m&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;s&#x02009;-&#x02009;2, the acceleration of gravity.

Inclusion criteria will be a minimum of 4&#x000a0;days of recording, including at least 1 weekend day and at least 600 registered minutes per day. The main outcome variable from the activity monitor will be the average intensity of physical activity (counts/minute), calculated with equal weighting given to each day (regardless of registered time per day). The intensity of physical activity will be determined according to the cut-off points proposed by Freedson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], sedentary (&#x0003c;100 counts/minute), light (100&#x02013;1952 counts/minute), moderate (1952&#x02013;5724 counts/minute) vigorous (&#x0003e;5724 counts/minute) and very vigorous (&#x0003e;9498 counts/minute).

It consists of a semi-structured interview (10-15&#x000a0;minutes) in which participants provide an estimate of the number of hours dedicated to physical or occupational activities requiring at least a moderate effort in the past seven days. The categories collected are moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous physical activity. The amount of time dedicated to each activity is multiplied by the mean metabolic equivalents (METs) of each category: light activity 1.5, moderate 4, vigorous 6, and very vigorous 10. The sum of the products of the hours dedicated to each activity and its estimated mean energy expenditure (MET) provides an estimation of the kilocalories per kilogram used per day (kcal*kg-1 * d-1). The dose of physical exercise will be estimated in METs/hour/week and active persons were considered as those doing at least 30&#x000a0;minutes of moderate activity, five days a week, or at least 20&#x000a0;minutes of vigorous activity, 3&#x000a0;days a week or 450 MET&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;min&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;wk<sup>-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].
