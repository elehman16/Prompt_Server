WHO recommends intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). However, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) efficacy is threatened by high-level parasite resistance. We conducted a trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of scheduled intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as an alternative strategy to IPTp-SP.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This was an open-label, two-arm individually randomized superiority trial among HIV-seronegative women at three sites in Malawi with high SP resistance. The intervention consisted of three or four scheduled visits in the second and third trimester, 4 to 6 wk apart. Women in the IPTp-SP arm received SP at each visit. Women in the intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy with DP (ISTp-DP) arm were screened for malaria at every visit and treated with DP if RDT-positive. The primary outcomes were adverse live birth outcome (composite of small for gestational age, low birthweight [&#x0003c;2,500 g], or preterm birth [&#x0003c;37 wk]) in paucigravidae (first or second pregnancy) and maternal or placental plasmodium infection at delivery in multigravidae (third pregnancy or higher). Analysis was by intention to treat.</p><p>Between 21 July 2011 and 18 March 2013, 1,873 women were recruited (1,155 paucigravidae and 718 multigravidae). The prevalence of adverse live birth outcome was similar in the ISTp-DP (29.9%) and IPTp-SP (28.8%) arms (risk difference = 1.08% [95% CI &#x02212;3.25% to 5.41%]; all women: relative risk [RR] = 1.04 [95% CI 0.90&#x02013;1.20], <italic>p</italic> = 0.625; paucigravidae: RR = 1.10 [95% CI 0.92&#x02013;1.31], <italic>p</italic> = 0.282; multigravidae: RR = 0.92 [95% CI 0.71&#x02013;1.20], <italic>p</italic> = 0.543). The prevalence of malaria at delivery was higher in the ISTp-DP arm (48.7% versus 40.8%; risk difference = 7.85%, [95% CI 3.07%&#x02013;12.63%]; all women: RR = 1.19 [95% CI 1.07&#x02013;1.33], <italic>p</italic> = 0.007; paucigravidae: RR = 1.16 [95% CI 1.04&#x02013;1.31], <italic>p</italic> = 0.011; multigravidae: RR = 1.29 [95% CI 1.02&#x02013;1.63], <italic>p</italic> = 0.037).

In sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (IPTp-SP) for HIV-seronegative women. The effectiveness of IPTp-SP to clear peripheral parasitemia decreases in areas where parasites are resistant to SP; this resistance results from a series of mutations in the parasite genes that encode the targets of pyrimethamine (<italic>dhfr</italic>) and sulfadoxine (<italic>dhps</italic>). For example, in settings where &#x0003e;90% of parasites harbor high-level SP resistance encoded by five mutations in <italic>dhfr</italic> and <italic>dhps</italic>, up to 40% of asymptomatic parasitemic women who receive SP for IPTp are parasitemic again by day 42, reflecting the failure of SP to clear existing plasmodium infections and prevent new infections [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, even in these high resistance settings, SP retains some beneficial effect on birthweight [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, an additional mutation at codon 581 in <italic>dhps</italic> is emerging in parasites in East Africa that renders IPTp-SP unable to inhibit parasite growth and may significantly compromise IPTp-SP when present [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, alternative approaches are required to prevent malaria during pregnancy.</p><p>Most of the proposed alternative drugs to replace SP are too poorly tolerated for IPTp use, including amodiaquine alone or combined with SP [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], mefloquine monotherapy [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the fixed-dose combination of chloroquine-azithromycin [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A proposed alternative strategy to IPTp consists of scheduled antenatal testing with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and the treatment of RDT-positive women with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), referred to as intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In West African settings, where parasite resistance to SP is low, ISTp with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) (ISTp-AL) was not inferior to IPTp-SP in reducing low birthweight and was well-accepted by providers and patients [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, in these studies, women in the ISTp-AL arm had lower mean birthweights and more clinical malaria during pregnancy.</p><p>We hypothesized that, owing to widespread parasite SP resistance, ISTp with the ACT dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) would be superior to IPTp-SP for the prevention of the adverse sequelae of malaria in pregnancy. However, a recent trial in an area with high levels of malaria transmission and parasite resistance to SP in western Kenya showed that ISTp with DP (ISTp-DP) was not superior to IPTp-SP and was associated with increased incidence of clinical malaria and malaria infection [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These findings need to be confirmed urgently in other areas that have high levels of parasite resistance to SP.

The study statistician remained blinded until after database lock and approval of the statistical analysis plan by the data and safety monitoring board.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Procedures</title><p>At enrollment, demographic, socioeconomic, and educational information was collected, a medical and obstetric history taken, and the gestational age ascertained by ultrasound. A 5-ml venous blood sample was taken for malaria microscopy, PCR, immunology, and testing for syphilis, HIV serostatus, and hemoglobin concentration (Hemocue). All women received a long-lasting insecticide-treated net.</p><p>Participants were randomized to receive either IPTp-SP or ISTp-DP, at enrollment and all subsequent scheduled antenatal visits. The IPTp-SP arm received three tablets of SP (500 mg/25 mg sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets). If they had fever or history of fever, they were tested for malaria by RDT. RDT-positive women were treated with AL and then received their first course of SP during the first scheduled follow-up visit. Women in the ISTp-DP arm were screened for malaria using the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)/plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) combination RDT (First Response Malaria pLDH/HRP2 Combo Test, Premier Medical Corporation). All RDT-positive women in the ISTp-DP arm received a standard 3-d course of DP (Eurartesim, Sigma Tau; 40 mg/320 mg dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine tablets) at a dose of 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 tablets for women weighing &#x0003c;50, 50&#x02013;59, 60&#x02013;69, and &#x02265;70 kg, respectively. All SP and DP doses were provided with a slice of dry bread as directly observed therapy. All doses in both arms were supervised. In case of vomiting within 30&#x02013;60 min, the full dose was repeated. If the repeat dose was vomited, the women received AL. Sigma Tau provided the Eurartesim free of charge.</p><p>The follow-up schedule consisted of three or four scheduled antenatal visits every 4 to 6 wk: four if enrolled at 16&#x02013;24 wk gestation or three if enrolled at &#x02265;25 wk gestation. At each such visit, a clinical and obstetric examination was conducted, and a blood sample taken for RDT (ISTp-DP arm), malaria microscopy, and PCR. Hemoglobin was assessed during the last scheduled visit. Women were encouraged to make unscheduled visits if they felt ill or were concerned about their pregnancy. In the IPTp-SP arm, women with uncomplicated clinical malaria (fever/history of fever and RDT-positive) during or in between scheduled visits received AL. Women with uncomplicated malaria in the ISTp-DP arm received DP, or AL if they had received DP within the previous 4 wk.</p><p>At delivery, a maternal venous sample was taken for the same malaria metrics, and a placental and cord-blood sample for histology, RDT, microscopy, and PCR. Children were weighed and the gestational age assessed using the modified Ballard score [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Log binomial regression was used for binary endpoints to obtain relative risk (RR) values and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The identity-link function was used to obtain risk differences. Linear regression was used for continuous variables, and results expressed as mean difference (95% CI). The unadjusted analysis, stratified by gravidity (pauci- and multigravidae), was considered the primary analysis. Secondary, covariate-adjusted analyses for the primary endpoints were conducted using seven prespecified covariates (in addition to gravidity and site) and simple imputation for missing covariates (&#x0003c;1%). These same covariates were included in subgroup analyses. Poisson regression with time of follow-up as an offset was used for count variables to obtain incidence rate ratios (95% CIs). A two-sided <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 was used to define statistical significance. The intention to treat (ITT) analytical population was defined as all eligible women who were randomized and contributed to the outcome. The per protocol population included women who attended every scheduled visit, who took all the daily study doses on each occasion, and who contributed to the endpoint. For the safety analysis, women in the ISTp-DP arm were considered overall and split by recipients and non-recipients of DP (i.e., those who were RDT-negative throughout).

Although the relative increase in malaria risk was modest, this affected an additional eight out every 100 pregnancies. These results suggest that ISTp-DP may not be a suitable alternative strategy to replace IPTp-SP in settings similar to ours and may even predispose to unfavorable pregnancy outcomes in these settings.</p><p>The results may not be representative of areas where &#x0003e;10% of parasites harbor the &#x0201c;sextuple mutant&#x0201d; haplotype carrying the <italic>dhps</italic> A581G mutation [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; however, our efficacy findings are similar to those reported recently from areas in western Kenya [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with similarly high transmission (malaria prevalence detected by PCR at enrollment 33% versus 44% in this study) and SP resistance (5.8% <italic>dhps</italic> A581G mutation), and are also consistent with two previous non-inferiority trials conducted in West Africa, despite marked geographic differences in prevailing SP resistance, which is low in West Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In both West African studies, ISTp was non-inferior to IPTp-SP in the reduction in low birthweight among paucigravidae; mean birthweights were higher in the IPTp-SP recipients than in those receiving ISTp-AL (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but there was no significant difference compared to those receiving ISTp with amodiaquine-artesunate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06) [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, the incidence of clinical malaria was higher in the ISTp-AL arm compared to the IPTp-SP arm. This was not observed in our trial, but the trial in western Kenya also observed higher incidence of clinical malaria as well as of plasmodium infection during pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Because DP has very high anti-parasitic efficacy in Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the lack of superiority of ISTp-DP may result either from the ineffectiveness of ISTp as a strategy in high malaria transmission areas or from the continued effectiveness of IPTp-SP despite prevalent SP resistance. To this latter point, in our study area in Malawi, 99.5% of parasites harbor the &#x0201c;quintuple mutant&#x0201d; haplotype, but only 2.6%&#x02013;4% carry the additional <italic>dhps</italic> A581G mutation [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that IPTp-SP continued to provide some benefits, as has been observed in settings with similar parasite populations [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Another factor likely contributing to continued effectiveness of IPTp-SP was our use of the frequent dosing regimen [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] now recommended by WHO, which may mitigate the shortening of posttreatment prophylaxis that results from SP resistance [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It would also be of interest to further explore whether SP, which also has broad antimicrobial activity, may have conferred additional protection from other pathogens [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>It is unlikely that suboptimal dosing or subtherapeutic levels of DP contributed to the non-superior performance of ISTp-DP: each dose was supervised, and there is no evidence that pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics of DP to a degree that requires dose adjustment [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The same DP regimen was shown to be highly effective (PCR-corrected success rate by day 63: 99%) in a concurrent treatment trial conducted by the same team in this area using the same batch [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>ISTp-DP may also have been ineffective owing to a failure to detect low-level parasitemias, although the biological impact of such infections during pregnancy is unclear [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. RDTs detected about 45% of the PCR-positive infections in paucigravidae and about 30% in multigravidae, thereby allowing the majority of infections to persist in the placenta. Conceptually, ISTp is intended to prevent both existing infections from progressing and new infections from occurring for up to 6 wk after each DP course. Because only the RDT-positive women receive treatment, many do not benefit from the posttreatment prophylaxis. Furthermore, the infrequency of screening (approximately monthly) in a high transmission setting may have allowed new infections to develop and persist between scheduled visits. These factors combined may explain the higher prevalence of plasmodium infections at the time of delivery in the ISTp-DP arm.</p><p>The ineffectiveness of ISTp to prevent malaria in high transmission settings may also explain the higher rate of fetal loss in the ISTp-DP arm (2.6% versus 1.3%), consistent with the results from previous meta-analyses that showed a 1.5-fold higher risk of fetal loss among women randomized to control arms in trials of insecticide-treated nets [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The excess risk of fetal loss was not due to an adverse effect of DP, as the risk was highest among women who had never received DP (3.1% versus 2.2%). An alternative explanation could be that the broad antimicrobial effect of SP reduced the risk of fetal loss relative to ISTp [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lastly, the effect could also be a chance finding, as the trial in Kenya did not observe an excess risk of fetal loss in the ISTp arm [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Overall, DP was well tolerated, which is consistent with the results of a recent four-arm treatment trial comparing the four fixed-dose ACTs in the case management of malaria in pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This is important as almost all RDT-positive women in our trial were asymptomatic, and tolerance can be a major factor determining adherence.</p><p>ISTp is a labor-intensive strategy, but a separate qualitative substudy using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions showed it was highly acceptable to both patients and clinic staff. Although ISTp requires more frequent blood sampling, women appreciated its importance and the fact that they could be shown the RDT test results, corroborating findings from similar acceptability studies in Ghana [<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The venous sampling at the first antenatal visit was deemed more convenient by women than repeated finger pricks, as it allowed health workers to tests for malaria, anemia, syphilis, and HIV testing with a single blood draw.</p><p>Limitations of our trial include the open-label design used. Another limitation is that we were not able to include a third arm with IPTp with DP as there was insufficient safety information for repeat courses of DP available at the time this trial was designed. Approximately 9% of the randomized women did not contribute to the primary outcome of adverse live birth outcome and 12% did not contribute to the primary outcome of plasmodium infection at delivery. However, this loss to follow-up was well balanced between the study arms, with little differences in baseline characteristics between those who contributed to the primary endpoint versus those who did not; thus, this loss to follow-up is unlikely to have biased the findings. The proportion of multigravidae reporting using a bednet the night prior to enrollment was slightly lower in the ISTp-DP arm; however, this did not explain the observed difference in the risk of plasmodium infection at delivery, as all women received an insecticide-treated net on enrollment, and bednet use thereafter was near universal in both arms (99% in each arm).</p><p>ISTp-DP was not superior to the existing IPTp-SP regimen in this area with high SP resistance in southern Malawi. These results should be equally relevant to other high endemic areas in east and southern Africa with similar or lower levels of parasite SP resistance. The identification of alternative drugs to replace SP remains a pressing research priority for the control of malaria in pregnancy before levels of SP resistance render IPTp-SP fully ineffective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002124.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002124.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002124.s002"><label>S1 Abstract</label><caption><title>French translation of the Abstract and Author Summary.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002124.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002124.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Subgroup analysis of the effect of ISTp-DP versus IPTp-SP on the composite primary outcome of small for gestational age, low birthweight, or preterm birth.</title><p>Hb, hemoglobin; RR, relative risk.
