Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for low mood and anxiety when delivered one-to-one by an expert practitioner. However, access to this talking therapy is often limited and waiting lists can be long, although a range of low-intensity interventions that can increase access to services are available. These include guided self-help materials delivered via books, classes and online packages. This project aims to pilot a randomized controlled trial of an online CBT-based life skills course with community-based individuals experiencing low mood and anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Individuals with elevated symptoms of depression will be recruited directly from the community via online and newspaper advertisements. Participants will be remotely randomized to receive either immediate access or delayed access to the Living Life to the Full guided online CBT-based life skills package, with telephone or email support provided whilst they use the online intervention. The primary end point will be at 3 months post-randomization, at which point the delayed-access group will be offered the intervention. Levels of depression, anxiety, social functioning and satisfaction will be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This pilot study will test the trial design, and ability to recruit and deliver the intervention. Drop-out rates will be assessed and the completion and acceptability of the package will be investigated. The study will also inform a sample size power calculation for a subsequent substantive randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12890709">ISRCTN12890709</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Bibliotherapy</kwd><kwd>computerized CBT</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Guided self-help</kwd><kwd>Life skills</kwd><kwd>Low mood</kwd><kwd>Online</kwd><kwd>Psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd><kwd>Treatment gap</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde</institution></funding-source><award-id>62641</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Depression is common, with an estimated 350 million people experiencing this mood disorder worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has a significant impact on health, wellbeing, employment status and social functioning and is the primary cause of disability globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Various interventions are available for the treatment of depression, such as antidepressant medication and talking therapies, including low-intensity guided self-help interventions as well as high-intensity interventions, often delivered face-to-face, such as individual high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and behavioural activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>However, only between 10 % and 50 % of individuals receive appropriate treatment for their depression within health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This treatment gap may depend on a number of factors, including non-recognition of the problem (by the individual or healthcare workers), limited knowledge about treatment options and a lack of mental health resources, resulting in long waiting lists. A key aim of the WHO mental health Gap Action Programme is to increase access to psychological therapies via non-expert support or healthcare workers. This could be achieved through the application of a low-intensity CBT guided self-help approach, delivered via bibliotherapy or online in the form of computerized CBT.</p><p>Various free and licensed computerized CBT packages are available, including &#x02018;Moodgym&#x02019;, &#x02018;Beating the Blues&#x02019; and &#x02018;Living Life to the Full&#x02019; (LLTTF). Studies show varying results regarding effectiveness and adherence to online interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recent meta-review of the effectiveness of computerized CBT for depression found insufficient evidence to indicate which packages achieve better outcomes, indicating a need for further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of computerized CBT to establish effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The LLTTF course puts bibliotherapy and life skills training at the centre of the course, providing various ways of completing the course (reading, audiovisual modules, video), presenting a blended learning approach. The resources, which address key aspects of low mood and stress, take the form of classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, Williams, McClay, Matthews, Haig, McConnachie, Morrison. A randomosied controlled trial of a community based group guided self-help intervention for low mood and stress. Submitted], printed books [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and e-books, in addition to the online course. Importantly, the online version of the LLTTF intervention adheres to the key NICE recommendations regarding computerized CBT packages in terms of content, number of modules and the support element provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A previous non-randomized feasibility study suggests that the online LLTTF course helps improve mood and anxiety; this study compared LLTTF, Beating the Blues and a book-based bibliotherapy intervention, demonstrating equivalent significant improvements across the three interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, further research is needed regarding the efficacy of LLTTF in its online format as to date there have been no adequately powered RCTs of the LLTTF package. Also, following earlier evaluations of LLTTF, the intervention has been refined in three key ways: (1) content has been updated; (2) the delivery platform (website) has been enhanced to add planning and reminder components, alongside the option to read the online linked books and (3) automated support emails as well as a structured support algorithm have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The extent and timing of support is known to improve outcomes in online treatments for depression, with maximal response (a Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> of 0.76) when support is offered both before and during treatment, compared with 0.21 when there is no therapist support before or during treatment, 0.44 when there is therapist contact before treatment, and 0.58 when there is therapist contact during treatment only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We have used the conservative estimate of effect of 0.58 to provide our sample size estimate.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>In this pilot study, the primary aim will be to investigate take-up, drop-out and completion rates of the online course and the completion rates for data collection.</p><p>Secondary outcomes will be mood ratings at 3 months. We will use changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] score to provide data relating to the effect of the intervention on depression levels. This will give an indication of efficacy, together with the drop-out and retention rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research questions</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary question</title><p>Is the study design feasible?

We have taken an estimated effect size of 0.58 to represent a typical response rate to supported or guided online interventions, such as that tested in the proposed study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With a power of 0.58 and a significance level of 0.05, 48 patients per group (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;96) would be required. Therefore, recruiting 30&#x02013;50 patients in this pilot trial should be sufficient to enable us to determine whether we can recruit and randomize sufficiently, as well as gauging our ability to retain participants and record follow-up data.</p><p>Drop-out rates in internet studies can vary from 1 % to 50 %.

Participants&#x02019; ID numbers will be passed to a separate researcher who will use the randomization function in Excel to assign participants remotely to the immediate immediate-access or delayed-access group. As this is a pilot study, we will not stratify for any variables during randomization. The randomization will be done remotely by a researcher who will not be involved in the final data analysis. After randomization, the two groups of participants will be followed up in exactly the same way. Those in the immediate-access group will be given an access code and link to the LLTTF website, including instructions on using the resources. Those in the delayed-access group will be told that they will be contacted again in 3 months; the access code will be sent once follow-up data have been received.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention</title><p>The free-access online LLTTF course consists of eight modules that teach a range of CBT-based life skills.</p><p>The eight sessions are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Session 1: &#x02018;Why do I feel so bad?&#x02019; &#x02013; An introduction to the CBT model and the &#x02018;vicious cycle&#x02019; of low mood that aims to help participants understand why they feel the way they do and how their thoughts, feelings, physical symptoms and behaviour are linked.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Session 2: &#x02018;I can&#x02019;t be bothered doing anything&#x02019; &#x02013; This module focuses on the impact of reduced activity.

Despite the fact that there are various evidence-based interventions for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], fewer than 50 % of those affected receive appropriate treatment for low mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Low-intensity interventions, such as online CBT courses can potentially bridge the gap between onset of depression and receiving appropriate treatment by increasing access to psychological therapies. The same LLTTF content has already been evaluated in its course (group classes) and book forms, showing significant improvements in depression, anxiety, quality of life and high levels of satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, Williams, McClay, Matthews, Haig, McConnachie, Morrison. A randomised controlled trial of a community based group guided self-help intervention for low mood and stress. Submitted]. The current pilot study will, however, represent the first RCT of the updated LLTTF online package and provide key information across a range of methodological uncertainties required for a full RCT of the LLTTF online package. These include community recruitment, uptake, delivery, adherence to the intervention and data collection, with results being used to determine the sample size needed for a substantive RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Benefits to participants</title><p>Participation within this research will allow adults who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of low mood or anxiety to use online CBT-based life skills and other educational modules aimed at addressing these issues. Previous research on other variants of the same course suggests that the LLTTF approach can be effective in aiding a variety of problems related to low mood and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, Williams, McClay, Matthews, Haig, McConnachie, Morrison. A randomised controlled trial of a community based group guided self-help intervention for low mood and stress. Submitted]. The satisfaction data will help us to gain a key insight into how online websites can be best delivered and supported in the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Working with the voluntary sector</title><p>In this pilot study, the Scottish charity Action on Depression will deliver the support element of the intervention using a pre-established support protocol. Support workers from this depression charity are experienced in working with the proposed population and have experience of introducing and supporting self-help materials. They can also assist any individuals who may need further help during the study by signposting them to additional support if there is concern about a participant&#x02019;s wellbeing. Action of Depression have an effective system for identifying and supporting individuals in the community and the involvement of this charity may aid in accessing hard-to-reach individuals, including young men and minority ethnic groups; as well as individuals who may prefer voluntary sector support rather than traditional treatment options offered via the NHS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Dissemination</title><p>We aim to disseminate the findings of this pilot study in an open-access journal and via conference presentations. The journal publication will present the study findings, with the data being used to inform a future RCT protocol and a grant application. A short summary of the findings of the study will be posted online via social media accounts. We will also disseminate findings via newsletters at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.livinglifetothefull.com">www.livinglifetothefull.com</ext-link>, which receives around 30 million hits a year from members of the public and practitioners and our partners Action on Depression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>The website has been designed and tested.
