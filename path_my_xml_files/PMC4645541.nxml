Several techniques have been developed to achieve these goals with variable outcomes. The aim of this study was to appraise the effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA) and subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) compared to coronally advanced flap (CAF) in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 30 patients aged between 18 and 50 years, with multiple Miller's Class I and II recessions on labial or buccal surfaces of teeth were selected for this study. The patients were randomly assigned to CAF + ADMA, CAF + SCTG and CAF groups with 10 patients in each group. The clinical parameters assessed were probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), width of keratinized tissue, plaque index and papilla bleeding index at base line and 6 months after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Statistical analysis using One-way ANOVA suggested that the root coverage obtained was greater in the ADMA + CAF (89.83 &#x000b1; 15.29%), when compared to SCTG + CAF (87.73 &#x000b1; 17.63%) and CAF (63.77 &#x000b1; 27.12%) groups. The predictability for coverage of &#x0003e;90% was greater in CAF + ADMA (65%) when compared with SCTG + CAF (61.66%) and CAF (31.17%). Improvements in the clinical parameters from baseline were found in all the three groups treated.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It was concluded that all three techniques could provide root coverage in Miller's class I and II gingival recessions; but greater % root coverage and predictability for coverage of &#x0003e;90% could be expected with CAF + ADMA and CAF + SCTG groups when compared with CAF alone.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acellular dermal matrix allograft</kwd><kwd>coronally advanced flap</kwd><kwd>gingival recession</kwd><kwd>multiple recession</kwd><kwd>root coverage</kwd><kwd>subepithelial connective tissue graft</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Root coverage procedures are frequently indicated to resolve a variety of patient-centered concerns including, but not limited to, root sensitivity, increased potential for root caries, difficulty in plaque control and esthetics.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The coronally advanced flap (CAF) to cover denuded root surfaces has been considered to be a simple (because donor tissue does not need to be procured) and predictable method (a reported root coverage between 70% and 99%)[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] at both single and multiple recession sites with apparently satisfactory esthetic results.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The use of subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) covered by a CAF has shown good predictability in the correction of multiple gingival recessions with mean root coverage ranging from 84% to 100%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, it involves a certain degree of patient morbidity because of two surgical sites.</p><p>The use of an acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADMA) as a substitute for palatal donor sites to increase the keratinized tissue (KT) around teeth, in addition to the treatment of alveolar ridge deformities and root coverage procedures has been reported in the literature. <italic>In vitro</italic> and clinical studies have suggested that ADMA is an acellular, nonimmunogenic scaffold that heals by repopulation and revascularization, rather than through a granulation process.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Previous studies have compared the results obtained with ADMA and the SCTG for the treatment of gingival recessions.

Inclusion criteria used were the presence of &#x0003e;2 mm recession depth with a loss of clinical attachment level (CAL) &#x0003e;4 mm, having equal amount of keratinized gingiva apical to the recession and a radiographic evidence of sufficient interdental bone (distance between the crestal bone and the cementoenamel junction [CEJ] as &#x0003c; 2 mm). Patients&#x02019; agreed to participate in the study and gave their informed consent. The University's (Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University, Nagpur) Ethical committee approved the consent form and the study protocol.</p><p>Patients using tobacco in any form, uncooperative, with unacceptable oral hygiene after Phase I therapy, and with a history of periodontal surgery were excluded from the study. Recession defects associated with caries or restorations, as well as teeth with pulpal pathology, were excluded. Information concerning dietary status, systemic background, mouth cleaning habits, gingival and periodontal status along with other routine clinical data were recorded in the specially designed chart.</p><p>Full mouth plaque score was obtained by using Turesky-Gilmore-Glickman modification of Quigley-Hein (1970)[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] plaque index (PI), which revealed the presence of plaque.

Thirty patients with a total of 73 recession defects, with a minimum of 2 recession defects per patient were found suitable. The subjects were randomly assigned to CAF + ADMA, CAF + SCTG and CAF groups by computer generated tables, with 10 patients in each group. CAF + ADMA group (mean age 30.8 years, M: <italic>F</italic> 8:2) with 21 recession defects, CAF + SCTG group (mean age 23.5 years, M: <italic>F</italic> 8:2) with 23 recession defects and the CAF group (mean age 30.3 years, M: <italic>F</italic> 7:3) with 29 gingival recession defects were treated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Initial therapy</title><p>Following selection, all patients were monitored in oral hygiene and instructed in proper toothbrushing, with roll-stroke technique being prescribed for teeth with recession-type defects. In order to achieve a regular and smooth surface, scaling and selective root planing were carried out. Coronoplasty was performed if required. At the end of therapy, before the surgical procedure, all patients had a plaque score of &#x0003c;1 and bleeding score of &#x0003c;1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>One calibrated examiner collected the following data at baseline, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively on the mid-facial aspect of the study tooth: Relative gingival margin level (RGML), probing pocket depth (PPD) and relative attachment level (RAL) with a computerized constant pressure probe that is, Florida disk probe (Florida probe corporation, Gainesville, FL, USA) with a constant force of 15 g (pressure-154 N/cm<sup>2</sup>), tip diameter of 0.40 mm, precision of 0.1 mm and a probe length of 20 mm. The RAL was recorded by placing the tip of the Florida probe at the base of the pocket and the disk base resting on the occlusal surface, the distance recorded as RAL. The distance from the occlusal level to the gingival margin was considered as RGML. The probing depth (PPD) was calculated by subtracting the RGML from RAL. GR was measured as the distance from the CEJ to the gingival margin with a William's graduated probe and width of keratinized tissue (WKT) was measured as the distance from the most apical point of the mucogingival junction to the gingival margin with a William's graduated probe.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Prior to the surgical procedure, intraoral asepsis was performed with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hexidine - ICPA Health product Ltd, India) for 1 min. After local anesthesia (2% Lidocaine with adrenaline 1:100,000), the exposed root surfaces were planed with curettes and ultrasonic instruments. An intrasulcular incision was made with a #15C (Ribbel, New Delhi, India) blade on the buccal aspect of the involved teeth and extended horizontally to adjacent interdental areas. Two oblique releasing incisions were made from the mesial and distal extremities of the horizontal incision beyond the mucogingival junction. The trapezoidal mucoperiosteal flap was raised up to the mucogingival junction, after which a partial thickness flap was extended apically, as far as necessary, and hence that it could be coronally repositioned, at the CEJ, without tension. The facial portions of the interdental papillae were deepithelized to create a connective tissue bed. Abundant sterile saline irrigations were performed during the procedures. The flap was displaced coronally, without tension, to the CEJ level fully covering the recession. A 4-0 nonresorbable silk surgical suture (Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson Ltd., Somerville, NJ, USA) was used to secure the CAF at the CEJ level by utilizing horizontal suspension suturing technique. Interrupted sutures were placed to coapt the mesial and distal papillae as well as the lateral aspects of the flaps along the vertical incisions, and to facilitate tissue stabilization.</p><p>For the ADMA (Alloderm, Lifecell Corporation, New Jersey) and SCTG sites the procedures were identical to the one described, with the exception of addition of ADMA or CT graft. A CT graft in the proper dimensions (as measured with a template) was harvested from the palate (canine to first molar area) using the trap door approach[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and trimmed as necessary after removal of excess fatty and glandular tissue. The graft dimensions were determined by the distance between the vertical incisions and by the distance of approximately 2&#x02013;3 mm from the gingival margin. The flap was then repositioned to completely cover the donor site and sutured with 4-0 silk surgical sutures.</p><p>The CT graft was placed immediately over the exposed root (s) covering the entire defect and the adjacent recipient bed and sutured to the interdental papilla with 5-0 Vicryl [Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Waluj, Aurangabad, India] sutures. It was then covered with the CAF. The tissue flap was then positioned coronal to the CEJ and sutured using 4-0 nonabsorbable silk surgical sutures. Interrupted sutures were placed laterally, and continuous sutures coronally [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical photograph showing preoperative recession in the coronally advanced flap and subepithelial connective tissue graft group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-537-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Graft harvested from donor site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-537-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Suturing of the connective tissue graft at the recipient site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-537-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Flap coronally positioned and sutured</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-537-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>6 months postoperative photograph</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-537-g005"/></fig><p>In the ADMA group, an ADMA was adapted after being aseptically rehydrated in sterile saline, according to manufacturer's instruction.

The predictability of root coverage of &#x0003e;90% for the CAF + ADMA group was 65% in the present study; whereas, a predictability of 72% has been reported[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] based on several published articles on ADMA.</p><p>When the root coverage obtained was compared between CAF + ADMA and CAF + SCTG groups, greater coverage was obtained in CAF + ADMA (89.83%) group when compared to CAF + SCTG (87.73%). However, the results were not statistically significant. These results are comparable to those obtained in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The results in the present study indicate that all the three treatment modalities, CAF, CAF + SCTG and CAF + ADMA groups showed good improvement in the studied clinical parameters with respect to baseline, indicating that all the three procedures can be used in clinical practice. The root coverage obtained in this study was found to be greater in CAF + ADMA (89.83%) group when compared to both CAF + SCTG (87.73%) and CAF (63.77%) groups. The root coverage obtained in both CAF + ADMA and CAF + SCTG groups were greater than that obtained with CAF alone, and the results were statistically significant. The observations are in accordance with several reported studies comparing the use of CAF alone, with either CAF + ADMA[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or CAF + SCTG.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] At present, within the limits of our knowledge, there are no reported studies comparing the effectiveness of all the above mentioned three procedures in the treatment of multiple gingival recession defects.</p><p>The gain in CAL was found to be greater in the CAF + ADMA group when compared to CAF + SCTG and CAF groups. The type of healing obtained between the soft tissue and the denuded root surface can be only speculated on, since no histological evaluations are available. Animal studies have demonstrated that new connective tissue attachment is made up of 44-50% of the successfully covered recession defects following the use of ADMA with CAF procedures.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Although, the observed clinical changes probably represent a combination of new connective tissue attachment in the apical half of the defect and long junctional epithelium in the coronal half as reported in previous histological studies on ADMA[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and SCTG.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Furthermore, the treatment procedures in the present study did not result in the formation of deep periodontal pockets (mean PPD in CAF + ADMA = 0.80 mm, CAF + SCTG = 0.81 mm, and CAF = 0.72 mm).</p><p>In the present study, all the treatment groups resulted in significant increase in the WKT. The CAF + SCTG showed significantly greater increase in the WKT of 2.21 mm, when compared to CAF + ADMA (1.6 mm) and CAF (1.00 mm) groups. However, since there are no reported studies comparing the three treatment procedures, we can take into account studies that have compared CAF + SCTG and CAF + ADMA,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] which have reported a significant increase in keratinized tissue in the CAF + SCTG group, similar to the findings in the present study. Furthermore, it has been reported that ADMA resulted in the lesser extent of attached gingiva due to considerable shrinkage during healing.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It can be said that all three techniques could provide root coverage in Miller's class I and II gingival recessions; nonetheless a greater % of root coverage and predictability for coverage of &#x0003e;90% can be expected with CAF + ADMA and CAF + SCTG groups when compared with CAF alone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McGuire</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Nunn</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of human recession defects treated with coronally advanced flaps and either enamel matrix derivative or connective tissue.
