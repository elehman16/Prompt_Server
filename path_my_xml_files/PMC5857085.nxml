This has hampered the treatment and prevention of child malnutrition. An innovative, locally produced, multiple micronutrient fortified lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) has been developed for use as an RUSF. Unlike most RUSFs, which contain milk, this product contains fish as the animal protein. Few RUSFs have been formulated using non-milk animal-source foods and they have not been widely tested. An acceptability trial that was conducted on this novel RUSF in June 2015 demonstrated that children will eat the RUSF and that caregivers will feed it to their children. The current trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the RUSF in preventing growth faltering and improving micronutrient status in Cambodian children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p id="Par2">This trial is a six-month, prospective, cluster randomised, non-blinded controlled trial among infants in peri-urban Phnom Penh. The trial aims to establish the superiority of the novel RUSF, compared to three alternatives (Corn-Soy Blend Plus Plus (CSB++) and Sprinkles micronutrient powders as active comparators, and the unimproved diet as a control). The allocation ratio is 1:1. Healthy children (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;540) aged six to eleven months will be recruited. Data will be collected at baseline, and monthly thereafter for a period of six months. Participants will be provided with a monthly supply of the food to which their village has been allocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">There is an urgent need to develop locally produced and culturally acceptable RUSFs, and to compare these with existing options in terms of their potential for preventing malnutrition, in Cambodia and elsewhere. This trial will contribute much-needed data on the effectiveness of supplementary foods with an animal-source food other than milk, by comparing a novel RUSF based on fish to one that uses milk (CSB++). Moreover, it will deepen the understanding of the impact of multiple micronutrients provided with or without macronutrients, by comparing the novel RUSF and CSB++, which combine macronutrients with multiple micronutrients, to Sprinkles, which contains no macronutrients. In addition, it will augment the body of evidence from Asia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: LNS-CAMB-INFANTS-EFF; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02257762?term=LNS-CAMB-INFANTS-EFF%09NCT02257762&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02257762</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF)</kwd><kwd>Lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)</kwd><kwd>Childhood malnutrition</kwd><kwd>Growth faltering</kwd><kwd>Corn-Soy Blend Plus Plus (CSB++)</kwd><kwd>Supercereal Plus</kwd><kwd>Sprinkles micronutrient powders</kwd><kwd>Cambodia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006641</institution-id><institution>UNICEF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institut de Recherche pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Fisheries Post-Harvest Technologies and Quality Control (DFPTQ), Fisheries Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background and rationale</title><p id="Par24">Undernutrition is an underlying cause in almost half of all deaths in children under five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Cambodia, rates of malnutrition remain stubbornly high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with 32% of all children under five years (and 40% of three to four year-olds) stunted, 10% wasted, and 24% underweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Suboptimal infant feeding practices, in particular, poor complementary feeding, result in inadequate energy and nutrient intakes to achieve optimal growth and micronutrient status, and consequently, childhood malnutrition.</p><p id="Par25">Adequate complementary feeding can prevent malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Cambodia, the traditional weaning food is a white rice porridge called <italic>borbor,</italic> which has very low nutrient density. Special supplementary foods, containing a source of protein and lipids such as powered milk, soy or peanuts, and multiple micronutrients, can be used to improve complementary feeding. Supplementary foods can be either foods requiring preparation e.g. fortified blended products, such as Corn-Soy Blend++ (CSB++, now called Supercereal Plus), that is mixed with water to make a porridge; or ready-to-use e.g. biscuits, such as BP5. Until fairly recently, prevention of malnutrition relied on fortified blended products. However, increasingly, ready-to-use foods are lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) which are often pastes, such as the peanut-based Plumpy&#x02019;Doz&#x02122;. These energy-dense ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs) contain both macro and micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These new RUSFs are proving effective, as they have a higher energy content, and have a longer shelf life, and, since they require no preparation, are more convenient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another common nutrition intervention is multiple micronutrient supplements such as Sprinkles, used solely to combat micronutrient deficiencies. These are individually-packed powders that can be added to food. Micronutrients are more likely to achieve growth outcomes when they are combined with energy, for example, in lipid-based nutrient supplements; there is no evidence that micronutrient powders alone contribute to sustained improvements in linear growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In Cambodia, various supplements and supplementary or therapeutic foods, including micronutrient powders, CSB++, BP100, and Plumpy&#x02019;Nut&#x02122; have been used or trialled. The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in Cambodia distributed CSB++ to children under two years to prevent malnutrition. Micronutrient powders (Sprinkles) have also been distributed through the public health system, though coverage is limited. These products are relatively expensive to procure and ship to Cambodia and in the case of Sprinkles, are not as effective as foods that contain macronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Plumpy&#x02019;Nut&#x02122;, which is produced in France by Nutriset, was trialled in Cambodia in 2009 and was not well accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nor was CSB++ very well accepted in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to lack of acceptability, and also due to budget constraints, WFP phased out distribution of CSB++ in Cambodia in June 2014. In addition, BP100, which is currently used in Cambodia to treat severe acute malnutrition, has not been well accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">For these reasons, the Cambodian Ministry of Health sought a ready-to-use food (in both therapeutic and supplementary versions) containing macro and micronutrients that was locally-produced and therefore more likely to be acceptable and cheaper than imported products.</p><p id="Par28">In 2009 in Vietnam, UNICEF, IRD (Institute of Research for Development) and the National Institute of Nutrition developed a supplementary food from mainly local ingredients including rice, soy, mung beans, sugar, milk powder, oil and multiple micronutrients (called HEBI). This product proved more acceptable and as effective as Plumpy&#x02019;Nut&#x02122; and is now widely used in Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In mid-2013, IRD, partnering with UNICEF and the Cambodian Department of Fisheries Post-harvest Technologies and Quality (DFPTQ), began developing a novel RUSF based on the same concept as the Vietnamese product.</p><p id="Par29">WHO recommends daily consumption of animal-source foods for their high protein, energy, and micronutrient availability, which plant-based complementary food alone cannot provide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Animal-source foods have been associated with greater micronutrient status, linear growth and non-fat mass gain compared to non-animal-source food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Usually, milk or whey powder is the animal-source food most commonly used in supplementary foods including CSB++ and various RUSFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, milk powder is an expensive (and often imported) ingredient. Therefore, it could perhaps be replaced with a cheaper, local source of animal protein that is widely accepted by the target population. There are precedents for replacing milk in supplementary foods for cost effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but until now, only a handful of supplementary foods have used meat, fish or eggs and they have generally not been tested for effectiveness on a wide scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The only known effectiveness study involving a supplementary food with fish compared a peanut and soy-based fortified spread to a corn porridge fortified with fish powder with six to eighteen month old children, and found that children consuming the porridge with fish powder gained less weight from six to eleven months, but otherwise the two supplementary foods performed similarly in terms of weight gain from twelve to eighteen months and linear growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In a number of studies, supplementing with meat or milk (as opposed to a supplementary food product containing no meat or milk), the nutritional improvement was less than expected, and sometimes was only the slowing of growth faltering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A study in Kenya is the only one to have compared milk and meat, and found meat had a greater impact, perhaps because milk inhibited iron and zinc uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In all of these studies, the limited impact of meat or milk may have been because the additional food did not contain a sufficient range or quantity of micronutrients to overcome deficiencies.</p><p id="Par30">In Cambodia, fish is inexpensive, readily available and highly acceptable to local tastes, and could therefore replace milk in a supplementary food. Combined with rice, soy, mung beans, oil and sugar, the resulting product should be less expensive and more acceptable to Cambodians. IRD developed the first version of this product in paste form in early 2014. It was compared to BP100, and found to be equally acceptable in younger children, although older children preferred BP100&#x02019;s milky taste to the fishy flavour of the RUSF.</p><p id="Par31">The product was revised to reduce the fish smell and make it into a snack. It was then tested for acceptability in comparison to CSB++ and Sprinkles with <italic>borbor</italic> in June 2015. That trial demonstrated that children will eat the RUSF and that caregivers will feed it to their children. The next step is to assess the effectiveness of the food in preventing malnutrition, and promoting optimal growth and development. Therefore, a six-month effectiveness trial will be conducted. The impact of the product on children aged six to seventeen months will be compared to the impact of CSB++, Sprinkles, and to a control group consuming an unsupplemented diet, typically <italic>borbor</italic> at an early age (e.g. six to nine months) and thereafter, family foods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>RUSF formulation</title><p id="Par32">The RUSF has been formulated and produced locally, using local inputs. Small freshwater fish were cleaned, dried, roasted and ground. Soy and mung beans were roasted and ground, then mixed with the fish and coconut. This mix was extruded, then combined with multiple micronutrient premix (DMS), icing sugar, maltodextrin and canola oil to create the RUSF paste. Wafers were hand-made from rice flour, eggs, water, sugar, salt and coconut with small amounts of vanilla or sesame seeds for added flavour. The wafer is a hollow cylinder between 8.5-9&#x000a0;cm long with an internal diameter of 0.4&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;cm. Such wafers, unfilled, are a popular Cambodian snack.

Similar effectiveness studies (considering weight and length outcomes) have ranged from as little as four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with many studies taking twelve weeks to compare three to eight food supplementation regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and others taking six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The INCAP study in Guatemala provided supplementary food to children for up to seven years, but nevertheless noted a detectable difference after three and six months of supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With respect to linear growth, healthy infants grow approximately 1.25&#x000a0;cm each month from six to eleven months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Golden notes that although the maximum rate of height gain is as yet unknown, catch-up growth can easily be three times the rate of normal growth. Thus, a malnourished child less than one year of age can gain one z-score in two to four weeks if receiving adequate nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The mean HAZ-score for a Cambodian child of six months is &#x02212;&#x02009;0.5, for twelve to seventeen month-olds is &#x02212;&#x02009;1.3 and for eighteen to twenty-three month-olds is &#x02212;&#x02009;1.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, s/he loses around 0.8 z-score in six to eleven months, or approximately 0.07 z-score per month. In our trial, if the intervention stops or slows growth faltering, we could see a difference in HAZ-scores of up to 0.42 over six months between intervention and control groups.</p><p id="Par74">Since it is not uncommon nowadays to find stunted but overweight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], a recent Cochrane review recommended that future research report results on body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Among stunted, non-wasted children, prevention is preferable to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In either treatment or prevention of malnutrition, the aim is to increase non-fat mass (bones, muscles) in preference to fat mass, and one should therefore see linear growth as well as increased weight, since linear growth is a better indicator of nutritional recovery than weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, body composition will also be an important outcome of our trial.</p><p id="Par75">The effectiveness trial of our novel RUSF will determine how a ready-to-use, fish-based, supplementary food compares with CSB++, Sprinkles, and an unsupplemented diet in terms of preventing of growth faltering and improving micronutrient status. This trial will contribute much-needed data on the effectiveness of supplementary foods with an animal-source food other than milk, by comparing a supplementary food with fish (the RUSF) and one with milk (CSB++). Moreover, it will deepen the understanding of the impact of multiple micronutrients provided with or without macronutrients, by comparing the RUSF and CSB++, which combine macronutrients with multiple micronutrients, and Sprinkles, which contains no macronutrients. Moreover, most studies on supplementary foods are from Africa, so this research will be an important contribution to the body of evidence from Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">There are two limitations of this trial. First, the data on consumption and compliance is based on self-reporting, and therefore risks response bias. It could be expected that any response bias would favour over-reporting of consumption, which may suggest lower effectiveness of the interventions. Similarly, sharing of foods with family members would likely be under-reported, again leading to underestimation of effectiveness. The second limitation is related to the generalisability of the findings to non-urban Cambodian populations, and to other South East Asian populations. Rural areas of Cambodia experience higher levels of malnutrition and poorer infant and young child feeding practices than urban [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, in rural settings, it would be difficult to predict if the interventions would appear more efficacious, or less.</p><p id="Par77">From a programmatic point of view, if the novel RUSF proves successful, not only would it provide an acceptable, effective product for preventing childhood malnutrition. It might also&#x000a0;simplify interventions in maternal and child nutrition in Cambodia and in countries where similar products could be produced, since, because of its composition, it could be used with pregnant and lactating women as well as children aged six months to two years.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AGP</term><def><p id="Par5">Alpha-2 acid glycoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSID</term><def><p id="Par6">Bayley Scales of Infant Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDHS</term><def><p id="Par7">Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par8">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSB++</term><def><p id="Par9">Corn-Soy Blend Plus Plus, now called Supercereal Plus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFPTQ</term><def><p id="Par10">(Cambodian) Department of Fisheries Post-harvest Technologies and Quality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p id="Par11">Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hb</term><def><p id="Par12">Haemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>L/HAZ</term><def><p id="Par13">Length/height-for-age z-score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LNS</term><def><p id="Par14">Lipid-based nutrient supplement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUAC</term><def><p id="Par15">Mid-upper arm circumference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NECHR</term><def><p id="Par16">National Ethics Committee for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUSF</term><def><p id="Par17">Ready- to-use supplementary food</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUTF</term><def><p id="Par18">Ready- to-use therapeutic food</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par19">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WAZ</term><def><p id="Par20">Weight-for-age z-score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WFP</term><def><p id="Par21">United Nations World Food Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par22">World Health Organisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHZ</term><def><p id="Par23">Weight-for-height z-score</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Remco Peters, Sanne Sigh, Marjoleine Dijkhuizen and Lyndon Paul (Vissot) for their work on product development.
