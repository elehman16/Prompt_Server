This heterogeneity causes a low success rate of single procedures of ablation and a high incidence of recurrence. Surgical ablation through bilateral thoracotomy demonstrates better results after a single procedure. Prospective observational studies in inhomogeneous populations without control groups report a remarkable 90% of success with hybrid or staged procedures of surgical ablation coupled with catheter ablation. In this trial, we will examine the hypothesis that a staged approach involving initial minimally invasive surgical ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation, followed by a second percutaneous procedure in case of recurrence, has a higher success rate than repeated percutaneous procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a controlled (2:1) randomized trial comparing use of a percutaneous catheter with minimally invasive transthoracic surgical ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, definitions, and treatment protocols are those reported by the 2012 Expert Consensus Statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation. Patients will be randomized to either percutaneous catheter (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100) or surgical (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) ablation as the first procedure.

PeAF is frequently caused by different coexistent electrophysiological mechanisms of induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This complex origin frequently requires the use of a combination of ablation techniques to achieve acceptable results. Indeed, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the ablation of complex fractioned atrial electrograms (CFAEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] did not result in satisfactory results when used separately during percutaneous catheter ablation procedures (PCAs), whereas the rate of success increased to 74% after combining the two techniques and was 88% when ablation was repeated after 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The evaluation of treatment for PeAF is further complicated by the small number of patients with PeAf included in controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similar outcomes are observed for the surgical treatment of PeAF. For example, in the FAST trial (atrial fibrillation catheter ablation versus surgical ablation treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], surgical ablation achieved better results (65% versus 36%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0022) than PCA in complex patients, whereas this trend was not confirmed in the cases with PeAf, who were a minority of those randomized.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism involved, the majority of the sites of origin of PeAF are located in the posterior part of the left atrium, as this portion is easily encompassed by the box lesions created by surgical ablations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As such, a staged approach may be a more suitable strategy, with use of percutaneous endocardial techniques only in case of failure of the surgical procedures. Recently, Pison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] obtained a success rate of 90% in PeAf with a hybrid approach involving bilateral minimal surgical access and PCA. In this series, only 23% of the lines created surgically were not transmural, and 88% of the patients had the AF terminated by a posterior left atrial isolation. Comparable results were reported with staged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] approaches of thoracoscopy or transabdominal pericardial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] access and PCA.</p><p>In the present trial, we examine the hypothesis that a staged approach involving minimally invasive surgical ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation, followed by a second percutaneous procedure in cases of recurrence, will have a success rate at 12 months higher than repeated percutaneous procedures. According to the recently published European guidelines on surgical ablation of AF alone, we will select patients with a class IIb indication to surgery and use the class I bipolar radiofrequency as the energy source for the ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The overall hypothesis of this study is that an initial surgical procedure has a higher probability of success than an initial percutaneous ablation, and therefore, fewer patients will be submitted to a second ablation. The proposed therapies are currently accepted and considered Class II indications in the current European Society of Cardiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] guidelines for the treatment of PeAf. As such, their comparison complies with the Declaration of Helsinki for the Ethical Principles of Medical Research in human subjects. The Ethics Committee of the University of Magna Grecia in Catanzaro (Italy) gave full approval to the study without conditions. No external financial support exists. Full reimbursement of the cost of the therapies has already been granted by the Italian National Health System.</p><p>All participants will be required to sign an informed consent to adhere to the study. The Surgical Staged Approach (SSA) strategy consists of an initial minimally invasive surgical ablation, followed by a percutaneous catheter ablation if necessary. To avoid any possible bias introduced by the difference in surgical techniques, we will use only the bipolar radiofrequency using the Estech cobra fusion ablator (Estech is a Market brand of Atricure Inc West Chester 45069 Ohio USA) introduced through a right minimal thoracotomy. The control group will receive the current standard strategy of PCA. In the case of recurrence of the AF, the second procedure will be either percutaneous or surgical. The inclusion criteria and the protocols for managing the pharmacologic and anticoagulant therapy, the description of the surgical approach, and the technique of the percutaneous ablation are those indicated by the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the European Guidelines for the treatment of lone AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Patient age &#x02265;18 years.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Patients with persistent AF defined as at least one sustained episode lasting more than 7 days in the last 12 months.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Patients with symptomatic AF that is refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic medication; symptomatic patients are those who have been aware of their AF at any time within the last 5 years before enrolment.

Transthoracic echocardiography will be also performed to record the presence of an atrial contraction in case of sinus rhythm. Quality of life will be assessed by a modified 36-item Short Form Health Survey and the Euro 5D questionnaire. The primary outcomes include the freedom from AF at 12 months, as detected by a 12-lead ECG and a 24-hour Holter examination after 3, 6, and 9 months of follow-up, and the occurrence of a second ablation procedure. The secondary outcomes include the duration of the procedures, freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia, incidence of procedural complications, any late complication related to the procedures, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Randomization will be performed by using currently available computer software. Sample size is based on the hypothesis that the success rate of the first procedure will be approximately 70% for the surgical cases and 35% to 40% for the PCA cases. At the end of the interventions, the number of patients in SR should be equivalent in the two groups, whereas the proportions of those submitted to a second procedure, either percutaneous or surgical, should differ significantly. Variables will be analyzed with an intention-to-treat method. The three possible results of this study are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. A flow chart depicting the most favorable result in which the power of the test is 98% is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Several different percutaneous and surgical techniques have been proposed for its treatment, owing to the difficulties in the standardization of the ablation procedures. In addition, many reports dealing with the ablation of PeAF also include patients affected by paroxysmal and permanent fibrillation, which introduces a considerable selection bias.</p><p>As in any arrhythmia, a number of basic problems are involved in ablating the PeAF, including the following: (a) identifying the mechanism; (b) locating the source; (c) reaching the ablation area; (d) choosing the lesion set; and (e) consistently obtaining transmural lesions. As PeAf shows heterogeneity in its mechanism of origin, a simple PVI has unpredictable results. Thus, other techniques such as CFAE ablation and linear ablations, with or without substrate control, have been developed to increase the percentages of termination of the arrhythmia. Once the arrhythmia has been ablated, it can also recur in other parts of the atrium with a different mechanism, causing a high percentage of recurrent fibrillation. Recently, focal ablation and the rotor modulation technique (FIRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have shown promising results in a limited number of cases. Surgical ablations that de-connect a large part of the posterior left atrium, where many of the sources of the PeAF are located, have also become increasing used owing to their simple approach. Conversely, surgical procedures also are difficult to evaluate, and numerous observational studies of mixed populations without controls used different sources of energy and line combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The FAST trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] was the first to compare the surgical and the percutaneous approaches, in which patients randomized to surgery had a higher rate of termination of the arrhythmia. However, their results were compromised by the incidence of complications. Many of these complications (pneumothorax, rib fracture) could be easily avoided by careful analysis of the results and by experience, which eventually results in an equivalent rate of complications between the two experiment groups. Further, the surgical ablation in that study was performed through a bilateral minimal thoracotomy. This approach was necessary to accomplish a complete surgical PVI with the use of bipolar radiofrequency delivered by the Atricure device. The bilateral approach adds time and increases the chances of complications. This can be avoided with different devices such as the Estech Cobra Fusion, which is capable of a complete electrical deconnection of the posterior left atrium, delivering bipolar radiofrequency through a single right minimally invasive approach. According to the European Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], bipolar radiofrequency is the preferred source of energy for achieving a complete transmural line of ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The transmurality of the lesions can be consistently obtained with hybrid or simultaneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and staged or sequential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] approaches.</p><p>The hybrid simultaneous procedures have some disadvantages, in that they take time and do not allow a blank period to evaluate the clinical efficacy of surgery. The staged procedures allow a blank period of evaluation, and two modalities of ablation (surgical and percutaneous) may be used after a predetermined period or only in case of recurrences.</p><p>All of these procedures share the same basic principles. The posterior left atrium (the portion where many of the sources of PeAf are located) must be electrically separated from the base of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], with the addition of some endocardial lines, if necessary. In our study, we have chosen to adopt a staged approach. This has some possible advantages, including the evaluation of the efficacy of a monolateral minimally invasive approach by using bipolar radiofrequency. For this, we will use the Estech Cobra Fusion system. The ablation device encircles the posterior portion of the left atrium and allows the use of bipolar radiofrequency in a controlled protocol. Second, the procedural time is expected to be relatively short so as to avoid any ICU stay. Third, a blank period will allow a second percutaneous ablation to be performed only in patients with recurrent AF, which should reduce the total number of invasive procedures necessary to control the AF.</p><p>Finally, in our opinion, this will allow us to study the modalities of failures of the surgical approach and give valuable information in refinement of the techniques and devices.</p><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>No standard strategy is known for the percutaneous ablation of PeAF. In the PCA control group of our study, the choice of the initial technique will be left to the treating cardiologist (PVI, CFAE ablation with or without manipulation of the substrate, or rotor manipulation are frequently used in combination or in staged procedures). Insulated PVI is the least effective technique, whereas rotor modulation has been recently introduced and is not widely used. Thus, we expect that the majority of the patients in the control group will undergo a combination of PVI and CFAE ablation. In cases of failure in the surgical group, this choice will be dictated by the residual electrophysiological findings. This is a potential limitation of the study that may make comparison between the two groups difficult.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>At the moment of submission, the trial is recruiting patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AF: Atrial fibrillation; CFAE: complex fractioned atrial electrogram; ECAS: European Cardiac Arrhythmias Society; ECG: electrocardiogram; EHRA: European Hearth Rhythm Association; FAST: atrial fibrillation catheter ablation versus surgical ablation treatment; HRS: Heart Rhythm Society; LMW: low molecular weight; PCA: percutaneous catheter ablation; PeAF: persistent atrial fibrillation; PVI: pulmonary vein insulation; SR: sinus rhythm; TEE: transesophageal echo; PAF: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; SSA: staged surgical ablation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors do not have any financial relationship, nor have they received financial, property, or intellectual aid from any commercial source.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Each author substantially contributed to the study and met the authorship criteria.
