Eight recreationally-trained male cyclists volunteered and performed a maximal incremental test and a familiarization test on their first and second visits, respectively. On the third and fourth visits, the participants performed a 4000-m cycling TT after ingesting capsules containing either caffeine (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of body weight, CAF) or cellulose (PLA). The tests were applied in a double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures, cross-over design. When compared to PLA, CAF ingestion increased mean power output [219.1&#x000b1;18.6 vs. 232.8&#x000b1;21.4 W; effect size (ES) &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.60 (95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 to 1.16), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.034] and reduced the total time [419&#x000b1;13 vs. 409&#x000b1;12 s; ES&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.71 (95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.09 to &#x02212;1.13), p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.026]. Furthermore, anaerobic contribution during the 2200-, 2400-, and 2600-m intervals was significantly greater in CAF than in PLA (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, the mean anaerobic [64.9&#x000b1;20.1 vs. 57.3&#x000b1;17.5 W] and aerobic [167.9&#x000b1;4.3 vs. 161.8&#x000b1;11.2 W] contributions were similar between conditions (p&#x0003e;0.05). Similarly, there were no significant differences between CAF and PLA for anaerobic work (26363&#x000b1;7361 vs. 23888&#x000b1;6795 J), aerobic work (68709&#x000b1;2118 vs. 67739&#x000b1;3912 J), or total work (95245&#x000b1;8593 vs. 91789&#x000b1;7709 J), respectively. There was no difference for integrated electromyography, blood lactate concentration, heart rate, and ratings of perceived exertion between the conditions. These results suggest that caffeine increases the anaerobic contribution in the middle of the time trial, resulting in enhanced overall performance.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from the Coordination of Improvement of Personnel of Superior Level (CAPES-PRODOC, call MEC/CAPES 029/2010; grant number 58).

Because energy supply during a middle-distance cycling time-trial (e.g. 4000-m TT) is provided by both aerobic and anaerobic pathways, the pacing strategy depends on the momentary rate of energy supply by each of these systems <xref rid="pone.0075399-DeKoning1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, as the total amount of anaerobic work generated during a short-distance TT has been considered a fixed and limited amount (i.e. the anaerobic capacity) <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, anaerobic power output distribution has been considered the main metabolic pathway determining both pacing strategy <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and performance <xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> during such events.</p><p>It has been suggested that athletes subconsciously monitor some aspects derived from their anaerobic energy expenditure so that near-zero values of the anaerobic reserve are never reached during a TT <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This monitoring process was suggested to be based on distance remaining, remaining anaerobic reserves, and momentary power output <xref rid="pone.0075399-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, studies have reported a significant benefit of a fast-start strategy on short-distance cycling TT performance, and this has been associated with a greater anaerobic contribution in the first part of the trial <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For example, Aisbett et al. <xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> compared different pacing strategies (fast-, even-, and slow-start) during a cycling TT lasting &#x0223c;5 min (approximately the duration of a 4000-m cycling TT) and found that a fast-start strategy was associated with a higher power output and oxygen deficit (indicating greater anaerobic contribution) during the first 25% of the trial, compared with even- and slow-start strategies. The power output and anaerobic contribution during the fast-start trial became lower than the even- and slow-start trials from the second to the last quarter of the trial, resulting in a similar total amount of anaerobic work during the trial, but an increased overall performance. These data reinforce the hypothesis that anaerobic power output distribution is an important factor determining performance. In addition, Craig et al <xref rid="pone.0075399-Craig1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> found a significant correlation between anaerobic capacity, measured by maximum accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) (i.e. total amount of anaerobic work), and performance during a 4000-m individual pursuit, suggesting that the maximum amount of ATP potentially supplied by the anaerobic energy system may also be an important determinant of performance. This suggests that any intervention able to increase either moment-by-moment anaerobic power output and/or the total amount of anaerobic work may improve performance during a middle-distance cycling TT.</p><p>While research suggests the choice of pacing strategy does not affect the total anaerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, caffeine consumption (from 3 to 9 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass) has been reported to increase both the total anaerobic energy contribution and performance during time-to-exhaustion tests <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For example, Bell et al. <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found an increase in both the MAOD (7%) and time to exhaustion (8%) during high-intensity exercise performed at 125% of the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) after caffeine ingestion (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). It is believed that caffeine may increase glycolytic turnover due to an increase in phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity, resulting in an increased rate of ATP resynthesis <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bridge1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Caffeine ingestion also seems to have a direct action on the central nervous system (CNS) <xref rid="pone.0075399-Doherty2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which could increase muscle recruitment through the propagation of signals between the motor cortex and motoneurons <xref rid="pone.0075399-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Caffeine's ergogenic effects have also been attributed to a blunting of pain <xref rid="pone.0075399-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and the RPE <xref rid="pone.0075399-Doherty2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, via blockade of adenosine A<sub>2</sub>a receptor <xref rid="pone.0075399-Fredholm1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Similar to time-to-exhaustion tests, improvement in short-distance cycling TT performance has been also found following caffeine ingestion <xref rid="pone.0075399-Astorino1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Wiles1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Wiles et al <xref rid="pone.0075399-Wiles1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> found an increase (+3.6%) in the mean power output and a reduction (&#x02212;3.1%) in time to complete a 1-km cycling TT after caffeine intake (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass) compared to placebo. However, anaerobic contribution, pacing strategy and muscle recruitment have not been measured in these studies. Therefore, to date, it still is not known if the improved short-distance cycling TT performance caused by caffeine ingestion is due to an increased anaerobic contribution, an increase in muscle recruitment, or both. Furthermore, any changes in anaerobic metabolism would also be expected to affect the work-rate distribution (pacing strategy) during a TT <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Studies investigating the effect of caffeine on pacing strategy, distribution of anaerobic contribution, and muscle recruitment could provide important insights into important physiological mechanisms explaining the ergogenic effect of caffeine on performance.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeine on pacing strategy, distribution of the anaerobic contribution, and muscle recruitment during a 4000-m cycling TT. We hypothesized that, if caffeine increases the anaerobic energy contribution at any particular point of the trial, it would also modify the pattern of power output distribution during the TT, increasing the total anaerobic contribution and overall performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight trained male cyclists volunteered to participate in this study.

On the second visit, the participants performed a 4000-m cycling TT as a familiarization session. On the third and fourth visits, participants performed a 4000-m cycling TT using a double-blind, randomized and repeated-measures crossover design. One hour before starting the experimental session, the participants ingested one capsule containing either 5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass of caffeine (CAF) or cellulose (PLA).

The seat position was recorded and replicated during all subsequent experimental sessions. The participants underwent a warm-up at 100 W for 5min at 90 rpm. All participants started in a fixed gear ratio (i.e., 53&#x000d7;16), but participants were allowed to change gear ratio as desired immediately after the trial had started.

One hour before the test, the participants ingested one capsule containing caffeine or placebo, with 150 ml of water. Then, the participants rested for 45min and performed the MVCs. Thereafter, the participants started a 5-min warm-up at 100 W (90 rpm) followed by a 5-min rest and the 4000-m cycling TT.

During the MVC, and every 200-m during the time trial, the EMG of the right vastus lateralis (VL) was measured (Electromyography model 410C, EMGSystem Brazil, Sao Paulo, Brazil). The HR was measured with a heart rate transmitter coupled to the gas analyzer. The RPE was recorded every 1000-m using the Borg 15-point scale, ranging from &#x0201c;6&#x0201d; (no effort) to &#x0201c;20&#x0201d; (maximum effort) <xref rid="pone.0075399-Borg1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

Individuals were verbally encouraged to exert maximum effort during each contraction. The quadriceps muscle strength of both legs was measured with a load cell (EMGSystem Brazil, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil) with the knee at an angle of 60&#x000b0; (full extension being considered 0&#x000b0;) and the hip at 90&#x000b0;. The MVCpre was established as the highest value recorded during the three MVC repetitions. An additional MVC was performed 2 min after the TT (MVCpost) and used to calculate the level of fatigue induced by TT. It was assessed via an index of fatigue expressed as the relative difference (%) between MVCpre and MVCpost.</p><p>Prior to the collection of electromyography signals, hair was removed by shaving, the skin lightly abraded to remove the outer layer of epidermal cells, and oil and dirt were removed from the skin with an alcohol swab to reduce skin impedance. A bipolar surface electrode Ag/AgCl (Hal, Sao Paulo, Brazil) was positioned over the VL muscle and the reference electrode in a neutral location (bone structure: tibia). Adhesive tape (Micropore TM 3M, Campinas, SP, Brazil) was used to fix the electrodes on to the skin. The placement and localization of the electrodes were in accordance with the recommendations of SENIAM <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hermens1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The sampling frequency for acquisition of electromyography measurements was 2000 Hz (model 410c EMG System of Brazil Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). The raw EMG signals were filtered with a Butterworth band pass filter with cut-off frequencies set at 10 and 400 Hz to remove movement artifacts and noise from external interference. The integrated EMG (iEMG) was calculated every 200 m. The iEMG obtained at every 200-m interval during the time trial was normalized by dividing the iEMG by the peak torque determined during the MVCpre. These procedures were performed using MATLAB 7.5 software (Mathworks Inc., Natick, US).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Quantification of aerobic and anaerobic power</title><p>The aerobic and anaerobic contributions were calculated following the model adopted by Foster et al. <xref rid="pone.0075399-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

The main findings were: 1) a greater mean PO and lower final time during the TT when athletes ingested caffeine compared to PLA; 2) the PO in the middle of the TT (2200, 2400 and 2600 m) was greater in CAF versus PLA; 3) the higher PO values in the middle of the TT with caffeine ingestion were accompanied by a higher P<sub>an</sub>, but total anaerobic work remained unchanged, although it was correlated with time to complete the TT; 4) there was no alteration in iEMG signal during any part of the trial. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that caffeine ingestion alters pacing strategy, anaerobic contribution and performance during a short-distance cycling TT.</p><p>Although we have found that two participants were non-responders to caffeine, both the mean PO and time to complete the trial were improved (&#x0223c;10 s faster, moderate ES&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71, P&#x0003c;0.05) after ingestion of caffeine (5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass). In addition, the mean improvement with caffeine ingestion was increased slightly when the two non-responders are not taken in account (&#x0223c;14 s faster). We did not identify any order effect for the variables investigated, suggesting that the results cannot be attributed to learning effect or something other than the effects of caffeine.

Caffeine ingestion has also been associated with a reduction in pain perception <xref rid="pone.0075399-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and a lower RPE <xref rid="pone.0075399-Doherty2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, probably via a hyperalgesic effect promoted by blockade of adenosine A<sub>2</sub>a receptors <xref rid="pone.0075399-Fredholm1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the present study, although mean PO was higher in CAF than PLA, the RPE was not significantly different between the conditions, suggesting that participants were able to perform the TT with a higher PO/RPE ratio with caffeine ingestion. This result is in accordance with other studies showing that caffeine increases the PO/RPE ratio during a given TT <xref rid="pone.0075399-Astorino1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Irwin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Even with a higher PO, the iEMG signal was not different between conditions, suggesting caffeine may have improved peripheral muscle function during the exercise. It has been suggested that iEMG may not be interpreted uniquely as a muscle activation parameter, since there is the possibility that changes in iEMG activity are the result of altered motor neuron firing rates mediated either centrally <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bilodeau1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> or peripherally as a response to a reduction in muscle relaxation time and contraction speed <xref rid="pone.0075399-Gandevia1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Nonetheless, during dynamic exercise, changes in iEMG amplitude have been the only way to indirectly measure muscle activation levels <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hkkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and there is some evidence supporting that changes in iEMG signal may reflect change in muscle activation during controlled-experimental conditions as in our case <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Farina1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, it seems reasonable to hypothesise that in the present study caffeine may have exerted its main ergogenic effects by reducing RPE for a given PO, and improving muscle function, with no evidence of a significant effect on muscle activation (as indicated by iEMG). In addition, although the average power output during the TT was higher in CAF than in PLA, there was no significant difference in the fatigue index between the conditions. This is consistent with previous research <xref rid="pone.0075399-Schneiker1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and suggest that caffeine was able to induce a greater power output during the trial without inducing any additional fatigue at the end.</p><p>It has been suggested that the main peripheral effects of caffeine are: 1) an increase in the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> pump <xref rid="pone.0075399-Lindinger1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; 2) an increase in calcium mobilization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0075399-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and; 3) an increase in glycolysis via a direct effect on PFK <xref rid="pone.0075399-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, the inhibition of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme in the muscle results in elevated levels of intracellular cAMP, which exerts control on the major kinases stimulating glycogenolysis <xref rid="pone.0075399-Beavo1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Although we cannot fully disregard any of these mechanisms, it seems unlikely that the caffeine dose ingested in the present study would have affected calcium mobilization since this effect has only been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> when toxic doses of caffeine are utilized <xref rid="pone.0075399-Fredholm1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, an increase in calcium mobilization and Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> pump activity would have increased the excitability of the muscle fibers, which should have altered iEMG activity. Instead, we found no changes in iEMG activity with caffeine throughout the trial. In contrast, caffeine increased the P<sub>an</sub> in the middle of the trial, suggesting that the improved power output during the time-trial may have been supported by an additional anaerobic energy supply related to any peripheral alterations provoked by caffeine action.</p><p>Although caffeine increased P<sub>an</sub> in the middle of the trial, there were no significant differences between CAF and PLA conditions for total anaerobic or aerobic work during the TT. It has previously been reported that the amount of anaerobic energy that can be produced during a TT is a constant value, independent of pacing strategy <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As a consequence, it would be expected that P<sub>an</sub> at the beginning or the end of the trial would be reduced in the caffeine TT to compensate for the greater P<sub>an</sub> in the middle of TT. Instead, we observed that P<sub>an</sub> at the beginning and the end of the TT was similar between the two conditions. However, even though it was not statistically significant, caffeine intake was associated with a total anaerobic work &#x0223c;10% higher than placebo, and total anaerobic work was significantly correlated with time to complete the TT. An increase of 10% in the total anaerobic work is compatible with results from previous studies that reported a similar increase (10%) in the anaerobic capacity (measured by MAOD) during supramaximal, time-to-exhaustion exercise after caffeine intake <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Doherty1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but it is larger than the 2.5&#x02013;4% variation in the total anaerobic work described after different induced pacing strategies <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It could be hypothesized from these results that caffeine may have allowed the use of a small additional "anaerobic reserve" (&#x0223c;10%) that is not used under normal conditions. The existence of this anaerobic reserve during a TT has recently been demonstrated by Corbett et al. <xref rid="pone.0075399-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, who found that the total anaerobic energy yield during a 2000-m cycling TT was higher when participants believed they were competing against another athlete of similar ability (head-to-head), than when they exercised alone (time trial), suggesting that a motivational stimulus promotes the use of a greater degree of the anaerobic &#x02018;&#x02018;reserve&#x02019;&#x02019;. Thus, a small increase in the total anaerobic work found in the present study after caffeine ingestion, probably via an effect associated with increased muscle glycogenolysis and glycolysis, contributed to an improvement in the overall performance.</p><p>Concerning the pacing strategy adopted, the athletes adopted a fast-start in both conditions, but were able to maintain a greater PO during the middle of the trial (1200-, 1400-, 2200-, 2400- and 2600-m intervals) in CAF versus PLA. The changes in the PO were mirrored by similar changes in the P<sub>an</sub>, corroborating the idea that power distribution along a TT appears to be regulated primarily by changes in the anaerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hettinga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0075399-Aisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is interesting to note that caffeine intake was able to increase anaerobic contribution only during the middle of the trial. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating the effect of caffeine on pacing strategy and anaerobic distribution during a TT. However, we <xref rid="pone.0075399-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-LimaSilva2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and others <xref rid="pone.0075399-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> have shown that metabolic (e.g., muscle glycogen depletion), performance level or psychological (e.g., listening to music) manipulation are able to alter pacing strategy within minutes of starting a TT. Rauch et al <xref rid="pone.0075399-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, manipulating initial muscle glycogen reserves, reported that participants started two identical time trials (1-h TT) at almost the same workload (&#x0223c;230 W), but after 1min of cycling the workload was &#x0223c;10 W higher and averaged 14 W higher throughout the carbohydrate-loaded diet compared with the normal diet TT. In the present study, we found that pacing strategy with caffeine intake started to change after 1.2 km (&#x0223c;1.5 min) compared with the placebo TT. These results suggest that the pacing strategy at the beginning of a given TT may be regulated by a feed-forward, anticipatory mechanism, based on pre-exercise expectations and experiences, but it may be influenced by peripheral feedback as the exercise progresses <xref rid="pone.0075399-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition, although PO and P<sub>an</sub> were increased in the middle of the trial, there were no differences beyond 2600 m. The PO and P<sub>an</sub> during the end-spurt were similar for both the CAF and PLA conditions, and were accompanied by a similar post-exercise [La], suggesting that CAF was not able to increase anaerobic contribution at the end of the trial. However, a similar end spurt after having produced greater power throughout the middle portion of the TT is an interesting and meaningful outcome. It would be expected that a greater power output in the middle would result in greater failure or attenuated ability to produce an end spurt. Instead, it is plausible to suggest that the influence of caffeine also appears in the end spurt enabling participants to produce a similar sprint finish even after producing more power in the middle portion.</p><p>A potential limitation of the present study is that circulating caffeine concentrations were not measured. However, the participants were asked not to consume caffeine in the 24 h prior to each experimental test. Adherence to this advice was controlled via diet records, which indicated that participants followed the recommendations. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the ingestion of 5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass of caffeine one hour before the main trial, as adopted in the present study, is sufficient to significantly raise caffeine plasma concentration <xref rid="pone.0075399-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Schneiker1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Bell2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075399-Hodgson1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. While measures of circulating caffeine concentration would have confirmed, especially in the PLA condition, that no diet caffeine was consumed prior the trial, participants were assigned to the two conditions using a randomized, double-blinded, random and counterbalanced design, and we found an improvement in the TT performance after caffeine ingestion compared to placebo. This provides indirect evidence that plasma caffeine levels were higher in CAF than in PLA.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that athletes were able to complete a 4000-m cycling TT more quickly when ingesting 5 mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of caffeine, compared with a placebo.
