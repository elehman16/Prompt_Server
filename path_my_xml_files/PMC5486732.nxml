The recommended treatment is based on decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT) with two separate phases: a short-term intensive phase to reduce lymphedema volume and a long-term maintenance phase to stabilize it. Optimizing compression therapy and compliance during maintenance phase are key factors for long-term control of lymphedema. The primary objective of this pilot prospective open-label randomized study was to assess the benefit of a new auto-adjustable nighttime arm sleeve (MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit) on lymphedema volume during the maintenance phase after the intensive phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Forty women with BRCL were consecutively enrolled and randomized (D0) for 1&#x000a0;month in 1:1 ratio either in night-use group: with MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit (on top of a daytime compression hosiery), or in no night-use group: without MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit (daytime hosiery alone). From Day 31 to Day 90, all patients were fitted with MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit. Primary endpoint was lymphedema volume variation between Day 0 and Day 30. Secondary endpoints were compliance, quality of life (LYMQOL arm questionnaire), functional symptoms (heaviness, limb use limitation, pain), sleep quality, and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In ITT population, between Day 0 and Day 30, mean lymphedema volume increase was higher in no night-use group with 92.9&#x000a0;mL (i.e., 3.2%) than in night-use group with 46.7&#x000a0;mL (i.e., 1.80%), <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.757. Between Day 30 and Day 90, all patients fitted with MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit, lymphedema volume remained stable in both groups. The device improved functional symptoms and function domain of the LYMQOL arm questionnaire. MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit was worn overnight almost 85% of the nights. It was well accepted by the patients and no adverse reaction leading to permanent device discontinuation occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our results suggest that MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit offers clinical benefits during maintenance phase of lymphedema treatment and enhances patient&#x02019;s self-management.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Lymphedema</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Volume</kwd><kwd>Compression</kwd><kwd>Maintenance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005261</institution-id><institution>Centre Hospitalier R&#x000e9;gional Universitaire de Montpellier</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Laboratory Thuasne</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common and debilitating complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite modern treatment modalities, it remains a major health problem. As edema progress, the disease can lead to pain, infection, decreased function, reduced quality of life, body image disturbance and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The recommended treatment of lymphedema is based on a decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT) which is composed of 2 phases: an intensive phase which combines manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), multilayer bandages, skin cares, and physical exercises, to reduce as much as possible lymphedema volume in a few days period of time and a maintenance phase which consists in helping the patient to preserve lymphedema volume achieved during intensive phase, as long as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In spite of self-care management, it is common to observe an increase of lymphedema volume after intensive phase also called &#x0201c;maintenance phase failure&#x0201d;. There is no existing consensus on the definition of treatment failure in lymphedema, but in the long-term trial of Vignes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the stringent definition of treatment failure, i.e., a lymphedema volume increase of &#x02265;50% of the total reduction obtained with the first intensive decongestive physiotherapy, was selected to estimate a prolonged benefit. With this end-point criterion, the risk of failure was estimated to 38.1, 53.1, and 64.8% after 1, 2, and 4&#x000a0;years, respectively. In the POLIT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the first large observational study measuring the effects of DLT in 12 French lymphology reference centers, Qu&#x000e9;r&#x000e9; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] showed that even if intensive phase permitted to reduce lymphedema volume by 30%, the effect was partially reversed 6&#x000a0;months later. Therefore, optimizing maintenance phase treatment seems to be crucial for long term management of lymphedema.</p><p id="Par7">Compression is largely described as the key component in the treatment of lymphedema in the updated best practice guidelines of International Lymphedema Framework (ILF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In France, the Haute Autorit&#x000e9; de Sant&#x000e9; (HAS) recommends to use high-pressure compression garments (up to 15&#x000a0;mmHg with the need to apply the higher pressure tolerated by patient) during the day and if needed, low stretched bandages during the night without any pressure specifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, Damstra and Partsch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed that applying too much pressure under low-stretch bandages may be counterproductive and recommends levels of 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;mmHg for the upper limb. Self-management and patient compliance to treatment are crucial in the maintenance phase. Among the 306 patients observed in POLIT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], maintenance therapy was applied in most patients by means of daytime hosiery (95.8%) and/or bandages (12.3%) meaning some patients used both day devices. At night, 21.1% of the patients did not use any night compression therapy. Among the rest, 45.2% of the patients reported night compression therapy using bandaging and 46% with made to measure hosieries.</p><p id="Par8">In practice, during maintenance phase, the bandages are not easy to put on and require assistance and/or specific patient&#x02019;s education. Composed of several layers of inelastic and short-stretch materials, these bulky bandages do not favor patient&#x02019;s compliance and quality of life. Custom made short-stretch arm sleeve, designed to apply a low rest pressure, are easier to put on but can be quickly unsuitable if patient&#x02019;s measurements vary over time. The challenge is to provide BCRL patients with an easy to use, safe and effective low-stretch night device as an add-on treatment to their daytime compression hosiery in order to optimize their maintenance treatment and increase their autonomy and compliance.</p><p id="Par9">This study was conducted to assess the interest of nighttime MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit arm sleeve on lymphedema volume during maintenance phase in patients with BCRL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient&#x02019;s selection</title><p id="Par10">This pilot prospective open-label randomized controlled trial had been conducted between September 2014 and February 2015 in the vascular medicine ward of the Saint-Eloi Hospital, Montpellier, France.

We observed a different variation of lymphedema volume between the two groups in favor of the night-use group. In the ITT population, the lymphedema volume variation from Day 0 to Day 30 (relative median, primary efficacy endpoint) was lower in patients fitted with MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit (night use group) vs. the no night-use group (1.8 vs. 3.2%, respectively). The introduction during the first 30 nights of Autofit in night-use group patients, a critical period following intensive phase of DLT associated with high risk of lymphedema volume increase, should have limited maintenance phase failure, as compared to no night-use group patients treated without night device.</p><p id="Par36">From Day 30 to Day 90, when all patients were fitted with the auto-adjustable MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit arm sleeve during the night, the lymphedema volume remained stable in both groups, suggesting that the device allowed stabilization of the lymphedema volume as soon as it is putted on. Interestingly, this stabilization observed in night-use group is associated with improvement of the functional symptoms as well as the function as assessed by the patients.</p><p id="Par37">High quality compressive garments are important to maintain and optimize the volume reduction achieved during the intensive phase of DLT. Long term and consistent use of garments or bandages during the night are encouraged by ILF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Vignes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that women who wore a daytime compression sleeve associated with nighttime low-stretch compression bandages had a significantly reduced risk of relapse in arm lymphedema volume. However, self-bandaging remain a difficult process for patients, especially for arm. In addition, multilayers bandages composition varies widely (number of layers, type of material, number of overlaps) and the final quality is operator-dependent. Our results showed that MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit night sleeve can stabilize lymphedema volume during the first 3&#x000a0;months of the maintenance phase and improve some domains of quality of life and functional symptoms as an add-on treatment.</p><p id="Par38">Patient&#x02019;s adherence to the therapy is an important factor in the long-term management of lymphedema. It has been shown that the persistence of reduced lymphedema volume is associated with good patient&#x02019;s compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our study, during the first month, MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit was worn all night long for a mean of 84.5% of the nights. The same levels of compliance are observed from D30 to D90 in both groups, confirming the high acceptability of the device by patients. This result is in accordance to the great satisfaction reported by patients who especially liked the speed to put it on and the auto-adjustable nature of the product giving patients autonomy and opportunity to take part of their own treatment. Our data also proved that this device has a good safety profile, which could be a contributing factor to the observed good compliance.</p><p id="Par39">This original proof of concept study shows that night arm-sleeve MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit can be a useful device to stabilize lymphedema volume during maintenance phase treatment. The benefit seems to be greater in case of early treatment initiation after DLT intensive phase. Moreover, the study shows that it is a well-accepted device that enhances patient&#x02019;s autonomy. Consecutive inclusion over a short period in a single site limited the selection bias; also it is worth noting that, the study population and lymphedema characteristics is representative of the population of patients with BCRL.</p><p id="Par40">The limit of the study is the small sample size to show the statistical significance. As there are very few articles dealing precisely on the maintenance phase of lymphedema therapy and specifically on night garment effect, it was difficult to initially hypothesis the treatment effects. The results need to be confirmed in an appropriately powered study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">The results of this study suggest that auto-adjustable MOBIDERM&#x000ae; Autofit night sleeve, on top of daily compression, offer benefit to patients during maintenance phase of lymphedema treatment and enhances patient&#x02019;s autonomy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the patients who took their time to participate in the study and all the team of the unit of lymphology, Montpellier University Hospital that allowed this study to be achieved in the best conditions, especially our caregivers V&#x000e9;ronique Bouys, physiotherapist; Florence Delseny, physiotherapist; Fabienne Mourgues, nurse; and H&#x000e9;l&#x000e8;ne Pourquier, physiotherapist.
