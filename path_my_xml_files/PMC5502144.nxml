In PREVAIL, an international, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression by 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.0001) and reduced the risk of death by 29% (HR, 0.71; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.0001) compared with placebo in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>To evaluate treatment effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in East Asian patients from the PREVAIL trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of the Japanese, Korean, and Singaporean patients. PREVAIL enrolled patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed on androgen deprivation therapy. During the study, patients received enzalutamide (160&#x0200a;mg/d) or placebo (1:1) until death or discontinuation because of radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent therapy. Centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary endpoints. The secondary endpoints of the PREVAIL trial were investigator-assessed rPFS, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, and PSA response (&#x02265;50% decline).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>Of 1717 patients, 148 patients were enrolled at sites in East Asia (enzalutamide 73, placebo 75). Treatment effect of enzalutamide versus placebo was consistent with that for the overall population as indicated by the HRs (95% confidence interval) of 0.38 (0.10&#x02013;1.44) for centrally assessed rPFS, 0.59 (0.29&#x02013;1.23) for OS, 0.33 (0.19&#x02013;0.60) for time to chemotherapy, and 0.32 (0.20&#x02013;0.50) for time to PSA progression. In East Asian patients, PSA responses were observed in 68.5% and 14.7% of enzalutamide- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The enzalutamide plasma concentration ratio (East Asian:non-Asian patients) was 1.12 (90% confidence interval, 1.05&#x02013;1.20) at 13 weeks.

The overall incidence of AEs and serious AEs was generally consistent between East Asian patients and the overall population (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), with few differences observed.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Overall AE summary.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7223-g007"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Most common AEs: Comparison with overall population.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7223-g008"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this post hoc analysis of PREVAIL, treatment effects and safety in East Asian patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve mCRPC were generally consistent with those in the overall study population. Some of the observed differences in baseline disease characteristics of East Asian patients relative to the overall study population may be attributed to differences in clinical practice in Japan, Korea, and Singapore compared with Western countries. In Asian countries, patients with prostate cancer are often diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease, which may be related to less frequent PSA screening in Asian countries than in Western countries.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In PREVAIL, compared with the overall study population, a higher percentage of East Asian patients had a Gleason score &#x02265;8 and a greater percentage had bone disease, suggesting a higher disease burden. However, at baseline, East Asian patients had lower median PSA levels and fewer had soft-tissue disease and pain. East Asian patients had an increased use of corticosteroids, commonly used to treat pain associated with bone disease, which may account for the larger proportion of patients with low baseline pain compared with the overall population. The percentage of East Asian patients who had received at least 2 antiandrogen therapies prior to treatment with ENZA was higher than in the overall study population. Notably, hormone therapy is widely used for treatment of early stage prostate cancer in Japan,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> whereas radical prostatectomy is the preferred treatment in Korea.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Some baseline disease characteristics may also be attributed to differences in ethnicity. It has previously been shown that, in general, Asian men have a lower baseline PSA than Caucasian men.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Studies of PSA screening in Korea,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Japan,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> and Singapore<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> have identified increased percentages of patients with prostate cancer in groups with PSA levels below the commonly accepted 4.0 ng/mL threshold. Some groups have suggested that a lower PSA cutoff value should be used to recommend prostate biopsy for Asian patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In PREVAIL, ENZA-treated East Asian patients had a lower PSA response rate (68.5%) than those in the overall study population (78.0%). Similar results were obtained in other studies of Asian men with mCRPC, including phase II studies of abiraterone acetate and prednisolone, in which 43% to 60% of Asian patients had a PSA response.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Similarly, in studies of cabazitaxel in Japanese<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> and Korean,<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> patients with mCRPC previously treated with chemotherapy, PSA responses were achieved by 29% and 32% of patients, respectively.</p><p>AEs commonly reported by East Asian patients treated with ENZA in PREVAIL were similar to those reported by the overall study population. AEs that were more common among East Asian patients than in the overall study population included upper respiratory tract infection, pollakiuria, fall, and decreased appetite. Among ENZA-treated East Asian patients, common AEs (fatigue and back pain) reported at a grade level &#x02265;3 were rare (occurring in &#x0003c;3% of patients).</p><p>The results from East Asian patients in PREVAIL should be interpreted with caution given the small number of Japanese, Korean, and Singaporean patients enrolled in the study. The heterogeneity of ethnicities across East Asia also precludes generalizing these results for the rest of Asia. In addition, PREVAIL was not designed to investigate the impact of any differences observed in baseline demographic or disease characteristics between East Asian patients and the overall population, nor was it powered to detect treatment effects or safety differences between ENZA and placebo in East Asian patients. These limitations impact median estimates of OS and rPFS in East Asian patients as well as the ability to detect differences in AEs between East Asian patients receiving ENZA or placebo. However, our analysis showed that results in East Asian patients were consistent with those in the overall population, which was sufficiently powered to detect treatment effects and the safety of ENZA compared with placebo.</p><p>In summary, this analysis showed that results in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve East Asian men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC were consistent with those observed in the overall PREVAIL study population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-96-e7223-s001.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e834" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AE = adverse event, AR = androgen receptor, CI = confidence interval, CRPC = castration-resistant prostate cancer, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ENZA = enzalutamide, HR = hazard ratio, mCRPC = metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, OS = overall survival, PSA = prostate-specific antigen, rPFS = radiographic progression-free survival, SRE = skeletal-related event.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The PREVAIL study was sponsored by the Astellas Pharma, Inc., and Medivation, Inc.; Medivation was acquired by Pfizer Inc in September 2016.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>CSK, YDC, SEL, HML, TU, JY, TF, EC, WL, BT, TMB, and GK performed the research; BT and TMB designed the research study; CSK, YDC, SEL, HML, TU, JY, TF, EC, WL, BT, TMB, and GK contributed essential reagents or tools; and all authors analyzed the data and wrote the paper.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>CSK, YDC, SEL, HML, and WL have nothing to disclose.
