Thus, successful interventions are still called for. The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of a multicomponent school-based intervention programme targeting physical activity, sedentary and dietary behaviours on anthropometric outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 20-month intervention was evaluated in a cluster randomised, controlled study of 1324 11-year-olds. Outcome variables were body mass index (BMI), BMI-for-age z-score (BMIz), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WTHR) and weight status (International Obesity Task Force's cut-offs). Weight, height and WC were measured objectively; pubertal status was self-reported and parental education was self-reported by the parents. Intervention effects were determined by one-way analysis of covariance and logistic regression, after checking for clustering effects of school, and moderating effects of gender, pubertal status and parental education.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Beneficial effects were found for BMI (p=0.02) and BMIz (p=0.003) in girls, but not in boys. While a beneficial effect was found for BMI (p=0.03) in participants of parents reporting a high level of education, a negative effect was found for WTHR in participants with parents reporting a low level of education (p=0.003). There were no intervention effects for WC and weight status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A multicomponent 20-month school-based intervention had a beneficial effect on BMI and BMIz in adolescent girls, but not in boys. Furthermore, children of higher educated parents seemed to benefit more from the intervention, and this needs attention in future interventions to avoid further increase in social inequalities in overweight and obesity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health promotion through physical activity</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Interactions between food intake and physical activity/exercise</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>The increasing rates of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents have resulted in several initiatives aiming to prevent further development of the epidemic.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, evidence supports beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on body mass index (BMI) in systematically developed interventions that promote healthy eating and physical activity and emphasise support from teachers and parents and home activities.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials of objectively measured physical activity concluded that successful physical activity interventions have only had a small effect on children's overall activity levels,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which may partly explain why they have had limited success in preventing childhood obesity. Methodological shortcomings have also been used as an explanation for the lack of intervention effects.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Many intervention studies are underpowered to detect small differences between groups, particularly on adiposity outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Longer term programmes and comprehensive school-based interventions may be more effective than shorter programmes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> There is ongoing discussion regarding the optimal measure of adiposity in larger studies of children and adolescents. Some authors claim that BMI-for-age z-score (BMIz) is the best measure as it adjusts for the age and gender of the child<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> while others claim that BMI most aptly represents a child's adiposity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> BMI and BMIz are merely estimates of body fatness as these indices do not differentiate between the types of tissue that contribute to body weight (fat, muscle or bone mass).</p><p>To determine whether a school-based intervention is truly an effective means to reduce body fat, it may be necessary to assess it using a number of different anthropometric variables.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Questions have also been raised about intervention reach.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Gender and socioeconomic status may moderate intervention effects.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There are still relatively few methodologically strong trials aimed at the primary prevention of weight gain in older children, thus indicating a need to strengthen the evidence base.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

Waist circumference (WC) was measured to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;cm by a measuring tape between the lower rib and the iliac-crest at the end of a normal expiration.

A beneficial effect on BMI was seen among participants of parents with higher education. However, a negative intervention effect on WTHR was seen among participants of parents reporting low education.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effect of the intervention on BMI</title><p>One reason for the lack of overall effect on BMI for both boys and girls can be the inadequate dose received of intervention components. Unpublished process evaluation data indicate that the level of implementation of the components decreased from midway to postintervention, thus reducing both the reach and dose received by the participants. Furthermore, since low cost and high applicability of the intervention activities in the public school system were given high priority, this may also have limited the dose received on each of the targeted behaviours. Moreover, the diet and activity behaviours that were promoted in the intervention, separately or in combination, may not have been sufficient to affect estimates of body composition to a greater magnitude.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The length of the intervention, being almost two academic years, can be considered relatively long compared with similar school-based interventions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Sufficiently intense intervention (daily expert-led physical education) and adequate duration (1&#x02005;year) were two strengths that were pointed out in the successful KISS study, which managed to favourably affect estimates of body composition in first and fifth grade schoolchildren.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additionally, both the control group and the intervention group in the present study increased their total physical activity significantly during the intervention.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This was unexpected as a decline in physical activity with increasing age has repeatedly been documented between the ages 9 and 15.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> We cannot rule out that the control schools have initiated their own health-promoting initiatives, even if allocated to the control arm of the study. For ethical reasons, we made no attempt to prevent this. The lack of overall intervention effects can also be due to the limited potential for change, as the majority of participants in this study were of normal weight at baseline.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effect of the intervention on secondary objectives</title><p>We have previously reported that gender moderated the effect of the HEIA intervention on dietary behaviours, sedentary behaviours and physical activity.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The effect of the intervention was greater for girls than for boys on most of the outcomes we investigated.</p><p>This can have several explanations. Four female researchers developed the intervention and assisted the implementation. The majority of teachers involved in this project were women. Unintentionally, the intervention components may therefore have been better adapted and delivered to girls than to boys. The earlier demonstrated intervention effects on behaviours in girls but not in boys may partly explain why the intervention was effective on BMI and BMIz among girls only.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is possible that boys did not change their physical activity level as much as girls because of higher baseline values and, consequently, had a smaller potential for change. Furthermore, the issues addressed in the study may be of greater interest to girls, or girls may be more conscientious regarding the intervention components than boys. We appreciate the results showing that the intervention reached and affected girls. However, we also acknowledge that the intervention failed to affect the same outcomes in boys. Similarly, the American &#x02018;Planet Health&#x02019; study significantly reduced the prevalence of obesity in 12-year-old girls by promotion of physical activity, modification of dietary intake and reduction of sedentary behaviours, but found no effect on boys.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> On the other hand, another American intervention study targeting environment, policy and social marketing (M-SPAN) showed a significant reduction in BMI in 11-year-old to 13-year-old boys over two school years, but not in girls.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A systematic review of school-based interventions that focused on changing dietary intake and physical activity to prevent childhood obesity concluded that such interventions may be more effective for younger children and girls.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The authors suggested that children aged 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;years may respond differently by genders to different intervention elements.</p><p>The present study demonstrated a beneficial intervention effect on participants having parents with high education, and a negative intervention effect on participants in the lowest parental education group with respect to WTHR. While acknowledging that we failed to positively reach participants of parents with low education, the reason is not readily explainable. In an attempt to explain social differences in fruit and vegetable consumption among Norwegian schoolchildren, Bere <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> found that children with lower educated parents had less access to fruits and vegetables than children with higher educated parents, and hypothesised that cost, greater knowledge, health considerations and greater support from family and friends could be the reasons for this difference. The results are in line with earlier findings, which describe a social gradient in the problem of adolescent overweight and obesity,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;35</xref> and which show that population-based intervention efforts seem to reach participants from different socioeconomic backgrounds differently and may contribute to increased health inequalities.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>In this paper, we chose to include multiple estimates of body composition as called for,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> although BMI was the main outcome variable in the study. It is noteworthy that relatively closely related outcomes, that is, BMI and WTHR, gave different results regarding intervention effects. All the investigated outcomes are descriptions of body composition and more equal effects could have been expected. The results suggest that there are differences in how the intervention affects these measures. The power analyses were calculated to detect differences between groups for BMI; the other investigated anthropometric outcomes may have required a larger sample size to detect intervention effects.</p><p>Regarding effect size, all the significant effect sizes were classified as small. The highest explained variance was only 1.4% in girls&#x02019; BMIz and WTHR in the lowest parental education group. This means that most of the participants&#x02019; estimates of body composition development during the trial were explained by other factors, and thus the importance of the intervention effects may be limited. However, obtaining small but beneficial findings such as this can be important for public health if implemented on a larger scale and with a longer duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of the study include the systematic development of the intervention and the study design, which were based on the current recommendations and best practice.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Other strengths were the large number of participants from a narrow age group. Furthermore, the multicomponent intervention lasting 20&#x02005;months was designed to be feasible to implement within the school system and not financially demanding. Also, the anthropometric measures were objectively assessed, self-reported pubertal maturation was included and parental education was reported by a parent for nearly the full sample.</p><p>We acknowledge that our study has limitations. A possible selection bias might be present because a rather large proportion of invited schools declined to take part in the study. Recruiting schools in Norway to extracurricular projects has become a challenging undertaking over the past decade, as curricular and administrative demands on schools have increased substantially. In addition, weighing of children is a controversial issue in Norway and has been debated in the national media repeatedly. However, attrition analyses showed no differences between the participating schools and schools which declined to participate in terms of the number of students in the sixth grade and the overall size.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The drop-out analyses showed that participants lost to follow-up had a higher BMI and indicate that we lost participants that we intended to reach. A possible reason for this attrition could be resistance to assessment of anthropometrics in light clothing or underwear only. This was discovered as the main reason for adolescents to refuse participation in the anthropometric measurement in a Dutch school-based weight gain prevention programme.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, the drop-out rate was small and equal in both groups, and no further differences were detected. Also, when investigating the intervention effects of a multicomponent intervention, it is not possible to sort out the effects of the different components. Finally, as the sample was recruited from a limited geographic area, this could reduce the generalisability of our findings. However, the objectively measured height, weight and total physical activity from the participants in this study fall adequately between the measures of 9-year-olds and 15-year -olds in a nationally representative sample.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that a 20-month comprehensive multicomponent school-based intervention designed to increase physical activity, reduce sedentary time and stimulate a healthy diet successfully decreased BMI and BMIz among girls, but not boys.</p><p>The intervention had a beneficial effect on BMI among children of parents with higher education, but not among children of parents with lower education.
