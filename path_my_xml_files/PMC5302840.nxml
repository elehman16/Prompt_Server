Given the modest effectiveness of seasonal vaccination, vaccine-induced antibody responses could serve as a potent selective pressure for novel influenza variants at the individual or community level. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. Importantly, this study design allowed us to isolate the impact of vaccination while still studying natural infection. We used pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers to quantify vaccine-induced immunity directly and to assess its impact on intrahost populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 5119 person-years. We obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples and used a stringent and empirically validated analysis pipeline to identify intrahost single nucleotide variants at &#x02265;1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season HAI and NAI titer, respectively. In our study population, we found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems, our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Influenza is a significant global health problem. Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza virus infection, and seasonal influenza vaccines are considered for reformulation each year in order to keep up with the virus&#x02019; evolution. Despite these efforts, vaccine recipients often develop an immune response that does not protect from infection. Given the current recommendation that all people over 6 months of age get vaccinated, it is important to understand how vaccination itself may impact viral evolution during natural human infection. We studied how vaccination may alter viral evolution within individuals, as each person harbors many highly-related influenza variants that differ in their ability to escape the immune response. We compared groups of people in a vaccine trial to determine the impact that vaccination has on viral diversity and variant selection within individuals. We did not detect significant differences in the number of variants detected or in the prevalence of mutations that could impact antibody binding based on vaccination group or antibody response. Our work suggests that vaccination is not a major factor in driving the emergence of new influenza strains at the level of the individual host.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI118886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2906-8335</contrib-id><name><surname>Lauring</surname><given-names>Adam S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000862</institution-id><institution>Doris Duke Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSDA 2013105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2906-8335</contrib-id><name><surname>Lauring</surname><given-names>Adam S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI057853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monto</surname><given-names>Arnold S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Sanofi Pasteur</institution></funding-source><award-id>Unrestricted research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monto</surname><given-names>Arnold S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Debbink</surname><given-names>Kari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR000433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Debbink</surname><given-names>Kari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCrone</surname><given-names>John T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Clinician Scientist Development Award from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (CSDA 2013105) and R01 AI118886, both to ASL, and by U01 AI057853 and an unrestricted grant from Sanofi Pasteur, both to ASM.

This is, in part, a result of the modest effectiveness of current vaccines, so that considerable numbers of vaccine failures occur each year. Within individuals, influenza populations exist as a collection of closely related, and at times antigenically distinct, variants that may exhibit diverse phenotypes [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNV) can be transmitted as part of the infecting population [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or generated over the course of an infection due to the virus&#x02019; low replication fidelity [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The evolutionary forces that shape the genetic structure of viral populations within hosts and ultimately give rise to novel antigenic variants at the host population level are poorly understood. A clear understanding of the intrahost diversity of influenza virus populations and its impact on influenza virus evolution is central to many questions of direct clinical and public health relevance [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Influenza vaccines are considered for reformulation each year to counter the viral antigenic drift that enables escape from the previous year&#x02019;s vaccine [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Annual influenza vaccine effectiveness is 60% on average, and can be much lower during antigenically unmatched years [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While antigenic drift is monitored annually on a global scale, the source of antigenic variation is ultimately at the level of the individual host. Phylogenetic studies of whole genome sequences from cities and smaller communities have demonstrated that multiple lineages circulate over the course of a single influenza season [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and individual hosts may harbor mixed infections that include antigenically novel variants [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While human hosts could be preferentially infected with one lineage over another based on pre-infection immune status, the degree to which circulating escape variants contribute to vaccine failure is currently unknown.</p><p>Host immune selection is a major driver of influenza virus evolution on the global scale. Both phylogenetic analysis and antigenic cartography have demonstrated that antibodies exert positive selective pressure on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vaccination and natural influenza infection often lead to partial, or non-sterilizing immunity, and post-vaccination antibody titers are only a moderate predictor of subsequent protection [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Previous work has demonstrated that sub-neutralizing concentrations of immune sera can promote the generation of antigenic variants, and some have argued that vaccination can accelerate the process of antigenic drift [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A recent study in vaccinated people suggested that novel antigenic variants could be present at low frequencies [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly, humans often differ in their prior exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines, and pre-existing immunity may confound such studies [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the extent to which partial immunity selects for antigenically relevant variants during natural infection in humans is unclear.</p><p>By necessity, most of the available data on vaccination and intrahost evolution have come from analyses of HA sequences in large animal models of infection, including horses, pigs, and dogs. These studies have suggested that intrahost populations include a number of somewhat rare single nucleotide variants that increase and decrease in frequency over the course an infection with sporadic fixation events occurring in some animals.

We hypothesized that non-sterilizing immunity could potentially select for novel antigenic variants and contribute to larger scale patterns of influenza evolution. We were able to definitively address these questions using samples derived from a randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trial in healthy, young adults who likely had similar prior exposure to influenza viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The availability of post-vaccination, preseason HAI and NAI titers allowed us to examine directly the impact of measured serologic antibody pressure rather than using vaccination alone as a surrogate marker. Because all individuals were infected naturally, our data provide a rare view of within-host influenza virus diversity in humans. We directly sequenced the samples without passage in cell culture, eliminating the possibility of culture-adapted mutations and employed a well-benchmarked variant calling pipeline [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that dramatically reduces the false positive iSNV calls that often plague next generation sequencing studies. In this exhaustive and well-controlled study, we found no differences in intrahost influenza diversity based on vaccination status or HAI and NAI titers.</p><p>Our findings in a natural infection system are concordant with an equine influenza virus evolution study in vaccinated horses. Intrahost variation was similar between na&#x000ef;ve and vaccinated horses, regardless of whether they were infected naturally or experimentally [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, not all experimental infection studies mirror results seen during natural infection. A study investigating swine influenza virus found discrepancies in intrahost variation based on whether animals encountered natural infection or were experimentally infected [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our data is in contrast with a study of experimentally-infected dogs that uncovered differences in intrahost diversity and evolution in antigenic sites based on vaccination status [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two other studies of equine influenza virus found mixed infections of multiple influenza lineages during natural infection, which would not be seen in an experimental model but may be relevant to the transmission and spread of novel variants [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overall, it is challenging to compare our results to those obtained in various animal models, where the hosts are often immunologically na&#x000ef;ve and infected with a defined inoculum of a single genotype.</p><p>We did not detect phylogenetic clustering of HA and NA sequences based on vaccination status, type of administered vaccine, or pre-season HAI and NAI titers. These results are consistent with those of Dinis et al., who found no segregation of HA sequences based on vaccination status in a case test-negative study of vaccine effectiveness [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are infected with similar strains and that within season antigenic drift is not a major contributor to reduced vaccine efficacy in the seasons analyzed. Because we also stratified our analysis by pre-season HAI and NAI titer, we can similarly exclude viral escape from a non-sterilizing antibody response. Our data further suggest that pre-existing antibody against circulating strains does not apply sufficiently strong selective pressure to drive the emergence of antigenically distinct strains within a given host.</p><p>High intrahost diversity may be an important factor in viral evolution, since it increases the number of novel variants on which natural selection can act. Some have proposed that the intrahost diversity of RNA viruses is linked to virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting that processes that act to restrict or enhance intrahost diversity may alter disease phenotypes. We found that within host diversity of influenza virus was quite low. Most iSNV were present at frequencies of less than 0.1, which means they would only plausibly be spread between hosts if the transmission bottleneck were reasonably large [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The number of iSNV in a given host was similar between vaccine and placebo groups, both across the genome and on the segments coding for HA and NA. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in diversity when samples were grouped by HAI and NAI titer, and we did not find evidence of treatment-specific iSNV. Together our data suggest that vaccine-induced immunity does not significantly influence intrahost diversity and is a relatively weak selective pressure at the level of the individual host.</p><p>While the number of iSNV was similar in all groups, we considered it possible that partial immunity may drive the emergence of specific antigenic variants. Vaccination and natural infection can induce a wide range of immune responses depending on host and viral factors. These can range from complete protection to leaky responses that allow infection, but influence disease severity or duration. Non-sterilizing immune responses have the potential to select for escape variants within each host. In the setting of current recommendations for universal vaccination, a highly vaccinated population could potentially select for antigenically evolved viruses more quickly than the spread of natural infection. For this reason, it is important to tease apart the role of vaccination on influenza evolution. We did find a number of variants in antigenic sites, but these were no more frequent than in other regions of the genome and did not vary with vaccination status or HAI and NAI titer. Importantly, our results are in conflict with earlier work in several model systems that demonstrate the rapid selection of antigenic variants in the presence of sub-neutralizing antibody or in experimentally infected animals [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in infectious dose, host genetic background, history of prior influenza infection, immune correlates not captured by HAI and NAI titers, or the strains tested. Animal studies are often performed in immunologically na&#x000ef;ve or genetically identical animals, whereas humans have complex genetic backgrounds and immunological histories that could play a role in mediating population-wide immunity.</p><p>While global patterns of influenza transmission and evolution are complex, our study provides important insights regarding influenza evolution on intra- and interhost scales. We were able to define aspects of intrahost evolution within a geographically-constrained and relatively young cohort with similar vaccination histories and previous influenza exposures across groups, limiting potential confounding factors. Still, we acknowledge that by reducing these confounders, we may be missing important determinants of intrahost evolution. For example, intrahost diversity may be different in children, older adults, or those with high-risk conditions. Our study included 5119 person-years of observations to yield a dataset of 165 viruses, 119 of which were sequenced. Large, placebo-controlled, randomized influenza vaccine trials involving thousands of people are unlikely to be conducted in the future due to the recommendation for universal vaccination. Therefore, our sample set likely represents the best chance to directly assess the impact of vaccination on influenza evolution in the context of natural human infection.</p><p>Despite our well-controlled study, we found little evidence for vaccine-driven evolution in the context of the community that was sampled. None of the low frequency variants identified in the antigenic sites were found in subsequent seasons. While we cannot rule out the possibility that evolutionary patterns would be different in other geographic regions, different influenza seasons, or with other subtypes, we did not uncover differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations with respect to genome-wide or antigenic diversity in three H3N2 seasons. We were not able to evaluate the impact of vaccination on H1N1 or subtype B viruses. Furthermore, our sample set cannot discern whether there are differences in evolutionary pressure based on vaccine match/mismatch, as the vast majority of our samples were from antigenically matched seasons. A major limitation of our study was that only one sample was available for each participant, so we could not track changes in diversity or mutation accumulation within each individual over the course of their infection. However, we did not observe significant differences in the number of mutations over the first 6 days of infection, which is consistent with previous work in horses [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and a deep sequencing study of 7 humans in an experimental challenge model [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Together with these works, our data suggest that within host dynamics are dominated by purifying selection with the transient appearance of minority variants and little sustained fixation. Selection and transmission of antigenically and epidemiologically important variants is likely to be a rare event when studied at this scale. Given that our data are derived from 165 incident infections in 5119 season-years of observation, detection of such events in the course of a natural infection would require an unrealistic sample size.</p><p>We evaluated the potential for vaccine-induced immunity to drive intrahost evolution, as this is an important issue in light of the current recommendation for universal influenza vaccination. We did not find evidence for vaccine-induced pressure on the intrahost or consensus level, despite employing several methods used to study evolutionary processes. Our study is larger than other reports and involves extensive analysis of both placebo and vaccination groups. While randomization, placebo control, and reliance on a young healthy population allowed us to address this question in a rigorous manner, these factors may have lessened person-to-person variation. By better defining the intrahost evolutionary mechanisms and how they impact population-wide influenza evolution, we hope to address questions of import to clinicians and public health workers, improve vaccine design, and develop more efficient epidemiological control measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical School, and all human subjects provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Subjects and specimens</title><p>We characterized host-derived influenza populations archived from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of influenza vaccine efficacy that ran from the 2004&#x02013;2005 through the 2007&#x02013;2008 influenza seasons (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00133523, [<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006194.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]).
