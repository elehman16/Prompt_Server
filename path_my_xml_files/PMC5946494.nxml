The most frequently used antidepressants are selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&#x000a0;(SNRIs), however, these exhibit a series of side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat PSD with few side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <italic>Jiedu Tongluo</italic> granules for treating PSD with <italic>qi deficiency</italic> and <italic>blood stasis syndrome</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The planned study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Eighty participants will be randomly assigned to receive either treatment or placebo. The treatment group will receive <italic>Jiedu Tongluo</italic> granules (JDTLG) with conventional treatment, and the placebo group will receive placebo with conventional treatment for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome is the effectiveness of JDTLG on depression after 8&#x000a0;weeks treatment, which is defined as a decrease of 50%&#x000a0;or more in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) score or clinical recovery (score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7). Secondary outcomes are improvement in neurological function, degree of independence, activities of daily living, and TCM syndrome at each visit, which will be measured with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI) and TCM scale, respectively. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and small-molecule metabolites will be monitored to explore the mechanism of action of JDTLG on PSD. Safety measures include vital signs, results of electrocardiography, laboratory index (full blood count, kidney and liver function tests) and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of JDTLG in individuals with PSD with concomitant <italic>qi deficiency</italic> and <italic>blood stasis syndrome</italic>.

The prevalence of PSD is approximately one third of stroke survivors at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], ranging from 39% to 52% within the first 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PSD patients experience poor functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several therapeutic strategies have been shown to be effective for PSD, including pharmacological, non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and acupuncture), and combination therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The most frequently studied agents are antidepressants, whereby the most thoroughly characterized agents are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, antidepressant medications exhibit a series of side effects, such as increased risk of hemorrhagic complications and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although minor side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness are most commonly reported.</p><p id="Par20">Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat PSD and has demonstrated a more favorable safety profile than conventional medicine. A meta-analysis showed that <italic>Liver-qi</italic> regulation effectively ameliorates depressive symptoms, as well as enhancing quality of life among patients with PSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to a&#x000a0;data from a previous&#x000a0; research about&#x000a0;the syndrome differentiation of ischemic stroke, the syndrome of <italic>&#x0201c;qi deficiency</italic> and <italic>blood stasis&#x0201d;</italic> might reach&#x000a0;a proportion of 21.54%&#x000a0;among the clinical patients, which would&#x000a0;rank first&#x000a0;within the different subtypes&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a common complication of stroke, PSD can be divided into different syndromes, among which qi deficiency and blood stasis is an important subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>Jiedu Tongluo</italic> granules (JDTLG) is a patented complex Chinese medicine formulation (No: 201510419571.3), which consist of seven herbs, including <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> (<italic>Ren Shen</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (<italic>Yin Xing Ye</italic>) 25&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, <italic>Hypericum perforatum L.</italic> (<italic>Guan Ye Lian Qiao</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi</italic> (<italic>Huang Qin</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, <italic>Gardenia jasminoides Ellis</italic> (<italic>Zhi Zi</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, <italic>Gastrodia elata Bl.</italic> (<italic>Tian Ma</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g, and <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong hort</italic> (<italic>Chuan Xiong</italic>) 12.5&#x000a0;g/100&#x000a0;g. According to the TCM theory, these herbs are believed to supplement <italic>qi</italic> and activate blood circulation, remove toxins and relieve stagnation, extinguish <italic>wind</italic>, and dredge collaterals. One previous study showed that JDTLG significantly improved depression-like behavior in animal stroke models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, key components of JDTLG, are known to possess neuro-protective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore<italic>, the antidepressant effects of&#x000a0;Panax ginseng</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] might be derived from&#x000a0;activation of&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;signaling pathway involving brain&#x000a0;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Our preclinical pharmacological experiments have shown that JDTLG has a neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effect via up-regulating the expression of BDNF, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1&#x003b1;), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and reducing the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule1 (VCAM1) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9). In addition, JDTLG can exert an anti-depressant function through increasing the expression of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor (unpublished data).</p><p id="Par21">This study aims to explore whether JDTLG can improve depression and daily living compared with placebo in PSD participants with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par22">This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JDTLG in treating PSD with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome.

Eighty participants will be assigned to one of two groups at the ratio of 1:1, whereby the treatment and placebo groups will be coded A and B, respectively. The code will be placed in an envelope and subsequently sealed. The statistician will send the envelope directly to the product manufacturer for labeling of the active and placebo product according to the randomization code. All participants and attending physicians will be blinded to treatment assignment until study completion. Duplicated blinding codes will be given to the research institution and the manufacturer and will not be broken during the trial unless required to do so.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data management and quality control</title><p id="Par60">The trial will be conducted according to the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in effort to guarantee the rigor of the study. Data will be imported in the clinical data management system (CDMS) available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xyedc.com">http://www.xyedc.com</ext-link>, and an independent organization will be responsible for the data management. The investigators are required to attend a series of training sessions which will cover correct administration of the assessments, participant instruction procedures regarding the use of study granules, collection of study variables, CRF completion, and use of the CDMS. Data is to be imported into the CDMS by two independent researchers within 1 week of collection. All discrepant entries will be marked and recorded for resolution at the clinical data system. After the first participant has completed, regular visits will be performed by an independent trial monitor who has been appointed by the trial sponsor. The monitor will review the two entries, resolve discrepancies, and recheck the CRFs and investigators&#x02019; source data if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Compliance and retention</title><p id="Par61">In order to maximize compliance and retention throughout the study, we will ensure the study schedule and requirements of participation are fully explained prior to obtaining consent, and that participants are aware of the potential risks and benefits of treatment. A copy of the signed informed consent form, containing the contact details of investigators, will be given to each participant so that they are able to contact the principal investigator if required. What is more, all participants will receive a telephone call before each follow-up appointment to remind them of the treatment time and location. Additionally, 8 weeks of medication will be given to participants in two separate sessions to avoid it being misplaced; i.e., at baseline and at week 4. We will try to prevent dropouts by providing ongoing support to participants. Transport allowance, free medical and relative examination will be provided for the participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par62">This is an exploratory clinical trial designed to provide scientific rationale and feasibility for clinical phase II pilot study and, therefore, is not fully powered. A sample size of 80 participants will be recruited, with 40 participants in each treatment group. Results from this study will be used to for sample size calculations in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par63">All of the data from this study will be analyzed by biostatisticians using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Outcomes are based on the intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p id="Par64">Baseline characteristics will be summarized by means of simple descriptive statistics and be compared between two study groups to assess covariate balance. The two-sample Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test will be used for continuous variables and the chi-square test or Wilcoxon test will be used for categorical variables.</p><p id="Par65">The primary analysis will be a comparison of the efficacy on depression between the two groups after 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Pearson&#x02019;s chi-squared test will be used to analyze the effective cases and logistic regression will be used to adjust for chance imbalances in the main prognostic variables between groups, such as age and gender.</p><p id="Par66">Secondary analyses will include the improved cases in neurological function (NIHSS score reduction of &#x02265;&#x02009;50% or the total score of 0&#x02013;1), independence (mRS 0, 1, and 2), daily living (BI scores &#x02265;&#x02009;90), and TCM syndrome. Secondary outcome analyses will be carried out according to standard statistical principles for comparison of parametric or non-parametric distributions as appropriate. Logistical regression analysis will be used to adjust for chance imbalances in the main prognostic variables between groups, such as age, NIHSS scores, BI scores, and TCM syndrome scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par67">Depression is common after stroke and is related to with poor functional outcome and high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The association between depression and stroke has been established whereby stroke has been shown to increase the risk of PSD, and conversely, depression has been shown to be an independent risk factor for stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The most commonly used antidepressants are SSRI and SNRIs, although they are not without side effects including increasing risk of hemorrhagic complications. As antidepressant medications have the potential to cause a series of adverse effects and are associated with poor patient compliance, it is important to explore other effective treatments that may have fewer side effects in the management of PSD. Chinese herbal medicine has the potential to offer an effective and safe treatment for PSD.</p><p id="Par68">In this trial, we will investigate whether the JDTLG plus conventional treatment can reduce depression and improve daily living ability among participants who have recently suffered a stroke. We have previously shown that JDTLG effectively treats PSD in a rat model. This study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot crossover trial to provide evidence for the clinical efficacy of JDTLG.</p><p id="Par69">The purpose of this prospective trial is to prove the therapeutic efficacy and safety of JDTLG. The outcome of the trial will provide evidence-based data regarding whether JDTLG is beneficial for PSD participants with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. More importantly, the success of this study will support a large-scale clinical study to further consolidate the evidence for the use of JDTLG in PSD patients with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome.</p><p id="Par70">This study has several limitations that require consideration. Firstly, as the study is being undertaken in one center; therefore, it may not necessarily be possible to extrapolate these results to other regions or ethnic groups. Secondly, the sample size is small and the treatment period short. However, this data will inform a subsequent multi-centered study compromising a sufficient sample size over a longer treatment period.</p><p id="Par71">In conclusion, this prospective study will demonstrate that the JDTLG with conventional treatment is able to effectively and safely treat PSD with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, thereby providing a new direction for treating PSD with minimal side effects.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par72">The trial was initiated in April 2017 and is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
