weight supported treadmill forward and backward walking training (PBWSTFBWT), progressive
body weight supported treadmill forward walking training (PBWSTFWT), progressive body
weight supported treadmill backward walking training (PBWSTBWT), on stroke patients&#x02019;
affected side lower extremity&#x02019;s walking ability. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 36
chronic stroke patients were divided into three groups with 12 subjects in each group.
Each of the groups performed one of the progressive body weight supported treadmill
training methods for 30 minute, six times per week for three weeks, and then received
general physical therapy without any other intervention until the follow-up tests. For the
assessment of the affected side lower extremity&#x02019;s walking ability, step length of the
affected side, stance phase of the affected side, swing phase of the affected side, single
support of the affected side, and step time of the affected side were measured using
optogait and the symmetry index. [Results] In the within group comparisons, all the three
groups showed significant differences between before and after the intervention and in the
comparison of the three groups, the PBWSTFBWT group showed more significant differences in
all of the assessed items than the other two groups. [Conclusion] In the present study
progressive body weight supported treadmill training was performed in an environment in
which the subjects were actually walked, and PBWSTFBWT was more effective at efficiently
training stroke patients&#x02019; affected side lower extremity&#x02019;s walking ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Support treadmill training</kwd><kwd>Forward walking</kwd><kwd>Backward walking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients have characteristic walking patterns showing long gait cycles, low walking
speeds, differences in stride length between the affected side step length and the
unaffected side step length, and short stance phases and relatively long swing phases on the
affected side<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The recovery of walking
ability is an important element for the improvement of quality of life and the achievement
of functional independence in daily life, and is one of the most important goals not only
for patients, but also for therapists<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the walking rehabilitation training of stroke patients, body weight supported treadmill
walking training is widely used in clinics<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have stated that body weight supported treadmill training is more helpful
for walking ability than walking training on the ground, because it extends the affected
side lower extremity&#x02019;s body weight support periods, enhances symmetric postures, and induces
constant activity patterns in the calf muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body weight supported treadmill walking
training helps maintain proper postures, and these postures play a role in increasing body
weight support by the damaged lower extremity while providing more proprioceptive sense
information input<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, although forward walking is widely performed as a method of walking training,
some studies have recently investigated the effects on stroke patients of backward
walking<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In an exercise physiological
study, Nadeau et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
backward walking and forward walking had different exercise physiological characteristics
and that the temporospatial characteristics of backward walking could increase the frequency
of, and endurance for walking.</p><p>Among the stroke patient-related studies of body weight supported treadmill walking
training, clinical studies have been conducted comparing treadmill walking training and
walking on the ground<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, increasing walking
speeds<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, intervention methods that
gradually increase the gradients of the treadmill to increase the intensity of training<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, whether treadmills should be used or
not<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and speed-dependent treadmill
training methods<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These studies have reported that treadmill walking training is effective at improving
walking. However, studies of body weight support, walking speeds, and walking directions
related to body weight supported treadmill walking training for improving stroke patients&#x02019;
walking are still insufficient. To improve the effects of body weight supported treadmill
walking training, gradual increases in the degree of body weight support<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and walking directions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
are important. In particular, with regard to the improvement of stroke patients&#x02019; walking,
existing body weight supported treadmill walking training is conducted with uniform training
parameters, such as forward walking and speed, making it difficult to change the stroke
patients&#x02019; walking patterns, and no studies have conducted body weight supported treadmill
training and forward and backward walking training simultaneously to investigate the
improvement of walking ability.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of progressive body weight
supported treadmill forward and backward walking training on changes in the stroke patients&#x02019;
affected side lower extremity&#x02019;s walking ability, and to examine the differences between
progressive body weight supported treadmill forward and backward walking training groups in
order to present diverse therapeutic protocols for improving stroke patients&#x02019; walking and
enhancing their functionality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 36 stroke patients in the rehabilitation center of a general
hospital located in Korea as subjects. To minimize selection bias, the patients were
randomly assigned to three groups. The selection criteria were: patients who medically had
had stroke for at least six months; had no joint contracture, pain, or fractures in their
musculoskeletal system, or hemianopia based on their medical records; and had functional
gait index scores exceeding three points. All subjects understood the content of the study
and voluntarily participated in the study. This study was approved by Institutional Human
Research Review Board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>Walking tests were conducted using a walking analyzer (OptoGait, MicrogateS.r.l, Italy,
2010) to collect data for the quantitative walking analysis of the patients&#x02019; walking
characteristics. The temporospatial characteristics of walking that comprise affected side
step length, affected side stance phase, affected side swing phase, and affected side
walking time were analyzed. To remove inter-tester differences, all measurements were
performed by one skilled physical therapist. The temporal symmetry index was calculated
using the formula: 2&#x000d7;[(affected single-limb support &#x02212; unaffected single-limb support) /
(affected single-limb support + unaffected single-limb support)]&#x000d7;100<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup></p><p>The study was conducted over of six weeks from June to August 2013. Progressive body weight
supported treadmill walking training was performed for three weeks, and the subjects were
evaluated after the three weeks of training. As a follow-up test, the subjects were
evaluated six weeks after the beginning of the training to examine the persistency of the
exercise effects. The subjects were randomly divided into a PBWSTFBWT group of 12 subjects,
a PBWSTFWT group of 12 subjects, and a PBWSTBWT group of 12 subjects, which performed their
respective regimes 30 minutes, six times per week.</p><p>The PBWSTFBWT group performed forward and backward walking on treadmill while wearing a
suspension system, the degree of body weight support was progressively decreased from 40% of
body weight in the first week of the training program to 30% in the second week and 20% in
the third week<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants&#x02019;
average forward walking speeds ranged from 0.6 to 1.0&#x02005;km/hr, and their average backward
walking speeds ranged from 0.4 to 0.9&#x02005;km/hr. The mean walking speeds of the PBWSTFWT,
PBWSTBWT, and PBWSTFBWT groups were 0.71&#x000b1;0.20, 0.75&#x000b1;0.31, and 0.67&#x000b1;0.16&#x02005;km/h, respectively,
and there were no significant differences among the groups. The mean speed of forward
walking in the PBWSTFWT group started at 0.71&#x000b1;0.20&#x02005;km/h and ended at 0.85&#x000b1;0.22&#x02005;km/h, and in
PBWSTBWT group the mean speed of backward walking started at 0.57&#x000b1;0.17&#x02005;km/h and ended at
0.67&#x000b1;0.16&#x02005;km/h, and in PBWSTFBWT group the mean speed of forward and backward walking
started at 0.67&#x000b1;0.16 and 0.53&#x000b1;0.09&#x02005;km/h, respectively, and ended at 0.86&#x000b1;0.22 and
0.63&#x000b1;0.09&#x02005;km/h, respectively. The mean weight support during the intervention was
progressively reduced from 40 to 20%, decreasing 10% weekly. For the exercise intensity,
individual gait speeds were changed at the same changes of body weight support. The patients
initially selected a treadmill walking speeds that they considered appropriate while walking
on the ground, and when each patient could stably walk for 20 seconds or longer<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, the treadmill walking speed was increased
by 0.1&#x02005;km/hr each time<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two physical
therapists participated in the training to help the subjects with the walking training. One
physical therapist took a position right behind the subject to help the subject with proper
body weight support, and the other physical therapist took a position on the side of the
subject&#x02019;s affected leg to assist the subject&#x02019;s steps and control the lower extremity
movements during the swing and stance phases. They manually corrected the subject&#x02019;s forward
walking patterns for 15 minutes and backward walking patterns for 15 minutes. When a patient
showed fatigue, signs of pain, abnormality of breathing, or change in complexion after
beginning the walking training, a rest of five minutes was allowed<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The PBWSTFWT group and the PBWSTBWT group performed forward walking training for 30 minutes
and backward walking training for 30 minutes, respectively, and the other parts of their
training were implemented in the same way as for the PBWSTFBWT group.</p><p>All statistical analyses in this study were conducted using PASW Statistics 18.0 for
Windows. Among the general characteristics of the three groups, sex, diagnoses, paretic
side, ankylosis, and whether walking aids were used were tested using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
test. The homogeneity of the dependent variables, such as age, height, weight, and Korean
Mini-Mental State Examination scores, among the three groups were tested using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVAs) before the training. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to
compare the differences between the first three weeks of the training and the three weeks of
follow up within each of the groups, and to compare the differences between pairs of groups
before the training, three weeks after the beginning of training, and six weeks after the
beginning of training. The Bonferroni test was used as a post-hoc test of the differences
between the groups, as analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) for the variables that showed
significant differences during the treatment period. The statistical significance level of
all data was chosen as &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the study subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects (N=36)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PBWSTFBWT<break/>(n=12)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PBWSTFWT<break/>(n=12)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PBWSTBWT<break/>(n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51.00 &#x000b1; 14.60</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.75 &#x000b1; 9.21</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.25 &#x000b1; 16.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Onset (months)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.33 &#x000b1; 3.76</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.00 &#x000b1; 4.22</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.83 &#x000b1; 3.46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (75.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Brain lesion location</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cortex level</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.3%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subcortex level</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (58.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (58.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mixed</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (41.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (33.3%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (41.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Affected side</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (33.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:15pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (50.0%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (66.7%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are N (<italic>%</italic>) or Mean &#x000b1; SD, ns = not significant, PBWSTFBWT:

walking training were performed by stroke patients, and we examined the effects of the
training programs on the patients&#x02019; walking abilities. According to the results, all three
groups showed significant changes at the end of the training period, and comparisons among
the three groups showed significant differences in the affected side step length and
affected side walking time.</p><p>The affected side step length increased in all three groups. In the comparisons of the
three groups, the PBWSTFBWT group showed more significant improvement than the other two
groups at the end of the three weeks of the treadmill training, and the PBWSTFBWT and the
PBWSTBWT groups showed more significant improvements than the PBWSTFWT group at the end of
the follow-up period, six weeks after the beginning of the experiment. These results are
consistent with the results of a study conducted by Verma et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> who reported that 30 stroke patients, divided into two
groups for circuit task-oriented gait training, showed improvements in walking-related
parameters, such as stride length. Our results are also consistent with those of the study
conducted by Yang et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which 25
stroke patients were divided into an experimental group that performed general walking
training plus backward walking training for 30 minutes at a time, three times per week for
three weeks, and a control group that performed only general walking training. The
experimental group&#x02019;s stride length increased from 0.78&#x02005;m before the intervention to 0.88&#x02005;m
after the intervention. Sousa et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when 12 chronic stroke patients performed walking training on the ground
without any body weight support or partial body weight support at self-selected speeds, the
walking speeds and symmetric stride length of the individual patients increased, a result
which is agreement with the results of our present study. We think patients&#x02019; walking speeds
increased, because the patients&#x02019; muscle activities were increased by the movements of their
affected side lower extremity, and their mental states or self-confidence in walking
improved as a result the repeated walking training on a treadmill in a stable walking
environment. Also, we found a significant difference in affected side step length at the end
of the follow-up phase, possibly because a variety of tasks on the treadmill induced a
higher activation of the cortex. Accordingly, we think that the activation of the flexors
and extensors of lower limb through PBWSTFBWT would elicit a higher center of gravity, which
would improve the step length. Although the affected side stance phase, affected side swing
phase, and affected side single support increased in all three groups, comparisons among the
three groups showed there were no significant differences. These results are consistent with
the results of the study conducted by DeVita and Stribling<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> who was reported that when the quadriceps muscles of the thigh
undergo eccentric contractions they require relatively more metabolism during backward
walking because of longer stance phase duration compared to forward walking. Also, in the
study conducted by Lam et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, stroke
patients performed body weight supported treadmill walking training with sandbags attached
to the affected side ankle weighing 5% of the patients&#x02019; body weight for 30 minutes per day
for 4 weeks. The swing phase ratio of the affected side lower extremity increased from 34.2
to 39.4% and the ratio of the unaffected side stance phases improved from 75.4 to 69%. The
repeated performance of body weight supported treadmill walking training increased
proprioceptive feedback through the sensory receptors on the sole, thereby improving lower
extremity extensor muscle strength and the central pattern generators.</p><p>The affected side walking time showed significant improvement at the end of the 3 weeks of
training in each of the three groups. In comparisons among the three groups, the PBWSTFBWT
group showed a more significant improvement than the other two groups at the end of the
three weeks of training. These results are consistent with the results of a study conducted
by Roerdink et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> who reported that
when the frequency of auditory stimuli was increased during treadmill walking, stride time
and walking time decreased. In the study of Yang et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, 25 stroke patients were divided into an experimental group that
performed general walking training plus backward walking training for 30 minutes at a time,
three times per week for three weeks, and a control group that performed only general
walking training. The experimental group&#x02019;s stride time decreased from 1.96 sec before the
experiment to 1.62 sec after the experiment. Therefore, we consider that progressive body
weight supported walking training is an appropriate method for improving motor control
ability and reinforcing newly learned walking training, because it reduces the phenomenon of
foot dragging during the swing phase, thereby reducing the time that the affected side of
the lower extremity needs to stay in the air for the body weight to be moved, and it induces
repeated use of the muscles necessary for walking while the body&#x02019;s weight is supported.</p><p>The symmetry indexes increased in all three groups, but comparisons among the three groups
did not find any significant differences. These results are consistent with the results of a
study conducted by Combs et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> who
reported that when nine stroke patients and 22 healthy individuals performed body weight
supported treadmill walking training for eight weeks, the stroke patients&#x02019; group showed
larger changes in walking symmetry after the training. Based on these results, we consider
that body weight supported treadmill walking training is a meaningful training method for
improving walking ability, because it reduces and adjusts the weight that must be borne by
the patient and supports the patient&#x02019;s trunk, so the patients can feel less fear while
trying to improve their ability to control their lower extremity movements.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the fact that the experimental groups&#x02019; daily lives
could not be completely controlled, the size of the experimental sample was small, and the
subjects were limited to stroke patients who could walk, making it difficult to generalize
the results.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that progressive body weight supported treadmill
walking training had a positive effect on stroke patients&#x02019; walking abilities, and that
implementing progressive body weight supported forward and backward walking training is more
effective at improving stroke patients&#x02019; affected side lower extremity walking abilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Sahmyook University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Eich</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mach</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Aerobic treadmill plus Bobath walking training improves
