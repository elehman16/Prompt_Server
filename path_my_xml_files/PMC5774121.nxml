PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing. The symptoms increase health care costs for stress-related illnesses and can make veterans&#x02019; civilian life difficult.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We used a randomized wait-list controlled design with repeated measures of U.S. military veterans to address our specific aim to test the efficacy of a 6-week therapeutic horseback riding (THR) program for decreasing PTSD symptoms and increasing coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, social and emotional loneliness.</p><p id="Par3">Fifty-seven participants were recruited and 29 enrolled in the randomized trial. They were randomly assigned to either the horse riding group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) or a wait-list control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). The wait-list control group experienced a 6-week waiting period, while the horse riding group began THR. The wait-list control group began riding after 6&#x000a0;weeks of participating in the control group.</p><p id="Par4">Demographic and health history information was obtained from all the participants. PTSD symptoms were measured using the standardized PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M).</p><p id="Par5">The PCL-M as well as other instruments including,&#x000a0;The Coping Self Efficacy Scale (CSES), The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and The Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults-short version (SELSA) were used to access different aspects of individual well-being and the PTSD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">Participants had a statistically significant decrease in PTSD scores after 3&#x000a0;weeks of THR (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01) as well as a statistically and clinically significant decrease after 6&#x000a0;weeks of THR (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01). Logistic regression showed that participants had a 66.7% likelihood of having lower PTSD scores at 3&#x000a0;weeks and 87.5% likelihood at 6&#x000a0;weeks. Under the generalized linear model(GLM), our ANOVA findings for the coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and social and emotional loneliness did not reach statistical significance. The results for coping self-efficacy and emotion regulation trended in the predicted direction. Results for emotional loneliness were opposite the predicted direction.

This study examined the effect of THR on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in veterans. Changes in coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and social and emotional loneliness were also investigated. Our study advances the empirical exploration into THR as a form of rehabilitation for veterans who have PTSD.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Social cognitive theory and self-efficacy</title><p id="Par21">Our study was designed using the conceptual framework of social cognitive theory (SCT). SCT explains psychosocial determinants of behavior in terms of triadic reciprocal causation (person, behavior/outcome, environment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this transactional view of self and society, personal factors, such as cognitive, affective, and biological events; behavioral patterns; and environmental events, operate as interacting determinants that influence each other.</p><p id="Par22">According to Bandura, in SCT, a major factor of motivation, affect, and behavior is self-efficacy. Persons have a level of confidence, known as perceived self-efficacy, that influences behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The actual performance of a behavior (in this case coping) in a specific situation is highly related to the perception that an individual has the ability to perform the behavior. The more strongly self-efficacy is perceived, the more active and persistent are the individual&#x02019;s efforts toward the behavior.</p><p id="Par23">Bandura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] noted that depression and social support are two key pathways that impact self-efficacy. Depression negatively influences the individual&#x02019;s ability to control life stressors. Aspirations are not achieved, and depression is potentiated. Additionally, an inability to develop and maintain social relationships and support contributes to depression and lowers self-efficacy. In our study, perceived coping self-efficacy was veterans&#x02019; perceived ability to successfully respond to unforeseen events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans</title><p id="Par24">PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a life-threatening event or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PTSD is marked by four symptom domains: re-experiencing (i.e., flashbacks), avoidance, changes in beliefs and feelings, and hyperarousal. Estimations of the percentage of the more than 23 million veterans who experience clinically significant PTSD symptoms per year vary by service era and are estimated to be in the range of 11%&#x02013;20% from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn, 12% from the Gulf War, and 15% from the Vietnam war (30% in their lifetime) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While these numbers are significant, PTSD is likely to be under-reported due to stigma, making these percentages lower than might be accurate among those who have served.</p><p id="Par25">PTSD has been associated with poor quality of life and increased use of health care services, and a variety of co-morbid physical and psychological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; most notably depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and substance misuse and addiction to drugs and alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Emotional withdrawal and numbing is common among men, while higher arousal, lack of control, and self-persecution occurs among women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Greater combat exposure has been associated with more PTSD symptoms and poorer readjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Research suggests that a common coping response to PTSD among veterans is excessive alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, veterans&#x02019; attempts to cope with PTSD symptoms through alcohol use may further magnify the challenges of reintegrating into post-deployment life. PTSD, depression, and substance use disorders are associated with a variety of family problems, including marital distress, domestic violence, poor parenting, and a variety of behavioral health problems for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These consequences place spouses and children at increased risk for their own behavioral health concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Additionally, fears of stigma may prevent veterans with PTSD from admitting to symptoms, seeking assistance, or following medical advice. PTSD and chronic pain are commonly comorbid, with each reinforcing and exacerbating the effects of the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD were found to have greater psychiatric comorbidity and physical and emotional well-being limitations than those without a PTSD diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The strong association of PTSD with medical co-morbidities heightens the need to address this disorder as early as possible to lessen demands for VA medical services as veterans age and the disorders they experience become chronic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often a recommended treatment for veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cognitive techniques generally target extinction of conditioned emotional responses by challenging distorted beliefs that result in maladaptive appraisals contributing to the maintenance of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Behavioral techniques are used to habituate or extinguish stimuli associated with memories of traumatic experiences by presenting a feared stimulus until the fear, anxiety and related problems are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition to CBT, positive stress reduction, social support and coping strategies are needed if PTSD symptoms are to be managed effectively. Finally, social support has been found to reduce the negative effects of life events and to positively affect the perception and interpretation of such events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Two meta-analyses showed that strong perceived social support was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Despite empirical evidence of the prevalence and potential negative impact of PTSD on veterans, research that examines innovative interventions is scarce. Experts have advocated for research on complementary and alternative therapies (i.e., those used in conjunction with or those which are not considered to be conventional therapies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Animal-assisted interventions are a unique form of complementary and alternative therapy based on human-animal interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The International Association for Human-Animal Interaction&#x000a0;Organizations has established standards for ethical implementation of animal-assisted interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. One important avenue to explore for treating PTSD may be human-animal interaction, and specifically, interventions involving horses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Therapeutic horseback riding and treatment of PTSD</title><p id="Par30">Clinically, THR is a standardized horse riding program for people with disabilities in which the primary goal is their rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. THR has been implemented in adults and older adults with a variety of physical impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as well as defined physical and psychological disorders. THR interventions have been designed for individuals with multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], spinal stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and traumatic brain injury&#x000a0;(TBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Positive psychological, physical and social outcomes have been documented with adults in other THR studies. Psychological improvements due to THR include increased self-efficacy, motivation, and courage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], reduced psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and enhanced psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Social benefits include improved social involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. THR psychological and social benefits may be important factors to facilitate veterans&#x02019; coping with PTSD symptoms.</p><p id="Par31">Physical benefits of THR include improved sitting posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], motor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], postural balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], decreased muscle tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], improved balance and gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and reduction of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that PTSD and other anxiety/depression related mental health symptoms may also decrease with physical activity (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. PA&#x000a0;occurring during THR may be a potential positive coping strategy for veterans with PTSD. In THR, the rider experiences the horse&#x02019;s stride, using core strength to remain erect, making horseback riding not merely a passive experience, but also a&#x000a0;PA. THR in a class setting may foster social support and enhance the veterans&#x02019; willingness to do other PA.</p><p id="Par32">There are limited studies involving THR in the treatment of PTSD or TBI. One important case study of a 44-year-old veteran with a spinal cord injury demonstrated both functional improvements, including increased regular PA, along with increases in self-esteem, self-control, and sense of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Veterans who participated in an equine assisted learning program (i.e., horses used to promote cognitive reframing and mindfulness) reported that the program had very positive benefits on their PTSD symptoms and coping skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Veterans who took part in a THR program reported greater communication skills and self-awareness and self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. While these studies provide veteran reported evidence of THR, none employed widely used and standardized instruments to measure outcomes. A single study was identified which showed quantitative decreases in depression and improvements in reported physical health due to a 24-week THR program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, this exploratory study lacked a control condition, making effectiveness of THR difficult to evaluate.</p><p id="Par33">Horses and THR have been previously used in treating PTSD; however, there are no randomized controlled trials studying the effectiveness of horses in reducing levels of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. THR may be a beneficial activity to reduce PTSD symptoms in veterans and also increase PA, reduce stress, enhance coping self-efficacy, and provide social support. Previously, THR participants have characterized horses as accepting and nonjudgmental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our specific aim was to test the extent to which participation in a 6-week THR program (riding once per week) was associated with improvements in the primary outcomes of PTSD symptoms and coping self-efficacy as well as in the secondary outcomes of emotion regulation and social and emotional loneliness. Participation was hypothesized to be associated with a decrease in PTSD symptoms, increases in coping self-efficacy, emotional regulation, and a decrease in social and emotional loneliness among veterans. Veterans assigned to the waitlist control group were not expected to have any changes in outcome measures during the 6-week waitlist control period. We selected the waitlist control design to enable all veterans to experience THR, and also to accommodate the capacity of the THR facility. The number of sessions attended in the 6-week THR program was predicted to be associated with improvements in all primary and secondary outcome measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par34">The study had the approval of the VA Research and Development Committee at the Harry S.

All participants completed the VA Research Consent Form, which had been approved by the Health Sciences (HS) Institutional Review Board(IRB). Fifty-seven veterans were assessed for eligibility. Nineteen veterans were excluded (13 did not meet inclusion criteria, and 6 for a variety of other reasons). Our primary means of recruitment occurred through letters and postcard invitations. Two invitations were mailed to veterans identified through VA electronic medical records as having met the inclusion criteria of a diagnosis of PTSD, or PTSD and traumatic brain injury (TBI), and who lived within a 50-mile radius of the THR sites. Veterans were also recruited through referrals from VA clinicians and by advertising the study throughout the VA hospital.

To facilitate retention and minimize the attrition of study participants, a strong study identity was created using regular study staff contact with participants and by giving t-shirts to participants depicting study-specific logos. Despite best efforts, attrition occurred; 29 veterans participated in the THR. Attrition occurred for a variety of reasons: 2 participants were injured between enrollment in the study and before the THR classes began; 2 participants no longer replied to telephone calls or emails; 1 did not want to provide a reason for discontinuing participation; 1 cited mistrust of government programs; 1 moved, and 1 said he was not yet ready to be in public. Nine participants who began the THR class did not finish the session, 5 participants discontinued due to family commitments or changes in their schedules (e.g., childcare responsibilities, illness of a family member, or employment), 3 participants no longer responded to phone calls or emails, and 1 participant stopped participating after one riding session because she perceived that the horse she was matched with did not like her. Study staff did not observe any overt negative behavior in the horse, and it was successfully matched with another veteran in the next round of THR sessions. The veteran was offered a different horse but she chose to discontinue the study instead. There were no adverse events (e.g., falls from a horse, biting, kicking, or injuries) during any riding session. The class coordinator had a cellular telephone with a designated toll-free number that participants could call 24-h a day for the duration of the study. This phone number was specifically provided&#x000a0;in case participants experienced any injuries or pains due to, or had concerns or questions about the study. No phone calls were received addressing injuries or pains; the phone number was exclusively employed regarding scheduling issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par39">Demographic and health history information was obtained from participants via investigator-developed questionnaires that were used successfully in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

Globally, the highest level of PTSD symptoms was recorded at baseline, then there was a drop at 3&#x000a0;weeks of riding and a still further drop at 6&#x000a0;weeks of riding.

A 5-point decrease is the minimum threshold used to determine that an individual has responded to a treatment modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. A 10-point improvement is the minimum threshold for determining clinically meaningful improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Our findings show that our participants&#x02019; mean improvements in PTSD symptoms were 6 points at the 3-week data point and 13 points at the 6-week data point while riding. As such, participants&#x02019; PTSD symptoms had beneficially responded to THR after only 3&#x000a0;weeks, and by the end of the THR program, they had definitively achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptoms. Kazdin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] advocated that the clinical significance of an intervention impacts a person&#x02019;s functional ability. We conclude that THR shows promise as a beneficial intervention for veterans with PTSD, but did not measure functional ability. Our findings suggest that riding is a constructive activity for reducing PTSD symptoms in our participants and that riding for longer periods of time has a stronger influence than riding for shorter periods of time. Studies examining resultant functional ability would be useful. Kazdin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] also indicated that the magnitude of change in a dependent variable determines to what extent we may accept causal influence. Others found that PTSD symptoms responded to complementary therapies such as guided imagery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The fact that 13 of our participants had served in the Vietnam war era, and thus had perhaps been living with PTSD for decades, yet derived a clinical meaningful improvement in their PTSD symptoms from a brief 6-week THR intervention is promising. Our findings provide empirical evidence that THR is effective at improving coping skills and in lessening one&#x02019;s difficulty with emotional regulation, especially with longer riding interventions.</p><p id="Par60">We recognize the many potentially extraneous variables that may have influenced our findings. The question arises, &#x0201c;What components contributed to the change?&#x0201d; First, we recognize that there is an inherent selection bias in THR research because only participants who were willing to ride a horse sought to enroll. However, we argue that no intervention toward which a person has a negative predisposition will be of benefit to that person; it is not possible to force people to participate in psychosocial interventions that they are unwilling to experience. We do not purport that THR is the intervention of choice for all veterans with PTSD, but only for those willing to ride horses.</p><p id="Par61">Methodologically, a long list of extraneous variables must be taken into account as we interpret our findings. So, the question may be asked, &#x0201c;what components of the THR and the conditions surrounding THR may have contributed to our beneficial findings in PTSD?&#x0201d; For example, driving to and from the stable, indoor versus outdoor riding arenas, and the weather while riding may have influenced the outcomes. It is not possible to isolate these factors. Additionally, the fact that THR consists of many steps including grooming the horse and interacting with it, applying the riding tack to the horse, learning basic horsemanship skills, as well as interacting with the horse leader and side-walkers may have enhanced the participants&#x02019; PTSD outcomes. These are all components of THR and cannot be isolated in our study to ascertain their individual effects on our outcomes. It is not realistic that each of these components could be studied separately in a randomized controlled trial; their individual relevance is perhaps less important than the complete THR experience because these components would not naturally occur in isolation. A common criticism of human-animal interaction research is that we cannot be sure that change is caused by only the animal because an animal handler is nearly always involved in such interactions. That is the nature of such interventions, and it would not be possible to study them without handlers. What was done, however, was to objectively study the biophysiologic parameters at each phase of the THR process (e.g., driving to the stable) to better isolate the precise contribution of the actual time on the horse to the changes in the PTSD levels.</p><p id="Par62">Our findings for coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and social and emotional loneliness did not reach statistical or clinical significance. The fact that coping self-efficacy and emotion regulation findings moved in the predicted direction was encouraging. We suspect that the diminishing sample size may have limited our power to detect statistically significant changes in these two variables. Alternatively, perhaps a longer THR program would have had a greater impact on these two variables. However, the loneliness findings moved in the opposite direction from our predictions. Although again not statistically significant, this trend warrants further discussion. One potential limitation of the SELSA with combat veterans is that loneliness, which may be associated with guilt and/or shame, is called spiritual or existential loneliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Another limitation is that it does not capture experiential isolation, which has been defined as failed inter-subjectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Our findings may suggest that more work is needed in the conceptualization and operationalization of loneliness in veterans.</p><p id="Par63">The &#x0201c;firing&#x0201d; of side-walkers was performed once participants felt comfortable and confident in their riding abilities and the THR staff was sure they were able to ride on their own. While this marked increased ability, it also lessened the interpersonal interaction with staff. The veterans in this study expressed that the interpersonal interactions with study staff was one of the benefits of participation. Decreasing the time spent with staff during the class session may have influenced our findings.</p><p id="Par64">On the most fundamental physiologic level, research has provided evidence that basic human emotions rooted in the limbic system generally do not occur in opposition to each other (e.g., fear and affiliation, panic and play) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In our study, veterans interacted with their horses (by grooming, tacking, rewarding-some brought carrots for their horse) and spent quiet time talking with their horses. Other investigators have reported that human touch is an essential factor in the creation of human-horse affiliations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This affiliation may increase the likelihood of veterans experiencing a reduction in anxiety, which is a central component of PTSD.</p><p id="Par65">The fact that we found significant improvements in PTSD but not in self-efficacy raises the issue of the difference between these constructs. PTSD is an anxiety disorder, but self-efficacy reflects a person&#x02019;s belief or confidence in their ability to act on their environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our THR intervention may have enhanced the context for the veterans to gain a skillset that would enhance their self-efficacy (e.g., with horsemanship), and while the scores on the CSES were in the predicted direction (improvement), they did not reach statistical significance. The fact that there was no change in these scores during the control period, but there was a positive change during the riding period would support this notion. Moreover, qualitative findings suggested that the veterans felt that they gained confidence. However, our THR curriculum may not have been sufficiently structured to bring to the veterans&#x02019; awareness that they were learning a series of horsemanship skills. Furthermore, self-efficacy has been reported to be context or domain specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. While our participants may have increased their self-efficacy for horsemanship, we did not measure this specifically. This is an important consideration for future THR programs aimed at improving self-efficacy.</p><p id="Par66">Our previous research demonstrated that emotionally stressed adult cancer patients who interacted quietly with a companion animal reported the visiting dog provided them comfort and was a confidant who made them happy and gave them energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Other research demonstrated that quietly petting a dog was associated with a relaxation effect (lower blood pressure and cortisol levels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Horses differ significantly from dogs; however, the quiet interaction between people and horses working in THR may produce similar experiences of affirmation and relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. As prey animals, horses may be less likely than dogs to compete with humans for leadership.</p><p id="Par67">Veterans with PTSD may experience stigma associated with others&#x02019; negative perceptions of them, leading to isolation. Moreover, the anxiety associated with PTSD is known to induce veterans to avoid social contexts, leading to further isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Afflictive behavior between person and horse has been identified as a vital component of best practices in veterinary medicine when veterinarians work with horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. It can be argued that THR will be more successful when military veterans also interact quietly and kindly with the horses they are riding. In our study, veterans engaged in this behavior at every session prior to and after riding, which may have positively potentiated the effects of our intervention and is a strength of our design.</p><p id="Par68">Our findings regarding social and emotional loneliness were not statistically significant, and the trends were not in the predicted decreasing direction. The participants expressed sadness that the THR program was ending. For example, one veteran said, &#x0201c;I enjoyed the closeness with the horse&#x02014;met some very nice people.&#x0201d; Another said, &#x0201c;it was really amazing, I really want to continue. I really will miss Rock [horse&#x02019;s name]. I am always happy around him and I think he responds well to me also.&#x0201d; It may be that loneliness scores at six weeks were related to the veterans&#x02019; anticipation of the completion of the program.</p><p id="Par69">Interactions between the veterans and the riding center and study staff were positive. Other investigators have advocated for an individualized approach to selecting &#x0201c;talkative volunteers&#x0201d; or less talkative volunteers as a match with each veteran&#x02019;s needs, which may enhance veterans&#x02019; THR experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We attempted to control for possible confounding effects of interpersonal interactions with riding center volunteers and study staff by instructing these individuals to minimize conversational initiation with the veterans. In this way, the veterans chose their level of interaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Veterans&#x02019; perceptions of THR</title><p id="Par70">At the beginning of our study, some veterans expressed reluctance to participate on receiving our first invitation letter. They were more receptive to the subsequent postcard that we sent with the study logo on it. One gentleman who was a Vietnam war veteran said that he did not want to participate, but his wife encouraged him to come. However, after his first session (which occurred the week before the University went on spring break and the THR was also on recess), he thought that it was too bad to have to wait 2&#x000a0;weeks to do this again. This veteran not only completed the study, he expressed interest in continuing to volunteer at the riding center after completion of the study.</p><p id="Par71">Veterans expressed interest in participating in the study to try something new or rekindle a childhood experience. Many had ridden horses as children and recalled this fondly. Fortunately, veterans who wanted to continue THR were able to do so after the study was completed. This occurred via prescriptions for THR facilitated by VA recreation therapists or when the veterans volunteered at the therapeutic riding centers. Volunteering has been found to be a meaningful activity for veterans, particularly those who served in combat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">Accessibility to riding centers may be an issue for veterans who wish to participate in THR. One veteran said &#x0201c;I had to drive an hour to and from the horse center&#x0201d;, and we know this was one of the challenges of the program. THR may be more accessible to rural veterans who may have to travel long distances to reach VA treatment programs. THR is clearly not a replacement for conventional therapies used to treat PTSD, but as a complementary therapy, riding centers may be a readily accessible resource to veterans in rural areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par73">Our sample size was small, which limited our power to detect changes in the dependent variables. Nevertheless, we did find statistical and clinical significance in lowering PTSD symptom levels. The sample size was limited by the local VA requirement that we could only recruit participants being treated at the VA through which the study was approved. Originally, we partnered with two THR centers in the St. Louis area. Only 4 of the 38 participants who were treated at the Columbia, Missouri VA lived close enough to these two riding centers to be able to travel there.</p><p id="Par74">The study was logistically complex to implement because of the need to balance VA requirements and approvals, the riding center schedules, university calendars, and the busy lives of the participants. One previously mentioned veteran drove 1&#x000a0;h, while others drove 40&#x000a0;min to attend the classes, which occurred during normal business hours to accommodate the riding center. Three volunteers were needed per veteran (2 side walkers and a leader). The volunteers are essential to the daily operation of the riding center, increasing the complexity of scheduling. We required an Occupational Therapist and a PATH-certified riding instructor to administer the detailed riding curriculum. We also had study staff present to monitor fidelity to the riding curriculum, oversee data collection, and monitor participant safety. The staff also phoned the veterans each week to confirm their attendance at each session or apprise them of changes in class schedule due to inclement weather.</p><p id="Par75">We did not use a longitudinal follow-up. It would have been helpful to identify to what extent the PTSD symptoms remained lower after time passed since the riding program ended. Furthermore, the length of our THR program may have been too short. Lanning and Krenek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] used a 24-week THR program in their study, which demonstrated improvements in veterans&#x02019; physical health and depression levels. However, for PTSD symptoms, our findings demonstrated that 3&#x000a0;weeks was an effective intervention length and that even more improvement was noted at 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Implications</title><p id="Par76">Those planning THR programs would do well to address some of the lessons we learned from our study. While our findings showed beneficial outcomes in PTSD at the 3-week measurement, longer participation (six weeks) was beneficial for self-efficacy and emotion regulation. We identified steps that could be taken to minimize veterans&#x02019; attrition. For example, assisting with transportation to the riding center and providing child care during the classes may be beneficial. Climate controlled riding centers would maximize comfort for participants, volunteers, staff and horses, while minimizing the likelihood of having to cancel a class session. Horses able to carry riders weighing more than 220 pounds would increase the numbers of veterans who can participate. In addition, provision of THR class scheduling options may decrease the number of classes missed by veterans due to scheduling conflicts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par77">Our findings have honed the existing knowledge base on THR, a beneficial intervention for veterans with PTSD, by identifying a clinically meaningful dosage of THR. A 3-week THR program was effective, and a 6-week program produced clinically significant outcomes in PTSD levels. Older veterans, such as the majority in our sample, may have been diagnosed with PTSD decades ago; THR may be particularly promising for them. It may be important for health systems to recognize such promise by supporting THR as a reimbursable complementary therapy.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACORP</term><def><p id="Par8">Animal component of research protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p id="Par9">Cognitive behavioral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSES</term><def><p id="Par10">Coping self efficacy scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DERS</term><def><p id="Par11">Difficulties in emotion regulation scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p id="Par12">Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PATH</term><def><p id="Par13">Professional association of therapeutic horsemanship</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCL-M</term><def><p id="Par14">PTSD checklist-military</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p id="Par15">Post-traumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p id="Par16">Social cognitive theory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SELSA</term><def><p id="Par17">Social and emotional loneliness scale for adults-short</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBI</term><def><p id="Par18">Traumatic brain injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>THR</term><def><p id="Par19">Therapeutic horseback riding</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RAJ was the primary investigator for this study.
