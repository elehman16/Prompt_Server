Subgingival bacteria are closely correlated with periodontitis, and these bacteria are mainly anaerobes. As we know, anaerobes are the most important factor on the onset of periodontitis. Anaerobes are divided into obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, and most of the anaerobes belong to <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic>, whose characteristic surface structures mediate subgingival bacteria growth and proliferation. Various virulent factors that cause destruction of gingival supporting alveolar bone and immune response of the body play an important role in the occurrence and development of various periodontal diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Because of the prevalence and complex pathophysiology, there is at present no effective treatment for aggressive periodontitis (AgP). However, our experimental work indicates that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) can inhibit the growth of anaerobes in the periodontal pockets of humans and animals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and improve gingival microcirculation and increase gingival blood flow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Previous studies have also shown that HBO<sub>2</sub> had good therapeutic effects on human severe periodontitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In recent years, some clinical case reports of HBO<sub>2</sub> therapeutic effects on senile periodontitis and periodontitis after periodontal flap surgery have been reported in Chinese medical journals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Pasquier <italic>et al</italic>. reported that HBO<sub>2</sub> can stimulate angiogenesis, fibroblast and osteoblast proliferation as well as collagen formation in irradiated tissues, and improve cellular levels of oxygen, and increase angiogenesis and cellular density.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] But, to date, no research reports have been published on the treatment regimen or mechanism of HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy of AgP. In order to further explore the mechanism of HBO<sub>2</sub> in the treatment of AgP, outpatients with AgP were treated with HBO<sub>2</sub> in a controlled manner. We selected Chinese aggressive periodontitis patients and anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> as the experimental parameter to investigate the effects of HBO<sub>2</sub> on anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> in AgP of Chinese to provide the scientific basis for clinical application of HBO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Sixty patients (34 males, 26 females) with AgP among the Chinese (36 generalized AgP, 24 localized AgP) were instructed on oral hygiene and were referred to the Periodontal Department of Stomatological Research Center and chosen for our study. New International Classification standards of Periodontal Diseases (1999) were used as case selection standards. Their ages ranged from 14 to 30 years (mean age 23.5 &#x000b1; 3.8 years). Patients were selected on the basis of severe AgP in Chinese, where pockets could be probed to 4 mm or more and where approximately one quarter or more of the original alveolar bone height had been lost. All patients had at least 20 remaining teeth and were willing to participate in the study. They had not received any irradiation and other periodontal therapy in the past 3 years, nor did they have any history of allergy, diabetes, blood dyscrasias or chronic liver or kidney disease. None of the patients were heavy smokers or alcohol drinkers. None of the women were pregnant.</p><p>It was made clear to the subjects that participation should be voluntary. Consent was obtained from all patients after careful explanation of the HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy used and the risks and benefits of the study. Ethical clearance was obtained for the study from the Ethical Committee, Hospital 411 of CPLA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study groups</title><p>The study groups were designated as follows: patients were randomly divided into two groups &#x02013; HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy and non-HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy. For the HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy, patients were exposed to a pressure of 2.5 ATA (0.25 MPa) breathing pure oxygen once a day for 90 min with an air break for 10 min in the middle of the session (exposure schedule: pure oxygen 45 min, air 10 min and pure oxygen 45 min). The subjects received a total of 10 treatment sessions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The left-sided teeth of all patients were treated with scaling and root planing with the same techniques, namely ultrasonic combined with manual mechanical scaling. The right-sided teeth remained untreated. The initial two groups of patients were each divided into two additional sub-groups based on different treatments. The HBO<sub>2</sub> group was divided into the HBO<sub>2</sub> group (G1) and the HBO<sub>2</sub> + scaling group (G2). The non-HBO<sub>2</sub> group was divided into the scaling group (G3) and the control group (G4).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical assessment</title><p>For all patients, the following clinical parameters were recorded during the first clinical visit, immediately after the last HBO<sub>2</sub> and 2 years after HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy. Gingival Index (GI) was measured in accordance with the Loe Standard[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and plaque deposits were recorded using the Plaque Index (PLI, Silness).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Probing depth (PD) and attachment loss (AL) were recorded in the nearest millimeter by a single investigator (Ramfjord 1959).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] PD and AL were the average values of the selected teeth buccomesial, buccocentral, buccodistal and linguocentral.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Clinical data of six test teeth of each group were measured, i.e. three maxillary and three mandible teeth of each group were chosen at random to measure the clinical indices. Tooth odontoseisis (TO) measured with the routine technique. Two teeth of the six teeth in each group were selected for the assessment of the subgingival anaerobes of AgP, obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic>. Measurement of anaerobes, subgingival bacteria and other clinical indices were made before HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy, immediately after the last HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy and 2 years after HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Subgingival bacterial sampling obtained</title><p>Subgingival bacterial samples in each periodontal pocket base were obtained as follows: when no detectable supra-gingival microbial accumulations were present, a clean and standard curette was introduced through the pocket orifice as far as possible and the contents were removed. The process was repeated to obtain enough material. If the crown was covered with substantial accumulation of bacterial debris, the latter was first scraped off from the tooth surface corona to the pocket orifice prior to sampling. The plaque from the base of each periodontal pocket was placed in 1.0 mL of sterile thioglycolate salt solution and then made ultrasonication for 30 s. Afterwards, this was air-sealed with liquid paraffin and then immediately sent to the laboratory for anaerobic bacteria separation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Assessment and observation of anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic></title><p>Bacterial suspensions of 10-fold dilution were prepared and 0.1 mL of the diluents were spread on 5% blood agar plates, one with and one without 1.0 mL of streptomycin and 300 ug of clindamycin phosphate per milliliter.

We also found that the mechanism of HBO<sub>2</sub> lies in the inhibition of growth and reproduction of subgingival plaque and spirochetes. HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy, combined with scaling and root planing , appears to be more effective for treating the human severe periodontitis. This treatment effect can last more than 1 year.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Gram negative <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> was considered to be the main pathogen of chronic periodontitis, which included <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (Pg), <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> (Pi), <italic>Prevotella nigrescenes</italic> (Pn), etc. These bacteria and their products were of great significance to alveolar resorption and AL in chronic periodontitis. In our previous study, we also found that PLI, GI, PD and AL decreased significantly after patients with chronic periodontitis were treated with HBO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> is very effective in periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Costantino <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] reported that HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy could reduce the incidence and severity of bone necrosis and inhibit alveolar resorption. Our research showed that TO for the HBO<sub>2</sub> group alleviated, with the extent of alleviation being greater for the HBO<sub>2</sub> group than that for the control group. At the same time, the alleviation of TO after HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy might not be just the result that dental plaque and inflammation were brought under good control, but that most probably HBO<sub>2</sub> promoted the formation of new bones and inhibited alveolar resorption. Anaerobes are culprits of periodontitis. HBO<sub>2</sub> kills or inhibits anaerobes, and can be applied in the treatment of periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Our controlled study clearly showed that PLI, GI, PD and AL of all the three treatment groups decreased, and those of the HBO<sub>2</sub> and scaling groups decreased markedly, indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> had significant effects on AgP and also indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> combined with scaling and root planing is most beneficial for treating the patients with AgP. The treatment effects can last at least 2 years. It has been reported that bacteria can secrete different enzymes that can destroy collagen and growth factors. When the oxygen concentration in gingival tissue is low, the number of bacteria in the periodontal pockets is increased. HBO<sub>2</sub> can effectively decrease the number of bacteria and inhibit secretion of collagenase. A study by Rabkin showed that oxygen at 0.20 MPa could inhibit the growth of certain pathogens related to periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] The PLI and GI in the scaling group decreased to some extent because of good removal of dental calculus and plaque on the surface of teeth, decreasing the sedimentation of the dental plaque and controlling gingivitis.</p><p>Pg and Pi in <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> are highly correlated with the occurrence and development of periodontitis. The fimbriae, outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, agglutinin and vesicles, etc. on the surface of Pg and Pi are closely related with the pathogenesis of periodontitis. In addition, Pg secretes protease, hyaluronidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The characteristic structure and secretion of these bacteria may cause edema, ischemia, hypoxia and inflammation of the periodontal tissue involved. The application of HBO<sub>2</sub> will increase oxygen tension in tissues and elevate oxygen concentration in periodontal pockets; thus, the growth of such <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> as Pg and Pi is inhibited, and metabolism is recovered. Experiments showed that oxygen at 0.2&#x02013;0.3 MPa could obviously inhibit the growth of <italic>Diplococcus catarrhalis, Bacillus diphtheriae, Lactobacillus casei</italic> and such bacteria as Actinobacillus, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and Streptococci,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] which are closely correlated with periodontitis. Our research showed that the number of anaerobic bacteria decreased considerably, types of obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and positive rate of <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> also decreased markedly for the HBO<sub>2</sub> group after therapy. For the HBO<sub>2</sub> group, <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> was detected after therapy, the positive rate being 34.5% of the original level, indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> can decrease markedly the number of <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> in cases of AgP. And, for the HBO<sub>2</sub> + scaling group, the positive rate of <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> after therapy was significantly lower than that of the other three groups. Jiang (1995) reported that the oxygen pressure in periodontal pockets was lowered when periodontitis was active.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Yoblon[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] reported that rats with a fracture exposed to 0.3 MPa pressures two sessions a day, 1 h each, had abundant new subperiosteal bones formed at 40 days, indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> could enhance new bone formation.

(1995) reported that radiotherapy coupled with HBO<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly reduced the occurrence of osteoradionecrosis and the amount of bone loss, indicating that HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy could effectively inhibit alveolar resorption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] As can be seen from our experiment and other literature, HBO<sub>2</sub> kills or inhibits actinomyces, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and streptococcus, which contribute to the development of periodontitis. HBO<sub>2</sub> exposure can increase local oxygen delivery, which will raise oxygen concentration in the periodontal pocket base, on the one hand inhibiting the growth of anaerobes and on the other enabling ischemic tissues to get enough oxygen supply to facilitate early recovery of tissue metabolism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] our results showed that the number of anaerobes in the HBO<sub>2</sub> group obviously decreased. Scaling and root planing may decrease markedly the number of microorganisms in periodontal pockets; therefore, HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy combined with scaling and root planing will be most effective for treating periodontitis. According to a series of studies, our &#x0201c;study group&#x0201d; proved the effects of HBO<sub>2</sub> on aggressive periodontitis and pocket anaerobes in Chinese patients. The mechanism may be related to HBO<sub>2</sub> inhibiting the anaerobes&#x02019; reproduction and growth. The detailed mechanism still needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our investigation provides good evidence that HBO<sub>2</sub> inhibits the growth of subgingival obligate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> thus promoting healing of peridontium, which will be of help in the treatment of AgP. HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy combined with scaling and root planing appears to be even better for synergistic treatment of AgP. The effects can last more than 2 years. The mechanism of HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy on AgP is not clear. The following might be involved in the mechanism of action of HBO<sub>2</sub>: an inhibition of growth and reproduction of subgingival plaque and anaerobes, and in particular the growth of obligate and facultative anaerobes and <italic>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</italic> at the base of the pockets. Collectively, these effects indicate a therapeutic benefit of HBO<sub>2</sub> for the treatment of Chinese patients with AgP, and it can be used widely.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This article was supported by CPLA Medical Key Laboratory Grant (No.036) and NanJing military area Science and Technology Program in the Eleventh Five-year Plan Period (CNJ06MA08).
