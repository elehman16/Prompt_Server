exercises performed by an unstable exercise group (UEG) and a stable exercise group (SEG)
on the knee joint, proprioception, and functional scores of patients who underwent
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. [Subjects] Twenty-eight patients
participated in this study. The exclusion criteria were fracture or neurological disease.
[Methods] The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups, each with 14 people.
Each group took part in a 60-minute exercise program, three times a week for six weeks.
[Results] The results of the clinical evaluation at 45&#x000b0;proprioception showed statistically
significant differences between the two groups. The results of the clinical evaluation at
15&#x000b0;proprioception showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups.
[Conclusion] The proprioception and functional scores of the patients in the UEG who
underwent ACL reconstruction were superior to those in the SEG group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Closed kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd><kwd>Functional score</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an extremely important role in resistance to
anterior tibia deformation and rotational load on the knee joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The treatment goal in ACL rupture is to stabilize the knee
joint and to recover the range of motion of the knee joint and the muscle strength to a
normal level, to restore smooth functioning of the knee joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve the range of motion of patients following ACL
reconstruction, various exercise programs together with electrical therapy, are conducted
with the aim of achieving passive joint movement and pain control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In closed-chain exercise simultaneous resistance is exerted on the proximal and distal
areas while the distal area of the upper and lower extremities remains in a fixed
position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Closed-chain exercise
involves simultaneous contraction of the muscles to improve their dynamic stability. When
eccentric contraction is predominant, it reduces the shearing force with a joint compression
force, thereby providing stability to the joints. Sensitive mechanoreceptors respond to
changes in the pressure of the articular capsules and promote proprioception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Impairment of proprioceptive sense has been reported to cause instability of the knee
joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception plays an
important role in inducing and promoting voluntary and involuntary movements by transmitting
basic information to the motor control areas involved in regulating equilibrium and the
vestibular senses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to one
study, information pertaining to motor control or location is provided largely by muscle
spindles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas ligaments, the
subacromial bursa, and capsules perform the role of mechanoreceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Proprioceptive exercises may recover impaired motor senses. To completely recover the
functioning of motor senses, proprioceptive exercises should be initiated as early as
possible in the early stages of the rehabilitation process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, proprioceptive senses are known to affect the
preciseness of the articular angles of the knee joint and proprioceptive rehabilitation
exercise improves the proprioceptive senses of the operated side after ACL construction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study of the knee joint stability of
patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction, closed-chain exercise on an unstable surface
increased activation of the vastus medialis muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a comparison of closed-chain exercise and open-chain exercise,
the closed-chain exercise stimulated the mechanoreceptors and increased the muscle
mobilization rate more than the open-chain exercise, effectively increasing the strength of
the quadriceps femoris muscle and the hamstring muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of closed-chain
exercise performed on a stable surface and on an unstable surface on proprioceptive
functions and a functional index of the knee joints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects (M&#x000b1;SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEG (n=14)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UEG (n=14)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.78&#x000b1;7.24</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.92&#x000b1;5.46</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">172.64&#x000b1;5.90</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.28&#x000b1;3.68</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.00&#x000b1;4.27</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.28&#x000b1;5.26</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side (Right/Left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>M&#x000b1;SD: Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, SEG: Stable exercise group, UEG: Unstable exercise

March 2013 and consented to participation in this study. The subjects were 28 male patients
who had undergone ACL reconstruction and received exercise treatment in the manual therapy
room of G hospital. The stable exercise group (SEG) performed exercise on a stable floor,
and the unstable exercise group (UEG) performed exercise on a balance pad. All the subjects
voluntarily consented to participate in this study. Those who had cruciate ligament damage
accompanied by multiple fractures or collateral ligament damage, or who had undergone
meniscus repair surgery, were excluded from the experiment. The general characteristics of
the subjects are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The Biodex system III (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirly, NY, USA) was used to measure the
proprioceptive sensory functions of the knee joints on the operated side prior to the
exercise and six weeks after the exercise. The subjects' thighs and abdomen were firmly
fixed with straps to ensure that they were vertical at 90&#x000b0; against the knee joints and the
dynamometer tube axis, and the isometric muscle strength was measured. The subjects' ranges
of motion were then determined. The differences in the proprioceptive sense functions of the
knee on the operated side at 15&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0; were measured. With the subjects' two eyes blinded,
the examiner instructed the subjects to perceive the angles that had been measured and to
remember them; the angles were maintained for 10 seconds. After the 10 seconds had elapsed,
the subjects were asked to adopt the same angles of the knee joints. The measurements were
made three times at 15&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0;, and the average values of the three measurements were
recorded.</p><p>The knee joint functional index questionnaire was administered prior to the exercise and
after six weeks of exercise. The Lysholm knee scale, which evaluates the function of the
knee joint after knee joint ligament surgery, was used for the functional score test of the
knee joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This scale assesses the
following: a normal gait (5 points), instability during activities like gait, running, and
jumping (30 points), pain (30 points), the degree of edema (10 points), and femoral
amyotrophy (5 points). The maximum score that can be obtained is 100 points. Scores of, zero
to 6l, 62 to 81, 82 to 90, and 91 to 100 represent to poor, average, good, and excellent
knee function, respectively.</p><p>The data were processed with SPSS 20.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics are reported as
means &#x000b1; standard deviations (M&#x000b1;SD). The paired t-test was conducted to verify differences in
the proprioceptive functions and the functional index within each group, and the independent
t-test was conducted to verify differences in the proprioceptive functions and the
functional index between the groups. The significance level was chosen as p =0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of proprioception and knee functional scores between the pre-test and

important role in neurological senses related to motor skills<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Biodex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical
Systems, Shirley, New York, USA) is a contemporary isokinetic dynamometer with an
electrically controlled servomechanism which is used in both clinical and research settings.
The Biodex System 3 performs with acceptable mechanical reliability and the validity of its
measurements has tested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous
study evaluated proprioceptive functions prior to and after ACL surgery following
rehabilitation exercise and found that the proprioceptive function of both the operated side
and the non-operated side significantly improved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study measured the proprioceptive functions of the knee
joint at angles of 15&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0; after a rehabilitation program comprising four weeks of
proprioceptive exercises and reported that the proprioceptive functions of the operated
sides were enhanced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, the six-week exercise program following ACL reconstruction significantly improved the
proprioceptive functions at the knee angles of 15&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0;. In the between-group comparison,
the proprioceptive functions were significantly different at 45&#x000b0;, but not at 15&#x000b0;. In the
UEG, the improvement in the proprioceptive senses and the scores of the functional index
showed that the exercise was effective. Our results demonstrate that closed kinetic chain
exercise on an unstable floor promoted proprioception more than closed kinetic chain
exercise on a stable floor. A prior study examined knee joint function after ACL
reconstruction and reported that a swiss ball exercise group showed greater improvement than
a control group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in the
present study, there were significant differences in the knee joint functional scores after
the exercise in both groups, but no significant differences between the two groups.</p><p>Squat exercise on a balance pad or a balance board after ACL reconstruction may enhance
proprioceptive functions of the knee joint and the knee joint functional index. Such
exercise is also effective at minimizing cruciate ligament stress. Therefore, closed-chain
exercise on an unstable surface early after surgery is a very important part of any
rehabilitation program.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it failed to control for other physical activities.
Also, we did not control for physiological or psychological factors that may have affected
the results. In addition, the subjects were confined to those who underwent cruciate
ligament reconstruction at G hospital located in U city, therefore the generalizability of
the findings is limited. To address these issues, further studies are required with greater
numbers of participants to develop effective exercises programs for a variety of therapeutic
interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Duthon</surname><given-names>VB</given-names></name><name><surname>Barea</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Adrassart</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal> et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament</article-title>.
