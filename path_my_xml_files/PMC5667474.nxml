The under-recognition and adverse effects of the pharmacological management of anxiety and depression among the PD population are considerable. Thus, adopting a Complementary and Alternative Management (CAM) approach to address this problem is important. Yoga, one of the most common &#x0201c;mind-body&#x0201d; CAM therapies, can improve the psychological wellbeing of people with chronic illnesses. However, limited research on the effects of yoga in people with PD has been conducted. This study will determine the effects of yoga on the psychological wellbeing of people with mild-to-moderate PD and will compare these effects with those of stretching and resistance training exercises.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A community-based, single-blind, randomized trial will be conducted. A total of 126 subjects will be recruited and randomly divided into yoga (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63) or stretching and resistance exercise (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63) groups. For 8&#x000a0;weeks, the yoga group will receive a weekly 90-min session of yoga, and the control group will receive a weekly 60-min session of stretching and resistance exercises. The primary outcome will be the level of psychological distress measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes will include the severity of motor symptoms measured by the Movement Disorders Society &#x02013; Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Scale&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;Part III Motor Examination; mobility, balance, and fall risk measured by the Timed Up and Go test; spiritual wellbeing measured by the Holistic Wellbeing Scale; and HRQoL measured by the Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Questionnaire-8. Assessment will be conducted at baseline, 8th, and 20th weeks of follow-ups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study will be the first randomized trial to compare the effect of yoga versus stretching and resistance training exercises in a PD population. Results will contribute to the value of yoga as a therapeutic option for managing psychological distress in PD patients. Multiple outcomes including psychological, physiological, and spiritual and HRQoL will also be measured to elucidate the potential mechanisms of yoga. The effect of yoga on people with chronic illnesses will further be elucidated.

Based on demographic changes and prolonged life expectancy, the estimated prevalence of PD is expected to double by 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PD is characterized by four cardinal motor symptoms, namely, resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The management of PD primarily focuses on the pharmacological replacement of dopamine to control motor symptoms. However, nonmotor symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, reportedly have a great impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and are thus gaining increasing attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Psychological distress, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, are prevalent among individuals with PD. The incidence of anxiety and depression in this group is 27.6 to 56%, which is much higher than that in people with other chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PD-affected individuals with psychological distress are found to be poor in social communication and prone to adopt a sedentary lifestyle, which compromises their daily role functions and self-care capacity, leading to early retirement and low HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. High psychological distress is also associated with increased disability, progression rate of physical symptoms, incidence of relapse, healthcare costs, and caregiver distress, as well as poor treatment compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The devastating effects of psychological distress impair the functional status and HRQoL of PD patients, which greatly increase their need and cost for care.</p><p id="Par22">Despite the high prevalence and substantial negative consequences of psychological distress in the PD population, this problem is poorly recognized and rarely addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The pharmacological management of anxiety and depression is complicated among PD patients; numerous potential drug interactions exist between antidepressants and PD treatments. Serotonergic agents may exacerbate PD symptoms. Bupropion has a potential dopamine agonistic effect benefitting PD symptoms but potentially worsening psychosis, whereas selegiline has antidepressant and anti-PD effects but may interact with levodopa and with other antidepressant agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding the negative side effects of pharmacological treatments of anxiety and depression in PD patients, adopting a Complementary and Alternative Management (CAM) approach that addresses psychological distress in PD patients is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">The beneficial effects of CAM on reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms have been demonstrated in individuals with chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Among all nonpharmacological CAM strategies, mind-body exercises are some of the most prevalent ones practiced by individuals with PD given their gentle and easy-to-follow nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of mind-body exercises, which include yoga, dancing, and Tai Chi, has revealed their immediate beneficial effects on the motor symptoms, postural instability, and functional mobility of individuals with mild-to-moderate PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Yoga has the largest beneficial effect on physical outcomes, but related research on psychological wellbeing is limited. To fill this research gap, this study will investigate the effects of yoga on the psychological wellbeing of individuals with PD.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p id="Par24">The Theory of Self-transcendence is the conceptual framework underpinning this research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The purpose of this theory is to &#x0201c;provide a framework for inquiry and practice regarding promotion of wellbeing in the midst of difficult life situations, particularly where individuals and families face loss or life-limiting illness&#x0201d; (p.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Self-transcendence is an underlying process that explains why people can attain wellbeing while confronting vulnerable conditions; it is theorized as a developmental capacity of a person that naturally emerges when a person encounters vulnerable health experiences. Self-transcendence involves the following four domains: (1) intrapersonal, i.e., how a person views situations that they are facing, (2) interpersonal, i.e., how people interact with others and the environment, (3) temporal, i.e., the capacity to integrate past experiences with outlook in life to obtain a meaningful view of the present situation, and (4) transpersonal, i.e., the capacity to connect with dimensions beyond the typically discernible world, also known as &#x0201c;spiritual consciousness.&#x0201d; How a person responds to difficult life situations, positively or negatively, affects the developmental process of a transcendent sense of self. If positively, people can &#x0201c;go beyond themselves&#x0201d; and self-transcend to attain a state of physical, psychosocial, spiritual wellbeing.</p><p id="Par25">Yoga, which is known as &#x0201c;mindfulness in motion,&#x0201d; is a form of mind-body exercise promoting wellbeing of the body, mind, and spirit. Throughout the mindfulness practice of a sequence of poses (<italic>asana</italic>), breathing exercises (<italic>pranayama</italic>), and meditation (<italic>dhyana</italic>), the awareness and attention to body, mind, and the present moment is raised and sustained. The noncompetitive nature of yoga differs from many forms of exercises relying upon comparison to others or pushing oneself beyond limits to define progress. The guiding principle of yoga is to foster resilience for accepting adversities in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Through the regular mindfulness practice of yoga, a person can redefine the experience of pain, disability, or difficulty, thereby promoting one&#x02019;s acceptance of disability and continual functioning beyond physical restraints and vulnerable conditions. Therefore, a yoga intervention is hypothesized to help a person with PD to explore one&#x02019;s self-boundaries, redefine their illness experience, and self-transcend to attain a sense of wellbeing even in the vulnerable PD trajectory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par26">This study aims to examine the effect of yoga on the psychological wellbeing of individuals with mild-to-moderate PD.

This study will broaden the body of research on the use of yoga to address psychological distress among people with chronic illnesses, including neurodegenerative conditions. The minimal side effects and low cost of yoga intervention, compared with other current treatments, make it attractive for populations who are expected to experience repetitive and progressive disequilibrium resulting from degenerating PD conditions while remaining active in daily and recreational activities. The mindfulness yoga program, if found effective for alleviating psychological distress, decreasing motor symptoms, and improving physical wellbeing and HRQoL, can serve as a low-cost community-based and self-help tool for long-term practice among PD patients.</p><p id="Par68">Research on yoga as a therapeutic modality is relatively new. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of yoga practices, structured protocols that are evidence based and reproducible are crucial if widely disseminated. Future research investigating yoga interventions among people with chronic illnesses can adopt and utilize this validated yoga protocol. Another focus of this study will be the implementation and evaluation of this evidence-based yoga intervention. The feasibility, acceptance, and practicability of a mindfulness yoga program for PD patients will be evaluated. This research will also estimate the attrition rates, response rates, variability in outcomes, willingness to accept randomization, and potential sampling biases in PD population.</p><p id="Par69">Our results will influence the current approaches to managing psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, in the PD population. This approach has a more integrative, interdisciplinary focus on active self-care approaches that will empower patients to achieve a mindful awareness of their condition, thereby guiding them to participate in the self-transcendence process to reach a sense of wellbeing while handling the vulnerable illness trajectory.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par70">We acknowledge two major limitations of this study. First, participation to the study is on a voluntary basis and limit to the mild-to-moderate stage only. People with PD who experience depressive and anxiety symptoms may be less likely to participate in the study. Also, people who are currently taking psychiatric treatment will be excluded. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to those with significant psychological distress. To ameliorate the effects of participation bias, subject recruitment will be conducted in both support groups and outpatient clinics in different geographical areas to increase access to a wider range of people with PD. Second, the single-blind design may expose the study to risks of bias stemming from performance, attrition, and evaluation, which may overestimate the treatment effects. Strategies for minimizing these risks are discussed previously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par71">This study is going to be commenced in March 2017.
