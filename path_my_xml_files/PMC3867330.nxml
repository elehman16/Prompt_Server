We aimed to describe trends in sexual behavior during study follow-up and after stopping study drug; to describe trends in the acquisition of HIV and syphilis; and to determine whether participants who believed they were receiving FTC/TDF and that it was highly effective had increased sexual risk behavior or increased risk of HIV or syphilis acquisition compared with participants who believed they were receiving placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The iPrEx study was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco, as well as local institutional review boards at each study site: Comit&#x000e9; Institucional de Bio&#x000e9;tica, Asociaci&#x000f3;n Civil Impacta Salud y Educaci&#x000f3;n, Lima, Peru; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, IRB #1, Quito, Ecuador; Fenway Community Health Institutional Review Board, Boston, MA; Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica para An&#x000e1;lise de Projetos de Pesquisa, CAPPesq Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da USP, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil; Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa, Hospital Universitario Clementino Fraga Filho/Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa do Instituto de Pesquisa Cl&#x000ed;nica Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; National IRB: Comiss&#x000e3;o Nacional de &#x000c9;tica em Pesquisa &#x02013; CONEP, Minist&#x000e9;rio da Sa&#x000fa;de, Bras&#x000ed;lia, Brazil; University of Cape Town Research Ethics Committee, Cape Town, South Africa; Human Experimentation Committee, Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Ethical Review Committee for Research in Human Subjects, Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand; Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

At the enrollment visit, participants were randomized to receive FTC/TDF or placebo and were instructed to take one tablet daily. Monthly visits included risk-reduction and adherence counseling. Serological testing for syphilis was performed at screening and every six months during follow-up. Symptoms of depression were measured semiannually beginning in July of 2009, defined as a score of &#x02265;16 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD); data from the first assessment were included in the current analysis. The primary analysis included visits through the pre-specified cutoff date of May 1, 2010, whereas the current analysis includes follow-up visits through November 21, 2010. Study results were not released until December, 2010.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sexual Behavior</title><p>Sexual practices during the previous three months were assessed by interviewer-administered questionnaires at screening and at quarterly visits subsequent to the enrollment visit, which occurred within 28 days of screening. We initially assessed trends in the number of receptive anal intercourse (RAI) partners and the proportion of those partners with whom a condom was consistently used. For the remainder of the analysis, we focused on any RAI with no condom (ncRAI), a dichotomized variable that is a composite of the first two outcomes and the behavior most strongly associated with HIV acquisition in iPrEx. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> For the current analysis, baseline sexual practices refer to behavior reported at the screening visit, while sexual practices during follow-up refer to behavior reported at any visits subsequent to enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Perceived Treatment Assignment and PrEP Efficacy Beliefs</title><p>At quarterly visits, participants were asked to which treatment group they believed they had been assigned. Response options were &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t know&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;I strongly [or somewhat] think I am in the Truvada [or placebo] group.&#x0201d; The &#x0201c;strongly&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; categories were collapsed for analysis. Unless otherwise specified, we used data on perceived treatment group collected at the first quarterly visit after enrollment (12-week visit). Perceived treatment group was evenly distributed by actual treatment group at the 12-week visit. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> At the same visit, participants were asked about how good they thought FTC/TDF was at preventing HIV infection on a scale from 1 (doesn&#x02019;t prevent) to 10 (prevents all the time). This variable was collapsed into high (6&#x02013;10), low (1&#x02013;5), and &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t know.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To assess trends in sexual behavior, we calculated the mean number of RAI partners and the proportion of those partners using a condom, using Poisson regression to estimate change over time and t-tests to compare means by perceived treatment group. We assessed the relationship between beliefs in treatment assignment and PrEP efficacy, in addition to other participant characteristics, and changes in reported ncRAI. We assessed such changes in sexual behavior in two separate analyses: from baseline to any time during follow-up, and from the visit at which study drug was discontinued (stop visit) to the visit eight weeks later (post-stop visit). For the latter analysis, perceived treatment group was extracted from data collected at the stop visit or the closest prior measurement. We used mixed log-binomial models to estimate risk ratios (RR), with a random effect for study site to account for unmeasured differences across sites. Participants were excluded if they did not have at least one quarterly assessment during which data on sexual behavior were collected.</p><p>To measure trends in sexual behavior using objective indices, we used retrospectively tested plasma specimens to calculate the baseline prevalence of acute HIV infection as an estimate of HIV incidence in the short period prior to enrollment; we then compared baseline prevalence to the prevalence of acute HIV infection during follow-up in each arm of the study. Acute infection was defined as plasma HIV RNA positive and HIV-antibody negative at baseline, and as the first HIV RNA positive while HIV-antibody negative during follow-up. We also calculated syphilis incidence in each treatment arm and by perceived treatment group among participants without seroreactivity for syphilis at baseline, with incidence calculated for each one-year time period and using chi-square tests for trend. Finally, we used Poisson regression to estimate the association between HIV incidence and beliefs in treatment assignment and PrEP efficacy among participants in the placebo arm.</p><p>All analyses were conducted in Stata 12 and SAS 9.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Of the 2,499 participants enrolled in iPrEx, 2,408 (96.4%) completed at least one follow-up quarterly assessment and were included in analyses of trends in sexual behavior.

Participants who believed they were receiving FTC/TDF had higher numbers of receptive partners at baseline, prior to initiating study drug, suggesting that risk behavior was not a consequence of receiving PrEP. The small decrease in the proportion of participants reporting ncRAI after stopping study drug was consistent with the overall time trends in RAI partners and condom use, and did not differ by perceived treatment group. Our results do not support the concerns arising from risk compensation theory: that participants who believed they were receiving FTC/TDF and that it was effective would be more likely to increase their risk behavior while on study drug or decrease their risk behavior after stopping it.</p><p>Of note, the number of RAI partners was significantly higher in the three months prior to baseline among participants who later reported believing they were assigned to FTC/TDF. Cross-sectional studies have found that optimism about the benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy was associated with riskier sexual behavior, <xref rid="pone.0081997-Crepaz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> but were not able to determine causality &#x02013; i.e., whether optimism about treatment made individuals feel comfortable taking more risk, or whether individuals having riskier sex were more likely to be optimistic about therapy. Our results suggest that belief in treatment assignment may have been a consequence of sexual practices, rather than sexual practices being a consequence of receiving PrEP. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Huebner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> For participants who thought they were receiving FTC/TDF, that belief could have served as a psychological coping mechanism to reduce concerns about their sexual behavior, thus minimizing cognitive dissonance. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Festinger1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>One-quarter of participants had never been tested for HIV prior to their iPrEx screening visit and reported safer sexual behavior during study follow-up than those who had previously tested. Prior studies conducted among MSM <xref rid="pone.0081997-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and adults in developing countries <xref rid="pone.0081997-Denison1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> have found decreases in sexual risk behavior associated with HIV testing. That effect has been more pronounced among individuals testing positive, but the benefit of testing may be increased for HIV-negative individuals who are testing periodically, as would occur in PrEP programs. The regular testing that accompanies PrEP use, as well as the act of taking PrEP itself, could increase contemplation of HIV risk as manageable rather than inevitable and motivate other risk-reduction strategies. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Bish1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081997-Kasparian1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081997-Brewer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Indeed, PrEP may increase self-efficacy regarding condom use and reduce fatalism about HIV by providing a daily opportunity for users to manage their own risk.</p><p>We identified participant characteristics that were associated with reporting ncRAI during follow-up after not reporting ncRAI at baseline, including symptoms of depression, younger age, and identifying as a woman or transgender. Our results are consistent with the high burden of HIV infection among male-to-female transgender individuals <xref rid="pone.0081997-Herbst1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and young MSM, <xref rid="pone.0081997-Mustanski1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> as well as prior studies that have found a correlation between depression and condomless sex. <xref rid="pone.0081997-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> These groups may be in particular need of attention in HIV-prevention interventions, including PrEP.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. First, data collected during an RCT may not be generalizable to a non-experimental context; efforts to minimize optimism about the study drug and maximize condom use could have contributed to the trend toward safer sexual behavior during iPrEx. However, counseling, testing, and condom provision will accompany PrEP implementation, suggesting that a similar trend may occur among PrEP users outside of the RCT context. Furthermore, we did not see risk compensation among those whose thought they were in the active arm and that FTC/TDF was effective, a subgroup that better represents individuals using open-label PrEP. A second limitation is the use of self-reported data on sexual practices, which could have been affected by social desirability bias. However, the decreases in syphilis and HIV infection are consistent with the finding based on self-report that sexual risk behavior decreased during follow-up. Third, analyses among the group who both believed they were receiving FTC/TDF and that it was highly effective, as well as analyses of HIV incidence by perceived treatment group in the placebo arm, were limited in statistical power, resulting in wide CIs. Fourth, adherence to PrEP could have affected our analyses of HIV infection; however, this would only have impacted participants assigned to the active arm, and we also observed a decrease in HIV incidence among participants in the placebo arm. Fifth, an overall trend toward safer behavior could result from regression toward the mean. Finally, a trend toward safer behavior could also result from loss to follow-up among participants with sexual risk behavior, but participants with higher risk at baseline were more likely to be retained throughout the study.</p><p>In this study, we found no evidence of risk compensation that would offset the benefits of PrEP. Indeed, participation in the study was associated with safer sexual behavior; frequent clinic visits, HIV testing and counseling, and daily PrEP use itself may motivate and popularize safer sexual practices. Social interactions may be more important determinants of sexual decisions than individual weighing of risks and benefits, as posited by risk compensation theory, and may underlie the trends toward safety that have been observed in biomedical HIV-prevention trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank John C.
