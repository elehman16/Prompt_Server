Amounts of information given to women may influence key informed decision-related outcomes, e.g. knowledge. The primary aim of this study was to compare informed decision-related outcomes between women given one of two versions (gist vs. extended) of a decision aid about stratified ovarian cancer risk-management.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This was an experimental survey study comparing the effects of brief (gist) information with lengthier, more detailed (extended) information on cognitions relevant to informed decision-making about participating in risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening. Women with no personal history of ovarian cancer were recruited through an online survey company and randomised to view the gist (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;512) or extended (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;519) version of a website-based decision aid and completed an online survey. Primary outcomes were knowledge and intentions. Secondary outcomes included attitudes (values) and decisional conflict.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There were no significant differences between the gist and extended conditions in knowledge about ovarian cancer (time*group interaction: F&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66) or intention to participate in ovarian cancer screening based on genetic risk assessment (t(1029)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67). There were also no between-groups differences in secondary outcomes. In the sample overall (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1031), knowledge about ovarian cancer increased from before to after exposure to the decision aid (from 5.71 to 6.77 out of a possible 10: <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.04, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and 74% of participants said that they would participate in ovarian cancer screening based on genetic risk assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">No differences in knowledge or intentions were found between women who viewed the gist version and women who viewed the extended version of a decision aid about risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening.

A lack of disease-specific symptoms during early disease makes diagnosis challenging and most women are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the cancer has already spread beyond the ovaries. Diagnosis at an earlier stage (e.g. Stage 1) carries a significantly better prognosis with more than 90% of patients alive at 5&#x000a0;years post-diagnosis.</p><p id="Par7">This observation has prompted a significant global effort to develop strategies that can lead to early detection of ovarian cancer. There is some evidence suggesting that a screening strategy involving serial sampling (annual or 4-monthly) of serum CA125 levels interpreted by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), and incorporating selective transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) may improve risk management of women in both the general population and those at increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, the potential impact on disease-specific mortality is not yet known. The largest of the randomised controlled ovarian cancer screening trials, United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), is continuing to follow its cohort to determine the long term impact of annual screening on ovarian cancer death rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At present screening for ovarian cancer using existing methodologies is not advocated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The recent advances in genomic and other -omic technologies present an opportunity to develop more personalised approaches to cancer screening where genetic predisposition, epidemiological and lifestyle factors may be combined to assess individual cancer risk. Screening efficiency may be improved by focussing on high-risk individuals and tailoring screening and other preventative and early detection activities to their needs while minimising harms to individuals at lower disease risk. General population surveys and surveys of specific patient subgroups such as women at high risk of cancer suggest that public interest in stratified approaches to cancer risk-management is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">As in almost all areas of medical care, patients must be helped to make decisions that reflect their autonomy and that are adequately informed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition to the usual anticipated harms of screening (including false-positive results, surgical complications, short-term anxiety, and overdiagnosis), identification of increased genetic risk may also prompt life-changing decisions to be made (e.g. prophylactic surgery) and may necessitate testing of family members with far reaching consequences. There is also the added complication of how to manage genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance. Patients will need to be helped to make informed decisions that take these complex potential benefits and risks into account and that are <italic>&#x02018;based on relevant knowledge, consistent with the decision-maker&#x02019;s values and behaviourally implemented&#x02019;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Decision aids are evidence-based tools that outline different healthcare options and consequences in an organised fashion with the purpose of helping patients make informed decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As well as conveying important information, decision aids also include questions aimed at clarifying personal values and preferences to remind the decision-maker to take these into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">We are engaged in PROMISE (&#x02018;Predicting Risk of Ovarian Malignancies, Improved Screening and Early Detection&#x02019;), a large collaborative international research programme that aims to develop and validate models for ovarian cancer risk stratification, early detection and diagnosis, incorporating clinical, epidemiological, proteomic and genetic data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.eveappeal.org.uk/about/research/promise">https://www.eveappeal.org.uk/about/research/promise</ext-link>, accessed 28 March 2017). In PROMISE, we are also conducting a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of applying a stratified approach to managing ovarian cancer risk. To aid potential recruits to make a decision about participation in the pilot study applying the risk stratification approach developed in PROMISE, we have been working to develop a decision aid. As a first step in this process, we examined the impact of two beta versions of a decision aid that focused on the use of genetic testing in ovarian cancer risk stratification. We measured outcomes related to informed decision-making among people in the general population, and compared two levels of detail of the information presented.</p><p id="Par12">We are not aware of any previous research addressing decisions about stratified cancer risk-management in a general population sample. Nor are we aware of any studies that have systematically evaluated how the volume of information contained in a decision aid affects cognitions relevant to informed decision-making for ovarian cancer risk-management. Therefore, we tested the impact of providing two levels of information (gist vs. extended) on cognitions relevant to informed decision-making about personalized (genetic) stratified ovarian cancer risk-management in a web-based experimental study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="Par13">The primary research objective was to describe and compare key informed decision-related outcomes between two versions of a decision aid about personalized risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening (gist vs. extended). The primary outcomes were (1) <bold>knowledge</bold> about ovarian cancer and the PROMISE study and (2) <bold>intention</bold> to participate in personalized risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening in PROMISE; secondary outcomes included (3) <bold>attitudes</bold> (values) towards taking part in PROMISE. Based on cognitive load theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we hypothesised that participants receiving the shorter &#x02018;gist&#x02019; information would have higher knowledge about key components of risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening in the PROMISE study than those receiving the longer &#x02018;extended&#x02019; information. This is because fewer demands would be placed on working memory in the &#x02018;gist&#x02019; condition and so content-related information would be processed more effectively. The secondary research objectives were to describe and compare attitudes (values) and other decision-related outcomes (<bold>decisional conflict</bold> and <bold>decision satisfaction</bold>) between the gist and extended versions of the information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par14">This was a single-blind, two-arm, individually-randomised, controlled experimental survey study comparing the effects of brief (gist-based) information with lengthier, more detailed (extended) information on cognitions relevant to informed choice about participation in personalized risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening (i.e. intentions, knowledge, attitudes). Given that an increasing amount of health information is accessed online, the study was web-based.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Decision aid</title><p id="Par15">We created two versions of an online decision aid for the purpose of this study. The decision aid content was informed by: interviews about knowledge and attitudes towards the proposed PROMISE programme among members of the public; interviews about knowledge and attitudes towards the proposed PROMISE programme among women at high risk of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; a systematic review of the literature; and existing clinical information designed for women at high risk of ovarian cancer. The decision aids outlined information about ovarian cancer risk, genetic testing, and the risk-stratification programme (PROMISE), and contained a values clarification exercise which aimed to help participants make a hypothetical decision about PROMISE that was in line with their personal values. The International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration (IPDAS) criteria were followed and all content was written for grade 8 reading level or below, as recommended by IPDAS. One version of the decision aid contained gist information and the other contained extended information (see below). With the exception of amount of content detail (gist vs extended), all other components of the online decision aid (layout, overarching themes, and values clarification exercise) were standardised and the same in both versions.

Quotas were set for education to broadly reflect those of the UK general population. Participants were recruited through an online survey company (Survey Sampling International; SSI) who were blind to the study hypothesis. SSI curates a panel of members of the UK general population who are willing to participate in online surveys in exchange for minor rewards (e.g. air miles), with the aim of reducing the possibility of drop-out and subsequent selection bias. Panel members invited to participate were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in order to assess eligibility to complete the full survey. We excluded women with a <italic>personal</italic> history of ovarian cancer (but not breast cancer) because they were already able to access specific risk management options according to NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. After discussion with the wider research team, we decided not to exclude participants with a <italic>family</italic> history of ovarian cancer because it would be unlikely that they would be excluded if a stratified approach to ovarian cancer risk-management was introduced as a novel screening programme. Interested and eligible participants indicated their consent to take part in the study by entering and completing the baseline survey. It was made clear that data would be stored according to data protection regulations and that participants could withdraw from the study at any time without any personal consequences. It was made clear that the decision to participate in PROMISE was hypothetical only (i.e. they would not actually be able to receive information about their personal risk of developing ovarian cancer).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study duration</title><p id="Par19">Participants received the follow-up questionnaire via an email link 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after they accessed the website.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">This study examined the effects of a web-based decision aid on key components of informed decision-making about risk-stratified ovarian cancer management, and compared the effects between a gist and an extended version of the decision aid. We found that knowledge about ovarian cancer improved significantly overall, indicating that the decision aid was successful in increasing knowledge; an essential component of informed choice. This finding is consistent with a review which found that decision aids increased patients&#x02019; knowledge about treatment or screening options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although scores on most of the ovarian cancer knowledge items were high after participants had viewed the decision aid, two of the items (&#x02018;Ovarian cancer mostly affects older women&#x02019; [True], and &#x02018;Ovarian cancer can be found easily with an ultrasound scan&#x02019; [Not true]) were coded as being answered correctly by fewer than half the participants (44.3% and 26.3% respectively). This may reflect ambiguity in the question wording, and/or that the decision aids did not express this information sufficiently clearly. Future versions of the information presented to participants in the decision aid and the measures used to assess understanding of that information will need to make these facts and their measurement clearer.</p><p id="Par41">To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of a gist versus extended version of a decision aid about risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening on aspects of informed decision-making. Different components of informed decision-making were measured, including knowledge, intentions and attitudes, in an attempt to capture the multidimensional nature of informed choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, individual item scores were examined, rather than just their composites, to obtain a detailed understanding of participants&#x02019; knowledge and beliefs. The study sample was large and diverse in terms of age and education. Despite the lack of difference between the two decision aids on informed choice outcomes, it was encouraging to observe that more participants intended to participate in PROMISE than not (74.2% vs. 25.8%). This suggests that a risk-stratified approach to screening for ovarian cancer and other management options might be considered acceptable to the majority of women within the general public, and if it were to be introduced, uptake could be high.</p><p id="Par42">Our findings also suggest that providing participants in the planned PROMISE feasibility study with a decision aid may valuably help increase potential participants&#x02019; understanding of some key concepts, and that either a gist or extended version could achieve this desired outcome. There were no differences in knowledge about ovarian cancer, knowledge about the PROMISE study or intentions to participate in the PROMISE programme between those who viewed the gist and those who viewed the extended version of the decision aid. Neither were there differences in attitudes towards PROMISE, anticipated regret or decisional conflict between the two groups. The absence of differences in components of informed decision-making between the two groups suggests that the amount of information provided in the decision aid had little impact on people&#x02019;s knowledge acquisition, attitudes or intention. Contrary to the study hypotheses, we found no evidence that participants in the gist group were able to retain more information, nor that those in the extended group experienced information overload. These findings support previous research which found no difference in colorectal cancer screening interest between participants who received a brief decision aid with two screening options and those who were given a more detailed decision aid containing five options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">An alternative explanation for the study&#x02019;s results is that the two versions of the decision aid were not sufficiently different to elicit differences in informed decision-making outcomes. The gist version was five pages long, and the extended version was eight pages, so perhaps this was not enough of a difference to affect information-processing. In light of this it might be worthwhile for future research comparing different levels of information in decision aids to ensure that gist versions are limited to one or two pages, to establish a sufficient difference between experimental groups. Moreover, all participants were able to access as much or as little information as they desired, albeit within the confines of their version of the decision aid. Detail about which pages each participant accessed and for how long was not recorded, so it is not known how much information each participant actually read. It is therefore possible that the amount of information read by participants in the two groups did not differ.</p><p id="Par44">It is also possible that the modality of the decision aid (i.e. website) was not particularly well-suited to the type of decision that was being made. Wilson and Wolf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] claim that the type of medium chosen for a decision aid can affect cognitive load, which can impact upon informed decision making outcomes. Although static media, such as the decision aids used in the present study, are appropriate for certain medical contexts, e.g. when complex information must be repeatedly reviewed, video is potentially more effective for single-event decisions, e.g. deciding whether or not to take part in the PROMISE programme.</p><p id="Par45">Decision aids are an effective tool to increase patients&#x02019; knowledge of their options when faced with a healthcare decision, so are likely to be valuable tools to help people make informed decisions. It is therefore potentially important that healthcare professionals consider providing patients with decision aids, and that such decision aids are available to them. This will be particularly important if stratified ovarian cancer risk-management becomes implemented in clinical practice, because it is a novel approach to screening and thus most patients&#x02019; knowledge of this concept will be low. Decision aids may be pivotal in improving knowledge levels and helping women to clarify their values in order to make informed decisions. Future research could explore the effect of providing women with decision aids about stratified ovarian cancer risk-management that are more different to each other in terms of the amount of information that is provided. The format of decision aid could also be manipulated, for example by using mobile apps and printed materials as well as websites, to ascertain whether this affects informed decision making outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">This study found that a web-based decision aid about (genetic) risk-stratified ovarian cancer screening significantly increased women&#x02019;s knowledge about ovarian cancer. No differences in knowledge or other components of informed decision-making between participants who viewed a gist version vs. an extended version of the decision aid were observed. Further research is needed to determine the ideal volume and type of content for decision aids about stratified ovarian cancer risk-management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec31"><p>
