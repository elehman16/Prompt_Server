The present analysis explores female partners&#x02019; treatment preference for erectile dysfunction in Chinese Men. This was a phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter, crossover study in Chinese men with erectile dysfunction who were na&#x000ef;ve to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatments. Eligible patients were randomized to sequential 20-mg tadalafil/100-mg sildenafil or 100-mg sildenafil/20-mg tadalafil for 8 weeks each. Of 418 patients, female partners of 64 patients agreed to enter the study; of 64 patients who entered the study with female partners, 63 were randomized, and 62 completed the study. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. Significantly more couples preferred tadalafil compared with sildenafil overall (75.4% <italic>vs</italic> 24.6%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and irrespective of erectile dysfunction severity at baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.005). Significant improvements in sexual quality of life scores were reported at endpoint (Visit 8) in male patients and female partners in both tadalafil and sildenafil treatment groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Significantly higher mean changes from baseline were observed for male patients in the tadalafil group compared with the sildenafil group for the erectile function (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) and overall satisfaction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.019) International Index for Erectile Function domains and the spontaneity domain (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scale. No major safety concerns were reported during the study. Though both treatments were effective, safe, and tolerable, more couples preferred tadalafil compared with sildenafil.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erectile dysfunction</kwd><kwd>partners&#x02019; preference</kwd><kwd>sexual quality of life</kwd><kwd>sildenafil</kwd><kwd>tadalafil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent sexual health concern in males<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> affecting both the physical and psychological health of male patients, as well as the quality of life (QoL) in both partners.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Pharmacotherapy with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors is the preferred first-line therapy for men with ED,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> as these drugs have been proven to be effective, safe, and well-tolerated.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The 3 PDE5 inhibitors currently offered in China for the treatment of ED are sildenafil citrate, tadalafil, and vardenafil as needed (pro re nata [PRN]) along with traditional Chinese medicine. Until recently, the majority of patients in China received prescriptions for sildenafil citrate, as it came into the market first; however, with the current availability of additional safe and effective PDE5 inhibitors, patients and their partners have more options when choosing the best treatment for ED. The fact that patients now have a role in choosing their therapeutic regimen has ignited the concept of preference studies, some of which have shown patients<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and partners<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> prefer tadalafil over sildenafil in the treatment of ED; however, no preference studies have been conducted in Chinese men with ED or their female partners.</p><p>The results of patients&#x02019; preference, degree of preference, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tadalafil and sildenafil treatment in men with ED in China have been reported previously; both tadalafil and sildenafil were shown to be effective and safe treatments for ED in Chinese patients, and more patients preferred tadalafil.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Previously reported efficacy and safety results for both tadalafil and sildenafil have recently been corroborated (Wenjun B, MD, unpublished data, 2014).</p><p>In addition to efficacy and safety, the objective of ED treatment should focus on sexual QoL due to ED's detrimental effects on the sexual life of couples. Hence, patient's and/or partner's sexual life satisfaction is also an important indicator for the success of ED treatment. Even though ED is distressing to both males and their female partners, and has been shown to have a considerable negative impact on female partners&#x02019; sexual QoL,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> most of the research on ED has focused on the males&#x02019; preferred treatment for ED and evaluated the outcome of sexual QoL in males.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The details pertaining to the outcome of ED treatment on female partners&#x02019; sexual health, as well as female partners&#x02019; preferred treatment for male partners&#x02019; ED, is limited both in China and globally. Therefore, for this analysis, we focused on male patients who entered the study with female partners.

The present analysis also evaluated patients&#x02019; preferred drug attributes using Drug Attributes Questionnaire (DRAQ), psychosocial and interpersonal outcomes associated with ED and its treatment using Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scale (PAIRS), and therapeutic efficacy of ED therapy using International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF) and Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) in those patients who had a partner's preferred treatment response reported.</p><p>The SLQQ<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> is a validated, multidimensional instrument that consists of two domains: sexual QoL (10 questions) and Treatment Satisfaction (THX, 6 questions). The SLQQ-QoL domain compared the patient's and his partner's current sexual experience with their experience prior to the onset of patient's ED. The SLQQ questionnaire was collected at defined time points during the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p><p>PAIRS is a self-administered 29-item scale containing four domains (Sexual Self-Confidence, Spontaneity, Time Concerns, and Sexual Miscommunication), which are related to the broader psychosocial and interpersonal outcomes associated with ED and its treatment.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Only three domains are validated: sexual Self-Confidence, Spontaneity, and Time Concerns.

The model included treatment, period, sequence, and pooled site as fixed effects, centered baseline value of the efficacy measure (defined as the baseline value for a patient minus the overall baseline mean value) as a covariate, patient within sequence as a random effect, and centered baseline-by-treatment interaction as a fixed effect. Since the wash-out period was planned for more than 7 days (7 to 10 days), no carryover effect was included in the mixed model.</p><p>All statistical tests were conducted at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 unless otherwise stated, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between treatments (tadalafil minus sildenafil citrate) were provided.

There is increasing recognition that both partners should be involved in the assessment, diagnosis, patient education, counseling, and choice of treatment for long-term ED treatment to be successful unless the informed patient is unwilling.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In the open-label, multicenter, randomized crossover study regarding ED patients in China, both tadalafil and sildenafil were found to be effective and safe.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The present results, in addition to evaluating the female partner's preference of treatment, also demonstrated the outcome of treatment on sexual QoL in both the male patients and their respective female partners.</p><p>Treatment preferences were similar in male patients and female partners in the overall study population, as well as in both treatment sequences (IC/S and S/IC). Significantly more couples preferred tadalafil compared with sildenafil irrespective of treatment sequence (75.4% <italic>vs</italic> 24.6; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and ED severity (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 across all baseline severity groups). These results were similar to those that were published previously.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The increased preference for tadalafil compared with sildenafil in female partners may be due to increases in relationship, sexual, and overall satisfaction, as well as less sense of urgency and/or time concerns in male partners, which needs to be confirmed in future studies. The importance of knowing a female partner's preference of male patient's ED treatment will help in the couple's continued long-term use of preferred oral ED medication.</p><p>A significant improvement in sexual QoL scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was reported at endpoint (Visit 8) in both male patients and female partners in both treatment groups. The increase in sexual QoL and THX scores in couples suggests that treating a male patient's ED may result in a concordant improvement in the female partner's sexual QoL due to female partners&#x02019; involvement in assessment and treatment decisions.</p><p>The mean increase from baseline in erectile function (18.23 <italic>vs</italic> 17.54; <italic>P</italic> = 0.013) and overall satisfaction (5.03 <italic>vs</italic> 4.47; <italic>P</italic> = 0.019) of IIEF domains was significantly greater for tadalafil-treated male patients. All the parameters of the SEP questionnaire were greatly improved in both treatment groups. These increases in IIEF and SEP scores indicate an improved erectile function and improved sexual QoL. The increase in improved erectile function and improved sexual QoL also may have had a role in influencing female partners in preferring tadalafil over sildenafil, which needs to be confirmed in future studies.</p><p>In this study, significant improvement in the PAIRS spontaneity domain (0.36 <italic>vs</italic> 0.13; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was observed in male patients who preferred tadalafil treatment, which may be due to its long efficacy duration up to 36 h.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Even though no significant differences were reported between the treatment groups, increased mean changes in sexual self-confidence (0.47 <italic>vs</italic> 0.42) and decreased mean changes in time concerns (&#x02212;0.20 <italic>vs</italic> &#x02212; 0.11) domains indicated less sense of urgency or less concern about time in relation to sexual activity after treatment with tadalafil or sildenafil. These results support that an effective ED treatment should not only treat the underlying condition, but also improve the psychological well-being of men.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The first reason listed in the DRAQ for a male patient's preference of treatment was &#x0201c;firmness of erections&#x0201d; (43.5% for tadalafil and 66.7% for sildenafil). The second best (alternate) preference in both treatment groups for choosing respective treatment was provided as &#x0201c;was able to get an erection every time&#x0201d; (50% for tadalafil and 60% for sildenafil). These responses indicate that male patients prefer the medications that allow them to return to an erectile function and partner interaction they experienced prior to having ED. The other notable response chosen by male patients (17.4%) in the tadalafil group was &#x0201c;able to get an erection long after having the drug.&#x0201d; This preference may be due to the long half-life of tadalafil.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Safety results of the trial have been reported previously<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and were similar to safety profiles presented in other tadalafil studies.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> No deaths, SAEs, or discontinuation due to AEs were reported, confirming the safety and tolerability of tadalafil as reported in earlier studies.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Even though more female partners preferred tadalafil over sildenafil, the sample size was too small to compare the superiority. Another possible study limitation was the open-label design of the study, which reveals the treatment to both patients and partners and could, therefore, interfere with the patient's, as well as the partner's, psychological outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present results confirm that both partners preferred tadalafil compared with sildenafil irrespective of treatment sequence and ED severity at baseline.
