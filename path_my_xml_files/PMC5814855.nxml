Paresthesia SCS is generally characterized by programming stimulation parameters (including electric field configuration) such that the patient experiences paresthesia, and the paresthesia topography overlaps the pain topography as much as possible. This modality of stimulation typically results in analgesia in minutes to hours, and in many cases notable decreases in pain are reported during post&#x02010;op recovery. Further, the stimulation parameter settings used for paresthesia SCS require relatively less charge per second (as compared to present sub&#x02010;perception SCS settings) which can positively affect device longevity (primary cell implantable pulse generators [IPGs]) or patient charging burden (rechargeable IPGs).</p><p>In contrast, sub&#x02010;perception SCS is characterized by programming parameters that do not cause the patient to feel paresthesia. This modality of stimulation tends to have longer wash&#x02010;in and wash&#x02010;out times, and typically results in analgesia in several hours to days. The stimulation parameter settings evaluated and published thus far for sub&#x02010;perception SCS use relatively more charge per second (as compared to present paresthesia SCS settings) <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, which can negatively affect device longevity (primary cell IPGs) and patient charging burden (rechargeable IPGs). Greater charging burden also increases the risk of patients being less compliant with the therapy due to the additional effort required to maintain therapy through frequent recharging.</p><p>These distinct clinical observations of paresthesia SCS and sub&#x02010;perception SCS suggest that different mechanisms could underlie these two modalities. Gate control theory <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> was the inspiration for and the putative mechanism underlying paresthesia SCS, though certain inconsistencies indicate that it is incomplete <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. It is not clear whether gate control is engaged directly when using sub&#x02010;perception SCS because computational evidence suggests that dorsal columns are apparently not activated <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. Reports that different brain regions may be activated and inhibited with sub&#x02010;perception 1 kHz SCS or burst SCS compared to standard rate SCS <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> are consistent with the idea that different mechanisms may be engaged by these two modalities. Preclinical studies also point to the possibility that different mechanisms underlie paresthesia SCS and sub&#x02010;perception SCS. &#x003b3;&#x02010;Amino butyric acid appears to play a role in paresthesia SCS <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, but may not be involved in burst SCS <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. The mechanisms put forth thus far for 10 kHz SCS have been deemed unlikely: dorsal column conduction block and dorsal column desynchronization do not occur at clinically relevant amplitudes <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, and the hyperpolarization observed with 10 kHz SCS <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> has been shown to be an artifact of the experimental conditions <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. Thus, a fundamental understanding of the mechanism(s) of action by which sub&#x02010;perception SCS acts is still lacking. Further, while the sub&#x02010;perception modality has been shown to be effective at very high rates <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, the sensitivity of the modality to the rate parameter is not clear. Understanding the sensitivities of clinical effects to parameters can potentially contribute information that is valuable in the search for mechanistic understanding.</p><p>Several clinical studies have shown that 10 kHz SCS can be effective <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Others have shown that 1 kHz can be effective <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. These results are consistent with preclinical studies showing that 1 and 10 kHz are approximately equally effective in reducing the mechanical hypersensitivity associated with neuropathic pain <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, and that frequencies from 2 to 100 kHz all suppressed wide dynamic range (WDR) neuronal activity <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>.</p><p>From a physiological perspective, these clinical and preclinical observations are consistent with the notion that effects of stimulation above maximum neuronal firing rates may be similar, because neurons are unable to fire in synchrony with stimuli greater than 800 Hz <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. However, because frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz have not been systematically tested in humans, the question of the sensitivity of pain relief to stimulation frequency remains unanswered. The multicenter, randomized, crossover, double&#x02010;blind study described here sought to answer this question by investigating effects of SCS frequency on analgesia in the kilohertz frequency range (1&#x02013;10 kHz).</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Details of the PROCO RCT are available on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> registry under identifier NCT02549183.

This study was sponsored by the Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p><sec id="ner12746-sec-0007"><title>Subject Selection</title><p>All subjects provided informed consent and satisfied, among other criteria, key requirements including: 1) persistent or recurrent low back pain, with or without equal or lesser leg pain, for at least 90 days prior to screening; 2) at least 90 days of documented pain management care prior to screening to address the primary pain complaint; 3) mean low back pain intensity&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5; 4) less than 180 mg per day of oral morphine or equivalent; 5) stable opioid medications for 30 days prior to screening; and 6) baseline Oswestry Disability Index score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;80.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria included 1) back surgery in the previous six months; 2) radiographic evidence of spinal instability requiring fusion; 3) spinal pain secondary to neoplasm, infection, autoimmune disorder with spinal involvement, or a spinal bone metabolic disorder; and 4) any pain&#x02010;related diagnosis or medical/psychological condition that a clinician believes might confound reporting of study outcomes. Of note, patients on Employment and Support Allowance or Personal Independence Payment (workers' compensation programs) were not excluded.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0008"><title>Use of Electronic Diary</title><p>Wrist&#x02010;worn electronic diaries (CamNTech LTD, Cambridge, UK) were used to collect pain scores throughout the study. The electronic diary (ED) prompted patients with an alarm for current numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score inputs for each of three pain areas (back, leg, overall), three times per day (morning, afternoon, evening). If patients did not respond within a three min time window, the response was recorded as missed. It was not possible for patients to access or change the response after the window closed. For each stimulation rate, ED&#x02010;NRS scores from five consecutive days at the end of each rate randomization period were used for evaluation. The fifteen pain scores (5 days &#x000d7; 3 pain scores per day) per pain area (back, leg, overall) per patient were averaged to yield a mean pain score per pain area for each patient at each rate. A total of 80 data points (4 rates &#x000d7; 20 patients) per pain area were used for statistical analysis. If patients missed an e&#x02010;diary entry or if they were aware that they made a mistake in entering the response, they were instructed to note the correct response on paper. Two patients had injuries unrelated to the study during one rate evaluation period, so the five consecutive days prior to injury were used for evaluation. Two other patients forgot to wear the e&#x02010;diary during one rate evaluation period, so the five consecutive days prior to neglect of e&#x02010;diary were used for evaluation. Missing data were omitted from statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0009"><title>Study Design and Patient Flowchart</title><p>The study design is shown in Figure <xref rid="ner12746-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the patient flowchart in Figure <xref rid="ner12746-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Of the 39 patients consented for the study, 34 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria and underwent a one week paresthesia trial, after confirming during the implant procedure while the patient was awake that at least 80% paresthesia coverage of pain areas could be achieved. A paresthesia trial was used to ensure that patients could be treated with usual care, which is paresthesia SCS for the participating centers. If a patient did not respond to the paresthesia trial, they underwent a one&#x02010;week 10 kHz trial, and responders (per standard of care) continued to the next phase of the study. Per standard of care, patients who verbally reported percent pain relief (PPR) of at least 50% in a trial proceeded to permanent implant (97%, 33 of 34 patients). Nonresponders to a 10 kHz trial did not proceed to permanent implant (3%, 1 of 34 patients).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="ner12746-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

The study provided the opportunity to exhaustively test stimulation bipoles along both leads (up to 14 stimulation locations were tested in eight weeks). The search was done using a frequency of 10 kHz and pulse width of 30 &#x000b5;s, and the amplitude was titrated to optimize therapy. Patients who had at least 30% pain relief per ED&#x02010;NRS were considered to be 10 kHz responders (68%, 21 of 31 patients) and proceeded to the rate randomization phase. A criterion of 30% pain relief per ED&#x02010;NRS (as opposed to the classical 50% criterion) was used because ED&#x02010;NRS is a more rigorous measure of pain relief (see <italic>Electronic diary as a rigorous method to assess pain</italic> section of Discussion). Two patients chose to withdraw from the study before completing the sweet spot search. Note: The apparent discrepancy between the trial responder rate and the 10 kHz responder rate is due to the difference in the methodology used to assess response (standard of care vs. e&#x02010;diary) and is described in detail in the Discussion. The ten patients who did not respond to 10 kHz per ED&#x02010;NRS were successful per standard of care, and nine of the ten continue to use SCS (four paresthesia, five multiple waveforms: paresthesia and 1 kHz or burst). 1 was explanted.</p><p>A methodological limitation of this study is that the sweet spot search was done only at 10 kHz and only 10 kHz responders proceeded to the rate randomization phase, which may have biased the study in favor of 10 kHz because other frequencies may not have the same optimal stimulation location.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0011"><title>Rate Randomization</title><p>The 21 patients who responded to 10 kHz proceeded to the rate randomization phase, where each patient experienced 1, 4, 7, and 10 kHz in randomized order. The same sweet spot identified during the 10 kHz sweet spot search was used for all rates. Before each rate was tested, patients turned off stimulation until their pain returned to 80% of baseline to prevent carryover effects. Washout was typically several hours to a day. Each rate was experienced for four weeks. During the first three weeks of each rate, pulse width and amplitude were adjusted to optimize therapy for the given rate. Pulse widths throughout the available range (different for each frequency) were systematically tested as time permitted. For each pulse width tested, amplitude was adjusted to optimize therapy. Each setting was used for 1&#x02013;2 days, which allowed 10&#x02013;20 settings to be evaluated during the three week titration period. The best identified setting was used during the fourth week, the last five days of which were used for the evaluation period.

Improvements in quality of life also showed no differences across frequencies. Notably, 1 kHz required significantly less charge to provide the same therapeutic benefits compared to higher frequencies. Providing the same therapy, while using less charge is expected to be beneficial for patients because the charging burden may be reduced. Furthermore, delivering more charge than is required to achieve therapeutic benefit may not be desirable for considerations including device longevity and potential implications on the development of tolerance to stimulation.

The lower mean charge required by 1 kHz could conceivably have differentiated 1 kHz from the other frequencies. However, neither patients nor investigators were aware at study initiation that lower frequency would be associated with lower charge, and therefore it is not expected that patients associated charging with stimulation frequency. Also, during titration, charge usage varied within a single frequency because stimulation pulse width and amplitude were varied. Finally, patients had no expectations of how frequency would affect outcomes, nor did they know which frequency they were using.

</p><p>One limitation of note is that when pain is assessed in the clinic, PPR is not the only consideration. Functional improvements are also assessed and taken into account when evaluating therapeutic outcomes. ED&#x02010;NRS does not capture functional improvements, which makes it a conservative measure of therapeutic efficacy. However, an e&#x02010;diary could include questions about functional improvements and satisfaction, which would provide a more complete understanding of patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0027"><title>Direct Comparison of Pain Assessment Using e&#x02010;Diary With Pain Assessment in the Clinic</title><p>The PROCO RCT trial period provided an opportunity to directly compare pain assessment by e&#x02010;diary with pain assessment in the clinic. During the trial, patients used both an e&#x02010;diary, and per standard of care, verbally reported their pain relief to the clinical team at the end of the trial. A trial responder rate of 97% was determined when based on in&#x02010;clinic verbally reported PPR of at least 50%. However, when ED&#x02010;NRS scores were used to calculate PPR in those same patients, the trial responder rate was 62% using a calculated PPR of at least 30%. That is, despite a lower threshold for success (30% vs. 50%), the responder rate was lower (62% vs. 97%) when using ED&#x02010;NRS scores compared to in&#x02010;clinic evaluation. Figure <xref rid="ner12746-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> illustrates the relationship between verbally reported pain relief and ED&#x02010;NRS PPR. This result suggests that for the same pain, greater PPR may be reported during in&#x02010;clinic verbal assessment than the PPR calculated through an e&#x02010;diary capture of current pain.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="ner12746-fig-0007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of responder rate during trial using in&#x02010;clinic assessment and ED&#x02010;NRS.

These reports also suggest equivalent pain relief is achievable with 10 kHz and lower rates (either 1 or 2 kHz), but using in&#x02010;clinic pain scores they observed 70&#x02013;80% improvement from baseline. These findings are also consistent with the SENZA RCT <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> which assessed back pain VAS in the clinic and reported 62.8% mean VAS change from baseline, while also assessing back pain (at rest) via paper diary and reported 56.2% reduction <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>. Similarly, the SENZA RCT responder rate based on in&#x02010;clinic assessment of pain (78.4%) was greater than the responder rate based on paper diary (65.7%) <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>.</p><p>Thus, measurements of pain are highly dependent on the method used for assessment, and e&#x02010;diary (multiple data points per day over multiple days) appears to be a useful method for rigorous investigation. Attempts to compare results from studies that used different assessment methodologies (e.g., in&#x02010;clinic evaluation, paper diary, and e&#x02010;diary) must be undertaken with careful consideration of the method used to assess pain among other factors.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0028"><title>Equivalence Margin</title><p>The primary endpoint analysis was limited in that it only tested whether the slope of ED&#x02010;PPR from 1 to 10 kHz fell within the predefined equivalence bounds (&#x02212;1.67%, 1.67%). To get a better sense of what the data suggested about possible values for the slope, 99% confidence intervals were calculated for the slope estimated during the primary LMM analysis. Compared to the equivalence bounds of (&#x02212;1.67%, 1.67%), the 99% confidence interval was notably smaller: (&#x02212;0.94%, 0.93%). Thus, the data indicated that the slope of ED&#x02010;PPR from 1 to 10 kHz was even closer to 0% than the equivalence margin suggested.</p><p>Additionally, paired <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;tests comparing ED&#x02010;PPR between different pairs of rates provided no evidence of significant differences (<italic>t</italic>&#x02010;test results were Holm&#x02010;Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).</p><p>Together, these post&#x02010;hoc analyses provided evidence that any possible change in PPR per ED&#x02010;NRS across rates was much closer to 0% than the equivalence margin could have suggested. In other words, data strongly support the hypothesis that all frequencies provided equivalent pain relief.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0029"><title>Number of Subjects</title><p>The PROCO RCT study used a crossover design which greatly enhances the statistical power compared to a parallel design because each subject acts as their own control across the range of stimulation frequencies tested, thereby reducing the variability in the data. Concretely, if a single subject is exposed to each frequency, differences in the subject's outcome data caused by one frequency vs. another will be easier to identify because all other attributes of that subject stay constant. Conversely, in place of this single subject, a parallel design study would require four different subjects experiencing one frequency each; thus, any outcome differences caused by different frequencies must be large enough to stand out from the differences caused by the variability between subjects, which can be sizeable and would reduce the power of the study.</p><p>To quantitatively demonstrate the increased power afforded by the crossover design, the sample size calculation described in the methods section was carried out under the assumption that the study was designed with four different groups of subjects in parallel arms. Specifically, the within&#x02010;subject outcome correlation across frequencies was removed and no random effect of subject was included in the linear regression models fit to each simulation. This process revealed that to achieve a power of 80%, an overall parallel&#x02010;arm sample size of 108 subjects was required (27 at each frequency). This means that had the current study been designed with parallel arms, it would have been necessary to recruit 108 subjects to provide the same statistical power provided here with 20 subjects. Thus, the power gained by crossover, allowing each patient to act as their own control, is a significant strength of the study design. The statistical plan was robust and post&#x02010;hoc analysis indicates it was conservative (see <italic>Equivalence Margin</italic> section of the Discussion).</p><p>However, the advantage afforded by the reduction of subjects, adds a significant difficulty in that it requires each subject to provide more data than in a parallel&#x02010;arm design, as each subject had to experience each frequency, instead of just one frequency. Therefore, this type of study required collaborative patients to execute, especially because of the large amount of data that each patient was asked to provide.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0030"><title>Comparison With Previous Clinical Studies</title><p>In two previous RCTs investigating kilohertz frequencies, Perruchoud et al. <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> found that 5 kHz was no more effective than sham, and Al&#x02010;Kaisy et al. <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> found that 5.882 kHz was more effective than 1.2 and 3.030 kHz, which were no different from sham. However, methodological differences in programming may account for these apparent inconsistencies with PROCO RCT results. First, in the Perruchoud et al. RCT, pulse width at 5 kHz was fixed at 60 &#x000b5;s and amplitude set just below perception threshold, while the PROCO RCT found that titrating pulse width and amplitude on an individual patient basis was required for achieving maximal pain relief (see <italic>Titration of pulse width and amplitude is required to achieve pain relief</italic> section of the Discussion). Second, the active electrodes in the Perruchoud et al. RCT were selected based on paresthesia coverage rather than on an anatomical search, as was done in the PROCO RCT. Similarly, the Al&#x02010;Kaisy et al. RCT used a fixed pulse width at each frequency, and it is unclear whether amplitude was titrated. However, at 1.2 kHz Al&#x02010;Kaisy et al. reported a mean charge per second more than double than that associated with optimal pain relief at 1 kHz in this study, so different outcomes may have been a result of different program settings.</p><p>Consistent with the results of the PROCO RCT, other RCTs have indicated that 1 kHz stimulation is effective <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Kriek et al. compared 40, 500, 1200 Hz, burst, and placebo SCS, finding that the four stimulation programs were equally effective and they were all significantly more effective than placebo. In the Kriek et al. RCT, the electrode configuration used for 500, 1200 Hz, and burst was identical to the electrode configuration providing paresthesia coverage. North et al. showed that 1 kHz SCS was effective in SCS patients with limited response to paresthesia SCS. Like the Kriek et al. RCT, electrode configuration in the North et al. RCT was based on paresthesia coverage.</p><p>Consistent with the PROCO RCT, the SENZA RCT showed that sub&#x02010;perception SCS at 10 kHz can be effective. SENZA did report a larger NRS decrease (&#x0223c;70%) <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> than the ED&#x02010;NRS decrease (&#x0223c;50%) reported by PROCO, but this difference is likely explained by the different methods used in each study to measure pain (see Discussion section <italic>Direct comparison of pain assessment using e&#x02010;diary with pain assessment in the clinic</italic>). Also, patients and clinicians in the SENZA RCT knew which treatment was being applied, and multiple studies have shown that positive and negative patient expectations can significantly impact pain, sleep, depression, and physical function <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref>. Because all stimulation comparisons in the PROCO RCT were sub&#x02010;perception, double blinding was able to be used to avoid this effect.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0031"><title>Comparison With Preclinical Studies</title><p>The PROCO RCT results are also consistent with preclinical studies. Schechter et al. <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> used a spinal nerve ligation model of pain and tested amplitudes of 20, 40, and 80% motor threshold (MT), showing that 1 and 10 kHz were equally effective in reducing mechanical hypersensitivity, and efficacy increased with amplitude. Song et al. <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> used a spared nerve injury model of pain and tested amplitudes of 40&#x02013;50% MT, also showing that 1 and 10 kHz yielded equivalent improvement in paw withdrawal threshold. Another preclinical study <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> found that frequencies from 2 to 100 kHz suppressed WDR neuronal activity. Though these preclinical studies have begun investigating mechanisms of high frequency SCS, the mechanisms remain unclear.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0032"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>A limitation of this study is that the sweet spot search was done only at 10 kHz and the optimal topographical target found from the sweet spot search at 10 kHz was always used for all frequencies. It is possible that different frequencies have different sweet spots. Also, only 10 kHz responders proceeded to rate randomization to experience all rates, guaranteeing that 10 kHz, but not other frequencies, would provide pain relief. These two aspects of the study design could have biased the results in favor of 10 kHz.</p><p>A potential criticism of this study is that it was not sham&#x02010;controlled. The PROCO RCT focused on the rate comparison rather than evaluating therapy efficacy because 10 kHz had already been shown to be effective <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. From an ethical standpoint, we could not be sure that patients would respond to frequencies below 10 kHz, so including a sham phase could have prolonged the time patients did not experience pain relief. Although the methods used in PROCO could be used to better understand placebo effects in SCS, the question that the PROCO RCT aimed to answer was &#x0201c;What is the effect of rate on analgesia?&#x0201d;</p><p>Another potential criticism of this study is that patients experienced paresthesia first during the trial, which could have biased the patients to prefer paresthesia. However, the ED&#x02010;NRS responder rate for the paresthesia&#x02010;based trial (62%) and the 10 kHz sweet spot search (68%) were similar, suggesting that such a bias did not likely exist. In addition, to maintain clinical equipoise among treatments, patients were informed that paresthesia and sub&#x02010;perception SCS were two options and that both could be effective. Further, any bias would have affected all frequencies equally because the comparison was between kilohertz frequencies, not paresthesia.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that patients experienced each rate for only four weeks. However, over the course of the study, patients experienced kilohertz frequency SCS for eight to nine months with consistent pain relief, as shown by the results of the three month follow&#x02010;up at the selected frequency after rate randomization.</p></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0033"><title>Future Directions</title><p>A natural question arising from this work is &#x0201c;What is the sensitivity of analgesia to frequency outside the range of 1&#x02013;10 kHz?&#x0201d; In particular, the possibility that frequencies below 1 kHz may require even less charge while providing equivalent pain relief without paresthesia is intriguing. Long pulse width burst SCS at 500 Hz has been shown to have an effect <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, further suggesting that lower frequencies of SCS may be effective in the sub&#x02010;perception modality (although, whether or not the mechanisms of action underlying burst SCS and kilohertz frequency SCS are the same remains an open question). Other questions include whether the mechanisms of action for these two broad modalities of SCS (paresthesia and sub&#x02010;perception) overlap in frequency range, and whether they can be engaged simultaneously to potentially yield an additive effect that further improves therapy. Finally, simple bipoles were used in this study, but optimizing field shape may further improve therapy. Just as in paresthesia therapies, more advanced and flexible electrode combinations can significantly improve outcomes <xref rid="ner12746-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>, so it can be speculated that the availability of such flexibility of electrode combinations may also further improve kilohertz frequency SCS outcomes.</p><p>As fundamental understanding of mechanisms of action increases, continued optimization is likely. In the meantime, empirical optimization is expected to support improved therapy, and increased empirical understanding of &#x0201c;what works&#x0201d; may inform mechanistic understanding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="ner12746-sec-0034"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PROCO RCT is the first study to provide Level I evidence on the effect of frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz on analgesia.
