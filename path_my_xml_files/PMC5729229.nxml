<underline>Objective:</underline> To evaluate and to compare the bioavailability, the influence of food intake on the bioavailability, and the safety and tolerability of a newly-developed oxycodone once-daily (OOD) prolonged-release tablet with an established oxycodone twice-daily (OTD) prolonged-release tablet after single-dose administration under fasting or fed conditions as well as after multiple-dose administration. <underline>Materials and methods:</underline> Three single-center, open-label, randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover studies were conducted. In each study, 36 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 10 mg oxycodone daily as OOD (oxycodone HCL 10-mg PR tablets XL (Develco Pharma Schweiz AG, Pratteln, Switzerland); administration of 1 tablet in the morning) or as OTD (reference formulation: oxygesic 5-mg tablets (Mundipharma GmbH, Limburg an der Lahn, Germany); administration of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening). Tablets were administered once daily or twice daily under fasting conditions (study 1) or under fed conditions (study 2) as well as after multiple-dose administration (study 3). A sufficient number of blood samples were taken for describing plasma profiles and for calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone were determined by LC-MS/MS. Safety and tolerability were monitored and assessed in all three studies. <underline>Results:</underline> Plasma profiles of OOD reveal sustained concentrations of oxycodone over the complete dosing interval of 24 hours. In comparison to the OTD reference formulation, the OOD test formulation showed a slightly slower increase of concentrations within the absorption phase and similar plasma concentrations at the maximum and at the end of the dosing interval (24 hours). Extent of bioavailability (AUC), maximum plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>), and plasma concentrations at the end of the dosing interval (C<sub>&#x003c4;,ss,24h</sub>) of OOD could be classified as comparable to OTD considering 90% confidence intervals (CIs) and acceptance limits of 80.00&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;125.00%. Bioavailability of OOD was not influenced by concomitant food intake. OOD and OTD were generally well tolerated, a difference between the two products could not be observed. <underline>Conclusion:</underline> The new 10-mg OOD formulation provides sustained oxycodone plasma concentrations over the dosing interval of 24 hours and is suitable for once-daily administration. Bioavailability of OOD could be classified as comparable to the twice-daily administration of the OTD reference formulation. The new formulation widens and optimizes the range of strong opioid drug products in patient-centered therapy of chronic pain with simplified dosing and better compliance. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxycodone</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>once daily</kwd><kwd>prolonged release</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction </title><p>Oxycodone is a pure opioid agonist with affinity for &#x003ba;-, &#x000b5;-, and &#x003b4;-opiate receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </p><p>The principle action of oxycodone is analgesia. Oxycodone is a strong opioid according to the World Health Organisation analgesic ladder for treating cancer pain (same as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and methadone) [<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oxycodone has been in clinical use since 1917 and is generally indicated for the treatment of severe chronic pain requiring the use of a strong opioid, although indications vary between countries [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although morphine has been the standard opioid analgesic in the management of moderate-to-severe pain for many years, according to opioid consumption across the world, oxycodone is the most widely used in the treatment of severe pain [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Oxycodone is available in a range of formulations that include intravenous ampoules for injection or infusion, immediate-release solution, capsules for oral administration every 4&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;6 hours (all traded as OxyNorm/Oxygesic; Napp/Mundipharma) [<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and prolonged-release tablets for oral administration every 12 hours (traded as OxyContin/Oxygesic; Napp/Mundipharma) [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>Results of a recent survey on patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; perspectives on opioid therapy of pain suggests that a lower number of intakes per day correspond to higher satisfaction and convenience for chronic pain patients [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A finding that supports the association between simpler, less frequent treatment regimens and better patient compliance [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. </p><p>A new oxycodone prolonged-release tablet formulation was developed to allow for administration every 24 hours. The aim was to design a formulation with even more extended prolonged-release characteristics allowing for simplified once-daily dosing regimen while attaining stable diurnal plasma concentrations and minimizing fluctuations in exposure over time, especially the 12-hour trough concentrations associated with the twice-daily administration of established prolonged-release oxycodone formulation. The studies presented here investigate bioavailability, influence of food on bioavailability as well as safety and tolerability of this newly-developed oxycodone once-daily (OOD) formulation in healthy subjects in comparison to the established oxycodone twice-daily (OTD) product. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and methods </title><sec id="sub-s1"><title>Study design and formulations </title><p>Three studies were conducted as single-center, open-label, randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover studies. Washout periods of at least 7 days separated the two treatment periods in each study. The first study considered a once-daily administration of OOD and a twice-daily administration of OTD under fasting conditions (study 1, EudraCT-No.: 2008-008216-19) and the second study considered these under fed conditions (study 2, EudraCT-No.: 2009-012646-24). The third study included multiple-dose administration of OOD and OTD (study 3, EudraCT-No.: 2009-012648-17). </p><p>Products under investigation in all three studies were the 10-mg strength of a new OOD tablet formulation as test product (named Oxycodone HCl 10-mg PR tablets XL (Develco Pharma Schweiz AG)) and the 5-mg strength of an established OTD tablet formulation as reference product (traded Oxygesic 5-mg Retardtabletten, Mundipharma GmbH, Limburg an der Lahn, Germany). </p><p>The test product is a prolonged-release multiple-unit pellet formulation intended for administration every 24 hours. Available tablet strengths of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40&#x000a0;mg, and 80 mg showed dose proportionality [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The new formulation is designed to also have abuse-deterrent properties regarding expected methods of abuse (crushing, heating, snorting and intravenous application) and to also have alcohol-resistant properties regarding misuse by concomitant alcohol consumption [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>The reference product is a matrix formulation where the release of oxycodone is biphasic with an initial relatively fast release followed by a more controlled release [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. </p><p>The reference product is approved for administration every 12 hours and is labelled as a prolonged-release tablet, but is also referred to as controlled release [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sub-s2"><title>Subjects </title><p>In each of the three studies, 36 healthy male and female Caucasian subjects between 18 and 55 years of age with a BMI of 19&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;28&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled.

The wash-out phase of 7 days covers more than 14 elimination half-lives and was therefore long enough to avoid predose concentrations in the second study period. </p><p>The geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs of AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, and C<sub>&#x003c4;,ss,24h</sub> are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="Table4">Table 4</xref> for comparison of the bioavailability of OOD and OTD.

From the total 108 exposed subjects, 8&#x000a0;subjects experienced 9 AEs while on OOD, and 13 subjects experienced 13 AEs while on OTD. </p><p>
<underline>Study 1 (fasting conditions):</underline> With 4 observed AEs related to treatment in 3 subjects (1 case each of nausea, headache, vomiting, and itching; all classified as mild or moderate), both treatments were well tolerated when applied in fasted state. </p><p>
<underline>Study 2 (fed conditions):</underline> Minor safety issues with 11 treatment-related AEs in 11 subjects were observed. Those included headache (n = 7), itching (n = 3), and nausea (n = 1). One was considered moderate, the others as mild. </p><p>
<underline>Study 3 (multiple-dose administration):</underline> 7 AEs in 7 subjects were reported as treatment-related including headache (n = 5) and itching (n = 2). All were of mild intensity. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion </title><p>The bioavailability studies of OOD and OTD were designed and conducted according to current standards on investigation of bioequivalence and on pharmacokinetic evaluation of modified-release dosage forms [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. OOD (10 mg) was administered once (in the morning) and OTD (5 mg) twice (in the morning and evening) in order to reach the same total daily dose. Results show that the chosen methods, including the time points of blood sampling and the length of wash-out phase, were adequate to describe plasma profiles and bioavailability of the investigated products. </p><p>The established oxycodone twice-daily (OTD) product used in the studies as the reference product is a single-unit matrix formulation where the release of oxycodone is biphasic, with an initial relatively fast release followed by a more controlled release, which determines the 12-hour dosing interval [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p><p>Compared to immediate-release formulations, the established twice-daily prolonged-release opioid products represent progress in terms of more stable plasma levels and more convenient dosing [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At the same time, those products still bear disadvantages, such as end-of-dose failures and peak-to-trough fluctuations, that may be associated with breakthrough pain [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Independently from these disadvantages, a large majority of patients in this therapeutic area prefer a simple and convenient once-daily dosing regimen [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>The new oxycodone once-daily (OOD) product is a multiple-unit pellet formulation. The oxycodone plasma concentration-time profile resulting from the new OOD shows the typical pattern of a once-daily formulation with a gradual increase during the first 4&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;6 hours followed by a plateau maintained for ~ 10 hours, and then a slow decline. OOD provides sustained drug concentrations over the dosing interval of 24 hours and avoids the initial fast release and the 12-hour trough levels associated with the twice-daily product, while showing a comparably slow decline after 16 hours. </p><p>The absolute values for AUC were in the range of those reported for immediate- and controlled-release oxycodone [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. </p><p>For the extent of bioavailability, the maximum plasma concentrations as well as for the concentrations at the end of the dosing interval, OOD could be classified as comparable to OTD considering the bioequivalence acceptance criteria of 80.00&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;125.00%. The study after multiple-dose administration indicates therapeutic dosage regimen conditions and shows the comparability of OOD and OTD. It could be assumed that OOD leads to comparable efficacy and safety and is therefore exchangeable when administered at the same total daily dose as OTD. This finding could be confirmed by results of a recent trial in patients [<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial in patients with malignant and nonmalignant moderate to severe chronic pain showed that OOD is at least equivalent to OTD regarding therapeutic efficacy and safety. </p><p>Bioavailability of OOD was not affected after intake of a standard high-fat meal before administration. Extent of bioavailability and maximum plasma concentrations were comparable. After administration of OTD under fed conditions, higher values were observed for the extent of bioavailability (+29%) and for the maximum plasma concentrations (+34%) in comparison to the intake under fasting conditions. The relevancy of these differences could not finally be assessed even if the recommendation in the OTD&#x02019;s summary of product characteristics [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] stated that tablets can be taken with or without food. </p><p>Recently, HVD and PTF have become popular parameters [<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to describe the duration and fluctuation of prolonged-release characteristics of opioid formulations [<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Those two parameters have been proposed as indicators of decreased incidences of breakthrough pain and/or end-of-dose pain in clinical pain management, showing promising results for once-daily opioid formulations [<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Results show that OOD has a sufficiently long HVD and appropriate peak-trough values to indicate that stable and constant concentrations could be held over the relevant time period. </p><p>Both tablet formulations were generally well tolerated. Incidence of AEs was lower with OOD. From the total 108 subjects exposed to OOD and OTD in the three studies, 21 subjects (19.4%) experienced any adverse event, thereof 8 subjects (7.4%) while under OOD and 13 subjects (12.0%) while under OTD. Reported adverse reactions were headache, itching, nausea, and vomiting, all transient and mostly of mild intensity. These are well-known side effects of opioids, especially when administered to opioid-na&#x000ef;ve healthy volunteers. </p><p>Whether long-acting opioids, such as oral prolonged-release preparations for once- or twice-daily dosing and transdermal systems, offer advantages over short-acting opioids in terms of efficacy and tolerability is still a matter of debate. Recent systematic review found no evidence supporting long-acting opioids&#x02019; superiority to short-acting ones in improving functional outcomes, reducing side effects or addiction [<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, prolonged-release formulations clearly have the benefit of less frequent dosing. As an easy, less frequent dosing schedule is preferred by chronic-pain patients [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], longer-acting once-daily opioid preparations may nevertheless best fit patient requirements. </p><p>In summary, it could be concluded that the developed OOD multiple-unit pellet prolonged-release tablet provides sustained and stable oxycodone plasma concentrations over 24 hours, being appropriate for simplified once-daily dosing regimen. The new OOD may add to physicians&#x02019; armamentarium of strong opioid products for patient-centered therapy in chronic pain with optimized dosing and better compliance. </p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgment </title><p>Medical writing support was provided by Stephan D&#x000f6;ppenschmitt and Petra Roos and was funded by Develco Pharma Schweiz AG. </p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of interest </title><p>MM, YG, and HR are employees of Develco Pharma Schweiz AG, the sponsor of the studies.
