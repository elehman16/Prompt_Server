On the other hand, anesthesia for cochlear implantation represents a great challenge as the anesthesiologist greatly involved in all surgical steps. It needs special anesthetic management such as providing bloodless surgical field, adequate airway management, limited use of muscle relaxation to facilitate assessment of facial nerve by peripheral nerve stimulator, adequate head positioning to avoid venous congestion which may obscure the surgical field, and finally, smooth recovery without nausea and vomiting and with adequate analgesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Controlled hypotension is commonly used to provide bloodless surgical field and optimize visualization for the surgeon which can be achieved by combination of physical techniques and pharmacologic agents such as inhalational anesthetics, opioids, vasodilators, beta blockers, magnesium Sulfate, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The use of controlled hypotension in pediatric surgery was first reported in 1953, thereafter, widely used in various pediatric surgical procedures, including scoliosis surgery, vascular surgery, and neurosurgery.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> selective and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist, which inhibits noradrenaline release and decreases sympathetic activity.

Informed consents were obtained from children guardians. Forty-six pediatric patients aging 1.5&#x02013;2.5 years of either sex with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classes I and II scheduled for cochlear implant surgery were included in the study. Patients refused to share or with known allergy to magnesium sulfate or dexmedetomidine; also, patients with fever, upper respiratory tract infection, coagulopathy, renal, hepatic diseases, or congenital heart diseases were excluded from the study. The randomization was performed using closed envelopes indicating the group of each patient.</p><p>All patients were preoperatively assessed by history, physical examination, and routine investigations (complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, International Normalized Ratio, urea, creatinine, serum glutamic pyruvic transferase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, albumin, bilirubin, and serum electrolytes). Cardiological consultation and preoperative electrocardiogram were done. Careful assessment of the airway was done. Solid food was not allowed 6 h before surgery but clear fluids were given for up to 2 h preoperatively. Children were randomized into dexmedetomidine (D) group (<italic>n</italic> = 23) and magnesium sulfate (M) group (<italic>n</italic> = 23).</p><p>Monitors were applied: Precordial stethoscope, non-invasive automatic blood pressure, pulse oximeter, and electrocardiograph. Peripheral nerve stimulator was used to assess recovery from muscle relaxant and to monitor the facial nerve intraoperatively. Induction of anesthesia was done by sevoflurane 8%. 0.1 mg/kg; intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone was given to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Then, after loss of consciousness, an intravenous line was inserted. Fluids were given at 10 ml/kg dextrose saline. Orotracheal intubation was facilitated by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg; no maintenance doses of atracurium were given to allow facial nerve monitoring. Arterial catheter was inserted in the radial artery for measurement of invasive blood pressure. Foley catheter was used to decompress the urinary bladder and to monitor urine output. In the D group, after induction of anesthesia but before the surgery, a bolus dose of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg slowly dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois, USA) infused over 10 min, then continuous infusion by a rate of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h until the end of surgery. In M group, after induction of anesthesia but before the surgery, magnesium sulfate 10% (50 mg\kg) was given slowly, then continuous infusion by a rate of 10 mg/kg/h during the whole surgery. The drugs were prepared and given by anesthesiologist blinded to the study.</p><p>Anesthesia was maintained using a 100% O<sub>2</sub> and with 2% sevoflurane. Controlled ventilation was started to maintain normocapnia (35&#x02013;40 mmHg). Body core temperature was measured by oropharyngeal temperature probe and maintained between 36&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C using heated mattress and warm intravenous fluids at room temperature. Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of the tested drugs. The target blood pressure was a decrease in blood pressure to get the mean atrial blood pressure (MAP = 50&#x02013;60 mmHg). If the MAP increased above the target or tachycardia as well, an additional dose of fentanyl was given 1 &#x003bc;g/kg to control these changes. Bradycardia was treated with 0.02 mg/kg i.v. atropine if the heart rate (HR) was 15% lower than the baseline value. After completion of surgery, inhalational anesthesia was stopped and muscle relaxant was reversed with atropine and neostigmine and the patient allowed to breathe spontaneously. The ETT was removed in deep plane of anesthesia to prevent coughing, bucking, and sudden agitation which can displace the implant and the children were transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Measurements</title><p>
