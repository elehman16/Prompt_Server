We examined whether interval walking training (IWT) could prevented these issues. Twenty-eight female patients (&#x0223c;60 years of age) who had undergone THA more than 2 months prior were randomly divided into IWT (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14) and control (CNT, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14) groups. The IWT subjects trained at a target of 60 min of fast walking at &#x0003e;70% peak aerobic capacity for walking (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0108690.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2peak</sub>) per wk for 12 wk, while those in the CNT maintained their previous sedentary life during the same period. We measured the energy expenditure of the daily physical activity, except during sleeping and bathing, every minute and every day during the intervention. We also measured the isometric knee extension (F<sub>EXT</sub>) and flexion (F<sub>FLX</sub>) forces, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0108690.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2peak</sub>, and anaerobic threshold during the graded cycling exercise (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0108690.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2AT</sub>) before and after the intervention. All subjects, except for one in IWT, completed the protocol. F<sub>FLX</sub> increased by 23% on the operated side (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003) and 14% on the non-operated side of IWT (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006), while it only increased on the operated side of CNT (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03).

In conclusion, IWT might be an effective home-based training regimen for preventing the muscle atrophy from reduced daily physical activity in THA patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>UMIN-CTR <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=history&#x00026;action=list&#x00026;type=summary&#x00026;recptno=R000015361&#x00026;language=E">UMIN000013172</ext-link>

According to the current American College of Sports Medicine guidelines, <xref rid="pone.0108690-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> repetitive contractions above a given percent of maximal force are recommended for increasing muscle strength. In other words, if muscles generate more than a given force in repetitive contractions during training, the strength will increase, but the strength will not otherwise increase. Indeed, Nemoto et al. <xref rid="pone.0108690-Nemoto1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> suggested that the thigh muscle strength remained unchanged after a 5-month moderate-intensity (50% <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0108690.e049.jpg"/></inline-formula>O<sub>2peak</sub>) continuous walking training regimen, while it increased after IWT, which is similar to the results for IWT in the present study. Therefore, the higher sensitivity of F<sub>FLX</sub> to IWT compared that of F<sub>EXT</sub> was because the relative exercise intensity was sufficiently high to increase the strength in F<sub>FLX</sub> but not in F<sub>EXT</sub>.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108690-t004">

Generally, THA patients tend to be physically inactive, fearing acetabular cap wear of the implanted joints due to more frequent friction on the surface during walking; <xref rid="pone.0108690-Dowson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> however, recent studies have suggested that the wear is not related to the daily physical activity level <xref rid="pone.0108690-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and, furthermore, the incidence of joint replacement was much higher in patients with less regular exercise, which is most likely due to the reduction in the surrounding muscle mass supporting the joint. <xref rid="pone.0108690-Judd1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> We found that the walking satisfaction score, &#x0201c;vitality&#x0201d; in SF-36 in IWT, was improved as the thigh muscle strength increased after training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108690-t003">

Therefore, it is unclear whether the patients would continue IWT afterwards; however, it has been suggested that the adherence rate of 4 months of IWT was 94% in age-matched healthy women, which was due to the instruction service that provided achievement-based feedback over the internet. <xref rid="pone.0108690-Morikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> Therefore, we surmised that most THA patients would continue IWT if the service was provided afterwards.</p><p>In the present study, a mild exercise control group was not included; however, Nemoto et al. <xref rid="pone.0108690-Nemoto1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> reported in middle-aged and older people, the F<sub>EXT</sub> and F<sub>FLX</sub> significantly increased after high intensity interval walking training for 5 months, while it did not increase after moderate intensity continuous walking training, although the time and steps for training were less in high intensity interval walking training group than in the moderate intensity continuous walking training group. Accordingly, they suggested that high intensity interval walking training increased the thigh muscle strength as resistance training by using machines recommended by the ACSM. <xref rid="pone.0108690-Armstrong1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> We confirmed this in THA patients in the present study.</p><p>The subjects in the present study had relatively low BMIs and were middle-aged and older Japanese women.
