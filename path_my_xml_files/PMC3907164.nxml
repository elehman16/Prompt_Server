<bold>Background:</bold> Psychosis is a common and debilitating side effect of long-term dopaminergic treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). While clozapine is an effective treatment, the need for blood monitoring has limited its first-line use.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> Since olanzapine shows similar receptor affinity to clozapine, we hypothesized that it might be an effective alternative to clozapine for treatment of drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in PD, and that lower doses than usual might make it tolerable.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> In 1998-2003 we conducted a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, fixed-dose trial of olanzapine (0, 2.5mg, or 5mg) in 23 PD patients with DIP while allowing for clinically realistic dose adjustments of dopaminomimetic mid-study. The primary outcome measures were Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings scored from videotaped interviews after study termination by an observer blinded to dose assignment and to interview timing, and CGI (Clinical Global Impression). The Unified Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale motor subscale (UPDRS) was the primary measure of tolerability.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences among treatment groups in study completion or serious adverse events. However, a disproportionate number of olanzapine vs. placebo subjects reported mild side effects (p&#x0003c;0.04), many citing motor worsening. Fourteen patients completed the study (seven on placebo, two on 2.5mg olanzapine, five on 5mg olanzapine). In study completers, analysis by repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant difference between olanzapine and placebo groups in BPRS psychosis reduction (p=0.536), parkinsonism (p=0.608), or any other measured parameters (CGI, MMSE, Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression score, PDQ&#x02011;39, Schwab-England ADL assessment, and sleep scores).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study adds to other evidence that olanzapine is ineffective in treating medication-induced psychosis in Parkinson disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Lilly Research Laboratories</funding-source><award-id>Investigator-Initiated Trial F1D-MC-I012</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Lilly Research Laboratories (Investigator-Initiated Trial F1D-MC-I012).</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug-induced psychosis (DIP) is a significant and disabling complication of long-term treatment of Parkinson disease (PD), affecting a large minority of PD patients receiving chronic dopaminergic therapy
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Visual hallucinations are the most commonly reported psychotic phenomena in this population, with auditory, tactile, somatic, and olfactory hallucinations being much less common. Delusions, when they occur, often antedate visual hallucinations and commonly are paranoid or persecutory in nature
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In addition to the increased caregiver burden caused by psychosis and its sequelae, hallucinations in the context of chronically treated PD tend to be progressive in nature, resulting in increased propensity for nursing home placement and subsequent higher mortality
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These sobering associations suggest aggressive management of DIP in this population. However, either dose reduction of antiparkinsonian medications or addition of traditional neuroleptics usually increases parkinsonian motor disabilities. Atypical antipsychotics, with their comparatively lower incidence of parkinsonism in schizophrenia, have potential advantages for treatment of hallucinations in this sensitive population
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>Until recently, the only treatment proven with randomized, placebo-controlled studies to reduce DIP has been clozapine, an agent that does not worsen motor function
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Despite these favorable data, use of clozapine has been limited secondary to its rare but potentially serious risk of agranulocytosis and the consequent necessity for frequent blood draws
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Thus alternative treatments have been eagerly sought.</p><p>Quetiapine has become the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic in DIP
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Although double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of quetiapine in PD confirmed it is well tolerated in terms of motor side effects, it has not proven significantly more effective than placebo in treating psychosis
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and a head-to-head comparison found clozapine superior to quetiapine
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Ziprasidone showed some benefit in open-label experience
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, including in a random-assignment open comparison to clozapine
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, ziprasidone can cause motor side effects in PD and is not generally considered standard therapy for DIP
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Other treatments, such as ondansetron, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and electroconvulsive therapy are supported by limited data in idiopathic Parkinson disease but are generally not viewed as first-line therapy
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Recently, a phase III clinical trial of a serotonin 5HT
<sub>2A</sub> inverse agonist, pimavanserin, showed benefit over placebo, but the drug will not be available in the U.S. at least until late 2014
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p><p>Clozapine&#x02019;s antipsychotic efficacy is often attributed to its D
<sub>4</sub> receptor antagonism. It is also posited that its robust 5HT
<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism, especially in relation to its relatively weaker D
<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade, actually increases dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortical and nigrostriatal projections
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This may account for the cognitive improvement as well as paucity of extrapyramidal adverse events observed in clozapine-treated patients with dopaminomimetic-induced psychosis
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Olanzapine, therefore, with its ostensibly similar receptor binding profile to clozapine at D
<sub>2</sub>, D
<sub>4</sub>, and serotonergic receptors (especially 5HT
<sub>2A</sub> and 5HT
<sub>2C</sub>), and muscarinic sites, provides a theoretically encouraging alternative to clozapine in this fragile population
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>An initial open study of olanzapine in Parkinson disease revealed antipsychotic benefit without motor deterioration when drug dosage was optimized in a slow titration (mean daily dose at end of study was 6.5mg) and dopaminomimetic dose adjustments were allowed
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Aarsland and colleagues replicated these findings in a relatively more challenging population of Parkinson disease patients with and without dementia
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Several other small, open-label studies of olanzapine, however, have demonstrated antipsychotic benefit but at the expense of intolerable worsening of gait and bradykinesia, frequently leading to premature termination of the drug
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Another small open-label trial and case report series suggested unacceptable Parkinsonian motor deterioration in the context of dubious antipsychotic efficacy
<sup><xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Later, two double-blind placebo-controlled trials revealed equivocal antipsychotic benefit and problematic motor decline in PD patients with DIP treated with 2.5&#x02013;15mg/day olanzapine (mean final doses 4.1&#x02013;4.6mg/day)
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. As a result, experts have recommended against the use of olanzapine in PD
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>None of these studies, however, were parallel-group fixed-dose trials, and some allowed for neuroleptic dose in the same range as approved for schizophrenia; experience with clozapine suggests that an effective antipsychotic dose in PD is often an order of magnitude less than that typical for schizophrenia treatment. In addition, the two double-blind placebo-controlled trials did not permit adjustments of subjects&#x02019; dopaminomimetics, which might have alleviated motoric side effects. Finally, some of the studies cited were terminated prematurely due to side effects. Given that the only marketed drug for which efficacy has been shown is clozapine, demonstrating efficacy for an alternative agent would be important, and a fixed low dose of olanzapine (2.5mg/day) may allow a reasonably low incidence of side effects if dopaminomimetic dose adjustments are allowed. We discuss here the findings of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fixed, low-dose olanzapine for treatment of DIP in the context of flexible dopaminomimetic dosing. The hypothesis was that olanzapine given in this fashion would reduce DIP in patients with idiopathic PD significantly more than would a placebo, without causing intolerable motor worsening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><p>The completed CONSORT checklist

Patients were examined by a movement disorders specialist and diagnosed with idiopathic PD based on presence of at least two of three cardinal manifestations of the disease (rigidity, bradykinesia, rest tremor), response to levodopa or a dopamine agonist, and absence of historical or examination features suggesting secondary parkinsonism. Subjects were treated with levodopa and were experiencing clinically significant hallucinations or delusions, as judged by their treating neurologist or psychiatrist and by the investigator (KJB). Subjects were required to be over 30 years old and have a caregiver who could provide a reliable report. At study entry, patients were required to be treated with the lowest clinically acceptable dose of dopaminomimetic. Patients treated only with a dopamine agonist were not entered in the study, as it was deemed more clinically appropriate to try a switch to levodopa before adding an antipsychotic. Exclusion criteria included a Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &#x0003c; 22
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, pregnancy, concurrent diagnosis of delirium (unless clearly explained by dopaminomimetics), catatonia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like syndrome, other confounding central nervous system (CNS) illness or systemic illness with potential CNS effects, antipsychotic use within the last month predating study enrollment (within the past six months for depot neuroleptics), history of olanzapine sensitivity, or any expectation of significant medical or surgical intervention within six weeks after enrollment. Subjects were also excluded if severity of psychosis warranted hospitalization or if, in the investigator&#x02019;s judgment, psychosis severity would have made randomization to placebo inappropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or either of two doses of olanzapine. At study initiation, treatment groups consisted of a placebo arm, a 5mg arm, in which patients received this dosage nightly throughout the four weeks of investigation, and a 10mg arm, in which patients received 5mg for the first week and 10mg thereafter. Subjects received matched tablets or capsules provided by Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN), who provided the investigator with sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes containing the medication identity for each subject. The envelopes were not opened until after all data were collected and reviewed for accuracy, and after all decisions about statistical analysis were final, so that both investigators and patients were blind to intervention assignment. The randomization was done by Lilly. KJB enrolled subjects and patients were assigned to treatment packages sequentially by enrollment date.</p><p>After the first five patients were enrolled, an interim safety analysis was conducted by a reviewer otherwise not involved in the study, in light of reports published since the study initiation that higher olanzapine doses caused intolerable exacerbation of parkinsonism in PD. Though serious adverse events were no more common in the treatment groups than in the placebo group, it was decided at this time that the two active treatment arms would be changed to fixed doses of 2.5mg and 5mg olanzapine, maintained throughout the four weeks of study. New treatment packages were received and the blind was maintained until after data analysis, as above. No other changes to the protocol were made. See
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for a summary of the final study design. The study was planned for 10 subjects in each of three dose arms. This would produce 90% power (at alpha = 0.05) to detect a change of the magnitude and variability seen in the Wolters

<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. In study completers, we did not observe the motoric exacerbation documented in several studies in the literature
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, but perhaps this is a function of our allowance for dopaminomimetic increase mid-study as well as a selection bias in some analyses for those subjects who best tolerated the medication and therefore completed the study. After all, of the nine subjects who withdrew from the study, a third identified a worsening of their motor disability prior to dropout, all of whom were discovered on unblinding to have been randomized to olanzapine. Therefore the good retrospective accuracy of investigator and patient guesses of study drug identity is not surprising.</p><p>The subjects enrolled are relatively typical of PD patients with psychotic symptoms with a few exceptions. Subjects with urgent need for treatment were not enrolled for ethical reasons. Although mild dementia was allowed, this sample had relatively high cognitive functioning, with a mean MMSE score &#x0003e; 26 (
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Finally, at this center, some of the patients are referred for subspecialty movement disorders consultation, though a large fraction of the patients are not referred and are typical of PD patients treated in the community. With these caveats, the results appear to be generally applicable to patients with PD and psychosis.</p><p>One methodological innovation in this study was the use of videotape to record semi-standardized interviews for later analysis by a rater blind not only to drug assignment but also to time (i.e., week 0, week 2, or week 4). The rationale was to minimize rater expectation of improvement over time that might reduce our power to detect significantly greater improvement in the active treatment groups. It also reduced the likelihood of rater unblinding.</p><p>This trial supports other evidence suggesting that olanzapine is ineffective for relieving dopaminomimetic-induced psychotic symptoms in Parkinson disease and that it may cause intolerable worsening of motor disability

<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This trial also underscores the importance of rigorous study design for the assessment of drug effectiveness in special populations, as we and others have not replicated the early, positive open-label experience reported for olanzapine in this population. If clozapine&#x02019;s prominence in the clinical management of DIP in PD is to be usurped, antipsychotic agents will have to meet the burden of proof of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Joel S.

<bold>Guidelines for rating selected BPRS items in a treatment study of psychosis in Parkinson disease.</bold>
</p><p>1. Emotional withdrawal = interpersonal relatedness during interview.</p><p>2. Tension:</p><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;a. Ignore: rest tremors, postural tremors, chorea, athetosis, dystonia.</p><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;b. Include: tardive dyskinesia and akathisia.</p><p>3. Depressive mood rating does
<italic>not</italic> consider &#x0201c;pure apathy&#x0201d; (
<italic>i.e.</italic>, apathy w/o other depressive signs or symptoms), but apathy
<italic>can</italic> contribute to the total judgment of depressive mood if other signs or symptoms are present.</p><p>4. Hallucinatory behavior:</p><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;a. 2 = illusions and &#x0201c;shadow in the corner of the eye&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;b. 3 =
<italic>e.g</italic>., colors on the wall.</p><p>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;c. &#x02265; 4 = definitively abnormal sensory perceptions.</p><p>5. Motor retardation: Speed of movement, not amplitude (also, depressive retardation is not substantially helped by external cues; if slowed movement is substantially helped by external cues, then it may be more parsimoniously attributed to PD).</p><p>6. Unusual thought content: Ratings &#x02265; 5 require action on delusion.</p><p>7. Blunted affect: Rate according to scale, considering emotional variance, regardless of amplitude; remember that flat/blunted affect is not equivalent to depressed affect.</p><p>8. Disorientation: Off by one day of week = 3.</p><p>Motor hyperactivity: Limit rating to pressured speech and voluntary movement; festination does not count.</p><p>Kevin J Black MD consulted with John G Csernansky MD to write these additional rules for scoring BPRS items potentially influenced by motor signs in Parkinson disease patients.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="ref-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group>:

Although the data was collected a decade ago, the information is still relevant because remarkably little progress has been made since 2003 in the treatment of PD related psychosis. Dr. Richard&#x02019;s referee response presents the methodological shortcomings and correctly points out resulting limitations in data interpretation. I agree with all of the comments in her review.</p><p>In addition, I would like to add the following comments/observations: </p><p>In the abstract and introduction, the authors suggest that because olanzapine has a similar receptor binding profile to clozapine, it is a good candidate drug to study in the PD population and they cite

<italic>et al. </italic>1993</ext-link>. More recent work by Seeman shows that what is unique about clozapine is that it binds D2 receptors &#x0201c;loosely&#x0201d; and that its receptor occupancy is short-lived. Quetiapine has a similar D2 binding profile to clozapine but, olanzapine behaves much more like haloperidol and risperidone in this regard. This may explain the motor worsening that seems to be associated with olanzapine use in PD. (

<italic>Delusions, when they occur, often antedate visual hallucinations...</italic>.&#x0201d; The natural history of hallucinations in PD has been looked at in only a few longitudinal studies and the interaction between hallucination and delusions has not been adequately studied but my clinical experience and the bulk of what is presented in the literature suggests that minor hallucinatory phenomena (illusions, passage or presence hallucinations, benign hallucinations with insight) are much more common and occur earlier in PD than delusions. Delusions are generally associated with more severe underlying cognitive impairment, by definition are associated with lost insight and are generally considered to indicate a more advanced stage of disease progression than isolated visual hallucinations.

<italic>et al. </italic>Brain 2000;123:733-745</ext-link>).</p><p>I would also question the premise that allowing for a dopaminergic medication dose adjustment in the study protocol (to reverse any worsening of PD motor symptoms due to the introduction of low dose olanzapine) might produce study results that are a more appropriate way to evaluate how this drug might work in the clinic. My experience is that this strategy is unsustainable even in the short term in this population. One reason is that each dose increase of dopaminergic medication is prone to reignite symptoms of psychosis and thus lead to a need for higher doses of the antipsychotic, setting up a cycle of overall worsening. Secondly, these patients tend to have more advanced motor symptoms including high risk symptoms such as postural instability and dysphagia. It may be very difficult to continue a drug known to worsen PD motor symptoms after the first fall or choking episode even if one cannot be sure it was a direct result of the antipsychotic drug.&#x000a0;&#x000a0; </p><p>I would suggest more clearly pointing out that this study cohort had relatively mild cognitive impairment (MMSE &#x0003e;26) which may be quite different than what is encountered in practice. More demented patients may be more susceptible to side effects of atypical neuroleptics including sedation, encephalopathy and motor worsening. More demented patients may also have more severe psychosis which is likely to be less responsive to the low doses used in this and some other clinical trials.&#x000a0; </p><p>Finally, I suspect that some readers may not have a full grasp of &#x0201c;Type II error&#x0201d;. This should probably be spelled out without jargon in the discussion.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body><sub-article id="comment532" article-type="response"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Kevin J.</given-names></name><aff>Washington University in St. Louis, USA</aff></contrib></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>
