The major aim of this research is to investigate the efficacy of interventions for preventing the development of psychological distress following a motor vehicle crash.

For those who have entered the compensation system, the level of distress appears to be even more elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Pain, injury, impairment, loss of income, trauma, depression and anxiety are common outcomes for survivors of motor vehicle crashes, and in an environment where coping capacity is already challenged, motor vehicle crash survivors are at risk of developing severe psychological disorders, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such an outcome for motor vehicle crash survivors entering compensation systems is understandable, given the multiple post-injury stressors that can have an impact. Examples of possible stressors include continual reminders of crash-related trauma, when providing oral or written detailed accounts of the accident to insurance organizations, medical experts and legal representatives, reduced social participation and relationship conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is estimated that up to 50&#x000a0;% of motor vehicle crash survivors will develop elevated psychological distress within 6&#x000a0;months of a crash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], suggesting that addressing the risks associated with psychological distress early in the compensation process will be of benefit to at-risk people, as well as their employment capacities, families, employers and insurance companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Interventions that have potential for preventing the development of psychological distress and thus facilitate recovery following a motor vehicle crash are worthy of investigation. For example, motor vehicle crash survivors who file compensation claims could be educated in distress management early in the compensatory process, with the goal of enhancing psychological, social and behavioural skills. Alternatively, lifestyle programmes that improve sleep, diet and exercise might also better position survivors, improving their resilience and coping skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is acknowledged as an efficacious treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], further evidenced by its support from government-sponsored initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Strategies used in CBT are pragmatic and effective, with easy-to-learn skills, such as problem solving, anxiety and mood management, in addition to psycho-education about stress and mental health. The efficacy of CBT has been established for mental health disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, and its efficacy has been demonstrated across a variety of clinical research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, CBT should benefit those who have experienced a motor vehicle crash, and who are engaged in the compensation system.</p><p>Additionally healthy lifestyle programmes have also been demonstrated to have positive health outcomes in various populations and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While there are a limited number of studies that have investigated the efficacy of healthy lifestyle strategies for mental health, current research suggests that positive mental health is independently associated with lifestyle features, such as regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Conversely, reduced physical activity has been found to be associated with health risks, such as coronary heart disease, Type II diabetes, some cancers, obesity, hypertension, depression and anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Physical fitness, indicated by a lower heart rate, was found to be associated with smaller inflammatory responses to mental stress as well as great parasympathetic control (e.g. through increased vagus nerve activity or lower neural arousal reactivity to stress) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These factors are known protective factors of mental health disorders, such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, poor sleep quality has been associated with a variety of health behaviours, impairment and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A systematic review of healthy lifestyle programmes delivered by internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] revealed that such factors as peer and professional support, regular email or phone contact and education were related to increased adherence and better outcomes in participants.</p><p>The internet has provided a new format for delivering CBT or healthy lifestyle interventions, by way of an online bibliotherapy with therapist contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Here, the client is exposed to the same components as with traditional face-to-face treatment; however, the psycho-educational material and instructions for behavioural change are delivered using an internet-based treatment platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent systematic review identified that an online-delivered CBT programme was cost-effective compared with face-to-face CBT, based on improvements in symptoms and reduction of time and resource demands on clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, recent research has suggested that online-delivered CBT designed to treat depression is no more effective than usual face-to-face care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Here, the low user engagement might have reflected the fact that direction to a website is perceived as impersonal and requires a degree of motivation perhaps unavailable to a clinically depressed person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For this trial, the intervention will be delivered by email and is expected to have similar efficacy to an online programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with the advantage of substantially reduced web-based developmental costs, as well as a more personally delivered CBT treatment via email in addition to telephone support specific to CBT strategies of gentle guidance and support of specific skills and strategies.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have only been six randomized controlled trials investigating the prevention of psychological distress following a motor vehicle crash. All six have involved relatively small samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Of these, only two specifically focused on compensatory claimants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and these both had non-significant results. However, other studies have reported significant results in reducing symptoms of psychological distress in people with elevated distress levels following a motor vehicle crash using CBT. For example, CBT techniques involving exploration of thoughts and feelings and <italic>in-vivo</italic> exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and cognitive restructuring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] have either contained or reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder for motor vehicle crash survivors. These promising results suggest that a randomized controlled trial involving interventions such as CBT, and designed to prevent development of psychological distress, employing a sample size with sufficient power to detect a true finding, is warranted. The uniqueness of this trial is that it will investigate the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent development of psychological distress for people entering the compensation system following a motor vehicle crash. Participants will be included, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms of psychological morbidity.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The major aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention designed to prevent development of psychological distress following a motor vehicle crash and delivered within 12&#x000a0;weeks of the crash. A secondary aim is to achieve a relatively high rate of adherence and participant satisfaction with email-delivered programmes, consistent with other studies of online-delivered CBT treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Primarily, the treatment interventions aim to prevent the development of psychological distress, along with producing clinically and statistically significant improvements in health outcomes, such as reduced anxiety and depressive mood, increased physical activity, improved sleep, improved quality of life and disability ratings, reduced pain severity, and improved return to pre-injury employment and daily functioning in the medium term after the programme.

The first is a brief email-delivered CBT treatment, consisting of five modules delivered fortnightly. The second is a brief email-delivered lifestyle treatment, also consisting of five modules and delivered fortnightly. Both groups will also receive weekly telephone contact to encourage their engagement with their programmes. The active waiting-list control group will receive reading material about the claims process, and will also receive fortnightly follow-up phone calls; however, these calls will only involve brief discussions of their progress in the compensation scheme in addition to confirming that they are receiving their reading material. There will be four measurement points: baseline (within 12&#x000a0;weeks of the motor vehicle crash), post-treatment (within 2&#x000a0;weeks of cessation of the interventions), and 6-month and 12&#x000a0;month follow-up sessions for the treatment groups (from the time of entry into the study) with the final two assessments also including participant satisfaction and acceptability questionnaires. If participants in the waiting-list control group do not want to receive either of the intervention programmes, they will also be assessed at 12&#x000a0;months.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment, inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Recruitment involves an opt-in two-step process for adult motor vehicle crash survivors who have lodged a compensation claim with one of the multisite insurance companies.

Assuming an &#x003b1; probability of 0.05 and a power of 80&#x000a0;% for a three-group comparison analysis with four measures over time, a sample of 135 participants must be recruited to detect a true difference (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is therefore proposed to recruit at least 180 adult participants, randomly assigned to one of the three groups each with at least 60 participants per group.

These questions have been used in previous research to examine the acceptability of internet-delivered CBT and other similar low-intensity treatments amongst consumers with a range of different conditions and across a range of different age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Treatment feasibility will be broadly assessed based on the preliminary outcomes achieved combined with the ease with which clients could be supported through the programme by the insurance regulatory agencies. Generalizability of the treatment will be assessed with reference to the percentage of people who enter the study compared with the total number to whom participation is offered, and the follow-up rate achieved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Safety measures and endpoint</title><p>This study is being conducted by a clinical psychologist highly experienced in the assessment and treatment of mental health disorders, as part of a doctoral study. The occurrence of adverse events, such as severe episodes of anxiety, panic, depression of risk of self-harm during the interventions, are considered safety endpoint measures of this trial. The regular contact by the clinical psychologist will identify whether the safety endpoint measure is required by any participant and appropriate action as per accepted mental health clinical guidelines will be instigated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Hypothesis and data analysis</title><p>The primary hypotheses assert that brief interventions (CBT and healthy lifestyle) will prevent the development of psychological distress by improving psychological coping skills and healthy behaviours. A further hypothesis is that the intervention groups will show improved resilience and quality of life compared with the control group; however, we are not hypothesizing a significant difference between the treatment groups themselves.</p><p>The effectiveness of the interventions will be determined by conducting multivariate analyses of variance with repeated measures for revealing differences within and between groups, as well as reporting effect size changes. Potential confounding factors, such as pre-injury health and education, will be adjusted for in the analysis. Correlation analyses and multiple regression will also be used to analyse predictors of psychological distress over time. The intervention satisfaction questionnaire will be analyzed to assess participant satisfaction of the overall treatment approach. Clinically significant improvements or recovery will be determined by identifying the proportion of participants who demonstrate a significant reduction in their symptoms.</p><p>An interim analysis will re-evaluate the assumptions made for the study&#x02019;s sample size calculation, with re-estimation made if required, unless the trial needs to be stopped as a result of significant and consistent indications of elevated psychological distress associated with the interventions, according to the safety measures and endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial organization, registration and ethical aspects</title><p>To ensure data integrity the database analyst remains blind to participant allocation details. Data are to be saved in three different locations under tight security with pass-code access only.

If the result is positive, and the intervention is acceptable to clients and efficient to administer, it could be implemented by the insurance companies&#x02019; regulatory agency as part of standard protocol to all motor vehicle crash survivors. Such a protocol would have the potential to reduce the psychological and economic burdens of motor vehicle crashes with benefits for at-risk people and their families, as well as their employers, with more efficient return to work timeframes, while reducing costs for insurance companies. The results of the study would enable other national and international regulatory agencies to implement a similar preventive intervention strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>Two sources of recruitment (national companies with local branches) have been initiated and are actively providing potential participants.
