Numerous adaptations take place to meet this challenge, both locally (including changes in mRNA expression and protein levels) and systemically (including hormonal signaling and organ crosstalk) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ultimately, these events will promote altered expression of the key proteins in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as well as the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Both studies were conducted at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences. The first study (study 1) was conducted during the fall of 2013 and the second study (study 2) during the fall of 2014 and the spring of 2015. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>In study 1, 24 resistance-trained young (mean age; 25.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.5&#x000a0;years) and 17 recreationally active older (mean age; 74.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8) healthy men and women were randomly allocated into a milk group or a whey group. Further, subjects in the whey group were randomized to receive whey protein concentrate (WPC80) or native whey on the first test day in a crossover design (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

Thus, the main difference between test products was the amino acid composition, as illustrated in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Further, the production method for WPC80 differed from that of native whey as native whey was produced at low temperatures (below 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). In both studies, the supplements were provided in identical packages to ensure blinding of both the providers and the participants, although the products were labeled with color codes to ensure that the participants received the correct products. The color-coding was provided by the producer and was not revealed until the interventions and statistical analyses were completed.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We observed that acute exercise modulated changes in mRNA expression levels of several genes known to be involved in repair, regeneration and adaptive processes of exercise, and in skeletal muscle as well as PBMCs. Some of the changes observed were regulated similarly in skeletal muscle and PBMCs, whereas other mRNA transcripts showed a unique pattern. Furthermore, we observed an attenuated response in the PBMC mRNA expression level of <italic>IL10</italic> in older compared to younger participants, whereas the PBMC mRNA expression levels of <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>IL1&#x003b2;</italic> increased in older compared to younger participants after exercise. In contrast, the intake of different types of dairy protein had no significant impact on the mRNA response neither in skeletal muscle nor in PBMCs.</p><p>When comparing mRNA expression levels in skeletal muscle and PBMCs, we observed three different expression patterns: (i) mRNA transcripts increased significantly in skeletal muscle only, (ii) mRNA transcripts increased significantly in both skeletal muscle and PBMCs, but the magnitude of the increase was higher in skeletal muscle than in PBMCs, and (iii) mRNA transcripts were similarly expressed in both skeletal muscle and PBMC. These results demonstrate that skeletal muscle and PBMCs have overlapping, as well as unique mRNA responses to acute exercise, suggesting tissue-specific functions in response to acute exercise. IL6 has, for example, consistently been shown to increase in skeletal muscle and in serum after acute exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], whereas data from PBMC mRNA expression analysis showed a modest or no increase of IL6 after acute exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A temporary increase in IL6 after an exercise may affect the satellite cells and promote myogenic lineage progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. TNF and IL1&#x003b2; may have a role in promoting myoblast proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and in inhibiting myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], potentially being important contributors to skeletal muscle adaptions. In PBMCs, the function of TNF and IL1&#x003b2; is primarily pro-inflammatory, playing a less important role after acute exercise. In addition, we observed a significant increase in mRNA expression levels of <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>IL1RN</italic> after exercise in both skeletal muscle and PBMCs. We speculate that the increased mRNA expression levels of these cytokines may induce a regenerative response in patrolling PBMCs, possibly as an attempt to restore homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The increase of these cytokines in PBMCs may be a result of IL6 released from skeletal muscle after acute exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In the present study, the mRNA expression of <italic>CCL2</italic> was strongly increased in skeletal muscle, whereas no change was observed in PBMCs. Little is known about the function and physiological relevance of CCL2 after strength exercise in humans, but studies on contracting C2C12 myotubes show that CCL2 is released in a NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner to induce monocyte chemoattraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have been performed investigating the response to acute exercise in skeletal muscle and PBMCs simultaneously, but Liburt and colleagues observed that mRNA expression levels of <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> increased in skeletal muscle after acute exercise in horses, with no increase in PBMCs. They also found that the expression of <italic>IL1</italic> was similar in skeletal muscle and PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Zeibig and colleagues found a significant correlation of mRNA transcripts of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferases between skeletal muscle and human blood cells after 6&#x000a0;months of endurance exercise in young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], whereas Rudkowska and colleagues reported that 88% of the mRNA transcripts in skeletal muscle and PBMCs overlapped after 8&#x000a0;weeks of supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids using a transcriptome approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Further, we observed both a reduced and an increased response to acute exercise in older compared to younger participants in PBMCs, with no differences in skeletal muscle. Few, if any, have investigated possible differences in mRNA expression levels of PBMCs after acute exercise between young and older subjects. An attenuated cytokine response to acute exercise in older subjects has been observed in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], with conflicting results in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Knowing that the immune cells may be an important part of adaptive processes to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], an altered response of cytokines and chemokines in PBMCs of older subjects may ultimately impair regeneration. In the present study, the relative workload was the same in young and older participants, but the training volume differed between the groups. Younger participants were stronger and able to lift a higher load than the older participants. This may have contributed to a higher systemic stress in younger than in older participants, possibly being part of the explanation for the altered response observed in PBMCs between younger and older participants.</p><p>No differences in mRNA expression levels of investigated markers were observed 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min after the heavy-load strength exercise, depending on the protein source (whey or milk). These results were supported by Nieman and colleagues who reported no differences in mRNA expression levels of markers, such as <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL1&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic>, and <italic>IL10,</italic> after an intense resistance exercise session, combined with the consumption of supplements consisting of carbohydrate (50%), protein (16%), and fat (34%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, other studies have indicated that whey proteins may have anti-inflammatory properties, by limiting the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In stimulated PBMCs, cultured in the presence of different glutamine concentrations, glutamine may enhance the production of T lymphocyte-derived cytokines, such as IL10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly, glucose ingestion may attenuate IL6 release from contracting skeletal muscle after 120&#x000a0;min of cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The time course of mRNA expression may differ in endurance and strength exercise, possibly explaining the different results.</p><p>There are some limitations to the present study. We report one post-exercise time point only, which limits our ability to identify potential differences in the time course of transcriptional regulation that may result from training or supplementation. This sampling point may also have been too early to detect possible differences in mRNA expression levels of the protein source provided. Another limitation of the study was that even though we are investigating the effect of a relative work load, because the young subjects were stronger and lifted approximately twice the volume of the old participants, it is not unreasonable to assume that the relative systemic stress (e.g., circulatory system) was higher in the young, and we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that this may have contributed to different responses in PBMC. Major strengths to the present study are the randomized controlled design, with participants receiving a standardized diet prior to, and on the test day, and the standardized exercise sessions that were performed under close supervision. The blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected simultaneously allowing comparison of the responses in the two tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report changes in mRNA expression levels of selected genes, in skeletal muscle and PBMCs, after two acute bouts of strength exercise, followed by the intake of different protein supplements, in young and old participants.
