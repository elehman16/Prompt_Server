The study included 5 visits conducted in 2 phases: phase 1 was an open-label run-in phase in which patients received an investigator-assigned PGA, and phase 2 was a double-masked treatment phase in which patients were randomized to receive BBFC or vehicle in addition to the PGA used during phase 1.</p><p>The open-label phase consisted of a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits conducted 3&#x02013;8 days apart, with the first eligibility visit conducted up to 28&#x000b1;3 days after screening based on the washout schedule of prior medications. At screening, patients discontinued other IOP-lowering medications and were assigned by study investigators a branded PGA: XALATAN (latanoprost 0.005&#x00025; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), LUMIGAN (bimatoprost 0.01&#x00025; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA), or TRAVATAN Z (travoprost 0.004&#x00025; Alcon Laboratories) to be taken once-daily at bedtime for the duration of the study. A ratio of ~2&#x02009;:&#x02009;2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 was achieved by imposing ceilings on the total numbers of patients receiving each investigator-assigned PGA. Patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized to masked BBFC or vehicle 3 times daily at ~0800, 1500, and 2200 hours for 6 weeks in addition to their once-daily PGA. On-therapy follow-up visits were scheduled after 2 weeks&#x000b1;3 days and 6 weeks&#x000b1;5 days of treatment with BBFC&#x0002b;PGA or vehicle&#x0002b;PGA.</p><p>For the randomized, double-masked treatment phase of the study, eligible patients were sequentially randomized by designated personnel at each study site to BBFC or vehicle using a schedule provided by the study sponsor. The series of randomization numbers were generated using PROC PLAN in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to generate 100 balanced blocks of size 4 in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio. Blocks were allocated on demand using an electronic-data-collection system with interactive response technology web software and stratified by investigator and patients' study PGA to ensure a balance of treatment allocations within study sites and type of PGA.</p><p>To minimize potential selection bias, patients, investigators, study site personnel, the study sponsor, and clinical monitors were masked to treatment assignments. Multiple study sites were used to eliminate the potential of single-observer bias. Personnel administering study medications during on-therapy visits did not discuss treatments or participate in IOP measurements, and study investigators were not allowed to administer treatments during the study. BBFC and vehicle were provided to study investigators using identical masked bottles, labels, and packaging with the kit number indicated, and the randomization schedule was restricted until after the database was locked and the study was unmasked.</p><p>The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and participating patients provided informed consent. The study protocol and consent documents were approved by Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA, USA), Wills Eye Hospital Institutional Review Board (Philadelphia, PA, USA), Summa Health System Institutional Review Board (Akron, OH, USA), and Sterling Institutional Review Board (Atlanta, GA, USA) before the start of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were enrolled by individual study investigators. Eligible patients were aged &#x02265;18 years, diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion) or ocular hypertension, and had a mean IOP of &#x02265;21 and &#x0003c;32&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg in at least 1 eye at 0800 hours during both eligibility visits, whereas on PGA monotherapy. Patients with IOP &#x02265;32&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg in either eye at any time point were excluded.</p><p>Additional key exclusion criteria were central corneal thickness &#x0003e;620&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, Shaffer angle grade &#x0003c;2, cup-to-disc ratio &#x0003e;0.8, or severe central visual field loss in either eye; chronic recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease; clinically significant or progressive retinal disease; ocular surgery or trauma &#x02264;6 months before screening; ocular laser surgery, infection, or inflammation &#x02264;3 months before screening; best-corrected visual acuity worse than 55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (equivalent to 20/80 Snellen or 0.6 logMAR) in both eyes; and use of additional ocular hypotensive medications during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>The primary efficacy end point was the between-group difference in mean diurnal IOP (average of 0800, 1000, 1500, and 1700 hours measurements) at week 6. Secondary efficacy end points were mean IOP at each time point at week 6, mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at week 6, and percent diurnal IOP change from baseline at week 6. Mean diurnal IOP, mean and percent diurnal IOP change from baseline, and IOP at individual time points at week 2; and mean and percent IOP change from baseline at individual time points at weeks 2 and 6 were also assessed. Mean IOP at each time point at week 6 was considered a supportive end point in the protocol, but was elevated to a secondary end point before completion of the study. This change was noted in the statistical analysis plan before study completion.</p><p>IOP was measured by an operator and a reader using Goldmann applanation tonometry. Two measurements were taken for each eye. If measurements differed by &#x02264;4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, the average value was considered the mean IOP for that eye. If measurements differed by &#x0003e;4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, a third measurement was taken and the two closest values were averaged. If the three measurements differed by equal amounts, all three measurements were averaged. IOP was measured at screening and at 0800 hours (&#x000b1;30&#x02009;min), 1000 hours (&#x000b1;30&#x02009;min), 1500 hours (&#x000b1;30&#x02009;min), and 1700 hours (&#x000b1;30&#x02009;min) during the two eligibility visits and at the week 2 and week 6 follow-up visits.</p><p>Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) reports, automated perimetry, dilated-eye examination, best-corrected visual acuity, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Best-corrected visual acuity and biomicroscopy assessments were performed at the screening, eligibility, and on-therapy follow-up visits. Perimetry and dilated fundus examination were performed at screening and at the week 6 follow-up visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy end points were analyzed in the intent-to-treat data set (all patients who received study medication and completed at least 1 scheduled on-therapy visit). The safety data set included all patients who received study medication.</p><p>Data for one eye per patient were used for efficacy analyses. If both eyes were treated, the eye with higher IOP at 0800 hours averaged across both eligibility visits was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had equal IOP at 0800 hours, the eye with higher IOP at 1000 hours was selected. If both eyes had equal IOP at 0800 hours and 1000 hours, the right eye was selected as the study eye. The primary and secondary efficacy end points were analyzed on an observed-case basis using a statistical analysis model that was robust for data that were missing at random. The superiority of BBFC&#x0002b;PGA relative to vehicle&#x0002b;PGA was established if the mean diurnal IOP at week 6 was significantly lower in the BBFC&#x0002b;PGA group <italic>vs</italic> the vehicle&#x0002b;PGA group. Treatment group differences for the primary and secondary efficacy end points were determined using tests based on the least squares means derived from a repeated measures statistical model that accounted for correlated IOP measurements within a patient. A sequential testing approach was used to account for multiplicity of analyses. Patient demographics, including race and baseline characteristics, supportive efficacy end points, and safety data were summarized descriptively. Information regarding race was collected to enable potential <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of study outcomes by race categories; patients self-identified their race at screening, and no race categories were predefined.

No changes in visual fields or meaningful between-group differences in fundus parameters were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>IOP reduction for patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma decreases the risk of progressive optic nerve damage and visual field defects. Despite the known efficacy of PGAs, a large retrospective cohort analysis demonstrated that ~12&#x02013;23&#x00025; of patients receiving initial monotherapy with bimatoprost, latanoprost, or travoprost required an adjunctive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Therefore, this study sought to determine whether there would be additional IOP-lowering efficacy if BBFC were added to a PGA in patients not sufficiently controlled with PGA treatment alone.</p><p>The IOP-lowering efficacy of BBFC&#x0002b;PGA has not been assessed previously. Our results demonstrated that three-times-daily BBFC produced clinically meaningful IOP reductions when added to a PGA; these reductions were significantly greater than those achieved with vehicle&#x0002b;PGA. A reduction in IOP (diurnal IOP: 1.9&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, 8&#x00025; peak reduction: 2.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg, 11&#x00025;) was observed in the vehicle&#x0002b;PGA group, similar to previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of clinical trials that assessed common ocular hypotensive agents estimated that vehicle treatment results in small but measurable decreases in IOP ranging from 1.3&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (5&#x00025;) at trough to 1.6&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (5&#x00025;) at peak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> This effect may reflect regression to the mean or improved compliance with active medication(s) when placebo is added because of participation in a clinical trial; however, consistent observations of IOP reduction with placebo alone suggest that 1 or more components of vehicle formulations may provide a small degree of IOP reduction.</p><p>The IOP reductions produced with BBFC&#x0002b;PGA in this study were significantly greater than those reported for brinzolamide&#x0002b;PGA or brimonidine&#x0002b;PGA. A randomized, parallel-group study of PGA-treated patients demonstrated that addition of three-times-daily brimonidine 0.15&#x00025; or brinzolamide 1&#x00025; produced IOP reductions from PGA-treated baseline of 4.8&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (21&#x00025;) and 3.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (16&#x00025;), respectively, at 1000 hours (peak effect) after 4 months of adjunctive therapy. In the current study, peak IOP reduction from baseline with BBFC&#x0002b;PGA was 7.1&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (31&#x00025;), indicating that adding BBFC to a PGA is more effective than adding brimonidine or brinzolamide individually. This finding is consistent with demonstrations of significantly greater IOP-lowering efficacy of BBFC compared with either component alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The effectiveness of treating glaucoma with a fixed combination and a single-agent therapy has been shown previously. After 6 weeks of treatment with fixed-combination brimonidine/timolol added to latanoprost, mean IOP at 1000 hours (peak IOP-lowering efficacy) was reduced by 36&#x00025; from latanoprost-treated baseline levels of 23.0&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg to 23.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> This report is not directly comparable to the current study because mean diurnal IOP reductions were not described; however, the 36&#x00025; IOP reduction at peak was similar to the 31&#x00025; reduction at the week 6, 1000 hours peak efficacy time point described here. Adding brinzolamide to fixed-combination travoprost/timolol reduced mean diurnal IOP by 14&#x00025; from the travoprost/timolol-treated baseline of 20.3&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg after 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Further, fixed-combination brinzolamide/timolol or brimonidine/timolol added to travoprost reduced IOP from travoprost-treated baseline (20.1&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg) by 14 and 10&#x00025;, respectively, after 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> In the current study, BBFC&#x0002b;PGA produced a mean diurnal IOP reduction of 25&#x00025; at week 6 (compared with 8&#x00025; in the vehicle&#x0002b;PGA group), suggesting that BBFC added to a PGA may produce IOP reductions similar to those observed in prior studies of a three-agent treatment regimen that included a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-blocker.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that the magnitudes of IOP reductions achieved with BBFC&#x0002b;PGA in the current study were clinically relevant and may reduce patients' risk of disease progression with long-term use. For example, results of the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) demonstrated that the risk of progression decreased by 10&#x00025; with each 1&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg decrease in mean IOP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> In the current study, the mean IOP decrease from baseline in the BBFC&#x0002b;PGA group was &#x02265;4.5&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg at weeks 2 and 6 at all time points assessed. Further, a meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 822 patients identified mean IOP as a significant risk factor for progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Progression over 5 years of follow-up was reported for more than half of patients with mean IOP&#x0003e;20&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg compared with &#x02264;18&#x00025; of patients with mean IOP of between 13 and 17&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> In the current study, mean diurnal IOP was decreased from 22.7&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg at baseline to ~17&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg at weeks 2 and 6; with the exception of the trough efficacy time point at 0800 hours (19.4&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg), mean IOP at individual time points at weeks 2 and 6 was generally &#x02264;17&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg.</p><p>As expected, AEs were more common in patients receiving BBFC&#x0002b;PGA, likely because the BBFC&#x0002b;PGA group was exposed to three active medications compared with only one in the vehicle&#x0002b;PGA group. Furthermore, treatment intolerance or PGA-related AEs likely occurred during the open-label run-in phase of the study. Most treatment-related AEs in the BBFC&#x0002b;PGA group were consistent with the known safety profiles of BBFC, brinzolamide, brimonidine, and PGAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> No new safety concerns were identified regarding addition of BBFC to a PGA.</p><p>A potential limitation of this study was that it did not evaluate the degree to which PGA treatment contributed to IOP control. In addition, because efficacy was evaluated in the eye with higher baseline IOP for all patients (ie, the &#x02018;worse' eye), the absolute magnitudes of IOP reduction observed in the BBFC&#x0002b;PGA and vehicle&#x0002b;PGA groups may be greater than would be observed in a clinical setting (ie, for a patient's &#x02018;better' eye). However, this approach is frequently taken in glaucoma studies to ensure patient safety by monitoring efficacy in the eye at greater risk of glaucoma-related complications and parallels physicians' concerns about managing the more severe manifestation of a patient's glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Because both treatment groups were analyzed using this approach, no treatment bias was introduced.</p><p>In conclusion, adding BBFC to PGA therapy produced a mean diurnal IOP reduction of 5.7&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg (25&#x00025;) compared with PGA-treated baseline and was superior to vehicle&#x0002b;PGA. BBFC&#x0002b;PGA therapy was well-tolerated, and no safety concerns were observed beyond the known safety profiles of the individual agents. PGAs are often preferred as initial monotherapy because of their IOP-lowering efficacy, lower frequency of instillation, and acceptable tolerability profiles. Adjunctive therapy with BBFC can provide an effective option for patients requiring additional IOP reduction beyond that achieved with PGA monotherapy, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate treatment with a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-blocker. Future studies incorporating longer treatment durations and comparisons with other fixed-combination medications will provide additional valuable information describing the efficacy of BBFC&#x0002b;PGA adjunctive therapy.</p><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="eye2016126i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Alcon Research, Ltd., Fort Worth, TX, USA, and was funded in part by an unrestricted grant to UNC Chapel Hill from Research to Prevent Blindness.
