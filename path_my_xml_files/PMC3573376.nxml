This was a randomized, positive-controlled, double-blinded, clinical study. Subjects were randomly divided into one of the two study groups. Pre-treatment and post treatment photographs of the 4 anterior teeth were recorded under standardized conditions and analyzed for lightness or luminosity values using Adobe Photoshop. The difference between the mean pre-treatment luminosity of test and control groups was not statistically significant. In both test and control groups, the post-treatment luminosity was significantly higher than pre- treatment luminosity (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 respectively). The mean post-treatment luminosity for test group was found to be significantly higher than control group. The mean percentage removal of stains for test group was significantly higher than control group. The test dentifrice showed significant stain removal when compared to control which could be attributed to the role of proteolytic enzymes in the test dentifrice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bromelain</kwd><kwd>extrinsic stains</kwd><kwd>image analysis</kwd><kwd>papain</kwd><kwd>proteolytic enzymes</kwd><kwd>stain removal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Teeth color is a combination of intrinsic color of the teeth and the presence of extrinsic stains that might accumulate on the tooth surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Extrinsic stains are linked with the adsorption of materials into the acquired pellicle on the enamel surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Factors influencing extrinsic stain formation include poor tooth brushing technique, smoking, areca nut chewing, dietary intake of colored foods (e.g. red wine, coffee and tea consumption), subject's age and the use of certain cationic agents such as chlorhexidine or metal salts like tin and iron.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Consumers and patients have always had a strong desire for white teeth which has given rise to a growing trend in the increased use of &#x02018;over-the-counter&#x02019; tooth whitening products. Manufacturers of oral care products are constantly developing new approaches for tooth whitening in order to meet the expectations of patients and consumers. Thus, today there is a huge range of products and technologies available that are self-applied and require no professional involvement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>The majority of these products work in two possible ways. It can be by bleaching of the teeth, or by addition of specific abrasives or chemical agents to toothpaste for the removal and control of extrinsic stain. Abrasives have been shown to effectively remove extrinsic stains along with food debris and plaque and also help in preventing extrinsic teeth stains from reforming.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Toothpaste abrasion of dental hard tissues is an important factor in terms of its trade off with cleaning efficacy during the formulation of whitening toothpastes. Hence whitening toothpastes contain additional chemical agents which augment the abrasive cleaning by aiding the removal and/or prevention of extrinsic stains. Many substances like surfactants, peroxides, enzymes, citrate, pyrophosphates and hexametaphosphate were studied previously for their stain removal efficacy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Since extrinsic stains are primarily incorporated into the pellicle, it is possible that enzymes such as proteases could help degrade the stained films and potentiate their removal. Early clinical evidence demonstrated that a highly proteolytic mixture of enzymes of fungal origin formulated into toothpaste were effective at reducing extrinsic stain levels as compared to a negative control toothpaste after 6-months of use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Clinical studies have demonstrated the stain removal efficacy of dentifrice containing papain, alumina and sodium citrate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Recently an <italic>in vitro</italic> study reported that a papain and bromelain (proteolytic enzymes) containing dentifrice was more effective in removing stains than the control dentifrice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The methods used to measure extrinsic stain levels in clinical studies include subjective clinician determinations based on indices and objective instrumental methods. The objective instrumental methods used in the past were Vita shade guides,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] colorimeters,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and image analysis of digital photographs of teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Digital image analysis can be utilized for assessing stains and overcomes some of the problems associated with some of the subjective and instrumental approaches.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Hence the present study aimed to evaluate the stain removal efficacy of a novel commercially available dentifrice containing papain and bromelain (Glodent, Group Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Mumbai, India) in comparison with a control dentifrice (Colgate Regular, Colgate Palmolive India Ltd, Mumbai, India) using a customized digital image analysis system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>This study was randomized and double blinded (participants and investigators) who compared the novel dentifrice containing papain and bromelain (Glodent) with control dentifrice (Colgate regular). The composition of test dentifrice was Papain, Bromelain, Miswak, Neem and 1000 ppm fluoride and while that of control was calcium carbonate, sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium silicate, sodium saccharin and 1000 ppm fluoride dentifrice. Papain and Bromelain are proteolytic enzymes derived from Papaya (Carica papaya) and Pineapple (Ananas comosus).</p><p>Before the start of the study, the protocol was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of Manipal University, Manipal and subjects gave informed consent prior to their participation. For inclusion in the study, the subjects were required to have visible stains on maxillary incisors with Lobene score of &#x0003e; 1; at least 4 maxillary anterior teeth without restorations; no oral prostheses; no untreated caries. Lobene stain index (1968) involves assessment of extent and intensity of stain on the gingival and body regions of the labial surface of incisor teeth. Intensity scores were: 0- no stain, 1- light stain, 2- moderate stain, 3- heavy stain. Extent scores were: 0- no stain, 1- stain covering up to 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the region, 2- stain covering &#x0003e; 1/3<sup>rd</sup> to 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the region and 3- stain covering &#x0003e; 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the region. Many stain indices proposed recently were mainly to determine the efficacy of anti-stain agents, or to investigate the interaction between chlorhexidine and dietary constituents. Subjects were excluded from participating in the study if there were generalized recession of the gingiva, or generalized malocclusion, or overlapping/spacing of anterior teeth, inability to comply with brushing instructions (e.g,dexterity or comprehension issues), obvious periodontal disease, or facial calculus on the anterior teeth. A total of 100 subjects were screened in out-reach centers of Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Manipal out of whom 29 subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. Out of these 24 subjects consented to participate in the study. This study was conducted for 2-months (November-December 2010).</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups and called to record the baseline photographs of their 4 maxillary anterior teeth. After briefing the purpose of the study to the participants, oral hygiene and tooth brushing instructions were given. Subjects who were divided into two groups were provided with the assigned products (either of the toothpaste and Colgate classic toothbrush with soft bristles) and were required to brush in front of a mirror for 2 minutes twice a day, covering the entire toothbrush head with the dentifrice each time. Test and control dentifrices tubes were painted in white color and delivered by a person not involved in examination. All investigators and participants were unaware of the identity of the tubes given. Tubes were identified as either the &#x0201c;Group 1&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;Group 2&#x0201d; tubes. Identity of each tube was revealed only after 2-weeks when the subjects were recalled for the follow-up examination. During this visit, standardized photographs of the 4 maxillary anterior teeth were repeated. Subjects were given a printed timetable for 2-weeks and were asked to check at the respective area after tooth brushing to ensure the compliance of brushing frequency. At the end of 2-weeks, participants were offered free treatment for scaling and polishing [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow chart showing the various steps in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JYPharm-4-245-g001"/></fig><p>Photographs of the teeth were captured in a customized wooden box with standardized lighting conditions, a chin rest and high resolution digital camera mounted on a platform.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Wooden box</title><p>A customized wooden box was made with plywood in dimensions of 18 &#x000d7; 18 &#x000d7; 18 inches.

In this study an economical and portable customized digital image analysis system was developed and used to evaluate stain removal.</p><p>A number of studies have reported the use of clinical indices for stain evaluation. These indices are quick and easy to use, but they face reliability issues because of their subjective nature. To overcome such problems, image analysis has been used as an objective method in the past to assess stain build up <italic>in vitro</italic> on acrylic and enamel slabs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] It was also shown to be an effective tool for assessing plaque[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and stains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] clinically. However, the methodology used in this study was different although the underlying construct for color assessment was same.</p><p>Image analysis is very sensitive even for minor changes in stain removal. This might facilitate in reduction of the duration of the clinical trials involving stain removal to as short as 2-weeks. This short duration of the study can reduce the costs of conducting a clinical trial, improve patient compliance, reduce attrition of subjects while eliminating subjective bias. The apparatus developed for our study was light in weight and could easily be carried to different field situations and could be replicated elsewhere.</p><p>The stain removal efficacy of novel dentifrice was assessed in terms of Lightness values only. The mean pre-treatment Lightness value for test and control group did not differ significantly. But the mean post-treatment Lightness value was significantly higher for test than control dentifrice. Similar results were reported by a previous <italic>in-vitro</italic> study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] using this test dentifrice. Clinical studies using toothpaste containing a mixture of papain, alumina and sodium citrate (Rembrandt) have also reported a significant stain removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The test dentifrice in the present study contained extracts of papain and bromelain, which are proteolytic enzymes. They disrupt and &#x02044; or remove the protein portion of the pellicle &#x02044; plaque layer that forms on the surface of teeth over time, thus removing the stains that are bound to these proteins. The control dentifrice was chosen as Colgate regular since the relative dentine abrasive value was nearly the same as test dentifrice [67 (test) and 70 (control) respectively]. Hence, significant increase in the mean Lightness values for the test dentifrice group could partly be attributed to these enzymes.</p><p>Limitations of the study were small sample size and habits like tobacco and areca nut usage was not accounted. Habits like tobacco and areca nut usage can have a direct effect on staining and are widely prevalent in this area. Although our study did not account for habits, the result remains valid in terms of maintenance of stain removal on a daily usage of the dentifrice whilst using these stain causing agents. In this particular geographic area where chewing areca nut is culturally acceptable, it is less likely to find subjects not having habits and but had stains on their teeth. Hence we could not warrant that subjects have not used these substances during the study period. Also, the shelf life of test dentifrice might be shorter than usual dentifrices because of papain and bromelain being proteolytic in nature. Overall, our study can be considered as a pilot study to evaluate the stain removal of this novel dentifrice and a feasibility study of digital image analysis in the assessment of stains. The results of this study can be useful to plan the needed clinical trials with large number of participants.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
