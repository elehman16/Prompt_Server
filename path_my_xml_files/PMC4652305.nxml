The findings of this study indicate that incremental AE to exhaustion induces a significant increase in serum p53 level. The augmented p53 response is consistent with other studies using high intensity RE to failure in untrained subjects Sharafi and Rahimi,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and similar responses have also been observed with acute bout of maximally activated eccentric contractions in skeletal muscle of rats.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Furthermore, regarding to p53 response in pathological and in vitro studies, it has been reported that p53 level in lymph node cancer of the prostate tumor cells was higher in the exercise serum-stimulated cells compared to control,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] similar results have also been reported in patients with colorectal cancer compared with healthy control.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Based on the findings of the current and aforementioned studies could be speculated that the increased oxidants after exercise and various oxidative related disease such as cancers lead to activation of p53 which is potentially an important mechanisms by which triggers effectors gene expression programs in order to preserve genomic intensity and cellular homeostasis including DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and ROS defense.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Since that increased oxidative stress is responsible for p53 up-regulation and previous study showed that antioxidant can inhibit induction of apoptosis.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] With this purpose in mind, CrM supplementation as antioxidant was used in order to decrease ROS generation and oxidative stress which addressed in the literature.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Results showed that p53 response to acute incremental AE to exhaustion significantly reduced after 7 days of CrM supplementation. In contrast, there was no significant change in p53 response in PL group. The decrement in p53 response due to short-term CrM supplementation may be, in part, attributed to the antioxidant properties of CrM which lead to decrease ROS levels[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] along with reduced oxidative damage to DNA as measured by 8-hydroxy-2&#x02019;-deoxyguanosine.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>The p53 decreasing mechanism following exercise to exhaustion after CrM supplementation compared to pre supplementation is unknown.

Moreover, after supplementation, IGF-1 significantly increased by 21.85% in CrM group following exercise to exhaustion. Corroborating to our finding Sharafi and Rahimi,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that plasma IGF-1 level was significantly higher in young resistance trained compared to untrained at immediately after RE while the higher level of p53 in the untrained group was observed in comparison to resistance trained group. With regards to IGF-1 role in suppression of the normal function of p53, it may be the reason for the lower level of p53 in CrM group in comparison to PL group. Based on the previous study, IGF-1 affect both induction of DNA repair and modulation of the MDM2/p19 alternate reading frame/p53 network through p38 MAPK.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the influence of short-term CrM supplementation on apoptosis biomarkers following incremental AE to exhaustion in young athletes. This study demonstrated that p53 level was significantly decreased after short-term CrM supplementation following incremental AE to exhaustion. As decreased p53 levels indicate a decrease in apoptosis and oxidative damage to DNA, these results suggest that CrM supplementation is likely to decrease the risk of oxidative damage to DNA and concomitant apoptosis. The possible mechanisms that CrM exert anti-apoptotic properties are unknown. Therefore, it is suggested that future studies evaluate the effect of short-term CrM supplementation on p53 protein level, activity, and expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies following exercise-induced oxidative stress. Based on previous and current study it could be speculated that the possible mechanism by which CrM induced decrease in p53 level may be, in part, due to anti-oxidative properties of CrM[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and may be due to increase in circulating IGF-1 level.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Further studies are necessary to determine the role of IGF-1 in regulating p53 following CrM supplementation after intense exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our findings revealed that strenuous AE lead to increasing p53 level which is the main inducing factor for mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and short-term CrM supplementation led to decline in p53 protein following incremental AE to exhaustion. CrM supplementation, which attenuated p53 protein, may lead to inhibition of p53 signaling event and subsequently promoted cell survival and protected the cell from oxidative stress. In this study, the decrease in p53 level and increase in IGF-1 level suggested that short-term CrM supplementation induced a protective effect on apoptosis, thereby; coaches and athletic trainers could utilize CrM supplementation to attenuate this process. However, additional researches regarding CrM effects&#x02019; on molecular control points of apoptosis following strenuous exercise are important.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This project is funded by the Department of Exercise Physiology, University of Guilan (80DRT, April 9, 2011).
