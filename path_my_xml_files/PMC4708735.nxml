Ten normal rats received vehicle and served as control. Four weeks later, sperm parameters, histopathological changes, testicular lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities, and apoptosis index (AI) were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results showed that ICAII treatment resulted in a significant recovery of sperm parameters and histopathological changes relative to the vehicle group (P&#x0003c;0.05). In the vehicle group, antioxidant enzyme activities and the expression of Sertoli cell Vimentin filaments obviously decreased, while lipid peroxidation and AI significantly increased as compared with the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Following ICAII treatment, corrective effects on these items towards normal levels were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results suggested that ICAII has beneficial effect on the preservation of spermatogenic function in the STZ-induced diabetic rats. The mechanisms might be related to its improvement of antioxidant enzyme activities, preservation of the protein expression and apical extensions of Vimentin filaments, and anti-apoptosis capability.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Streptozotocin (STZ)</kwd><kwd>spermatogenic dysfunction</kwd><kwd>icariside II (ICA II)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
