therapy exercise for older adults on biomechanical and physiological factors affecting
gait. [Subjects] A total of 15 subjects participated in this study and they were randomly
divided into the experimental and the control group. [Methods] Physiological variables,
leg strength, power and flexibility, and biomechanical variables, both kinematic and
kinetic, were measured before and after the aqua aerobic therapy exercise. Each subject
was instructed to walk along an elevated walkway and during the trials a trapdoor opened
at random to create a 10&#x02005;cm falling perturbation. Full body motion and kinetics was
gathered during the gait. [Results] There were significant reductions in body weight, and
body fat mass, and stride time after the perturbation. Significant increases in leg
strength corresponded to the maximum joint moment of the landing leg showing that the
subjects' ability for recovery of balance after the perturbation improved. [Conclusion] As
the results showed significant improvements in gait pattern and recovery time after
perturbed gait, we conclude that aqua aerobic therapy is an effective exercise method for
training older adults to reduce their risk of falling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Falling</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fall-related injuries are high in the developed countries, and in the US. They are recorded
as the second largest source of unintentional fatal injuries and the main source of non
fatal injuries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 2005, the National
Center of Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) of Korea reported elderly females to be more
likely than men to have injuries due to falling. In 2005, Kannus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup> found that over 80% of elderly patients were admitted to
hospital due to falls, and Roach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> report
that over 50% of these patients died within 1&#x02005;year after they were hospitalized. It is well
known that besides the acute injuries sustained, the long-term effects of hospitalization
are more serious as they can prevent the recovery of a patient's muscle strength, reducing
their ability to be self sufficient.</p><p>There are many factors that can cause falls by older adults: joint instability and muscle
imbalance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, reduction in joint range of motion, reduction in the ability to
ambulate proficiently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and deficiencies
in lower body strength<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A decreased ability to ambulate proficiently arises from
a loss of muscle mass and strength which is attributable to aging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other factors
that can also cause serious falls are medicinal side effects, and chronic diseases
associated with aging, e.g. arthritis.</p><p>Ultimately, preventing falls is better than cure, and Kavanagh<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and many researchers have concluded older adults should
participate in exercise programs to prevent falls and maintain self-sufficiency, which is
linked to a high quality life. Berg and his colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> state that older adults should participate in regular exercise to
prevent falls. It is recommended that a fall prevention exercise program should strengthen
the lower body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, rectify muscle
imbalances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, incorporate balance
exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and increase
flexibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wolf<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup> implemented Tai chi as a falling
prevention exercise program and reported that after 15 weeks of Tai chi, the frequency of
falls was reduced by 47.5%. Dayhoff<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
implemented an elastic band exercise for 14 weeks and reported an increase in the subjects'
preferred gait speed. Skeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup> had
participants perform resistance training for 10 weeks and reported that subjects' muscle
strength and gait speed both increased. However, since older adults are susceptible to
arthritis, lower range of motion and chronic diseases exercise training programs should be
carefully developed so as not to exacerbate any pre-existing problems.</p><p>Aqua aerobic exercise has been shown by many studies to be highly effective at reducing
pain for patients with arthritis and disabled populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as improving flexibility, strength, and balance
disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and has a significant
positive psychological effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that aqua therapy increases
cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, muscle strength, muscle balance and reduces the
percentage of body fat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Subject demographics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of subjects</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.86&#x000b1; 4.97</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">150.64&#x000b1;4.58</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.34&#x000b1;5.88</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.57&#x000b1;5.09</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">155.77&#x000b1;4.06</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.87&#x000b1;7.04</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Aqua therapy exercise program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Exercise Type</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time (mins)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Warm up</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">1.

was measured by whole body dual energy X-ray absoptiometry (DEXA; MA). Twenty of the
subjects had a score below &#x02212;1, and they were excluded from this study due to the high impact
nature of the forced perturbation. Twenty subjects commenced the aqua aerobic therapy
training, and they were divided randomly into two groups of 10. During the 12 weeks of aqua
therapy exercise 5 subjects dropped out leaving only 7 in the control group and 8 in the
experimental group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This study met the
required ethical standards as outlined by Harriss and Atkinson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As in Rikli and Jones study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, subjects'
flexibility, agility, balance and muscle strength were measured and recorded (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Subjects' muscle strength was measured by
a Cybex (770, New York). Both knee flexion and extension were measured at two speeds; 60&#x000b0;/s
and 180&#x000b0;/s. Muscle power was defined as the peak torque generated at a constant velocity of
180&#x000b0;/s. Similarly muscle strength was defined as the peak torque generated at a constant
velocity of 60&#x000b0;/s. Each trial lasted 5 seconds and was repeated three times with three
minutes of rest between each trial, as recommended by Rikli and Jones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The peak torque was recorded for knee flexion strength
and knee extension power, was testing was performed one week before the gait experiment.</p><p>Therefore this current study investigated the effects that an aqua exercise therapy has on
the physiological and biomechanical factors of gait. A secondary aim was to examine if
improvements in gait variables would improve older adults' responses in a perturbed gait
condition.</p><p>During gait observations, kinematics at 60&#x02005;Hz were recorded by 8 OQUS 500 cameras
(Qualisys, Sweden), and kinetics on by 2 AMTI force platforms (AMTI, USA) were recorded at
1200&#x02005;Hz by Qualisys Track Manager (QTM, Qualisys Sweden). After explanation of the testing
procedures and obtaining subjects' informed consent, the experiment began. Subjects strapped
into an overhead harness for safety. For the dynamic trials the participants walked at a
self-selected pace three times down a walkway. The participants were then escorted out of
the room while the walkway was raised and the perturbation device was set up. Next, the
participants were instructed to walk along the walkway and then step down. The participants
were informed that this step-down procedure would have to be done three times. After each
trial the participants were escorted back outside the laboratory and the perturbation device
was reset. During these final 3 trials the perturbation platform would open up randomly and
participants would fall 10&#x02005;cm during the three steps down trials. Perturbation data was
collected once for each participant as they became apprehensive of walking on the walkway
after the perturbation.</p><p>The aqua therapy exercise program was carried out three times per week for one hour in each
session (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were three main parts
to the exercise session: including warm up, aqua aerobics, and cool down. The indoor pool
was 25&#x02005;m long, 4&#x02005;m wide and 1.3&#x02005;m deep, and had a water temperature of 28&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C and a room
temperature of 26&#x000b0;C. The warm up consisted of walking. After the participants began to feel
warmer a slow aqua aerobics pace was set which was then increased steadily. The aqua therapy
consisted of aquatic adaption time, breathing techniques, floating and posturing. Equipment
were introduced to maintain the participants' enjoyment, and as each piece of equipment
could be used to train difference aspects of fitness, they were used for overall variation
and stimulus of different muscles. The cool down gave the participants time to do stretching
and have some free time. The intensity of the aqua therapy was set according to the ratings
of the Borg perceived exertion (RPE) scale set at an intensity level of 7&#x02013;11 for the first 3
weeks then the intensity was increased to 12&#x02013;13.</p><p>After labeling of the data and interpolation in QTM, the data were exported to a c3d file,
and modeling and manipulation were performed with Visual3D (C-motion, USA). A 2 &#x000d7; 2 (group &#x000d7;
time) ANOVA with repeated measures were performed to compare the data between the two groups
according to the measurement time. The significance level was set to p&#x0003c;0.05. Independent
t tests were used to verify that there were no significant differences between the control
and experimental group at the initial stage of the study. Further, significant differences
were investigated using the paired t-test to investigate the differences between pre and
post treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Participants' weight, muscle mass, fat mass and mineral mass for both the control and
experiment groups before and after the aqua aerobic therapy were measured using an InBody

variables were measured and calculated. There were no significant differences between the
experiment and control groups before and after the intervention in support time, step length
and jerk cost. There were statistical differences and interactions in stride and step times
between the groups. These results demonstrate that the experiment group participants reduced
their stride time, which shows that they recovered more quickly after the perturbation
(<xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>The kinetic variables calculated were the maximum moments of the ankles, knees and hips,
and the propulsion force of the perturbed foot after landing. There were both significant
main effects (p&#x0003c;0.05) and interaction effects (p&#x0003c;0.01) of the maximum ankle moment.
Similarly for the maximum knee moment there were both significant main (p&#x0003c;0.05) and
interaction (p&#x0003c;0.05) effects. There were no significant effects found for the maximum hip
moment and the propulsion impulse. To summarize the kinetic data, the participants in the
experiment group were able to develop more ankle and knee moment to prevent their body
falling and recover. The hip moments did not seem to affect the recovery of the participants
(<xref rid="tbl_006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The increasing risk of falls increases with aging, and the aims of this study were to
investigate whether aqua exercise therapy can help the elderly by preventing falls and
improving their gait patterns after a perturbation. It was our hypothesis that aqua exercise
training would increase the elderly participants' physical strength, flexibility, and
balance which would in turn help improve a subjects' ability to react to a perturbation. Our
results are similar to those of previous studies which have reported that 12 weeks aqua
therapy exercise improves lower body strength, power, flexibility, agility and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, due to the training effect the
weight and body fat mass was reduced, whereas no significant changes were seen in these
variables in the control group.</p><p>Kinematics and kinetics were recorded and compared to evaluate subjects' reaction to
perturbation. Our data show that the older adults of the experiment group managed the
perturbation more efficiently and had a more stable gait pattern. Oddsson and his
colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that recovery
after a perturbation takes about 3 or 4 steps depending on limb strength and age. The
present study found no significant differences in the support time, step time, step length
and jerk cost after the perturbation. However, recovery started at the second step, shown by
the significant difference in stride times between before and after the perturbation. The
maximum joint moment of the landing leg show that subjects due to an increase in strength
were able to create more ankle and knee moment which helped their quick recovery of balance
after the perturbation.</p><p>One of the main limitations of this study was the danger associated with perturbed gait,
especially with older adult subjects. Subjects with a high bone density were selected due to
the risks of perturbed gait, and they might not have been representative of the general
older adult female population, as it has been shown that exercising has a positive effect on
the bone density of older adults aged in their sixties to eighties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To conclude, aqua exercise therapy may be used as a method of training for older female
adults to prevent falls. We recommend further study of older adults' reaction to a
perturbation, includingthe measurement of EMG as well as more detailed kinematic and kinetic
data analysis of the first few steps after the perturbation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fingerhut</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>International comparative analysis of injury mortality:
