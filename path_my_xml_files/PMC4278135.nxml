Breast cancer patients experience cancer-related fatigue at some points during the treatment for breast cancer. Since cancer-related fatigue is of multifactorial origin, there are no evidence-based treatment strategies for fatigue. This study tested the effectiveness of certain pranayama techniques in reducing cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pranayama on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy as measured by cancer fatigue scale.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Center, Kasturba Hospital Manipal.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Study was a randomized controlled trial done among breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Statistical Analysis Used:</title><p>Demographic characteristics of the participants are presented as frequency and percentage.

Adjuvant radiation is used among breast cancer patients to prevent loco-regional recurrence of the tumor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Almost all breast cancer patients experience fatigue during the course of treatment and the intensity of fatigue increases during the course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. National Comprehensive Cancer Network has defined cancer-related fatigue as a &#x0201c;distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Curt <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000 reported cancer-related fatigue as very common in advanced cancers and its prevalence reported to be as high as 95% among patients with advanced cancer receiving adjuvant therapies. They identified that cancer-related fatigue is a problem before, during and after therapy, and it can continue to be a problem in cancer survivors as well. The authors also stated that fatigue can affect the activities of daily living of the people affected.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Assessment of fatigue and health status in Greek patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy has shown that approximately 13% of the women in the study experienced moderate to high levels of fatigue and fatigue increased during radiotherapy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Cancer-related fatigue has a very strong negative effect on quality-of-life (QOL) as many patients find it difficult to carry out their activities of daily living. Thus, cancer-related fatigue a problem often less understood and underdiagnosed, should be considered as an important issue to challenge during cancer and its treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Yoga and pranayama have been tried for managing cancer-related fatigue by few researchers. A pilot study done by Carson <italic>et al</italic>. observed that gentle yoga postures, and breathing exercises were effective in lowering fatigue in women with metastatic breast cancer.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Bower <italic>et al</italic>. have observed that &#x02018;Iyengar yoga&#x02019; classes resulted in statistically significant improvements in fatigue severity and vigor in breast cancer survivors.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Researchers observed that a good number of breast cancer patients admitted for radiation therapy in the setting complains of fatigue. Cancer-related fatigue is considered as an expected problem among these patients and is currently not actively diagnosed and treated. Since yoga and pranayama can be easily adopted as supportive therapies and encouraged by the results of the above-mentioned studies, this study tested the effectiveness of pranayama on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy in Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Center, Manipal.</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pranayama on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy as measured by cancer fatigue scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Breast cancer patients undergoing daily adjuvant radiation therapy for 6 weeks. Patients were of age 18 years or older and have undergone surgical treatment and chemotherapy for their breast cancer.

The cancer fatigue scale was prepared by the researchers. It had 18, 11 point scales to measure fatigue in physical and functional aspects, affective and cognitive areas. Content validity of the tool was done by giving it to three experts in the field of radiation oncology, one expert in the field of psychiatry and one expert in the field of clinical psychology and two experts in the field of nursing. Reliability of the scale was done on 20 breast cancer patients each undergoing radiation therapy in Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Center, Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, and it was found to be 0.82. Reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Pranayama</title><p>Experimental group of patients performed pranayama, morning and evening for 5 days a week for 6 weeks (from the day of starting radiotherapy until the last day of radiotherapy). Patients performed Nadi Sodhana for approximately 5 min (21-25 cycles), Sheethali for approximately 5 min (50-60 cycles) and Brahmari for approximately 8 min (10 cycles). The initial sessions on pranayama were given in the Yoga Department for 1 week. The patients performed pranayama morning and evening for the next 5 weeks in a separate room in the hospital under supervision.</p><p>In Brahmari pranayama, patients were taught to take deep inhalations and deep exhalations with a humming sound.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In Sheethali pranayama, patients were taught to draw in air slowly and deeply through a curled tongue, which is stretched out of the mouth. After the inspiration, the tongue is withdrawn and the mouth is closed, and they were asked to exhale passively through the nose. Those who had difficulty in making a curled tongue were taught to draw in air slowly and deeply through clenched teeth and exhale passively through the nose.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In Nadi Shodhana pranayama, the patients were taught the following procedure. &#x0201c;The right hand was brought to the nostrils. Left nostril was blocked completely with the ring finger and small finger of the right hand without disturbing the septum.&#x0201d; Patients were instructed to exhale through the right nostril slowly, steadily and deeply and inhale though the same side in the same way. When the inspiration was completed, the right nostril was blocked with the thumb of the right hand, and they were asked to exhale slowly and steadily through the left nostril. Once the exhalation is completed through the left nostril, patients were instructed to inhale slowly and steadily through the same nostril. Again, they were asked to slowly and steadily exhale through the right nostril. This completed one cycle of Nadi Shodhana pranayama.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>While doing pranayama, the patients were taught to sit on the floor in padamasana. Those who had difficulty sitting in padmasana were sitting in &#x0201c;ardha padmasana or sitting on a chair with the spine straight.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Treatment received by breast cancer patients</title><p>Patients who were having locally advanced breast cancer and who underwent modified radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery, followed by eight cycles of chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV d1 [cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1] 3 weekly &#x000d7; 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV 3 weekly &#x000d7; 4 cycles) were enrolled in this study.

The patients have completed several cycles of chemotherapy before starting radiation therapy. Surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments for breast cancer cause some amount of fatigue in patients.</p><p>Williams and Schreier[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have reported that all the women experienced some degree of fatigue and fatigue increased in severity during the course of chemotherapy. de Jong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported that that fatigue after completion of chemotherapy did not significantly differ from fatigue at baseline.</p><p>In Poirier's[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] study, there were 40 (52%) with no fatigue, 36 (47%) with mild fatigue and one participant with moderate fatigue at baseline before starting radiation therapy.</p><p>In Lavdaniti <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] among breast cancer patients before radiation therapy, approximately 13% of women experienced moderate to higher levels of fatigue at baseline.</p><p>Donovan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] assessed fatigue in 134 women receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy or radiotherapy only for early stage breast cancer. Fatigue severity at the start of radiotherapy among these women was statistically equivalent to their fatigue severity at the start of chemotherapy.</p><p>In this study, fatigue during the postoperative period and during and after chemotherapy was not assessed. However, the patients selected for this study have undergone surgical treatment and chemotherapy before starting with radiation therapy. The present study findings supports the findings of all the above-mentioned studies in that all the patients experienced some amount of fatigue when they came for radiation therapy. Although the breast cancer patients underwent surgery and chemotherapy before starting radiation therapy, majority of the patients had only mild fatigue at baseline before starting radiation therapy.</p><p>Goldstein <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have reported that among breast cancer patients, case rate for cancer-related fatigue was 24% (<italic>n</italic> = 51) postsurgery and 31% (<italic>n</italic> = 69) at end of treatment; it became persistent in 11% (<italic>n</italic> = 24) at 6 months and 6% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) at 12 months. Manir <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] assessed the prevalence, course and degree of fatigue in breast cancer patients on adjuvant treatments. Fifty-two patients (77%) had fatigue during radiotherapy. Prevalence increased in the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of radiotherapy and decreased subsequently.</p><p>Whelan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have reported that the patients assigned to radiation therapy experienced more fatigue than the control group.</p><p>The above-mentioned studies have shown that breast cancer patients experienced fatigue during treatment for cancer. Patients receiving radiation therapy mostly experienced increasing levels of fatigue during the course of treatment. The present study findings also show that breast cancer patients experienced fatigue during the course of radiation therapy with the exception that breast cancer patients who performed pranayama along with radiation therapy experienced less amount of fatigue.</p><p>Many studies have attempted various nonpharmcological approaches for treating cancer-related fatigue.</p><p>Danhauer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have reported that fatigue and QOL improved with restorative yoga intervention. The restorative yoga intervention included combined physical postures, breathing, and deep relaxation given for 75 min for a period of 10 weeks. Fatigue was assessed at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 2 months postintervention. Fatigue improved significantly between pre- and post-intervention. Women with breast cancer reported a higher QOL after the intervention. Although the restorative yoga intervention was not designed to provide group support, many of the participants noted the value of the social aspects of the yoga classes.</p><p>This study also found that there was a reduction in the level of fatigue experienced by the women who practiced pranayama than the women who had undergone radiation therapy only. The researchers have also noted group cohesion between the study participants and the easiness with which the participants shared and discussed their problems with each other.</p><p>Bower <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] assessed fatigue severity and vigor among breast cancer survivors with persistent posttreatment fatigue. The experimental group performed Iyengar yoga for 90 min twice a week for 12 weeks and the control group received health education for 120 min once in a week for 12 weeks. It was found that yoga resulted in statistically significant improvements in fatigue severity and vigor. These findings are consistent with the present study findings in that the group who performed yoga reported less amount of fatigue compared to the control group.</p><p>This study does not support the findings by Moadel <italic>et al</italic>. Moadel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed no significant difference in the levels of fatigue among breast cancer patients between the group who performed yoga (34.37&#x000b1; 11.26) and the waitlist control group (33.82&#x000b1; 12.97) at 3 months follow-up.</p><p>Findings, contradictory to the present study findings were observed also by Chandwani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] They assessed the effects of yoga on QOL and psychosocial outcomes in 61 women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Experimental group received yoga classes biweekly during the 6 weeks of radiotherapy. Assessment of QOL and fatigue was done before radiotherapy and then again 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to fatigue, depression or sleep scores at any observation point. Whereas in this study even though sleep improvement was not the primary outcome, majority of patients who performed yoga reported an improvement in sleep along with reduction in fatigue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although there are studies with contradicting results the authors conclude that pranayama may be utilized as an adjunct in the management of breast cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are greatly indebted to Indian Council of Medical Research for funding the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> ICMR</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>American Cancer Society</article-title><source>Global Cancer Facts and Figures</source><year>2011</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Atlanta</publisher-loc><publisher-name>American Cancer Society</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pathy</surname><given-names>NB</given-names></name><name><surname>Yip</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Taib</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Saxena</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Iau</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Breast cancer in a multi-ethnic Asian setting: Results from the Singapore-Malaysia hospital-based breast cancer registry</article-title><source>Breast</source><year>2011</year><volume>20</volume><issue>Suppl 2</issue><fpage>S75</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21316967</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Badwe</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Breast cancer: An Indian perspective</article-title><source>Natl Med J India</source><year>2011</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>193</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22208136</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nandakumar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramnath</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaturvedi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The magnitude of cancer breast in India: A summary</article-title><source>Indian J Surg Oncol</source><year>2010</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>8</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22930611</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Three - Year Reports of Population Based Cancer Registries: 2006-2008.
