The increasing use of bariatric surgery to treat obesity has rapidly gained widespread acceptance, owing in part to greater weight loss (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and effective treatment of diabetes and other cardiometabolic risk factors (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). And while bariatric surgery can cause dramatic weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), many patients lose much less weight, have significant weight regain (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or do not experience diabetes remission (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). There have been few studies to determine whether interventions such as exercise could effectively promote greater weight loss and better health outcomes following bariatric surgery. Moreover, although the amount of weekly exercise has been associated with greater weight loss (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and improvements in both insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) among non-severely obese subjects, the amount of exercise required to improve health outcomes in bariatric surgery patients is not clear.</p><p id="P6">To address this deficiency we recently performed a randomized trial to determine the potential benefit of an exercise program in participants following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We reported that an exercise program could significantly improve insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness compared to a health education control group. Although we had a 93% completion rate, there was considerable variability in the compliance and adherence to the structured exercise program. This left us with questions about the minimum or specific amount of exercise that was associated with these positive health benefits. Therefore, we conducted a post-hoc outcomes analysis of participants in our trial (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) according to their amount of objectively recorded exercise. Our overall hypothesis was that RYGB surgery patients who performed more total weekly exercise will achieve greater health benefits, including greater body fat and abdominal adipose tissue loss, better insulin sensitivity, cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Participant recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomization</title><p id="P7">RYGB participants were recruited and randomized as previously described (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

Many patients, however, do not experience robust weight loss (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), have weight regain (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and do not have diabetes resolution (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Thus adjunct therapies such as exercise post bariatric surgery could improve weight loss and other health outcomes. We recently reported that patients who were randomized to a structured exercise program following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery had significantly greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and physical fitness compared to control subjects who lost similar amounts of weight but who did not perform exercise (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). One of the limitations in that study, however, was that the wide variation in compliance to the exercise program precluded us from determining more precisely how much exercise is needed to elicit these additional health benefits.</p><p id="P29">The primary findings in the current study were that patients in the highest two tertiles of weekly exercise had greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, but only the highest tertile lost more weight, body fat and abdominal adipose tissue, as well as significantly greater cardiorespiratory fitness and enhanced mitochondrial function within skeletal muscle. Although exercise dose recommendations for achievement of health benefits exist for the general population as well as for weight maintenance in formally obese people (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the minimum amount or specific dose of exercise training needed post-RYGB to achieve additional health benefits is virtually unknown. In a systematic review, Egberts found that increased physical activity post-gastric bypass surgery is correlated with additional weight loss (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The vast majority of studies published to date, however, have relied on self-reported subjective physical activity metrics (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Few prospective structured exercise-training studies have been performed post-bariatric surgery.</p><p id="P30">One shorter-term 12-week study employing a high-volume exercise program post-gastric bypass surgery had no effect on weight loss (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the current analysis the minutes per week of exercise spanned from almost no exercise to a maximum of 729 minutes per week of a combined supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions. The low-Ex group averaged 53 minutes per week, while the middle-EX group averaged 128 and the high-EX group averaged 238. Therefore, the middle-EX group&#x02019;s minutes per week was very similar to the amount of exercise recommended to the general population, while the high-EX group&#x02019;s minutes per week was very similar to the amount of exercise previously demonstrated to be effective in a weight-matched population. Exercise intensity could also play a role in improved insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and other health outcomes. Intensity of exercise expressed as %HRmax was not different across EX: 81.7%, 78.0% and 83% for Low-EX, Middle-EX and High-EX, respectively (P&#x0003e;0.05). Although we focused this analysis on the influence of intentional structured exercise post-RYGB, we recognize the potential important role that lower doses of unstructured physical activity, or decreased sedentary time, may play in promoting health benefits. We need to understand the role of objectively measured physical activity in bariatric surgery patients. In addition, although we did not quantify energy or macronutrient intake, subjects who performed more exercise experienced greater weight and fat loss relatively soon after surgery. As exercise can affect appetite and energy intake (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and exercise and macronutrient intake can synergistically influence insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), additional studies are needed to assess the effects of physical activity on energy intake, in association with weight loss and improved health post-bariatric surgery.</p><p id="P31">Remission of type 2 diabetes and improvements in insulin sensitivity is considered a key beneficial outcome post-RYGB. In our post-hoc analysis we recapitulate previous findings that have demonstrated improvements in S<sub>I</sub> in patients post-RYGB (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); however, we go on further to investigate the potential additive improvements in S<sub>I</sub> with increasing amount of weekly exercise training. We demonstrate that 120 minutes or more per week improves both S<sub>I</sub> and D<sub>I</sub> over RYGB CON. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to hone in on a specific exercise prescription post-RYGB that provides additive improvements in both S<sub>I</sub> and D<sub>I</sub>. These observations are in agreement with not only our previously published per-protocol analysis (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), but others who found improvements in glucose tolerance after 12-weeks of exercise training post-RYGB (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although the High-EX group lost more weight and body fat, it is difficult to imagine how this relatively small additional weight loss could induce the observed improvement in insulin sensitivity, particularly since the Low-EX group who lost no additional weight had significant improvements in S<sub>I</sub>. Our results are also supported by a report by Slentz et al. (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) demonstrating that low to moderate doses of exercise robustly improves S<sub>I</sub> and D<sub>I</sub> in non-diabetic subjects. Additional studies are needed to determine the potential benefits of exercise post-RYGB on insulin sensitivity and &#x003b2;-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="P32">The weight loss induced by RYGB includes body fat as well as lean body mass. Exercise training has been shown to maintain muscle mass in the face of decreasing total body fat mass (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In our post-hoc analysis, we demonstrate a dose-dependent effect of exercise training on total weight loss, while with regards to body composition we demonstrated that only the high-EX group lost significantly more total fat mass when compared to CON, as well as a trend for less lean mass loss. The amount of weekly exercise was more strongly associated with weight loss in the second half of the intervention, suggesting that the amount of physical activity is more strongly related to weight loss over a protracted time post surgery.</p><p id="P33">The amount of weekly exercise was associated with greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>max). This finding is in agreement with our previously published data as well as other reports of improvements in fitness with exercise post-RYGB (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). More specifically, VO<sub>2</sub>max was only significantly increased in the high-EX group, indicating that the improvements documented in our previously published work (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) was truly driven by those subjects who exercise an average of ~280 minutes per week, while those who exercised and average of ~120 minutes per week or less maintained &#x02013; but did not increase - their fitness compared to control subjects who had a decline in fitness over the course of the intervention. This significant decrease in fitness could be attributed to a trend for a greater loss of lean mass. Thus, our data indicate a dose-dependent improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, suggesting a minimum exercise threshold is needed to improve VO<sub>2</sub>max in these patients.</p><p id="P34">Exercise training can have profound effects on skeletal muscle metabolism in normal weight and obese subjects (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Much less is known about whether exercise can improve skeletal muscle metabolism in severely obese subjects, particularly following bariatric surgery. Subjects with severe obesity (BMI &#x0003e; 45) seem to have a &#x0201c;obesity metabolic program&#x0201d; (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), by which there is a significant reduction in skeletal muscle fat metabolism when compared to lean subjects (BMI &#x0003c; 25). Though exact mechanisms for this diminished fat oxidation have not been elucidated, mitochondria within skeletal muscle likely play a role. Within this context it was important to determine whether skeletal muscle mitochondria could be modified in severe obesity &#x02013; either by dramatic weight loss or with the addition of structured exercise. Surgery-induced weight loss without concomitant exercise (control subjects) in our study decreased complete fatty acid oxidation by mitochondria, which was corroborated by a trend towards a decrease in maximal uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. These data support prior studies demonstrating that the reduced fat metabolism in severely obese subjects persists post weight loss (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In stark contrast, our data demonstrate a dose response of exercise training on both state 4 and state 3 respiration, as well as FCCP supported uncoupled respiration, In addition, the combined EX group demonstrated a significant decrease in incomplete palmitate oxidation within muscle tissue. These data are in agreement with Cortright et al. who reported an increase in palmitate oxidation after 10-days of exercise training in severely obese subjects (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Taken together, the data derived from muscle biopsies indicate that mitochondrial respiration is not improved by the dramatic weight loss but that exercise robustly improves mitochondrial respiration in a dose-dependent manner during surgery-induced weight loss.</p><sec id="S26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">RYGB subjects who exercise more than ~238 min/week achieve significantly greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, lose more weight and body fat, and have significantly greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and greater improvements in skeletal muscle metabolism. This study provides direct evidence supporting an important role for specific amounts of adjunct exercise to provide additional health benefits in patients following bariatric surgery.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><p>Funding: This study was supported by funding from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01DK078192, R01DK078192-02S1, BHG), and the University of Pittsburgh Clinical Translational Research Center (M01RR00056).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN3" fn-type="con"><p>TLW and BHG researched the data; contributed to study execution, interpretation of the data; and wrote the manuscript.
