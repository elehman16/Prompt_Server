There was a significant correlation between having osteoporosis and increasing age, fertility period, parity, menopausal duration, and the presence of comorbidity, especially hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]*</p><p>The findings of different studies suggest that exercise and adequate intake of calcium and Vitamin D have a significant effect on reducing the rate of bone density loss and improving bone mineral density (BMD).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Osteoporosis is preventable, and an important point in preventing the disease is to modify thinking, lifestyle, and daily habits in such a way that they improve the quality of life and efficiency of individuals.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, teaching preventive behaviors such as physical activity and correct nutrition as a simple and efficient method can help us prevent the disease and promote and maintain our health. One of the most important World Health Organization (WHO) goals is to increase the number of women trained in the area of osteoporosis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In line with such a purpose, identifying factors affecting behavior change can make changes easier. Therefore, in order to investigate factors affecting the adoption of osteoporosis preventive behaviors among women, it is essential to use models that identify factors affecting behavior. Based on Health Belief Model (HBM), people change their behavior when they understand that the disease is serious. Otherwise, they might not turn to healthy behaviors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The structures of the HBM include perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, modifying variables, cues to action, and self-efficacy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Perceived susceptibility was used to evaluate women's perception about the extent to which they are at risk of osteoporosis. Also, their perceived severity of osteoporosis complications was measured. The sum of these two factors is the women's perceived threat of the disease. The perceived benefits and barriers that refer the individual's analysis about the benefits of adopting preventive behaviors of osteoporosis such as diet and walking and about potential barriers to preventive behaviors of osteoporosis were investigated. These, alongside women's perceived ability to carry out preventive behaviors, their cues to action (the incentives that affect women within and outside the family such as friends, doctors, healthcare providers, media, and educational resources), their fear of osteoporosis complications, and their sense of inner peace as a result of seeking preventive behaviors are factors affecting women's decision to comply with preventive behaviors of osteoporosis.</p><p>Considering what said above, this study aims to measure HBM constructs regarding eating behaviors and physical activity on bone density in the prevention of osteoporosis among women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study was a quasi-experimental, prospective intervention research in 2014.

The questionnaire includes the following parts:</p><p>Thefirst part includes demographic questions, including age, body mass index (BMI), education level, marital status, occupation, times of delivery, breastfeeding, smoking, history of osteoporosis, history of osteoporosis in the family, history of a special disease (any disease other than osteoporosis, such as thyroid disease, diabetes, cancer, and immunodeficiency diseases), and history of BMD.</p><p>The second section includes questions on structures of the HBM.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Questions include: Twenty three questions on knowledge; 4 questions on perceived susceptibility (the women's opinion about chances of getting osteoporosis); 6 questions on perceived severity (about complications due to osteoporosis); 8 questions on perceived benefits (about the benefits of preventive behaviors of osteoporosis, such as physical activity and calcium intake); 7 questions on perceived barriers (including barriers to physical activity and consumption of calcium-rich foods), 4 questions on self-efficacy (including the ability to do exercises and observe proper diet); 1 question on external cues to action (resources including family and friends, doctors and health workers, mass media, books and magazines, internet and other patients with osteoporosis that encourage the subjects toward prevention behaviors of osteoporosis); and 3 questions on internal cues to action (including the fear of suffering from complications of osteoporosis and a sense of inner peace following preventive behaviors); all questions are based on the standard 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (scores of 1&#x02013;5). Scores of questions on external cues to action are calculated as cumulative frequency.</p><p>The third section consists of questions on nutritional performance and exercise, that is, walking. The performance questions consist of 10 questions about the type and amount of food consumed during the past week (score from 0 to 14). The exercise questions include 7 questions on the duration and type of walking (easy, moderate, and heavy) during the last week based on received guidelines (score from 0 to 21).

Based on the results, there were significant differences between mean scores of knowledge before, immediately after, and 6 months after intervention in the experimental group. The knowledge scores in this group increased significantly after intervention. This is consistent with results of Ghaffari <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Winzenberg <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Al Seraty and Ali Wafaa.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Although the mean score of knowledge significantly increased in the control group as well, there is a significant difference between the mean scores of knowledge for the two groups. The increase in knowledge and other constructs can be the participants&#x02019; access to information as well as their participation in the training course held by the Fasa Health Center about diseases and health issues for women and health volunteers. The increase in knowledge score in the intervention group is significant and deserves consideration.</p><p>There was a significant difference between perceived susceptibility of the two groups 6 months after intervention. This can be attributed to the effects of intervention on the subjects perceived susceptibility. In other words, after intervention, most women believed they were at risk for osteoporosis. This is consistent with results of Tussing and Chapman-Novakofski,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Doheny <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Ghaffari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>After intervention, the perceived severity of the experimental group significantly increased compared to the control group.

Azar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that the construct of perceived benefits of physical activity in the intervention group significantly increased after training, but this was not true for the control group. This is consistent with the findings of the present study. In the study by Beik on the prevention of osteoporosis among women with low socioeconomic status, perceived benefits showed a significant increase after intervention.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The increase in the perceived benefits can be the result of an emphasis in training on walking and diet, physical and psychological benefits of walking, and the role of nutrition in preventing osteoporosis.</p><p>The results of this study showed no significant difference between the two groups before intervention in terms of barriers. However, the difference was significant in immediately and 6 months after intervention for the experimental groups. In other words, the educational interventions significantly reduced barriers to proper diet and walking, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporosis. In the study of Anderson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Khorsandi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] perceived barriers of the study population regarding calcium intake and physical activity decreased after intervention.</p><p>The mean scores of self-efficacy in the present study showed that before intervention, both groups had low ability to control diet and walk. After intervention, the mean score of self-efficacy increased significantly in the experimental group. This is consistent with the results of Sedlak <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Tussing and Chapman-Novakofski,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Kaveh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Piaseu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] but is inconsistent with those of Jessup <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Wu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>External cues of action are social factors included in the HBM and refer to perceived social pressures leading to doing or not doing a behavior. These external cues alongside internal ones led the women toward osteoporosis prevention behaviors. In this study, external cues for the subjects included family, friends, doctors, and health workers. In immediately after and 6 months after intervention, external cues increased. They have an influential role as a source of information and support for eating and walking behaviors and for providing resource and guidance people need to assess bone density. The mean score for the internal cues to action significantly increased after intervention in the experimental group compared to the control.

Immediately after and 6 months after intervention, the mean performance score of the women in the intervention group significantly increased compared to controls. This shows the positive effects of the education on women's performance. Hazavehei <italic>et al</italic>. also reported an increase in walking and calcium intake in the intervention group after intervention.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study by Al Seraty and Ali Wafaa on 100 female students using the HBM, the students&#x02019; performance on calcium intake and exercise after intervention showed a significant increase compared to before.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This is consistent with Shirazi <italic>et al</italic>.'s study on the effects of physical activity education in the prevention of osteoporosis among women 40&#x02013;65 years old based on Transtheoretical Model.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The study by Tarshizi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the subjects&#x02019; physical activity levels before the training was not appropriate. However, by applying the HBM training in the experimental group, a significant difference was observed in this area.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In the study by Beik, a significant difference was reported between the level of physical activity after intervention in the experimental and control groups. This is consistent with the present study, but no significant difference was observed between the mean daily calcium and Vitamin D intake before and after training. The intake levels were unsatisfactory.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The results of this study are consistent with results of Khorsandi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Wallace,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Azar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Davoud <italic>et al</italic>.'s study showed that there was a significant increase in calcium intake in the second phase, but in the third stage (3 months after intervention) calcium intake decreased.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a study by Plawecki and Chapman-Novakofski, an 8-week, bone-health community program addressed risks/lifestyle changes within the Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action frameworks in a randomized format (treatment group <italic>n</italic> = 35; control group <italic>n</italic> = 34). Median week 1 values for calcium (control, 963 mg; treatment, 1023 mg) and vitamin D (81 IU both groups) were below recommendations, increasing throughout the program for both control (1023 mg calcium, 128 IU vitamin D) and treatment (1005 mg calcium, 122 IU vitamin D) groups.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Six months after intervention, the value of lumbar spine BMD T-score in the experimental group increased to 0.127, while in the control group it reduced to &#x02212;0.043. The value of the thigh BMD T-score in the intervention group increased to 0.125, while it decreased to &#x02212;0.028 in the control group. In a study, Huang investigated the effectiveness of an osteoporosis prevention program among women in Taiwan based on the HBM and the three factors of knowledge, self-efficacy, and social support. The results showed that in the intervention group, perceived barriers and benefits improved significantly. Self-efficacy and knowledge variables also increased because of the training program. BMD is improved in the intervention group, while it is reduced in the control group.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. showed that exercise and calcium intake improved bone density.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Jessup <italic>et al</italic>., in a research on the effects of exercise on bone density, balance, and self-efficacy in older women, showed that in the experimental group, compared to the control group, BMD in the femur and balance improved significantly.

Results of the education based on the HBM showed that people with higher mean scores on these constructs performed better in activities for the prevention of osteoporosis and had better bone density.</p><p>The limitations related to this research include its sampling method. Simple random sampling is selecting research participants on the basis of being accessible to the researcher. Another concern about such data centers on whether subjects can accurately recall past behaviors. Cognitive psychologists have warned that the human memory is fallible, and thus the reliability of self-reported data is tenuous on some items.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The exercise questions only related to walking, which may not have a big impact on bone density.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of this study, the importance of ongoing investigations, epidemiology and education about osteoporosis in women reveal that policy makers should consider health-related field as a priority. The results of this study showed that health can enhance the knowledge, perceived susceptibility, understanding the risks of disease, and interests and obstacles to the proper conduct of the preventive role. Most importantly, but it seems to change behavior, especially long-term behaviors and the behaviors that socioeconomic factors are interdependent, and failure. To sort these issues, should also be considered.</p><p>It can be concluded from the results of this study that providing educational programs in this regard for family members, physicians, and other health personnel and offering training programs in radio and television broadcasting is essential. Further studies should have more comprehensive interventions on the structures of calcium intake benefits and barriers and use other behavioral change theories. It is advised that researchers explain social and behavioral barriers in calcium intake in different cultural contexts.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stubbs</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Osteoporosis and falls: Some further considerations for the nursing profession</article-title><source>Br J Nurs</source><year>2010</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>1431</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21139526</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adachi</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Adami</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gehlbach</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>FA</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Boonen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chapurlat</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Impact of prevalent fractures on quality of life: Baseline results from the global longitudinal study of osteoporosis in women</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc</source><year>2010</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>806</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20634496</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shirazi</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Niknami</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hidarnia</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Torkaman</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilchrist</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A home-based, transtheoretical change model designed strength training intervention to increase exercise to prevent osteoporosis in Iranian women aged 40-65 years: A randomized controlled trial</article-title><source>Health Educ Res</source><year>2007</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>305</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16928779</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boot</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>de Ridder</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Pols</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Krenning</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name><name><surname>de Muinck Keizer-Schrama</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bone mineral Density in children and adolescents: Relation to puberty, calcium intake, and physical activity</article-title><source>J Clin Endocrinol Metab</source><year>2008</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8989233</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Prevention Disease Office, Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
