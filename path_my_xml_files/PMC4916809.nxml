The intercristal line or Tuffier line is an imaginary line joining superior aspect of iliac crest which is known to cross the L4 vertebra or L4-L5 intervertebral disc. This is an important surface landmark to select intervertebral space (IVS) for neuraxial block. In adults, conus medullaris ends at the lower border of L1 verterbra. Since there are variability in position of termination of conus medullaris, selecting lowermost space becomes crucial for practicing safe neuraxial anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The most common method of selecting IVS is palpation method which is based on identification of Tuffier line. Palpation method is shown to be least reliable method with accuracy rate being as low as 29%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the recent years, ultrasonography (USG) has been extensively evaluated for practicing safe neuraxial anesthesia. It is a simple, less time consuming, noninvasive, and easy to learn technology.</p><p>Hence in this study, ultrasound is used to evaluate the accuracy of palpation method to estimate the level of the IVS. In addition to that the effect of demographic parameters, patient positioning and anesthesiologists experience were also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This observational single arm study was approved by the Hospital Ethics and Research Committee (Ref no. ECR/215/Inst/Ker/2013) and registered with Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI/2014/09/005035). One hundred and nine patients undergoing procedures under spinal anesthesia were recruited in this study. Patients aged between 18 and 60 years undergoing lower abdominal or lower limb surgeries were included in this study and written informed consent was taken. Pregnant patients, severely obese patients with body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, spine deformity, or patients who were unable to position themselves for spinal anesthesia were excluded from the study. Patients with poor imaging quality were also excluded from the analysis. Resident anesthesiologist undergoing anesthesia training with minimum 1 year of experience was taken in the trainee group. All consultant anesthesiologists with minimum 5 years of anesthesia experience were taken in consultant group. Two consultant anesthesiologists having more than 5 years of experience in neuraxial ultrasound were allotted to perform the ultrasound assessment throughout the study. They were kept blinded about the marked IVS. Inside of the operation theater, patient was positioned either in sitting or lateral position. An anesthesiologist palpates, marks the chosen interspace, defines the level, and keeps this level in secret. Another anesthesiologist scans with ultrasound the marked interspace and provides his definition of level. Later the levels estimated by palpation and identified by ultrasound are confronted in search for agreement or disagreement. The ultrasound assessment was done using GE Healthcare Venue 40 software and curved array low frequency probe of 2-5 MHz, basing in parasagittal oblique view. Sacrum was taken as a reference landmark, which appears as a horizontal hyperechogenic line [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Probe was then moved in cephalad direction to assess IVS. The hyperechogenic pattern corresponding to the laminae of vertebra while hypoechogenic shadow corresponding IVS forms a saw tooth like pattern [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. For accurate counting of interspace, each space corresponding to the center of probe was marked on skin. After ultrasound assessment, neuraxial block was performed in a space unrelated to the studied space in routine manner and surgery was continued. Anesthesiologists were not given immediate feedback of the assessment to avoid self-improvement. On an average, every anesthesiologist marked IVS in maximum 4 patients.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Hyperechogenic line corresponding to sacrum and L5-S junction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-270-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Laminae of vertebrae</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-270-g002"/></fig><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess under ultrasonographic control the accuracy of palpation method to identify lumbar IVS.

The results showed that the inaccuracy of the palpation method was neither due to demographic reason nor to the patient positioning in sitting or in lateral. They also showed that the accuracy or inaccuracy depended on the anesthesiologist's experience.</p><p>The accuracy of palpation method to assess IVS is shown to be in between 29% and 64%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Our findings are consistent with the finding of Schlotterbeck <italic>et al</italic>. who observed the accuracy of palpation method to be 36.4% in pregnant patients. The gold standard techniques to assess IVS are computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, and fluroscopy. However, the limitations of these techniques (CT, MRI) are patient's need to lie in supine unflexed position and risk of radiation. In clinical practice, the IVS is palpated after the patient is positioned appropriately by flexing hip and neck. Hence these methods (CT, MRI) can lead to bias when the accuracy is compared with palpation. The advantage of ultrasound technique is being a bedside technique and the assessment can be done in the same flexed position given for spinal anesthesia. Hence, the bias of displacement of marker as seen with CT and MRI can be eliminated. The accuracy of ultrasound assessment when compared to other various techniques has been reported as 68-76% but with appropriate training and experience it can enhanced up to 90%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The ultrasound estimation usually differs from CT and MRI by one space unlike in palpation where errors can be up to 4 spaces. Identifying interspinous spaces is reported to be relatively easier than estimating epidural depth and optimal needle insertion point.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Relevant anatomical structures for lumbar puncture can be identified quickly in emergency setting.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hence, spinal ultrasound can form an important tool for practicing safe neuraxial anesthesia and for assessment of accuracy of the palpation method in this study.</p><p>In our study, patient positioning has not improved accuracy. Theoretically sitting position should improve the accuracy. In sitting position, it is easier to eliminate the effect of lumbar lordosis. It is easy to determine the intercristal line in this position as it gives good grip by palpating both iliac crests. The distribution of body weight is even in sitting position as compared to lateral position where patient is lying on uneven surface. In lateral position, the axis of pelvic brim is deviated from spine resulting in the variation in the position of Tuffiers line while sitting position helps better to widen the lumbar interspaces and thus pushes Tuffiers line caudally to cross L4-L5 space.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Larysa and Broadbent demonstrated no difference in sitting and lateral position. In Larysa <italic>et al</italic>. study, majority of cases were done in sitting position (89%) and they studied exclusively L3-L4 IVS (76%). While Broadbent has compared palpation assessment with MRI which requires patient to lie down in supine unflexed position which in turn could have caused bias. Ours is the first kind of study where ultrasonographic assessment was carried out for each lumbar IVS with an aim to see impact of patient positioning and experience of anesthesiologist's hand.</p><p>In our study, anesthesiologist's experience has improved accuracy. These findings were consistent with Larisa <italic>et al</italic>. who noticed accuracy improves significantly with experienced anesthesiologist's with professional experience of 10 years. Broadbent, Schlotterbeck and Whitty <italic>et al</italic>. reported that accuracy is unaffected by level of experience. However in all of these studies, the years of anesthesia experience studied varied widely. As per Broadbent <italic>et al</italic>., the experience may not improve the accuracy as there is no element for self-correction in the professional training because of lack of radiographic confirmation. Even in experienced hand, errors have occurred 3-4 spaces above the space they believed in and it was a common finding in our study also. This highlights the need of the ultrasound as a modality to confirm IVS for every anesthesiologist's irrespective of years of experience.</p><p>There is difference in the opinion about the space corresponding the intercristal line. As per traditional teaching, the intercristal line crosses the body of L4 or the L4-L5 interspace. This forms an important landmark while giving spinal anesthesia. However, this landmark is shown to be influenced by age, sex, pregnancy, height, BMI of the patient as well as imaging methods used to identify the space.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In pregnant patients, it shown to vary in range of L1-L2 to L4-L5 spinal segments while in tall males it crosses L2-L3 spaces. The position of conus medullaris varies from T12-upper to L3-upper segments and elderly females tend to have low conus. Use of atraumatic spinal needle is not completely risk free. The position of cones medullaris in relation to vertebral column does not change after spinal flexion and hence does not offer any protection against spinal cord damage.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we have not evaluated for lumbosacral anomaly (lumbarization of sacrum and sacralization of lumbar vertebra). The incidence of these anomalies is around 6% and can be easily missed by ultrasound.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Spine radiograph combined with MRI is a gold standard technique to diagnose and to count lumbosacral vertebral anomalies. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that despite the transitional vertebrae there seems to be margin of safety of two IVS and these authors consider that counting up from lumbosacral junction is fairly valid approach to select the interspace for spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Although neurological complications with spinal anesthesia is rare, but there are some disturbing evidence of grievous spinal injury and likely medico legal malpractice. In addition to liberal attitude of anesthesiologist for selecting lumbar IVS, use of atraumatic spinal needle has been cited as a cause of damage to spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It is not uncommon to anesthesiologist to select most easily palpated lumbar interspace to improve the success rate. Anesthesiologist may tempt to prefer L2-L3 space in order to reduce the dose of spinal anesthetic drug but in this space if more cephalad needle is directed more likely are the chances of needle trauma.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Greaves reported a case of serious spinal injury caused by misidentification of the L2-L3 IVS in a patient receiving heparin.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Atraumatic needles (pencil point) carries more risk as free flow of cerebrospinal fluid comes after needle is well advanced in the subarachnoid space.</p><p>Major drawback with ultrasound is inability to visualize conus medullaris and hence its routine use during spinal anesthesia to improve safety is questionable. Use of MRI, fluoroscopy before spinal anesthesia is deemed unnecessary. Hence, the skill to locate IVS and upmost care to perform lumbar puncture remains most important safety measure.</p><p>The limitation of this study is exclusion of high risk population such as severely obese and pregnant patients. The reason we excluded these patients is that obesity would have impaired the quality of ultrasound images and pregnant patients would experience discomfort during forced flexion. However, it is still noteworthy that accuracy is not improved in normal population even in experienced hand. Hence, ultrasound may be used as a safeguard to prevent dural puncture being performed at misidentified dangerous high level. Future studies are required to study if the use of USG can reduce the neuraxial damage caused by spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The accuracy of palpation method when controlled by ultrasound is &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; and differs by 1-3 IVS particularly in cephalad direction.
