Constipation is classified as functional and organic<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Functional constipation accounts for 95% of children with chronic constipation while only 5% have an organic cause for their symptoms<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Chronic functional constipation (CFC) is defined as a delay in defecation with less than three times per week existing for more than two weeks and being associated with stool withholding behavior. It is also associated with painful defecation, without underlying anatomic or medical etiologies. Thus, CFC is also called idiopathic. Treatment includes primary stool evacuation, toilet training, high fiber diet and laxative administration<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Children usually are treated with a combination of toilet training, running a bowel diary, and oral laxatives. In many patients, this does not provide effective improvement, so newer treatment is required<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The early difficulty with defecation that causes pain, fear, and refusal to use toilet, often progresses to the formation of vicious cycles of increasing fecal retention and the rectum increases in capacity, then the experience of passing large, hard stools is repeated. There is increasing distress as overflow fecal incontinence compounds the problem for the older child<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Surgical treatment has been used in children&#x02019;s refractory constipation treatment. However, surgical methods are often regarded to be traumatic. Topical muscle relaxants have been used in recent decades. The evolution began with nitrates, which were helpful in adult chronic fissure. Botulinum toxin A, a widely applicable acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitor that causes clinically reversible muscle paralysis, is now a popular drug for treating many conditions associated with smooth or skeletal muscle dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Transcutaneous needle-free injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter is a novel and safe new treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and anal fissure in children<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of intra sphincteric injection of botox in the treatment of children with refractory constipation referred to our center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This was a prospective case control study which was done in Children&#x02019;s Medical Center in Tehran University of Sciences.</p><p>All children who suffered from chronic constipation for more than three months, and who had not responded to medical treatment, were referred to pediatric surgical clinic for interventions by pediatric gastroenterologist. Perineal examination in the first step provided that they did not have macroscopic anatomical abnormalities. In case of accompanying diseases or abnormal anus and perineum, and children with transition zone in barium enema were excluded from the study. Also, manometry and rectal biopsy was performed in all children. Those with ganglion cells in their rectal biopsy and who had high threshold recto anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) or absent RAIR in manometry, entered the study.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into cases and control group. The control group received no injection and were treated exclusively with stool softeners. The case group received botulinum toxin injection in addition to this therapy. botox injection was carried out under general anesthesia in three regions of the anal sphincter in lithotomy position. The botulinum toxin Dysport was injected in sphincter in 3, 6 and 9 o&#x02019;clock. It was not injected in 12 o&#x02019;clock to avoid the possibility of urinary incontinence. Total Dysport dosis was 160 units, half of it (i.e. 80 units) was injected in 6 o&#x02019;clock and one-fourth (i.e. 40 U) in 3 o&#x02019;clock and one-fourth in 9 o&#x02019;clock, Injection was done simultaneously in both internal and external anal sphincters.</p><p>In the first month after injection, all patients were evaluated once a week and were investigated regarding the improvement or recurrence of symptoms and followed up monthly in the first six months. The response to botox injection six months after injection was compared with the control group.</p><p>For evaluation of the patients&#x02019; condition after the botox injection, patients were asked questions about the presence of the signs of constipation including painful defecation, vomiting, stool&#x02019;s consistency, soiling and defecation intervals.</p><p>The sample size based on statistical calculations is 88 patients (44 cases and 44 controls).

Toxin botulinum interferes with acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction in anal sphincter after injection<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. By this mechanism, it produces a chemical denervation of sphincter<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. Therefore intra sphincteric botulinum toxin injection by inhibition of neural stimulation to sphincter can induce a chemical myectomy and it may be useful in treatment of IASA<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and chronic idiopathic constipation<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In one study, toxin botulinum injection in internal anal sphincter had definite effect in improvement of patients who had obstruction or constipation after pull through for treatment of Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease. In these patients, residual aganglionosis and anastomotic stricture were ruled out by rectal biopsy and barium enema and physical examination<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In another study injection of botulinum toxin had a transient effect in treatment of most children with anismus and in some patients it showed a long term effect<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In this study painful defecation existed in 88% of patients before toxin botulinum injection and it was reduced to 15% after toxin botulinum injection and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001).</p><p>Moreover, Stool condensation existed in 80% of these patients before toxin botulinum injection, it was reduced to 28% after toxin botulinum injection, the difference is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). Soiling existed in 62% of patients before botox injection and was reduced to 8% after botox injection. In the control group it reduced from 62% to 42.5% after medical treatment and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). Defection interval more than 3 days existed in 100% of patients before botox injection and it was reduced to 15% after botox which is also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). In the control group, 98% had defection intervals more than 3 days and it remained the same after medical treatment. In average defecation interval before botox injection was 9.1 days and after botox injection was reduced to 2.6 days which is also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Injectio of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter is an effective and safe new treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We hereby thank Dr. Najafi, the head of gastroenterology division of Children&#x02019;s Medical Center.
