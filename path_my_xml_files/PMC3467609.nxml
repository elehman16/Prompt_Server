The prevalence of CHF is increasing throughout the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> In Europe, the prevalence of CHF is between 2% and 3%; in the elderly patients it is estimated to reach more than 10%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Interestingly, CHF is responsible for more hospitalisations than all forms of cancer combined and it is the leading cause of hospitalisation in the elderly patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In-hospital death rate is excessive and the readmission rate is very high. Overall 50% of patients die within 4&#x02005;years; 40% of patients admitted to hospital with CHF die or are readmitted within 1&#x02005;year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Frequent hospitalisations, along with other direct and indirect costs, place an enormous financial burden on healthcare systems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> CHF accounts for approximately 2% of the national expenditure on healthcare in the EU countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Same, CHF represents a major burden for most Baltic Sea Region countries with a clear need for better home care of CHF patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>Therapies targeted at improving outcomes in CHF have been well studied over the past two decades; new therapy possibilities has been leading to an improvement of survival rates as well as a decrease in morbidity, mostly associated to ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), &#x003b2;-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists availability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> However, despite advances in pharmacological therapies, the outlook remains poor.</p><p>Previous studies on traditional telemonitoring of CHF patients have determined that telemonitoring has the potential to reduce mortality, hospitalisations and costs as well as improve quality of life, self-care and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10 R11">8&#x02013;11</xref> However, the results of telemonitoring trials have been inconsistent due to diverse study interventions and common variations in the study designs. The findings also suggest that tele-education (TE) programmes give merit for CHF patients by reducing number of hospital stays, optimising medical therapy, improving quality of life and reducing mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Furthermore, the potential for telemedicine (TM) and e-health is particularly promising for most cardiovascular patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Rationale</title><p>CHF is a chronic condition where appropriate disease management is critical.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Effective disease management requires the patient to take an active role in his/her health. Indeed, CHF is a disease where patient empowerment is very important. Unfortunately, many CHF patients do not successfully manage their disease; therefore rehospitalisation and high death rates prevail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref> Frequent communication between patient and healthcare professionals, intensive education programmes, and home health monitoring can help reduce hospitalisations and death rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Despite the dismal prognosis, there are several examples of CHF patients living beyond the years normally expected.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> These successes are usually attributed to patients taking an active role in disease management, facilitated by appropriate diet, exercise, daily self-measurement (eg, weight scales and blood pressure (BP) devices), medication compliance, smoking and other behaviour control and education on recognition of disease-related symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> However, TM and TE interventions must be examined critically by using rigorous methodology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>This study addresses a significant knowledge gap by applying quasi-experimental clinical trial methodology to determine the effect of a TM and TE interventions on health outcomes after patient discharge to home.</p></sec><sec><title>Rigour and limitations</title><p>Limitations of our study protocol can be seen in use of a quasi-experimental rather than a randomised controlled trial design. This can lead to the internal validity bias including bias mostly related to a sample selection by concurrent allocation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The control strategies should help to minimise these potential biases. Study sample will be generated from the list of patients recently diagnosed with CHF. Allocation to the groups will be based on matching by age, sex, education level and NYHA class&#x02014;it should ensure clinical and socio-demographic comparability of study and control groups. Thus, bias related to sample selection and allocation will be addressed in part because the patient sample will include only eligible patient population. We will include adjustments in the data analysis, for example, bootstrapping can be used.</p><p>Strengths of this study protocol include the fact that we are seeking to find the way for better home care model in CHF patient care. Current standard of care is associated to high rehospitalisation and death rates. We hope that this study, aiming to analyse home care practice change by introduction of TM and TE facilities will facilitate improvements in home care quality. We also hope that the practice change will lead to more cost-effective use of healthcare resources.</p><p>Our proposed practice change is based on translational research with empirically supported interventions. It can help to find the most effective and to patient needs oriented home care model.</p><p>By this study it is expected to evaluate the feasibility of TM and distance learning applications for CHF patients after hospital discharge. This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of TM and distance learning applications to improve disease patterns and quality of life compared to current standard of care.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Other information</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study has been approved by National Bioethics Committee (2011-03-07; BE-2-11).</p><p>Patient will get all necessary information about the study and they will be asked to sign informed consent form adopted from templates developed by the WHO ERC.
