Cancer therapy or the cancer itself may cause changes in the body chemistry that results in loss of appetite, pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and very common mucositis which makes eating difficult. Loss of appetite is followed by an undesirable loss of weight due to insufficient amount of calories every day which can lead to loss of muscle mass and strength and other complications by causing interruptions of medical therapy, impeding effective cancer therapy. Mucositis cause decreased immunity and quality of life as well as poor tolerance to surgery and altered efficacy of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy. The present study is designed with the objective to minimize the radiation induced mucositis, skin reaction, xerostomia, change in voice etc. with an Ayurvedic preparation <italic>Yashtimadhu Ghrita</italic> (processed ghee). Total 75 patients were randomly divided into four groups and drugs were administered: Group A with local application of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> powder and honey in the oral cavity for few minutes prior to radiotherapy along with oral intake of <italic>Yashtimadhu Ghrita</italic>; Group B with only local application of the <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> powder and honey in the oral cavity; Group C patients administered with only local application of honey in the oral cavity; Group D on conventional modern medication controlled group. All these patients under four groups had received Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for maximum duration of 7 weeks. Mucositis and Skin reactions were observed in 100% of patients with varying degree. The intensity of Radiation and Chemotherapy induced mucositis was reduced to a great extent by the trial drug. <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) can be used effectively in prevention and treatment of oral mucositis post radiation and chemotheraphy in patients of cancer, especially of the head and neck region. It proves beneficial in two ways: (i) there were no interruptions in the treatment, and (ii) food intake was not severely affected leading to maintenance of nutritional status of the patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Head and neck cancer</kwd><kwd>oral mucositis</kwd><kwd>radio-chemotherapy</kwd><kwd><italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> ghrita</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, commonest in India, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. In India, head and neck carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] (HNCA) account for 30-40% cancers at all sites, out of which 9.4% are oral cancers. It is the sixth common cause of death in males and seventh in females. In North-east India, incidence of tobacco related oral cancers is about 33%. The morbidity and mortality associated with this disease is a cause of major concern in this region. Many factors implicated for its preference are consumption of tobacco in its various forms, alcohol, smoking habits, poor oral hygiene, lack of awareness, and lack of proper nutrition. No complication of cancer treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] is more acutely distressing than stomatitis. The oral cavity, normally a delicately balanced and exquisitely sensitive portal, can become a site of extreme discomfort. Stomatitis, or oral mucositis, is defined as the inflammation of the oral mucous membranes. Such inflammation affects one's sense of taste and smell, as well as nutrition and hydration, and may well reduce the palatability of oral medications. Oral Mucositis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] occurs in 15-40% of patients receiving standard chemotherapy and 100% of patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer are afflicted with oral mucositis of varying degree. Currently, the world wide population with mucositis is estimated at 400,000 to 600,000 receiving chemotherapy or radiation. Ionizing radiation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] causes various changes in normal tissues, depending on closely interrelated factors of total dose, fractionation schedule (daily dose and time), and Volume treated.</p><p>In Ayurvedic classics like <italic>Charaka samhita</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and <italic>Sushruta samhita</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] cancer is described as <italic>Arbuda</italic> (major neoplasm) or <italic>Granthi</italic> (minor neoplasm) and <italic>Tridoshaja/Sannipataja</italic> varieties of as the malignant stage of neoplasms or abnormal growths have been described. <italic>Ayurveda</italic> can be helpful in the management of cancer in many ways, as prophylactic, palliative, curative and, supportive and undoubtedly it helps to improve the quality of life (QOL),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] as an adjuvant therapy along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and post surgery care, to minimize the side effects of these therapies. Although the adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy cannot be totally avoided, there are ways to minimize the side effects of these treatment procedures. Therefore, an attempt has been made to minimize the radiation induced mucositis, skin reaction, xerostomia, change in voice etc with an Ayurvedic <italic>Ghrita</italic> preparation i. e. <italic>Yashtimadhu Ghrita</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Also, we have tried to assess the efficacy of the prepared drug in the healing or protection of the above said side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of patients</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients between 30-60 years attending the Radiotherapy Department of Guru Govind Singh Hospital, Meghji Pethraj Shah Medical College, Jamnagar with histopathologically proven head and neck malignancies, and who had not initially been treated by Radiotherapy, and were selected for administering Radiation Volume between 100 cm<sup>2</sup> to 170 cm<sup>2</sup> subject to hemoglobin concentration &#x02265;9% and Serum protein within normal limits, were included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Those patients who were on palliative course of treatment, who had taken Radiotherapy earlier, were below 30 years and above 60 years of age with history of Hypertension, Cardiac Ailments, Diabetes and those allergic to Platins&#x02019;, were excluded from the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Drug collection and authentication</title><p><italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> roots were collected from a dealer in Ahmadabad.

Though detailed principle of management is narrated in ancient classics, practically it is the modern approached of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy that are modalities administered to the patients. Maximum patients were 50 years of age and above, which is considered as <italic>Praudhavastha</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>, i. e. late adult hood; and, cancer in contemporary science is considered as an old age disease. Gender predilection was towards male dominancy (85.33%) in head and neck cancer prevalence rate in our study. There was statistically a marked reduction in the appearance and severity of mucositis in group A when compared to group D in the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of radiotherapy, which is highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The same significance is seen in the last week of radiotherapy and chemotherapy i. e. grade III mucositis which was comparatively less in group A than in group D. In group B, the results on mucositis as compared to group D are not significant in the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of radiation therapy (P &#x0003e; 0.1); however, in the 7<sup>th</sup> week the results are statistically highly significant i. e. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. In group C, the statistical analysis reveals that in both the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> week of treatment schedule, the results on mucositis in comparison to group D are insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1).</p><p>The trial drug of group A <italic>Yashtimadhu ghrita</italic> orally and <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> powder with honey locally had insignificant result (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1) in skin reactions in both initial stage and in final week of the treatment when compared to the control group D. In group B the trial drug had highly significant results (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in both 2<sup>nd</sup> week and 7<sup>th</sup> week of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The skin reactions were of low grade in comparison to skin reaction in comparison to patients of control group D. These changes that occurred with the treatment may be due to the <italic>Varnya</italic> properties (which bestows good complexion) of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> powder. Xerostomia symptoms were persistent in all the groups and <italic>Yashtimadhu ghrita</italic> has shown no effect on this particular side effect. The intensity of change in voice was gradually increasing as the treatment progressed. In group A the effect on change in voice was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1) in 2<sup>nd</sup> as well as in 7<sup>th</sup> week but the result was surprisingly highly significant in study group B in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> week (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) while in group C the therapy had insignificant results on both initial and final week of therapy (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1). The change in voice has a statistically significant result in group B which may be due the <italic>Swarya</italic> (promoting good voice) property of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> powder. The results are substantially good in comparison to control group D.</p><p>Though the hemoglobin percentage (Hb%) did not rise in group A, it was maintained within normal limits which is quite appreciable in the pretext of the disease condition and the invasive treatments of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It also cannot be ruled out that the trial formulation was ineffective in increasing Hb% level since duration of treatment was for 7 weeks which is not sufficient enough to expect any significant rise in hemoglobin level. In study group B and C, the Hb% and total leukocyte levels (TLC) did not show any significance statistically but in both the groups it's within normal limits the levels were maintained within normal limits. Similarly renal function was also within normal limits in all the study groups (A, B and C) revealing that <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> is not nephrotoxic since the chemotherapeutic drug administered in these patients is Cisplatin and the incidence of renal insufficiency is about 5% with adequate hydration measures and 25% to 45% without hydration measures.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Probable mode of action</title><p><italic>Yashtimadhu ghrita</italic> showed encouraging results in minimizing the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] has <italic>madhura rasa, sheeta virya, madhura vipaka</italic>.

<italic>ghrita</italic>, which proved beneficial in two ways: (i) there were no interruptions in the treatment, and (ii) food intake was not severely affected leading to maintenance of nutritional status of the patients. Higher prevalence of male sex is evident, probably due to the addiction to smoking of bidis and tobacco chewing which contribute as carcinogens, and thus increase the risk of such malignancies in males in comparison to the opposite gender. The side effects were more visible in <italic>Pitta</italic> dominant <italic>prakriti</italic> (body constitution), which can be understood in the line of <italic>gunas</italic> (properties) (<italic>Ushna</italic> and <italic>Tikshna</italic>) of both the invasive treatments, i. e. RT and CT since radiation may be compared to <italic>Agni</italic> and chemotherapy to <italic>Visha aushadhi</italic>. The hematological levels were maintained within normal limits&#x02019; and the drug had no adverse effect on kidneys, which helped in timely administration of chemotherapy thereby preventing any delay in the scheduled doses. Xerostomia symptoms were persistent and the trial drug caused no improvement on this particular side effect. There were no side effects of the trial drug in all the study groups and it was well tolerated by the patients throughout the study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><date-in-citation>Last cited on 2010 Mar 9</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
