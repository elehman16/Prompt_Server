The teeth most involved include maxillary central, lateral incisors and first primary molars in both jaws.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Maxillary primary incisors are usually extremely involved (deep decay extends to the pulp) and in some cases can lead to complete loss of coronal structure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the past, the extraction of these teeth was the only treatment option. The early loss of these teeth leads to an abnormal position of the tongue, reduction of bite force, mastication problems, speech disorders, psychological problems due to esthetic concerns, reduction of facial vertical height and mouth breathing habit.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Extensive restorative treatments of anterior primary teeth have always been a big challenge in pediatric dentistry. The restoration of these teeth is difficult due to the small size of the crown, relatively large pulp chamber and the age of the child. Lack of strength of restorations and consequently their fracture are often associated with inadequate remaining sound tooth structure.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In addition to preserving the tooth structure and reconstructing the primary form, considering the beauty and use of composite resins are highly regarded in anterior teeth. Meanwhile, the use of composite restorations for primary teeth harbors some problems due to structural differences between primary and permanent teeth such as less available dentin for bonding.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In severe decayed incisors where pulpectomy is carried out, intracanal retention is necessary for durability of the composite crown.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Several types of posts are available to use in pediatric dentistry such as prefabricated posts,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] orthodontic wires in &#x0201c;&#x003b1;&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;&#x003b3;&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and &#x0201c;&#x003a9;&#x0201d; form,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] cast post with macro retentive element,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reverse metallic post,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] composite resin posts,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] fiber posts[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and biologic posts.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, many non-metallic prefabricated posts have been introduced such as fiber based posts with excellent properties like the biocompatibility with different core materials, fatigue and corrosion resistance and high tensile strength, which are considered as a substitute for metallic prefabricated posts.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Currently, the available fiber-based posts consist of fibers of carbon or silica surrounded by a matrix of polymer resin. The silica-fiber posts, being translucent and more tooth colored, are also called glass-fiber and quartz-fiber.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Fiber reinforced composite posts are available in both prefabricated and customized forms.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Despite numerous clinical reports on primary teeth restoration,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] there is not enough information about the physical and mechanical properties of post-supported restorations, especially fiber posts. Furthermore, no study has been conducted on customized quartz fiber posts so far. The aim of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to evaluate and compare the fracture resistance of three types of post, including composite resin, customized quartz fiber and prefabricated glass fiber.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty extracted maxillary anterior primary teeth with intact roots were selected for this study. The teeth were cleaned and stored in 0.5% chloramine-T solution for 1 week and thereafter stored in distilled water at 4&#x000b0;C until use. The teeth were sectioned horizontally 1 mm above the cement-enamel junction with a diamond bur in a high-speed hand piece, and the root canals were prepared to size 45 by k-files (Mani, Japan) 1 mm short of the apex. Then, the root canals were dried using paper points and filled with calcium hydroxide paste with iodoform (Metapex, META BIOMED Co. Ltd, Korea). After removing 4 mm of Metapex from the coronal part of canals, the orifices were covered with 1 mm light cured Dycal Lime-Lite (Pulpdent Co, MA USA) and cured by light-emitting diode (LED) (Radii, SDI co) for 40 s to leave 3 mm space for posts.</p><p>Then, the teeth were randomly divided into three groups using block randomization. Afterwards, each sample received a code, including the group and the number of sample. Due to the effect of the bonded surface on the samples&#x02019; fracture resistance, photographs were taken from the samples from the same distance with the scale on the picture [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Then, the bonded cross-sectional area of each tooth was calculated using two methods by Autocad 2012 English software [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. In the first method:</p><p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The bonded cross-sectional surface (total area of the tooth cross section minus the canal cross section) was calculated precisely, and in the second method.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which is a simpler technique, the inscribed rectangle area on the outer surface of the tooth was calculated.</p></list-item></list>

After performing the above steps, the following steps were performed in each group. (It should be noted that all times were in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group 1 (Customized quartz fiber post)</title><p>To prepare this type of post, three units quartz fiber reinforced pontics substructure (RTD co, France) were used. These Pontics were cut with a disc in lengths of 5 mm and were formed with a diamond bur to conform to the canal. Following irrigation, the post space was lightly dried. Dual-cured cement (Embrace WetBond Resin Cement, pulpdent Co., USA) was placed into the canal, and the post was seated. The excess cement was removed and cured with LED for 40 s.</p><p>The tooth was etched with etching gel (Scotchbond&#x02122; Etchant, 3M ESPE, MN, USA) for 15 s and rinsed for 10 s. Then, two consecutive coats of light cured bonding agent (Adper Single Bond, 3M ESPE, MN, USA) were applied on the etched surface, uniformly dispersed by a compressed air blast for 2-5 s and cured for 10 s. Finally, the teeth were incrementally restored with composite resin Filtek Z250 (3M ESPE, USA) and each 2 mm was cured for 20 s and 4 mm crown was formed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Group 2 (Composite resin post)</title><p>Acid was applied on the rinsed and dried tooth and intracanal area for 15 s.

The composite was condensed into the canal and placed incrementally to restore the crown with 4 mm height.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Group 3 (Prefabricated glass fiber post)</title><p>Proper lengths (5 mm) of glass fiber post (Reforpost, Angelus, Brazil) with a diameter of 1.1 mm were cut with a diamond bur using a high-speed hand piece under copious water cooling and were cleaned with alcohol. After irrigation of the post space, it was lightly dried, and the dual-cured cement and the post were placed in the canal. The excess cement was removed, and the cement was cured for 40 s. Further steps were performed similarly to the first group. It is noteworthy that the post length and the crown height were 3 mm and 4 mm, respectively in all groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Schematic view of three study groups.

In the current study, the force was imposed on the tested teeth at an angle of 148&#x000b0;. This angle is 135&#x000b0; in the permanent teeth that simulate occlusal forces on maxilla incisors in class 1 occlusion.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Because primary incisor teeth are straight, this angle is considered 148&#x000b0; as suggested by Baker <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>By dividing the fracture resistance values by bonded cross-sectional area, which has been described previously, the sample fracture strength (stress) was calculated (N/mm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). The fracture mode was assessed. Those fractures were considered favorable if it occurred above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and was restorable. Non-favorable fractures are defined as fractures below CEJ which are not repairable.</p><p>Data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences software version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test and intraclass correlation test (ICC).

This difference may be due to high tensile strength and similar modulus of elasticity to dentin in quartz fiber posts.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, the customized posts are formed by the dentists. These posts maintain the shape and strength of the roots, and drilling and shaping the canals are not required.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Our findings were consistent with the results of the study by Hegde <italic>et al.</italic>, in which the fracture strength of three posts including cast post, glass fiber post and quartz fiber post was compared in the permanent teeth. Hegde <italic>et al.</italic> showed that although the mean fracture strength was greater in quartz fiber post (480.9 N) than glass fiber post (432.2 N), the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The higher fracture strength in the study of Hegde <italic>et al.</italic> can be attributed to larger teeth diameter and enamel area available for bond, higher post length, lack of thermocycling and use of different cements. In contrast to our results, the fracture resistance was increased significantly when the fiber post was used compared to the composite post in Sharaf study.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In their study, the means of fracture resistance in the composite post and glass fiber post groups were 230.6 and 277.9 N, respectively, which were lower than our results.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] This difference may be due to the difference in post, cement and composite resin. In a study done by Ambica <italic>et al.</italic>, the fracture resistance of permanent teeth was evaluated after restoration by four methods: Without using post, carbon fiber post, glass fiber post, and dentin post. The mean fracture resistance in glass fiber post group was 603.44 N,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which can be due to the larger diameter of the tooth and the posts. Further, different posts, cements and specimens used in their study did not undergo thermocycling.</p><p>In an <italic>in vivo</italic> study, Eshghi <italic>et al.</italic> showed that retention of different techniques, including fiber post, composite post and reverse metallic post did not change significantly after 12 months follow-up and was 90, 98 and 100%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This finding is consistent with the results of the Sharaf and Judd <italic>et al.</italic> that reported 100% success for the composite posts and fiber posts.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>According to previous studies, the diameter of the tooth is one of the factors affecting fracture resistance.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The researchers reduce this effect by measuring and matching the mesiodistal and buccopalatal width of samples in the CEJ area in different groups.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In this study, we evaluated and compared the specimen's fracture strength by exact calculation of the cross-sectional area, which is one of the strengths of the current study. This effect has not been considered in other studies. Despite using the &#x0201c;fracture strength&#x0201d; term in other studies, in fact, they have calculated the fracture resistance according to the definitions. In the current study, the customized quartz fiber post group (12.82 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) had the highest fracture strength and prefabricated glass fiber post group (11.31 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) had the lowest fracture strength, although the difference was not statistically significant between groups. Due to lack of similar studies, we were unable to compare our results. In this study, in addition to the exact calculation of the cross-sectional area, we also calculated the inscribed rectangle area of the outer surface of the tooth and compared these two methods. The results of this study showed that these two methods are in good agreement with each other, which can be due to the small tooth dimensions. Due to the very good agreement between these two methods, it is possible to calculate the inscribed rectangle rather than the cross-sectional area to match the samples. Hence, the mesiodistal and buccolingual widths of the tooth can be measured by a digital caliper to calculate the inscribed rectangle area.</p><p>The clinical study of Sharaf showed that the use of fiber posts in severely decayed anterior primary teeth is an acceptable method. After 1 year, of 30 teeth only two teeth were extracted, one due to luxation and the other one because of pulp therapy failure. In their <italic>in vitro</italic> study, Sharaf showed that fiber posts increased the fracture resistance of the teeth significantly and the use of composite post compared to using no post significantly increased the fracture resistance.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Gujjar and Indushekar compared the retentive strength of three different posts, including composite post, orthodontic wire &#x003b3; and glass fiber post in the primary incisors. Their findings showed that the glass fiber post group had the highest, and the composite post group had the lowest tensile strength, indicating a statistically significant difference. They attributed the higher retentive strength of fiber posts to the better bond of these posts to the cement and better light transmission through these posts, which improves the polymerization of the cement in the apical area.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the fracture mode was divided into two categories: favorable (fractures above the CEJ) and catastrophic (fractures below the CEJ). Varvara <italic>et al.</italic> studied the permanent central tooth and considered cracks above the bone margin as restorable and cracks under the margin non-restorable in permanent central incisors.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Some other researchers have considered the incisal third of the root as restorable,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but since crown lengthening surgery is not performed routinely in pediatric dentistry, the fractures above the CEJ are considered as restorable fractures.</p><p>In the current study, the frequencies of non-restorable fracture mode were 35% in composite group, 15% in customized quartz fiber post group and 10% in prefabricated glass fiber post group. Although the difference was not significant, it indicated that the use of fiber post reduced catastrophic fractures, which is consistent with the results of the study carried out by Sherfudhin <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the study of Hegde <italic>et al.</italic>, 100% of glass fiber and quartz fiber posts had restorable fracture mode; however, 13.3% of the cast posts showed restorable fracture.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Pithan showed that the fracture mode of 80% for glass fiber posts and 47% for composite posts were adhesive,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] whereas these values in the study of Gujjar and Indushekar were 100% and 20%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] They attributed the adhesive fracture to the bond failure between cement and root canal. It should be noted that the mentioned studies used resin composite for post cementation. Therefore, in this study, dual cured resin cements were used to cement fiber posts. Among other benefits, we can refer to the high bond strength, reduced chairside time increased working time, high degree of conversion and good mechanical properties.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>The length of the post was considered 3 mm in our study (1/3 of the canal length). This is the proper length of the post in the primary teeth; hence, it does not interfere with the eruption of permanent teeth.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Another strength of the present study is the thermocycling of samples between 5&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C for better simulation of the oral environment. Since these cycles can affect the strength and durability of the restoration in the mouth,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] they can reduce the fracture resistance and increase the accuracy of results in addition to reconstructing the clinical conditions.</p><p>In a study conducted by Mountain <italic>et al.</italic>, carried out on 3 to 6-year old children, the maximum bite force measured at three areas, including the first and second molars and central incisors was from 12.61 to 353.6 <italic>N</italic> (mean = 196.6 N).[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] In the study of Owais <italic>et al.</italic>, this value was 176 <italic>N</italic> in the early primary stage and 240 <italic>N</italic> in the late primary stage.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] It should be noted that these forces are considerably greater in the oral environment under physiological conditions[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and affect the materials used through constant stresses.
