Over 90% will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (LPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are a variety of care and treatment &#x0201c;options&#x0201d; for men diagnosed with LPC including surgical treatment, radiation treatment, or active surveillance. There is little medical evidence to support the &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; option for most men diagnosed with LPC and therefore men often are asked to contribute to the care or treatment decision. These decisions are complex and are made based on a variety of personal and social economic factors, as well as the side effect profile of each approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Personal Patient Profile: Prostate (P3P) is a Web-based intervention providing tailored, values-based education and communication coaching to men making decisions about management of LPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The P3P was tested in a multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) from 2007&#x02013;2009 comparing standard patient education plus P3P to standard patient education alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The 6 study sites in 4 U.S. cities were the Seattle Prostate Institute (SPI) in Seattle, Washington; the University of Washington (UW)/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) in Seattle, Washington; Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) radiation oncology clinic in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Veterans Affairs Hospitals (VA) in Seattle, Washington; San Antonio, Texas; and Augusta, Georgia.</p><p>The main outcome of the trial was decisional conflict over 6&#x000a0;months, measured by the validated Decisional Conflict (DC) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A total of 494 eligible cases participated in the original study. A detailed description of the study sample and procedures has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. P3P was found to significantly reduce DC related to making LPC treatment decisions over 6&#x000a0;months, adjusting for participant personal characteristics and baseline measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the primary multivariable analysis, even after controlling for participant personal characteristics and other study measures, the study site at which participants received consultation remained a significant predictor of DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The purpose of this analysis was to explore further the factors that could potentially explain the influence of study site on DC, focusing on site characteristics and pre-intervention variables measured at baseline prior to entry into the study and receiving consultation at the study site.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study sites were described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. One participating site (SPI) enrolled only 18 participants, compared to 25 or more at all other sites, and was therefore excluded due to small sample size. 476 cases from 5 sites were included in this analysis. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at each site for the original trial, with the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Consortium as the lead IRB site, and all participants had completed written informed consent.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The current analysis explained what factors played a role in the significance of study site for two of the four DC subscales, uncertainty and values clarity. For the remaining two subscales included in this analysis, informed and support, study site remained significant. Potentially unmeasured variables play a role in why study site is important for these subscales and future trials will measure study site specific variables as well as participant factors.</p><p>The primary finding from our secondary analysis documents that the characteristics of men who sought treatment at the sites were explanatory of baseline DC measures. Disproportionate numbers of men with certain characteristics were consulted at the various study sites. The results highlight how men from diverse backgrounds engage in the complexity of decision making for LPC treatment. Race was implicated in univarate analysis of uncertainty, but did not predict DC once entered into the multivariable model. For those men with higher socioeconomic status, such as those at the Philadelphia Fox Chase radiation oncology site and the Seattle UW/SCCA, with access to information and health care resources, who sought information independently, and accessed Web-based information and multiple doctors to discuss treatment options (by default at the radiation site), DC related to uncertainty was higher. These men may have known the complexity of the LPC treatment decision at study entry, and therefore experienced more conflict. In contrast, men with lower socioeconomic status, such as those from the VA hospital sites, who did not access information outside of the clinic and did not seek information independently may have been less aware of the complexities and implications of the multiple treatment options available for LPC, and therefore experienced less conflict at study entry.</p><p>The significant influence of scores from the EPIC hormonal symptom domain was an interesting finding in the univariate analysis for three of four DC scales, though not sustained in the multivariable model. Men at the San Antonio VA had significantly worse scores in this domain. Certainly, at diagnosis these men had not been exposed to any androgen suppressive therapies. Two of the items within this domain inquire about depression and energy; this may help explain the relationship between the EPIC hormonal domain scores and DC.</p><p>Having a preferred treatment choice at study entry and having higher perceived knowledge were important factors that contributed to lower DC across subscales. It is important to recognize that having perceptions of a preferred treatment decision and having high perceived knowledge prior to having had LPC treatment related consultation does not equate with actual knowledge about LPC treatment options. A descriptive study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] evaluating prostate cancer related knowledge in 109 men with and without a prostate cancer diagnosis from low income settings, found low to moderate levels of prostate cancer knowledge and comprehension in the sample. The findings that of the age appropriate men, fewer than half knew the various prostate cancer treatment options and less than a fourth knew the potential side effects of treatment, may help place our findings in context. Men with low socioeconomic status may perceive themselves as having adequate knowledge but still require more informational support related to prostate cancer and treatment. In a recent publication, Kaplan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported baseline factors that predicted DC scores in men with LPC from a VA clinic. They reported that lower prostate cancer knowledge was associated with higher DC and uncertainty at baseline. In the P3P RCT, men at sites, such as the Seattle VA site, that had the lowest baseline DC scores, indicating men were the least conflicted, actually had the largest difference between control and intervention groups with regard to overall DC scores six months from enrollment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our secondary analysis helps us understand that participants who were not as prepared at baseline may have been less aware of the complexity of the decision and, the educational and coaching component of the P3P intervention benefited these men over time as they engaged in the complex task of a shared decision.</p><p>If a man had high state, or situational, anxiety at study entry, he was more likely to have higher DC across all subscales. State anxiety is a modifiable factor that could be addressed by clinical teams providing consultation for LPC treatment. Davison and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported significantly lower state anxiety in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer six weeks after randomization to an informational intervention. In 2012, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer proposed a 2015 mandate for cancer care settings that the management of distress, that includes anxiety, should be a component of all patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Limitations to our findings are important to identify. Study site process variables were measured by investigator recall and the current analysis may not have included all necessary site information, potentially missing important contributions that unknown study site variables may have made to the results.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Clinicians who consult with men regarding management of LPC may use these findings to better support men and decrease DC. Anxiety could be assessed at baseline to help clinicians understand which patients are likely to feel most conflicted when making a treatment decision and then target support to specific patient needs. Clinical centers which serve a high proportion of men with no access to the Internet and who are typically not consulting with multiple clinicians may want to assure (not assume) that men have a full understanding of prostate cancer and options for treating or monitoring the condition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Individual characteristics of men seeking consultation for localized prostate cancer were associated with DC at baseline and men with these characteristics were enrolled disproportionately at the various sites. While the original impact of the P3P intervention was positive despite these site differences, we now understand more of the influential baseline factors, notably information access and perceptions of knowledge about prostate cancer options. The modifiable factor of anxiety was identified as contributing to higher conflict at baseline. These finding will inform future development and implementation of the P3P and other decision support interventions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>P3P</term><def><p>Personal patient profile: Prostate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPC</term><def><p>Localized prostate cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DC</term><def><p>Decisional conflict</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAI</term><def><p>State trait anxiety index</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MU contributed to data collection, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.
