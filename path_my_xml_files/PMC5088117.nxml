discomfort of Korean patients after invasive percutaneous coronary intervention. [Subjects
and Methods] The participants consisted of 48 patients (experimental: n=24, control: n=24)
who underwent invasive coronary intervention (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in K
hospital, Seoul, Korea. A randomized controlled trial design was used. Position changes as
the experimental treatment were sequenced as follows: supine position for one hour after
removal of the catheter; 30-degree bed-elevated lateral position for one hour; 30-degree
bed elevation for one hour; and finally 30-degree bed-elevated lateral position for one
hour. The thirty degree bed-elevated lateral position was intended to press on the
surgical site. Measures used were the general characteristics form, Visual Analogue Scale
for lumbar pain, and discomfort scale. [Results] There were significant differences on
lumbar pain and discomfort of Korean patients after invasive coronary intervention between
the experimental and control groups. [Conclusion] Position change was an effective
intervention for decreasing lumbar pain and discomfort of Korean patients after invasive
coronary intervention. Health professionals need to consider an array of methods including
position change for patients after invasive coronary intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Position change</kwd><kwd>Lumbar pain</kwd><kwd>Discomfort</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ischemic heart diseases such as angina, cardiac infarction, heart failure, and cardiac
arrest are caused by a lack of oxygen in the cardiac muscles. With the increase in the
morbidity and mortality rates of ischemic heart diseases, the demand for medication therapy
and invasive coronary intervention (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is also
increasing<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were 36,476 cases in
2006, up by 59.5% to 58,186 in 2010<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Coronary intervention is a procedure for improving coronary artery blockage<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A tube is inserted into the blood vessel in
the arm or femoral region to treat the narrowed coronary artery<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, patients suffer pain and discomfort after
coronary intervention<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, patients&#x02019; lumbar pain and discomfort level decreased when they sat on
a bed with the upper part elevated<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, or when they were in a lateral position
after a coronary intervention<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their
position change did not induce complications such as bleeding and hematoma in the femoral
artery puncture area, but femoral arterial catheterization and the administration of an
anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting could cause vascular complications such as bleeding,
hematoma, and false aneurysm in the femoral arterial puncture site<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to
clinical guidelines<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, patients are moved
to the ward with their catheters intact from the pathology laboratory to prevent bleeding or
hematoma development. Their catheter is removed four hours after the procedure, and the
surgical site is manually compressed for 15&#x02013;20 minutes with the patient&#x02019;s legs extended
straight. A compressive dressing is applied on the surgical site before a sand bag is put on
it for several hours to stop the bleeding while the patient is in a still position. The
patient takes a bed rest in a still position with his or her legs extended straight for six
to eight hours after the surgery<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to a survey on the absolute rest period after coronary interventions in South
Korea, the mean period was about 20 hours<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The method of compressing the puncture area, the absolute rest
period, and the types of nursing care modalities varied according to the clinician and the
protocol<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, the absolute
rest period ranged from 6 to 24 hours.</p><p>Due to the still position to prevent vascular complications in the catheterization site
after a coronary intervention, patients experience lumbar pain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> and difficulty
in eating and urination<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. To prevent bleeding complications and for fast recovery,
various hemostatic appliances such as vascular closure devices have been developed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with manual compression, these
appliances help reduce the risks of bleeding and vascular complications<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the
use of the hemostatic appliances shortened the bleeding time to 3&#x02013;6 hours and reduced the
risk of vascular complications as well as the rest period after the surgery<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, patients should still have bed rest for three hours
with their legs extended straight, which results in discomfort associated with lumbar pain,
leg numbness, and surgical site pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, the pain and discomfort associated with the still position and the supine position
after the intervention can affect the patient&#x02019;s vital signs and recovery<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the minimization of bleeding complications after a coronary intervention is the
focal point of nursing care, and practical and effective methods that can be used in
clinical cases must be prepared. Studies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> on
position change after a coronary intervention have been conducted in many countries, but
only a few of them were on relieving discomfort after hemostatic appliance applications. In
previous studies, Fowler&#x02019;s position did not cause bleeding complications but relieved lumbar
pain and discomfort<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no studies on
the lateral position have yet to be reported. In this study, the effects of the lateral
position and a 30-degree-elevated position for the effectiveness of bleeding complications,
lumbar pain, and discomfort in patients who had been in a still position for three hours
after invasive coronary intervention and hemostasis, were investigated for clinical
applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used a randomized controlled trial design. Participants were a total of 48
patients (experimental: 24 samples, control: 24 samples) who underwent invasive coronary
intervention (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in K hospital, Seoul, Korea. The
participants were secured through random sampling using a coin toss. During the toss coin,
heads meant the subject becomes a participant of the experimental group in this study.
Eligibility criteria included those aged 25 to 75&#x02005;years old after invasive coronary
intervention that consented to engage in this study, no lumbar pain before invasive coronary
intervention, and no bleeding and hematoma during and after invasive coronary intervention.
Average age of the study participants was 63.2 &#x000b1; 4.6. Sample size adequacy (N=34) was
estimated based on an alpha level of 0.05, medium effect size of 0.5, and power of 0.80<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the sample size of this study
was appropriate.</p><p>The method of changing positions used in this study was based on the results of the study
of Chair et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> that targeted coronary
angiography patients, and on the study of Kim et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> on hemostasis using hemostatic appliances in coronary intervention
patients. The experimental treatments in this study were conducted with the patient in a
supine position for one hour, and then in a 30-degree bed-elevated lateral position for
another hour. The position change was finalized after preliminary experimental treatments.
Position changes in the experimental group were sequenced as follows: supine position for
one hour after removal of the catheter; 30-degree bed-elevated lateral position for one
hour; 30-degree bed elevation for one hour; and finally 30-degree bed-elevated lateral
position for one hour. At this time, thirty degree bed-elevated lateral position was
intended to press on the surgical site. The details of the position change in the control
group were to maintain bed rest in a supine position for three hours with the legs extended
straight after removal of the catheter.</p><p>A questionnaire was designed to measure general characteristics, lumbar pain, discomfort,
existence of bleeding and hematoma. General characteristics consisted of gender, age,
marital status, education, religion, experience of PCI for a total of six items. Lumbar pain
was measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS was the assessment instrument of lumbar
pain relief by means of a scale with a range from 0&#x02013;10, where 0 represented no pain and 10
the most pain. Although VAS is a subjective tool, it is widely applied and is a valid
instrument for pain assessment<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The discomfort scale developed by
Kim<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and revised by authors was used
to measure the level of discomfort of the participants. It consisted of a total of 9
questions using the Likert 4 scores scale. The possible score range was 9&#x02013;36, and the higher
the score of respondent was, the higher the level of his or her discomfort. The reliability
of this instrument was Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;=0.95. Criteria of existence of bleeding and hematoma
were done on the basis of Rein et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>
Yes in bleeding means more than one 4 &#x000d7; 4 gauze, and No in bleeding means there was less
than one 4 &#x000d7; 4 gauze. Yes in hematoma means above 1&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;1&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;1&#x02005;cm in size, and No in
hematoma means below 1&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;1&#x02005;cm &#x000d7;1&#x02005;cm in size.</p><p>Approval for this study was obtained from the IRB committee of K medical center in
University (Kyung Hee University Medical Center Institutional Review Board, KMC IRB:
1205&#x02013;05). Participants who formulated the cases were informed about the aim and methodology
of the study and were asked to participate. All cases were anonymous. Participants were
reminded that they could disengage from the study at any time and without the need to give a
reason. The researchers received accomplished written consent forms from those who agreed to
participate in the study. Participants were screened after the purpose and study procedures
were explained. The double blind method was used and a research assistant was trained for
error decline. A researcher recruited subjects and applied the intervention, while the
research assistant measured the lumbar pain, discomfort, and existence of bleeding and
hematoma. General characteristics and study variables were measured immediately after
invasive coronary intervention (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in the experimental and
control groups. Also, study variables were measured after applying experimental intervention
in experimental groups, and for the control group, study variables were measured after
experimental intervention was not applied. Position change as the experimental treatment was
applied to study participants by a researcher. Data were collected by a research assistant
from March to October 2013.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. The general characteristics of
the study participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics with frequency,
percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The homogeneity between two groups was analyzed
using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and independent t-test. Effects of position change were analyzed
using repeated measure ANOVA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of participants and the homogeneity test are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics and homogeneity test (N=48)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1">Characteristics</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental<break/>group (n=24)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control<break/>group (n=24)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Gender </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (45.8) </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (50.0) </td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.083 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (54.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (50.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;50</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 1 (4.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 0 (0.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="4" colspan="1">4.467&#x02020;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50&#x02013;60</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (33.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;70 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (58.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (70.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70&#x02013;75 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (4.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (12.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Marital status</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Married</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (100.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (95.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">1.021&#x02020; </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (4.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Education</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elementary school below</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (20.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (25.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">1.239</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Middle school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (58.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (54.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High school above</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (20.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (20.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Religion</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protestant</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (37.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (50.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">1.392&#x02020;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Buddhism</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (20.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (41.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Experience of PCI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (54.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (54.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">0.000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (45.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (45.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are shown as the n (%): frequency and percent. <sup>&#x02020;</sup>Fisher Exact Test,

There were statistically significant differences in lumbar pain (F=86.046,
p&#x0003c;0.001) and discomfort (F=99.305, p&#x0003c;0.001) between the two groups. Lumbar pain and
discomfort in experimental group were decreased more than them of control group. Also, there
were no existence of bleeding and hematoma in both groups (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>First, in terms of the effects of the position changes on lumbar pain, no significant
difference in the pain scores was seen immediately after the procedure. The pain score of
the experimental group was 4.00 (0.66) and 3.71 (0.62) for the control group. After the
position changes, the pain score of the experimental group decreased to 3.50 (0.78), 2.96
(0.69), and 2.79 (0.83), whereas that of the control group without a position change
increased to 4.54 (0.59), 4.83 (0.57), and 5.21 (0.78), corresponding to results of previous
studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar pain increased due to the
lumbar tension caused by the still position that was maintained for 30 minutes to three
hours after the procedure to prevent bleeding complications. In the group with change in
position, lumbar flexibility was well-maintained with a decrease in the tension level, which
prevented an increase in lumbar pain. These results corresponded to those of the studies of
Nam<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and Tavris et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> The still position and a decrease in lumbar
flexibility caused muscle tension, and the position change helped relieve lumbar tension and
pain. In the control group, the pain score gradually increased up to four hours after the
procedure. The trend of the pain score in this study corresponded to that in the study of
Kim et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which the pain score
increased until three hours after the procedure before it abruptly decreased. This important
outcome may be used to determine the timing of intervention in a patient who had undergone
manual compression. In the study of Nam<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, there was no significant difference in the lumbar pain score
immediately after the procedure, but the scores in the experimental group decreased 10
minutes, one hour, and two hours after the position change, whereas those in the control
group increased, as in this study. These results also correspond with those of the study of
Chair et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, which confirmed a decrease
in the lumbar pain in coronary angiography patients who were initially in a supine position,
followed by a 30-degree right lateral position, a 30-degree left lateral position, and
finally, supine position at an interval of one hour.</p><p>Second, the discomfort score immediately after the procedure in the experimental group was
21.79 (1.50), and in the control group, 21.04 (2.27), reflecting no significant difference.
In contrast, the discomfort score in the experimental group, which underwent position
changes, tended to decrease to 19.75 (2.19), 18.40 (1.89), and 17.54 (1.86) one, two, and
three hours after the procedure, respectively. In the control group, which did not undergo
position changes, the discomfort score increased to 22.67 (2.50), 23.79 (2.65), and 24.67
(2.58), respectively. In summary, the discomfort levels of the groups according to their
position changes immediately after their invasive coronary intervention were similar, but
those in the experimental group decreased more significantly as time passed than did those
in the control group, which confirms the effect of position changes on reducing discomfort.
These results correspond with those of the study of Ki<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, which confirmed growing discomfort with an increase in the
absolute rest period after a coronary intervention, and with those of the study of Kim et
al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, which confirmed the relationship
between a position change and the discomfort level after coronary angiography. These results
also correspond with those of the study of Kim et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, which were obtained from coronary angiography patients who assumed
a lateral position at one-hour intervals with gradual elevations of 15 and 30 degrees, and
with those of the study of Nam<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
were obtained from patients whose bed was elevated to up to 45 degrees. In this study, most
of the subjects who did not change their position complained of lumbar pain, leg pain, and
numbness, as well as difficulties in food intake and urination as time passed after the
procedure. In previous studies<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, the lumbar pain levels of the control
groups that did not undergo the intervention increased. This implies that lumbar pain and
the discomfort level after a coronary intervention increase as time passes, which confirms
the need for active nursing interventions to relieve pain and discomfort.</p><p>Third, regarding the possibility of developing bleeding complications after an invasive
coronary intervention, no bleeding and hematoma after position changes was observed in both
groups. Between the groups with various bed rest periods and position changes, similar to
results of previous studies there was no significant difference in vascular complication
developments in the puncture site after the invasive procedure<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the study of Kim et
al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, only one case of Grade I (less
than 100&#x02005;ml) bleeding without hematoma was reported three hours after patient arrival in the
experimental group, and one case of the same Grade I bleeding without hematoma one hour
after patient arrival in the control group was reported. There were no bleeding
complications because coronary intervention patients who showed bleeding upon arrival were
excluded from this study due to their risk of developing hematoma or bleeding complications.
In the study of Rein et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, bleeding
was defined as when one or more 4 &#x000d7; 4 gauzes were used. Accordingly, &#x02018;no&#x02019; bleeding was
observed in both groups without hematoma, as three cases of less than one 4 &#x000d7; 4 gauze
bleeding were observed in the experimental group, and two cases of less than one 4 &#x000d7; 4 gauze
bleeding in the control group. Therefore, position change after an invasive coronary
intervention was confirmed as a safe procedure because it does not cause bleeding
complications. However, further observations on hematoma and bleeding developments in
patients who had used hemostatic appliances after a coronary intervention may be needed.</p><p>The limitation of this study involves the samples&#x02019; degree of representation and
generalizability. The samples used in this study were recruited only from one hospital in a
metropolitan area in South Korea, limiting the characteristics of the resulting data.
However, the main aim of this study was not to produce generalizable results, but rather to
provide information on which to build future investigations. Further studies with larger
sample sizes on physiological responses such as blood pressure and pulse rate may be needed
in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the changes from a 30-degree bed-elevated lateral position on the surgical
site to a 30-degree bed-elevated position at one-hour intervals during the absolute rest
period of patients who underwent invasive coronary interventions were confirmed to have been
effective in relieving lumbar pain and discomfort without causing bleeding complications.
This has significant implications in clinical practice in overcoming lumbar pain and
discomfort for patients after invasive coronary interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to all the participants who participated in the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">American Heart Association:
