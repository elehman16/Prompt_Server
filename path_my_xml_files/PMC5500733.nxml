Music interventions have been shown to be a potential alternative for depression therapy but the number of up-to-date research literature is quite limited. We present a review of original research trials which utilize music or music therapy as intervention to treat participants with depressive symptoms. Our goal was to differentiate the impact of certain therapeutic uses of music used in the various experiments. Randomized controlled study designs were preferred but also longitudinal studies were chosen to be included. 28 studies with a total number of 1,810 participants met our inclusion criteria and were finally selected. We distinguished between passive listening to music (record from a CD or live music) (79%), and active singing, playing, or improvising with instruments (46%). Within certain boundaries of variance an analysis of similar studies was attempted. Critical parameters were for example length of trial, number of sessions, participants' age, kind of music, active or passive participation and single- or group setting. In 26 studies, a statistically significant reduction in depression levels was found over time in the experimental (music intervention) group compared to a control (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or comparison group (<italic>n</italic> = 2). In particular, elderly participants showed impressive improvements when they listened to music or participated in music therapy projects. Researchers used group settings more often than individual sessions and our results indicated a slightly better outcome for those cases. Additional questionnaires about participants confidence, self-esteem or motivation, confirmed further improvements after music treatment. Consequently, the present review offers an extensive set of comparable data, observations about the range of treatment options these papers addressed, and thus might represent a valuable aid for future projects for the use of music-based interventions to improve symptoms of depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>music therapy</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>neuropsychology</kwd><kwd>psychosomatic medicine</kwd><kwd>neurophysiology</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="121"/><page-count count="21"/><word-count count="15925"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.

International studies predict that approximately 322 million (WHO, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) of the world's population suffer from a clinical depression. This disorder can occur from infancy to old age, with women being affected more often than men (WHO, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, depression is one of the most common chronic diseases. Depressive suffering is associated with psychological, physical, emotional, and social impairments. This can influence the whole human being in a fundamental way. Without clinical treatment, it has the tendency to recur or to take a chronic course that can lead to loneliness (Alpass and Neville, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and an increasing social isolation (Teo, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Depression can have many causes that range from genetic, over psychological factors (negative self-concept, pessimism, anxiety and compulsive states, etc.) to psychological trauma. In addition, substance abuse (Neighbors et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) or chronic diseases (Moussavi et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) can also trigger depression. The colloquial use of the term &#x0201c;depressed&#x0201d; has nothing to do with the depression in the clinical sense. The ICD-10 (WHO, <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) and the DSM-V (APA, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) provide a classification based on symptoms, considering the patient's history and its severity, duration, course and frequency. Within the last two decades, research on the use of music medicine or music therapy to treat depression, showed a growing popularity and several publications have appeared that documented this movement (e.g., Lee, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Loewy, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Esfandiari and Mansouri, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Fancourt et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, most researchers used a very specific experimental setup (Hillecke et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and thus, for example, focused only on one music genre (i.e., classical, modern; instrumental, vocal), used a predefined experimental setup (group or individual) (e.g., Kim et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), or specified precisely the age range (i.e., adolescents, elderly) of participants (e.g., Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A recent meta-analysis (Hole et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reviewed 72 randomized controlled trials and concluded that music was a notable aid for reducing postoperative symptoms of anxiety and pain.</p><p>Dementia patients showed significant cognitive and emotional benefits when they sang, or listened to familiar songs (S&#x000e4;rk&#x000e4;m&#x000f6; et al., <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Beneficial effects were also described for CNMP (Chronic Non-Malignant Pain) patients with depression (Siedliecki and Good, <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Cardiology is an area where music interventions are commonly used for intervention purposes. Various explanations were postulated and the broad range of effects on the cardiovascular system was investigated (Trappe, <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hanser, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Music as a therapeutic approach was evaluated (Gold et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and found to have positive effects before heart surgery (Twiss et al., <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), used to increase relaxation during angiography (Bally et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), or decrease anxiety (Do&#x0011f;an and Senturan, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Yinger and Gooding, <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A systematic review (Jespersen et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) concluded that music improved subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia, verbal memory in children (Chan et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Ho et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), and episodic long-term memory (Eschrich et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Music conveyed a certain mood or atmosphere (Husain et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), allowed composers to trigger emotions (Bodner et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Droit-Volet et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), based on the cultural background (Balkwill and Thompson, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), or ethnic group (Werner et al., <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) someone belonged to. In contrast, the emotional state itself plays a role (Al'tman et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) on how music is interpreted (Al'tman et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and durations are evaluated (Sch&#x000e4;fer et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Subjective impressions embedded in a composition caused physiological body reactions (Grewe et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; J&#x000e4;ncke, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and even strengthened the immune system (McCraty et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Bittman et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The pace of (background) music (Oakes, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), has also been used as an essential element of many marketing concepts (North and Hargreaves, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), to create a relaxed atmosphere. An in-depth, detailed illustration described the wide variety of conscious, as well as subconscious influences music can have (Panksepp and Bernatzky, <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and endorsed future research on this subject.</p><sec><title>Distinction between the terms &#x0201c;Music Therapy [MT]&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Music Medicine [MM]&#x0201d;</title><p>Most of us know what kind of music or song &#x0201c;can cheer us up.&#x0201d; To treat someone else is something completely different though. Therefore, evidence-based procedures were created for a more pragmatic approach. It is important to differentiate between music therapy and the therapeutic use of music. Music used for patient treatment can be divided into two major categories, namely [MT] and [MM], although the distinction is not always that clear.</p><sec><title>Music therapy [MT]</title><p>Term used primarily for a setting, where sessions are provided by a board-certified music therapist. Music therapy [MT] (Maratos et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Bradt et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) stands for the &#x0201c;&#x02026;<italic>clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program</italic>&#x0201d; (AMTA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Many different fields of practice, mostly in the health care system, show an increasing amount of interest in [MT]. Mandatory is a systematic constructed therapy process that was created by a board-certified music therapist and requires an individual-specific music selection that is developed uniquely for and together with the patient in one or more sessions. Therapy settings are not limited to listening, but may also include playing, composing, or interacting with music. Presentations can be pre-recorded or live. In other cases (basic) instruments are built together. The process to create these tailor-made selections requires specific knowledge on how to select, then construct and combine the most suitable stimuli or hardware. It must also be noted that music therapy is offered as a profession-qualifying course of study.</p></sec><sec><title>Music medicine [MM] (i.e., functional music, music in medicine)</title><p>Carried out independently by professionals, who are not qualified music therapists, like relaxation therapists, physicians or (natural) scientists. A previous consultation, or collaboration, with a certified music therapist can be helpful (Register, <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In recent years, significant progress has been made in both the research and clinical application of music as a form of treatment. It has valuable therapeutic properties, suitable for the treatment of several diseases. The term &#x0201c;music medicine&#x0201d; is used as a term for the therapeutic use of music in medicine (Bradt et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), to be able to differentiate it from &#x0201c;music therapy.&#x0201d; [MM] stands for a medical, physiological and physical evaluation of the use of music. If someone listens to his or her favorite music, this is sometimes also considered as a form of music medicine. [MM] deliberately differs from music therapy as part of psychiatric care or psychotherapy. It is important to stress out that the term &#x0201c;Music Therapy [MT]&#x0201d; should not be used for any kind of treatment involving music, although there is without doubt a relationship between [MT] and [MM]. What all of them have in common is the focus on a scientifically, artistically or clinically based approach to music.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x0201c;Seamless Transitions&#x0201d; between music therapy [MT] and music medicine [MM]</title><p>Activity used for treatment is ambiguous or not clearly labeled as &#x0201c;Music Therapy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Music Medicine.&#x0201d; It should not be forgotten that the definition of &#x0201c;Music Therapy&#x0201d; is not always clearly distinguishable from &#x0201c;Music Medicine.&#x0201d; One possible scenario would be a physician (i.e., &#x0201c;non-professional&#x0201d;), who is not officially certified by the AMTA (or comparable institutions), but still acts according to the mandatory rules. In addition, depending on one's home country, uniform standards or eligibility requirements might be substantially different. We think that every effort should be recognized and therefore postulate one definition that can describe the main principle of [MT], [MM], and everything in between, in one sentence: &#x0201c;<italic>Implementation of acoustic stimuli (&#x0201c;music&#x0201d;) as a medium for the purpose of improving symptoms in a defined group of participants (patients) suffering from depression.&#x0201d;</italic></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Literature search</title><p>Search strategy and selection process was performed according to the recommended guidelines of the Cochrane Centre on systematic literature search (Higgins and Green, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Our approach (<bold>Figure 2</bold>) was according to their scientific relevance, supplemented by the analysis of relevant journals, conferences and workshops of recent years. We obtained 60,795 articles from various search engines as initial result. Retrieved data was collected and processed on an existing personal computer with the latest Windows operating system.</p><sec><title>Search, collection, selection, and review strategies</title><p>We used a combination of words defining three search-categories (Music-, Treatment-, and Depression associated) as well as several words (e.g., Sound, Unhappy, and Treatment) assigned to each category as described in the collection process.below. If synonyms of those keywords were identified, they were added as well. Theme-categories<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref> were created next, then related keywords identified and added into a table. &#x0201c;Boolean Operators<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0004"><sup>4</sup></xref>&#x0201d; were used as logical connectives to broaden and/or narrow our search results within many databases (mostly search engines as described below).</p><p>This way the systematic variation of keyword-based queries and search terms could be performed with much more efficiency. To find the most relevant literature on the subject, keywords were entered into various scientific search engines, namely PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. After the collection process, several different steps were used to reduce the number of retrieved results. Selection out of the collected material included to narrow down search results to a limited period of time. We decided to choose a period between 1990 and 2016 (i.e., not exceeding 26 years), because within these years several very interesting works of research were published, but often not mentioned explicitly, discussed in detail, or the main target of a comparative review. After several papers were excluded, a systematic key phrases search was conducted once more to retrieve results, limited to original research articles<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0005"><sup>5</sup></xref>. We also removed search results that quoted book chapters, as well as reports from international congresses and conferences. Research papers that remained were distinguished from duplicates (or miss-matches not dismissed yet). Based on our predefined criteria for in- and ex-clusion, relevant publications were then selected for an intensified review process. Our plan was to apply the following inclusion criteria: Original research article, published at time of selection, music and/or instruments were used intentionally to improve the emotional status of participants (i.e., intended or officially confirmed as music therapy). The following exclusion criteria were used: No original research, article was not published (e.g., project phase, in review), unverified data or literature was used, participants did neither receive nor interact with music. Not relevant for in- or exclusion was the kind of questionnaire used to measure depression, additional diagnostic measures for pathologies other than depression, spatial and temporal implementation of treatment, demographics (i.e., number, age, and gender) participants had, or distinctive features (like setting, duration, speakers, live version, and recorded) of stimuli. After the initial number of results, the remaining articles were manually checked for completeness and accuracy of information. Our final selection of articles included 28 research papers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>General information &#x02014; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)</title><sec><title>Evaluating the methodological quality of our meta-review</title><p>During the review process, we used a very strict self-monitoring procedure to ensure that the quality of scientific research was met to the best of our knowledge and stood in accordance with the standards of good scientific practice.

Inspired by another author's meta-review (Kamioka et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we evaluated our work by the AMSTAR checklist (Shea et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0006"><sup>6</sup></xref> and found no reasons for objection regarding our selection of reviews.

Medium sized groups of up to 100 participants were found in six articles (Gupta and Gupta, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Castillo-P&#x000e9;rez et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lu et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Large groups with more than 100 (Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), or 200 (Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) participants were the exception, and 236 participants (Chang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) presented the upper end in our selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Age groups &#x02013; results</title><p>Within our selected articles, the youngest participant was 14 (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and the oldest 95 years of age (Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>). We then separated relevant groups, according to their age, into three categories, namely &#x0201c;young,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;medium,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;elderly.&#x0201d;</p><sec><title>Young</title><p>Participants were defined as &#x0201c;young,&#x0201d; if their mean age was below or equal to 30 years (&#x02264;30). Young individuals did show minimal better (i.e., higher) depression score improvements (DSI) (mean difference between the pre-test and post-test results was calculated in percent), if they attended group (mean DSI<sub>Gr</sub> = 53.83%)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0009"><sup>9</sup></xref>, rather than individual (DSI<sub>Ind</sub> = 40.47%) music intervention sessions. These results may be due to the beneficial consequences of social interactions within groups, and thus confirm previous study results (Garber et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tartakovsky, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Medium</title><p>We used the term &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; for groups of participants, whose mean ages ranged between 31 (&#x0003e;30) and 59 years (&#x0003c;60). Medium-aged participants presented much better results (i.e., higher depression score improvements), if they attended a group (mean DSI<sub>Gr</sub> = 48.37%), rather than an individual (mean DSI<sub>Ind</sub> = 24.79%) intervention setting. However, it should be stressed that our findings only show a positive trend and thus should not be evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Elderly</title><p>The third and final group was defined by us as &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d; and included participants with a mean age of 60 years or above (&#x02265;60). Noticeable results were found for the age group we defined as elderly, as participants showed slightly better (i.e., higher) score improvements (mean DSI<sub>Ind</sub> = 48.96%), if they attended an individual setting. Considering the music selection that had been used for elderly participants, a strong tendency toward classical compositions was found (e.g., Chan et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Because a relevant number of participants came from Asian countries (e.g., China, Korea), elderly people from those research articles received, in addition to classical music, quite often Asian oriented compositions as well. Despite our extensive investigations, the influence this combination had on results, remained uncertain. Positive tendencies within those groups might be due to &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;culture related&#x0201d; factors. It is, however, also conceivable that combining Western classical with traditional Asian music is notably suited to produce better results. Concerning this matter, future research on western depression patients treated with a combination of classical Western, and traditional Asian music might be a promising concept to be further explored.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gender &#x02013; results</title><p>As far as gender was concerned, we subdivided each sample group in its female and male participants. Women and men were found in 20 study designs. This was the most frequently used constellation. Within this selection, we did not find any significant differences, and so no further analysis was done. Only women took part in two studies (Chang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Esfandiari and Mansouri, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0010"><sup>10</sup></xref>. Interestingly the same stimuli setup was used in both cases. It consisted of instrumental music without vocals, stored on a digital record, and was presented via loudspeakers from a CD (Chang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) or MP3 player (Esfandiari and Mansouri, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Only men were seen in four research papers (Gupta and Gupta, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Schwantes and Mckinney, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A significant improvement of depression scores was reported for every experimental group, and once (Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) for a corresponding control setting (received only standard and no alternative treatment). Three articles (Schwantes and Mckinney, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) shared several similarities, as percussion instruments (e.g., drums, tambourines) were part of each genre selection, all participants received music interventions in a group setting, and stimuli were actively produced within a live performance. In addition, the BDI questionnaire has also been used in three cases (Gupta and Gupta, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and thus we were able to perform a search for similarities or tendencies. The average duration for one music intervention was 80 (<italic>SD</italic> = 45) min and the total number of sessions was 17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5) in average. Two publications (Hsu and Lai, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) did not offer any information about gender related distribution of participants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Music therapy [MT] vs. music medicine [MM] &#x02014; study results</title><sec><title>Music-therapy [MT]</title><p>Within our selection of 28 articles, six explicitly mentioned a certified music therapist (Hanser and Thompson, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Choi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Schwantes and Mckinney, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0011"><sup>11</sup></xref>.

Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used by four researchers (Choi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Schwantes and Mckinney, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). One author (Choi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used music based on instruments that were selected according to participant's preferences. Included were, for example, egg shakes, base-, ocean-, and paddle-drums. Participants actively played and passively listened to instruments or sounds, complemented by singing together. Another researcher (Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) preferred the African Djembe<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0012"><sup>12</sup></xref> drum as well as a selection of several percussion sounds created digitally by an external MIDI (<italic>Musical Instrument Digital Interface</italic>) synthesizer. Percussion-oriented improvisation that included rhythmic drumming and vocal patterns was another approach one scholar (Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) used for his stimuli selection. Congas, Cabassas, Ago-Gos, and Claves was the percussion-based selection (in addition a guitar and a Piano was also available) in the fourth music-therapy article (Schwantes and Mckinney, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Twice, music without the use of percussion instruments or drums in general, was selected for the intervention. Once (Hanser and Thompson, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) relaxing, slow and rhythmic harp-samples, played from a cassette-player, were used. In addition, each of the participants was invited to bring some samples of her or his favored music titles. The second one (Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) decided to play a &#x0201c;12-bar Blues&#x0201d; (i.e., &#x0201c;blues changes&#x0201d;)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0013"><sup>13</sup></xref> progression as an introduction, followed by a Blues songwriting session. The last-mentioned music-therapy project was the only article out of six, where participants within their respective music intervention group did not present a significant reduction of depression. A very interesting &#x0201c;fund&#x0201d; was that none of the music-therapy articles neither concentrated their main music selection on classical, nor on Jazz music. When we looked for other distinctive features it turned out that stimuli were actively produced within a live performance in five articles. There was only one exception (Hanser and Thompson, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), where a passive presentation of recorded stimuli was preferred by the scholar.</p></sec><sec><title>Music-medicine [MM]</title><p>The remaining 22 research articles did not explicitly mention a certified music therapist.

Researchers that used drums reported a significant depression score improvement for every experimental group and we calculated an average of 53.71% for those five articles. Regarding the kind of genre used in our selection of music-medicine articles, a wider range of genres was found. One of the biggest differences was that only music-medicine articles used, in addition to percussion stimuli, also classical and Jazz music for their intervention.

For all four articles mentioned above, we calculated an average of 11 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10) for the total number of sessions that included classical music. The remaining five articles on the other hand, presenting results not as good as the aforementioned, showed an average of 30 (<italic>SD</italic> = 21) music interventions. One plausible hypothesis might be &#x0201c;saturation effect&#x0201d; caused by too many interventions in total. Too little variety within the selection of music titles has probably played an important role as well. A general tendency that less intervention sessions in total would lead to better results for every case where classical compositions were included could not be confirmed for our selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Percussion (drumming-based) music &#x02013; results</title><p>Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used by nine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0018"><sup>18</sup></xref> researchers, and among those, two ways of integration were found. On the one hand, rhythmic percussion compositions were included as part of the music title selection used for intervention. On the other hand, and this was the case in nine articles, various forms of drums had been offered to those who joined the experimental groups, allowing them to &#x0201c;produce their own&#x0201d; music. Sometimes participants were accompanied by a music therapist (e.g., Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) or professional artist (Fancourt et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), who gave instructions on how to use and play these instruments. When we looked for trends or distinctive features percussion music (in particular drumming) had, it turned out that, except one article (Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), all were carried out within a group, rather than an individual setting. A further search for additional similarities, leading to better outcome scores, did not deliver any new findings as far as improvement of depression was concerned. Participants in altogether 7 out of 9 percussion groups were medium aged, two authors (Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) described elderly participants, whereas none of the percussion groups included young participants.</p><p>A wide and even distribution of reduced depression scores across all outcome levels became apparent, when participants received percussion (or drumming) interventions.

Unfortunately, available data was quite limited, mainly since most authors did not disclose relevant information and a detailed description was rarely seen. Some interesting points were also found for research articles that used Jazz as a treatment option. All five of them were among those with good outcome scores, as far as depression reduction was concerned. Test scores ranged between a significance level of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 (Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>; Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and sometimes even better than <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (e.g., Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Fancourt et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Depression score improvement (DSI) had an average of 43.41% (<italic>SD</italic> = 6). However, there was no clear trend leading toward Jazz as a more effective intervention option, when compared to other music genres. This was assumed because the two studies that showed the best<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0021"><sup>21</sup></xref> reduction in depression [Chan et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref> (DSI = 48.78%); Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref> (DSI = 4 6.58%)] used both classical music in addition to Jazz as an intervention. Experimental groups received two types of intervention (i.e., classical music and Jazz) which eventually blurred outcome scores or prevented more accurate results. Since it was not possible to differentiate to what extent either classical music or Jazz was responsible for the positive trend in reducing symptoms of depression, further research in this field is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional music genres &#x02013; results</title><p>Numerous other music styles were used in the experiments, ranging from Indian ragas<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0022"><sup>22</sup></xref> played on a flute (Gupta and Gupta, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Deshmukh et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), nature sound compositions (Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Chang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), meditative (Chan et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), or slow rhythm music (Chan et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), to lullabies (Chang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), pop or rock (Kim et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Erkkil&#x000e4; et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), Irish folk, Salsa, and Reggae (Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), only to name a few. As far as we were concerned all those genres mentioned above would present interesting approaches for future research. Due to a relatively small number and simultaneously wide-ranging variety, more thorough investigations are needed, though. These should be examined independently. As far as the above-mentioned music genres, other than classical, percussion, or Jazz were concerned, no indication for a preferable combination was observed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Experimental vs. control groups &#x02013; results</title><sec><title>Non-significant results for experimental groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05)</title><p>In two (Deshmukh et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) out of 28 studies within our selection of research papers, no significant reduction in depression scores was reported, after participants participated in music interventions. Within those two cases all relevant statistical observations differed without any obvious similarities indicating reasons for non-significant results. Although the results did not meet statistical significance for symptom improvement, both authors explicitly pointed out that positive changes in the severity of depression became obvious for the respective experimental groups. We declared one article (Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>) as significant, although it was marked as non-significant in our complete table. This was due to the overall results of this specific research paper, with significant [HADS-D] test scores for weeks 5, 10, and 15. Only week 20 did not follow this positive trend of improvement. It is also important to mention that after music treatment every one of the additional tests [HADS-A for Anxiety; Face(-Scale) to measure mood] showed significant improvements for the experimental group.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative treatment for corresponding control groups</title><p>Control groups, who received an alternative (i.e., non-music) intervention, were found in nine research articles (e.g., Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>; Castillo-P&#x000e9;rez et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0023"><sup>23</sup></xref>.

As far as these nine articles were concerned, a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in depression scores was found in every experimental but only one control setting (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). In this case, an entirely different result became apparent, when control participants received a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy [CBT] and a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in depression scores was measured compared to the respective baseline score, although music still lead to better results. Another scholar (Chan et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0025"><sup>25</sup></xref>, instructed participants in the control group to take a resting period, while simultaneously the experimental attendees joined their music intervention session. This alternative approach did not reduce the [GDS-15] depression score, but even increased it. Interestingly, the same author previously published (Chan et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) a significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007) increase (i.e., worsening of depression) for the relevant control setting. To be complete, a resting period was also conducted in another case (Hsu and Lai, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), but results showed also no significant reduction in depression scores.

Among our article selection we could find a well-balanced distribution of 15 trials with participants who received music interventions in a group, while 13 researchers used an individual setting. First, the impact of individual compared to group treatment was evaluated. Here an almost equivalent outcome (for the significance-level of results) across all 13 individual, compared to 15 group settings was found, without any advantage to one over the other.

It ranged from 1 day in two cases (Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) up to 20 (Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>), or even 24 weeks (Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).

The scheduled (i.e., total) treatment duration was determined by a variety of factors. Our investigation, whether there was any relationship between the entire duration of experimental projects and relevant outcome scores, delivered the following results. For an individual (Ind) therapy setting, we isolated eight<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0029"><sup>29</sup></xref> research papers with above average<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0030"><sup>30</sup></xref> results in depression score improvement (DSI<sub>Ind</sub> &#x0003e; 36.50%). We then calculated for the entire project an average duration of almost 7 weeks. For the remaining five<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0031"><sup>31</sup></xref> articles that also used an individual approach, but had below average depression score improvements, an average duration of 6 weeks was found. A different picture became apparent when we selected those four<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0032"><sup>32</sup></xref> articles that presented better than average (DSI<sub>Gr</sub> &#x0003e; 49.09%) results in depression score improvement, after participants received music intervention in a group (Gr). Percussion music (mainly drumming) was used by three researchers (Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Lu et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In comparison, the fourth author (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) used a selection of relaxing music for treatment. For this setup, a combined duration of six (<italic>SD</italic> = 4) weeks was calculated for the entire project length. On the other hand, a mean close to 10 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7) weeks was found for the remaining 7<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0033"><sup>33</sup></xref> group intervention projects that were less successful (i.e., below average), as far as depression score reduction was concerned. Based on these results, we concluded that the length for the entire music intervention procedure might be a crucial element for successful results, and seems to be associated with the intervention type. These findings were not enough to draw further conclusions for every project though, but as far as our selection was concerned, a slightly longer intervention duration of 7 weeks led to better results if participants were treated individually. In comparison, for a group setting our calculations revealed a different picture, when we calculated the average entire duration for all relevant research projects. Here it was 6 weeks that produced the most beneficial results within groups. Drums were used for three out of the four projects that presented above average results. Once (Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) a small African drum was used for &#x0201c;drumming activity&#x0201d; at the start of every session. Each time a different participant was asked to perform with this instrument, although nobody in the experimental group was neither a professional drummer nor a musician. African drums were also used by another researcher (Chen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, equipment also included one stereo, one electronic piano, two guitars, one set of hand glockenspiel, and other percussion instruments such as cymbals, tambourines, and xylophones. Finally, percussion instruments used in the third study (Lu et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) included hand bells, snare drums, a castanet, a tambourine, some claves, a triangle and wood blocks.</p></sec><sec><title>Total number of sessions &#x02013; results</title><p>Continuing the analysis, we evaluated the total number of music intervention sessions. Apparently, this metric was dependent on the duration as well as frequency (&#x0201c;session frequency&#x0201d;) each intervention had. With one exception (Wang et al., <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), where relevant data was missing, the number of sessions varied considerably. Only a single treatment session was used by three authors (Chan et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Koelsch et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), whereas 56 sessions (Castillo-P&#x000e9;rez et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) marked the opposite end of the scale.

To be able to compare this work with the other studies one single baseline (31.75), post treatment (12.50), and pre-post difference score of 19.25 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.47)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0041"><sup>41</sup></xref> was calculated (according to common statistical standards) for both experimental settings. Interestingly, the corresponding control sample showed a three-point increased BDI score (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and no decrease at any time. Continuing with the remaining articles, even bigger initial baseline BDI scores of 39.00 (<italic>SD</italic> = n/a) (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and 49.30 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.10) (Choi et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) were found. In addition, both authors reported a significant pre-post BDI score reduction<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0042"><sup>42</sup></xref> for their experimental groups. Based on the published data it became evident that BDI scores improved significantly in each of the cases and this time an overall average reduction of 26.90 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.59) was calculated. Once (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) a significantly reduced BDI pre-post score was also reported for the control setting, where participants received a cognitive-behavioral activities program as an alternative (non-music) intervention.</p><p>We compared all research projects that used the BDI questionnaire (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Higher baseline scores almost always led to comparatively bigger score reductions in those experimental groups, who received music intervention. Except for two articles (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), no significant improvements were found for control samples. For one of the above-mentioned exceptions (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) an alternative treatment (&#x0201c;<italic>Cognitive-Behavioral&#x0201d; activities</italic>) was provided, which might be a plausible explanation why those relatively young participants (all 14 or 15 years old) showed such reductions in BDI values. Nevertheless, it is also important to mention that the relevant experimental group improved to a greater extent (BDI<sub>PRE</sub> &#x02212; BDI<sub>POST</sub> = 37.66) after treatment. As far as the other case (Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) was concerned, no alternatives (i.e., other than basic or usual care) were offered, and thus no explanation had been established as to how the results could be explained.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of BDI results.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Authors [BDI]</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Music Type/Genre (focus on)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Test-score [mean] Exp-Gr.

As already suggested by its name, all 223 participants were elderly. Because both GDS versions are based on the same questionnaire, we combined scores of the long (i.e., GDS-30) with the short (i.e., GDS-15) test version and found a total of 223 participants in six articles (e.g., Chan et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A possible bias could be prevented because tests were evenly distributed in number, and with respect to higher GDS-30 as well as lower GDS-15 scores, calculations were adapted accordingly. Taking a closer look at the GDS-15/-30 results (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), some similarities could be found for the most successful (all <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) four research articles (Chan et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gu&#x000e9;tin et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>; Verrusio et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All of them used and mainly focused on classical compositions as far as their music title selection was concerned. The average reduction in depression as measured by the GDS-15/-30 depression scores was 43% (&#x02212;42.62%; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.24%). In comparison, every one of the remaining four research projects (Hanser and Thompson, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Chan et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) also presented significant results, albeit not as good as the above-mentioned (all <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Interestingly, as far as music genres were concerned, the focus of these less successful projects was rhythmic drumming in two cases (Ashida, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).

It also has an impact on reliability or stamina at daily work and may even result in a greater susceptibility to diseases. Music can be considered an emerging treatment option for mood disorders that has not yet been explored to its full potential. To the best of our knowledge, there were only very few meta-analyses, or systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials available that generated the amount of statistical data, which we presented here.</p><p>Certain individual-specific attributes of music are recognizable, when the medium of music is decomposed (Durkin, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0047"><sup>47</sup></xref> into its components. Numerous researchers reported the beneficial effects of music, such as strengthening awareness and sensitiveness for positive emotions (Croom, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), or improvement of psychiatric symptoms (Nizamie and Tikka, <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Group drumming, for example, helped soldiers to deal with their traumatic experiences, while they were in the process of recovery (Bensimon et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, we have concentrated our focus of interest on patients diagnosed with clinical depression, one of the most serious and frequent mental disorders worldwide.</p><p>In this review we examined whether, and to what extent, music intervention could significantly affect the emotional state of people living with depression. Our primary objective was to accurately identify, select, and analyze up-to-date research literature, which utilized music as intervention to treat participants with depressive symptoms. After a multi-stage review process, a total of 1.810 participants in 28 scholarly papers met our inclusion criteria and were finally selected for further investigations about the effectiveness music had to treat their depression. Both, quantitative as well as qualitative empirical approaches were performed to interpret the data obtained from those original research papers. To consider the different methods researchers used, we presented a detailed illustration of approaches and evaluated them during our investigation process.</p><p>Interventions included, for example, various instrumental or vocal versions of classical compositions, Jazz, world music, and meditative songs to name just a few genres. Classical music (Classical or Baroque period) for treatment was used in nine articles. Notable composers were W.A. Mozart, L. v. Beethoven and J. S. Bach. Jazz was used five times for intervention. Vernon Duke (Title: &#x0201c;April in Paris&#x0201d;), M. Greger (Title: &#x0201c;Up to Date&#x0201d;), or Louis Armstrong (Title: &#x0201c;St. Louis Blues&#x0201d;) are some of the featured artists. The third major genre researchers used for their experimental groups was percussion and drumming-based music.</p><p>Significant criteria were complete trial duration, amount of intervention sessions, age distribution within participants, and individual or group setting. We compared passive listening to recorded music (e.g., CD), with active experiencing of live music (e.g., singing, improvising with instruments). Furthermore, the analysis of similar studies has enhanced and complemented our work. Previous studies indicated positive effects of music on emotions and anxiety, what we tried to confirm in more detail. The length of an entire music treatment procedure was suspected to be an important element for reducing symptoms of depression. A longer treatment duration of 7 weeks for an individual, compared to nearly 6 weeks in a group setting led to better (i.e., above average) outcomes. Although a difference was discovered, 1 week was not enough to draw further conclusions for each and every project. As far as intervals between sessions were concerned, we found no differences between those research articles that were among the best, compared to the remaining experimental designs. Consequently no trend was becoming apparent, favoring one over the others. We further investigated if there was any association between an individual or a group setting, if the length of a single session and trial duration were compared with regard to symptom improvement. Groups showed better improvements in depression, if each session had an average duration of 60 min, and a treatment between 4 and 8 weeks long. In comparison, the two variables, session length and trial duration, had different effects for individual treatment approaches. Above average results were found for sessions lasting 30 min combined with a treatment duration between 4 and 8 weeks. Furthermore, results were compared according to age groups (&#x0201c;young,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;medium,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d;). Overall, elderly people benefitted in particular from this kind of non-invasive treatment. During, but mainly after completion of music-driven interventions, positive effects became apparent. Those included primarily social aspects of life (e.g., an increased motivation to participate in life again), as well as concerned participants' psychological status (e.g., a strengthened self-confidence, an improved resilience to withstand stress).</p><p>We described similarities, the integration of different music intervention approaches had on participants in experimental vs. control groups, who received an alternative, or no additional treatment at all. Additional questionnaires confirmed further improvements regarding confidence, self-esteem and motivation. Trends in the improvement of frequently occurring comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, sleeping disorders, confidence and self-esteem)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0048"><sup>48</sup></xref>, associated with depression, were also discussed briefly, and showed promising outcomes after intervention as well. Particularly anxiety (Sartorius et al., <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Tiller, <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) is known to be a common burden, many patients with mood disorders are additionally affected with. Interpreted as manifestation of fear, anxiety is a basic feeling in situations that are regarded as threatening. Triggers can be expected threats such as physical integrity, self-esteem or self-image. Unfortunately, researchers merely distinguished between &#x0201c;anxiety disorder&#x0201d; (i.e., mildly exceeded anxiety) and the physiological reaction. Also, the question should be raised if the response to music differs if patients are suffering from both, depression and anxiety. Sleep quality in combination with symptoms of depression (Mayers and Baldwin, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) raised the question, whether sleep disturbances lead to depression or, vice versa, depression was responsible for a reduced quantity of sleep instead. Most studies used questionnaires that were based on self-assessment. However, it is unclear whether this approach is sufficiently valid and reliable enough to diagnose changes regarding to symptom improvement. Future approaches should not solely rely on questionnaires, but rather add measurements of physiological body reactions (e.g., skin conductance, heart and respiratory rate, or AEP's via an EEG) for more objectivity.</p><p>The way auditory stimuli were presented, also raised some additional questions. We found that for individual intervention most of the times headphones were used. For a group setting speakers were the number one choice instead. For elderly participants, a different sensitivity for music perception was a concern, when music was presented directly through headphones. Headphones add at least some isolation from background noises (i.e., able to reduce noise disturbances and surround-soundings). Another concern was that most of the time a certified hearing test was not used. Although, a tendency toward a reduction in the ability to hear higher frequencies is quite common with an increased age, there might still be substantial differences between participants.</p><p>Two authors (Deshmukh et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Silverman, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reported that participants within their respective music intervention group, did not present a significant reduction of depression. Those two had almost nothing in common<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0049"><sup>49</sup></xref> and were not investigated further.</p><p>Control groups, who received an alternative (&#x0201c;non-music&#x0201d;) intervention, were found in nine research articles. Significant reduction of depression in corresponding control (&#x0201c;non-music intervention&#x0201d;) groups was reported by two authors (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In one instance (Albornoz, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) the relevant participants received only standard care, but in the other case (Hendricks et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) an alternative treatment (Cognitive-Behavioral activities) was reported. Medical conceptions are in a constant state of change. To achieve improvements in areas of disease prevention and treatment, psychology is increasingly associated with clinical medicine and general practitioners. Under the guidance of an experienced music therapist, the patient receives a multimodal and very structured treatment approach. That is the reason why we can find specialists for music therapy in fields other than psychosomatics or psychiatry today. Examples are internal medicine departments and almost all rehabilitation centers. The acoustic and musical environment literally opens a portal to our unconscious mind. Music therapy often comes into play when other forms of treatment are not effective enough or fail completely.</p><p>Music connects us to the time when we only had preverbal communication skills (Hwang and Hughes, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Graham, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; i.e., communication before a fully functioning language is developed; e.g., infants or children with autism spectrum disorder), without being dependent on language. Although board-certified music therapy is undeniable the most regulated, developed and professional variant, this should not hinder health professionals and researchers from other areas in the execution of their own projects using music-based interventions. The only thing they should be very precise about, is the way they define their work. Within our selection of articles the expression music therapy was used sometimes, although a more detailed description or specific information was neither published nor available upon our request. In those cases, the term &#x0201c;music therapy&#x0201d; should not be used, but instead music medicine or some of the alternatives mentioned in this manuscript (e.g., therapy with music, music for treatment). This way many obstacles as well as misunderstandings can be prevented in the first place, but high-quality research is still produced. Also, it is very important that researchers contemplate and report the details of the music intervention that they use. For example, they should report whether the music is researcher-selected or participant-selected, the specific tracks they used, the delivery method (speakers, headphones), and any other relevant details.</p><p>Encouraged by the promising potential of music as an intervention (Kemper and Danhauer, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), we pursued our ambitious goal to contribute knowledge that provides help for the affected individuals, both the patients themselves as well as their nearest relatives. Furthermore, we wanted to provide detailed information about each randomized controlled study, and therefore made all our data available, so others may benefit for their potential upcoming research project. The overall outcome of our analysis, with all significant effects considered, produced highly convincing results that music is a potential treatment option, to improve depression symptoms and quality of life across many age groups. We hope that our results provide some support for future concepts.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>DL (Substantial contributor who meets all four authorship criteria): (1) Project idea, article concept and design, as well as planning the timeline, substantially involved in the data, material, and article acquisition, (2) mainly responsible for drafting, writing, and revising the review article, (3) responsible for selecting and final approving of the scholarly publication, (4) agreed and is accountable for all aspects connected to the work.
