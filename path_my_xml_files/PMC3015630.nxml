No patients received any infertility drugs for 4 months before the study. At the time of study entry, each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: Group I, each ovary was cauterized to a change in depth of 5 points; Group II, each ovary was cauterized to a change in depth of 10 points; Group III, each ovary was cauterized to a change in depth of 15 points.</p><p>All laparoscopies were performed with the patient under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube installed by the senior author of this article. After inserting of an 11-mm trocar intraumbilically, the single laparoscope (Storze, Germany) was passed into the pelvic cavity. Then a 6-mm suprapubic trocar was inserted in the left side.

Armer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> used 4 points of ovarian cauterization and stated that ovarian diathermy can initiate regular ovulation in women with polycystic ovaries although the mechanism is uncertain. On the other hand, Neather<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> emphasized the importance of androgen-making tissues. He showed that a decrease in total serum testosterone concentration is proportional to the number of points of cauterization.</p><p>However, Armer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> believe that using more points of ovarian cauterization increases the risk of periadenexal adhesion that could have negative effects on future pregnancies of the patient.</p><p>To our knowledge, no prospective, randomized study answers this contradiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Our study showed that pregnancy rates and, more importantly, live birth rates are significantly higher at 15 points of cauterization compared with 5 points and 10 points. Because more damage to the ovary could increase the risk of adhesion formation and at the same time result in a greater decrease in androgen-making tissues, our study shows that the decrease in androgen-making tissues is more important. Our previous finding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> showing that the rate of adhesion formation after ovarian cauterization is generally low, supports our present findings.</p><p>Furthermore, Greenblatt and Casper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> found no correlation between the degree of ovarian damage and subsequent adhesion formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In a prospective, randomized study of 187 patients with PCOD, we found that ovarian cauterization of 15 points results in higher pregnancy and live birth rates compared with the rates with cauterization of 5- and 10-points.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support was provided by Dabirashrafi Fertility and Endoscopy Research Center, Tehran, Iran.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
