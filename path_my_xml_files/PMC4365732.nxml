Axial SpA encompasses a spectrum of disease, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and axial SpA without radiographic evidence of AS (nonradiographic axial SpA) (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There are often long delays between symptom onset and diagnosis, since back pain from axial SpA can be difficult to distinguish from more common causes of back pain. Historically, diagnosis has been challenging in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA because of the lack of definitive structural changes on SI joint radiographs. Nevertheless, the burden of disease is similar across the axial SpA spectrum (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and patients with AS and nonradiographic axial SpA often suffer for many years before a diagnosis is made.</p><p>Due to the chronic nature of axial SpA, treatments must be tolerable and efficacious in controlling the signs and symptoms of disease over the long term. Current pharmacologic treatments are limited to either nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or a limited number of anti&#x02013;tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>); hence, there is a substantial need for additional treatment options in this disease area. Furthermore, treatment options are especially limited for patients with nonradiographic axial SpA, with only 3 anti-TNF agents licensed for the treatment of nonradiographic axial SpA in the European Union (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The long-term safety and efficacy data available for axial SpA treatment are predominantly focused on the AS subpopulation (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), with limited data available in the broader population of patients with axial SpA.</p><p>RAPID-axSpA is the first trial to present data on the efficacy of an anti-TNF agent across the broad spectrum of patients with active axial SpA as defined by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), including both patients with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA. In this trial, it was shown that certolizumab pegol (CZP), a PEGylated Fc-free anti-TNF agent, rapidly reduced the signs and symptoms of axial SpA in the broad population of patients with axial SpA over 24 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Here we present the first long-term data directly comparing outcomes in patients with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA, and we report the long-term efficacy and safety data for 2 CZP dosing regimens (200 mg every 2 weeks and 400 mg every 4 weeks) from the dose-blind (week 24&#x02013;48) and early open-label (week 48&#x02013;96) treatment periods of the RAPID-axSpA trial.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RAPID-axSpA trial have been reported previously (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Eligible patients had active disease (Bath AS Disease Activity Index [BASDAI] [14] &#x02265;4 and spinal pain &#x02265;4), had an inadequate response to &#x02265;1 NSAID, and fulfilled the ASAS criteria for adult-onset axial SpA (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The study included patients with AS (&#x0003e;50% of patients) and patients with nonradiographic axial SpA (no definitive sacroiliitis on radiography), as defined by the modified New York criteria (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Here we report the outcomes of the dose-blind (to week 48) and early open-label extension (to week 96) treatment periods. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo or to receive CZP 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4 (loading dose) followed by either CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks. Patients originally randomized to receive CZP in the double-blind phase continued to receive their assigned dose in the dose-blind phase and open-label extension. Patients randomized to receive placebo who were nonresponders according to the ASAS criteria for 20% improvement (ASAS20) (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) at both weeks 14 and 16 or patients randomized to receive placebo who completed the 24-week double-blind phase entered the dose-blind phase and were rerandomized 1:1 to receive CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks following the CZP loading dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A, RAPID-axSpA trial design: certolizumab pegol (CZP) in active axial spondyloarthritis.

Efficacy outcomes reported here include self-reported assessments for back pain and disease activity (0&#x02013;10 numeric rating scales), as well as health-related quality of life, which was assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) mental and physical component summaries (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed as an objective measure of inflammation. Spinal mobility and functionality were assessed using the Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI) linear score (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Efficacy results to week 96 are presented using composite end points validated for use by ASAS (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>): ASAS20, ASAS40, ASAS partial remission, and ASAS5/6 criteria. The BASDAI and AS Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) were used to assess disease activity (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition to absolute scores, we report the proportion of patients in whom a &#x02265;50% improvement in the BASDAI from baseline (BASDAI 50), ASDAS major improvement, and ASDAS inactive disease criteria were achieved. ASDAS major improvement was defined as a reduction in ASDAS of &#x02265;2 from baseline, and ASDAS inactive disease was defined as an ASDAS of &#x0003c;1.3.</p><p>The long-term safety of CZP was investigated through analysis of adverse events (AEs) at every study visit to week 96. For laboratory analyses of plasma concentrations of anti-CZP antibodies, levels of &#x0003e;2.4 units/ml at &#x02265;1 study visit were considered positive (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to identify a potential increase in the risk of tuberculosis infection with CZP treatment, the sponsor required that all patients have a systematic purified protein derivative (PPD) test (and/or interferon-&#x003b3;&#x02013;release assay [IGRA]) at weeks 48 and 96, regardless of risk of tuberculosis (signs, symptoms, or close contact with a tuberculosis patient). All cases of PPD &#x02265;5 mm or suspected tuberculosis were reviewed post hoc by independent experts. Active tuberculosis was confirmed according to the World Health Organization criteria for tuberculosis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The majority of efficacy outcomes are presented for all patients randomized to receive either CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks at baseline (randomized set), although selected data are also shown for patients who were rerandomized from placebo to either of the CZP dose regimens at week 16 or 24. Response rates (%) were calculated using nonresponder imputation (NRI), and quantitative assessments are shown as arithmetic means and use last observation carried forward imputation. Observed data are also shown for patients completing week 96. Analyses are presented in the overall axial SpA population and for the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations. Data are shown with no inferential statistics. Safety data are presented for all patients treated with &#x02265;1 dose of CZP at any stage of the 96-week trial period (safety set). Placebo-treated patients rerandomized to receive CZP were included from the date of their first CZP injection. Geometric means for CZP plasma concentrations were analyzed for all subjects from the safety set who had valid pharmacokinetic assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>Of a total of 325 patients who were randomized, 218 received CZP (200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks) from week 0 (randomized set). Of these patients, 203 (93%) remained in the study to week 24, 191 (88%) to week 48, and 174 (80%) to week 96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>B). Between week 24 and week 48, 3 patients (1.4%) withdrew due to an AE, 3 (1.4%) due to lack of efficacy, and 5 (2.3%) due to other reasons. Between week 48 and week 96, 11 patients (5.0%) withdrew due to an AE, 2 (0.9%) due to lack of efficacy, and 4 (1.8%) due to other reasons. The numbers of patients who withdrew from the study were similar in both the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</p><p>Of the 315 patients who received any dose of CZP, 35 (11.1%) experienced an AE leading to discontinuation of study drug. Of these patients, 6 (1.9%) withdrew due to infection (the most frequent cause). Of note, 14 patients (4.4%) were withdrawn by the sponsor due to their having a PPD tuberculin skin test &#x0003e;5 mm (and one positive IGRA test). According to study protocol, the PPD test was performed in all patients, including those who were asymptomatic or had no additional risk factors for tuberculosis.</p><p>Of the 107 patients originally randomized to receive placebo, 56 (52.3%) entered an early escape phase (according to study protocol) and were rerandomized in a double-blind manner at week 16 to receive CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (n = 27) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (n = 29) following a CZP loading dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>B). At week 24, 41 placebo completers were rerandomized to receive CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (n = 20) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (n = 21) following a CZP loading dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>B). The proportions of placebo completers were similar between the 2 subpopulations: of the 41 patients, 18 (43.9%) had nonradiographic axial SpA and 23 (56.1%) had AS.</p><p>Disease characteristics were similar between all populations for those patients randomized to receive CZP at baseline (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). It was noted that placebo-treated patients who demonstrated a clinical response at week 14 or 16 and continued to receive placebo until week 24 had less severe disease activity at baseline compared with placebo-treated patients who did not respond clinically (and who therefore withdrew from the placebo arm at week 16) (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table 1</xref>, available on the <italic>Arthritis &#x00026;

The plasma concentration of CZP was lower in patients with anti-CZP antibodies than in those without (geometric mean 2.5 units/ml and 19.7 units/ml, respectively). Since the number of patients developing anti-CZP antibodies was relatively low, an investigation into efficacy in this subgroup of patients was not carried out.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The rapid improvements observed over the first 24 weeks of the RAPID-axSpA trial in clinical measures of efficacy and patient-reported outcomes were maintained in both CZP dosing regimens and in both AS and nonradiographic axial SpA patients throughout the dose-blind treatment period (in which patients and investigators were blinded with regard to CZP dosing regimen to week 48) and the open-label extension period (week 48 to week 96). Indeed, for some outcome measures, slight improvements were observed between week 24 and week 96.</p><p>RAPID-axSpA is the first study to investigate the efficacy of an anti-TNF agent in the broad population of patients with axial SpA, including both those with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA. Baseline disease activity, as measured by BASDAI and ASDAS, was similar in the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations. The similarities between these subpopulations in terms of disease characteristics and burden (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) underline the need for more treatment options to be available across the broader population of patients with axial SpA. The similarity in improvements observed across both patients with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA indicates that CZP is efficacious for the treatment of patients with axial SpA with objective signs of inflammation, independently of whether the patient has sufficient structural damage in the SI joints to meet the modified New York classification criteria for AS.</p><p>RAPID-axSpA is also the first study to report long-term efficacy data for patients with axial SpA, who were required to have CRP levels and/or evidence on MRI indicative of SpA for inclusion in the trial; these characteristics have been associated with a good response to anti-TNF treatment. The maintenance of response seen with continued CZP treatment to week 96 confirms its long-term efficacy in axial SpA patients with objective signs of inflammation. Additionally, the similar long-term reduction in disease activity for both CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks and CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks is important, since this may offer the treating physician more freedom to switch between the dosing regimens.</p><p>The ASAS20 scores observed over the first 96 weeks of the RAPID-axSpA trial were comparable to those observed over a similar time period with adalimumab treatment of patients with nonradiographic axial SpA (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and with etanercept (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), adalimumab (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), infliximab (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and golimumab (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) treatment of AS patients. However, care must be taken when interpreting intertrial comparisons, since different studies use different patient populations, trial designs, and data analysis methods. Here we reported ASAS20 response rates conservatively using NRI as well as observed data, according to recommendations for reporting long-term results (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Consistent with previous reports of CZP in axial SpA (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), AEs were predominantly mild to moderate in nature, with 9.8% of AEs considered to be severe and with a serious AE event rate of 10.9/100 patient-years. There were no malignancies or deaths observed over the 96-week trial period and no new safety signals identified compared with previous reports of CZP.</p><p>The presence of anti-CZP antibodies was low in this trial, with only 9 of 215 patients testing positive at week 96 (4.2%). Due to the low numbers of anti-CZP&#x02013;positive patients, an investigation into the impact of antibody levels on treatment efficacy was not carried out.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations, including the lack of a placebo arm beyond week 24, and limitations inherent to the unblinded nature of the open-label study period. Furthermore, no radiographic data are presented here, precluding any analysis of disease progression from nonradiographic axial SpA to AS.</p><p>In this study, the rapid improvements in clinical outcomes observed in axial SpA patients treated with CZP over 24 weeks were maintained through the dose-blind phase to week 48 and the open-label extension to week 96 in both the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations. This maintenance of efficacy was observed when CZP was administered as either 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. The safety profile of CZP in patients with axial SpA over a period of 96 weeks was comparable with that reported over shorter time periods and in other indications, with no new previously unreported safety signals occurring over the 96-week trial period.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
