These changes in lipid homeostasis were accompanied by in vivo insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance and associated with increased phosphorylation of protein kinase C &#x003b8;, inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1, and a decreased activation of protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) in liver and skeletal muscle in response to insulin.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>IUGR enhances specific deleterious metabolic responses to a HF diet.

Moreover, several obesity-related pathologies are reaching record prevalence among youth and are resulting in substantial costs for the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although most elements of metabolic syndrome (MetS) have a complex pathophysiology, characterized by both a strong influence of inherited factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and environmental variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), it is clear that behaviors such as decreased physical activity and consuming high-fat (HF) and hypercaloric Western diets also play a major role in their pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Interestingly, there is a tremendous variability in the responses of different individuals to similar environmental, nutritional, and behavioral conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) that have primarily been attributed to genetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, a growing body of evidence suggests that adverse environmental conditions during crucial periods of development may also predispose individuals to exhibit different components of the MetS in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition in which the fetus does not reach its growth potential for a given gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). IUGR constitutes one of the most common pathological conditions diagnosed during pregnancy, affecting over 15% of all pregnancies in the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Beyond the well-described association between IUGR and higher rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality, being born with IUGR has also been associated with the development of most components of MetS in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although the etiology of IUGR is considered multifactorial, in most instances, fetal growth is constrained by a limitation of oxygen and nutrient delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A substantial body of epidemiological and basic fundamental evidence supporting the effect of prenatal environment on the future development of obesity and other components of the MetS are based on epidemiological observations made in subjects exposed to nutritional restriction during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Given the limitations of studying the developmental origins of MetS with clinical or epidemiological approaches, several animal models using a variety of prenatal nutritional insults (such as global food restriction, protein restriction, micronutrient restriction, and excess fat feeding) have been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study, in which IUGR was induced in rats by surgical ligation of the uterine arteries, demonstrated that prenatal reduction in the uterine blood supply caused insulin resistance and hyperleptinemia in offspring at 8 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, the impact of fetal hypoxia specifically on the future susceptibility to develop metabolic alterations is still unknown. This prenatal insult is relevant because many conditions that are associated with fetal hypoxia, such as placental insufficiency, preeclampsia, maternal anemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking, are highly prevalent in Western societies, are strongly associated with IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and could have fundamentally different programming mechanisms and effects.</p><p>Using a well-characterized experimental murine model of hypoxia-induced IUGR that mimics complications commonly observed during human pregnancy, we previously showed that adult IUGR offspring born from a hypoxic environment have impaired vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), have increased cardiac susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and develop left ventricular hypertrophy (only in males) and diastolic dysfunction (both in males and females) as the rats age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that aging itself constitutes a stressor that affects offspring born with IUGR with higher severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Moreover, during a pilot study using the hypoxia-induced IUGR model, we observed that during aging, male IUGR offspring tended to accumulate more pericardial and intra-abdominal fat relative to sex- and age-matched controls. To study potential long-term effects of prenatal fetal hypoxia, the objectives of this study were to investigate whether hypoxia-induced IUGR increases susceptibility to obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance in young adult rats exposed to a HF diet and to examine signal transduction pathways that may contribute to the long-term metabolic effects of being born from pregnancies complicated with IUGR.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Hypoxia-induced IUGR model.</title><p>Female SD rats were obtained at 3 months of age (Charles River, Quebec, Canada), acclimatized, and then mated within the animal facility. Throughout pregnancy, rats were given ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory murine food (LabDiet Ref. 5001; 3.02 kcal/mg, 23% protein, 4.5% fat, 6% fiber). On day 15 of pregnancy, rats were randomized to continue in normal environmental conditions (controls, <italic>n</italic> = 6) or placed inside a chamber continuously infused with nitrogen to maintain an oxygen concentration of 11.5% during the last 6 days of pregnancy (IUGR, <italic>n</italic> = 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), dams exposed to hypoxic environments exhibit a decrease in food intake (&#x0223c;40%); however, they also exhibit a substantial decrease in physical activity. At the time of birth, litters were reduced to eight male pups, which were then weaned at 3 weeks of age and housed two per cage. All procedures in this study were approved by the University of Alberta Animal Welfare Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Diet-induced obesity and MetS.</title><p>After weaning, male offspring from each experimental group (controls, <italic>n</italic> = 36; IUGR, <italic>n</italic> = 36) were randomly allocated to receive either a low-fat (LF) diet (10% fat, Research Diets D12450B) or a HF diet (45% fat, Research Diets D12451) as we and other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have previously described (detailed diet compositions are given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db10-1239/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Therefore, four different experimental groups were created: control offspring receiving LF diet (<italic>n</italic> = 18 from six litters), control offspring receiving HF diet (<italic>n</italic> = 18 from six litters), IUGR offspring receiving LF diet (<italic>n</italic> = 18 from six litters), and IUGR offspring receiving HF diet (<italic>n</italic> = 18 from six litters). Rats were then randomly assigned to three possible experimental subgroups (designated A, B, or C) that determined the measurements performed on these animals. Because all rats included in each experimental group belonged to a different litter, we used the offspring as the unit of analysis. Rats were given ad libitum access to either diet. Nine weeks after weaning, experimental analyses were performed. The length of the nutritional intervention was selected based on previous studies in rodents that demonstrated the induction of several metabolic changes using similar nutritional insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Food intake, body weight, and body composition analyses.</title><p>After weaning, food intake and body weight were measured for all animals twice per week.

Blood samples were collected and serum was then separated by centrifugation and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Circulating concentrations of insulin were determined using a radioimmunoassay kit for murine insulin (Cat. No. EZRMI-13K; Linco, St. Charles, MO). The lowest detectable level of insulin using this assay was 0.2 ng/mL. The intra-assay variability was &#x0003c;10%. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Millipore&#x02019;s Biomarker Services performed a multiple adipokine determination using an Adipokine Panel 5-plex (Milliplex System, Millipore, St. Charles, MO) on a Luminex 100 machine (Millipore). The reported minimal detectable concentrations for this technique are 9.7 pg/mL leptin, 6.1 pg/mL adiponectin, 1.2 pg/mL interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, pg/mL IL-6 8.8, and 3.2 pg/mL tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;.

For the insulin tolerance test, human recombinant insulin (Novolin) was used to prepare an insulin-saline solution that was injected intraperitoneally (1 mU/kg) after a 2-h fast.

Specifically, we demonstrated that hypoxia-induced IUGR increases the susceptibility to HF diet&#x02013;induced alterations of fat distribution, lipid metabolism, and insulin-signaling pathways. The data presented herein provide four important findings. These include <italic>1</italic>) IUGR significantly influences fat deposition, with HF-fed IUGR rats having significantly elevated amounts of intra-abdominal fat and larger adipocyte diameters than control rats in the absence of changes in whole-body adipose tissue mass; <italic>2</italic>) IUGR results in a significant increase in plasma and tissue lipid concentrations in response to a HF diet compared with HF-fed controls; <italic>3</italic>) IUGR contributes to an increased susceptibility to HF diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance by altering skeletal muscle and liver insulin-signaling pathways; and <italic>4</italic>) IUGR results in decreased physical activity relative to control rats independent of diet.</p><p>Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of IUGR in the development of MetS and provide considerable insight into why subjects in the Western world born with IUGR may require closer clinical monitoring and could obtain greater benefit from nutritional interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. The important clinical implications of these findings are discussed below.</p><sec id="s26"><title>IUGR, HF diet, fat distribution, and lipid metabolism.</title><p>Contrary to the results reported by other groups using nutritional restriction to induce IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), offspring exposed to hypoxia did not exhibit an exacerbated weight gain after birth. Moreover, feeding a HF diet to offspring born with IUGR did not cause rats to gain more weight or increase total body fat content during the early stages of their lifespan. However, relative to all other groups, rats born growth restricted exhibited a notable increase in the proportion of fat located in the intra-abdominal cavity and had a larger adipocyte diameter when fed a HF diet. Interestingly, these changes in fat distribution and morphology were associated with a significant impairment in lipid profile and glucose homeostasis, which suggests that special attention should be paid to the distribution of fat rather than body weight or total body fat content when evaluating cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Most efforts toward understanding the regulation of adipogenesis and adipose differentiation have been made ex vivo using cultures of preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Based on previous studies, it was suggested that adipocyte differentiation is a complex process that can be modulated by multiple stimuli including transcription factors and hormonal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Although little is known about the mechanisms that determine adipose tissue distribution or the differential development of fat deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), our data highlight the potential involvement of prenatal growth as one of the regulators of this process.</p><p>Previous studies in rats also demonstrated that, at the time of weaning, the majority of body fat is located in subcutaneous deposits, but as rats age (2 months later), the majority of body fat is located in the abdominal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Although subcutaneous fat weight increases 6-fold between weaning and adulthood, intra-abdominal fat increases 116-fold during the same period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Because intra-abdominal fat has such a dramatic rate of increase during postnatal stages, it is possible that the catch-up growth of IUGR pups after their birth may contribute to the greater accumulation of abdominal fat and favor a later-stage metabolic dysfunction in IUGR rats. In addition, IUGR rats exposed to a hypercaloric HF diet (but not a LF diet) developed high circulating concentrations of triacylglycerol and free fatty acids, as well as an accumulation of triacylglycerols and ceramides in the liver and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the synergistic effects of both IUGR and diet are associated with an early onset of dyslipidemia in this model.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Effects of IUGR and HF diet on feeding behavior and physical activity.</title><p>Previous studies that evaluated the association between IUGR and the development of obesity concluded that exposure to prenatal insults that lead to IUGR and early postnatal catch-up growth produce permanent changes in neuro-endocrine appetite regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Interestingly, our study also describes an increase in circulating concentrations of leptin and reduced calorie intake in offspring born IUGR. These results suggested that, in our IUGR model, at 12 weeks of age, the appetite regulatory system and the central effects of leptin were at least partially preserved. Despite the reduced consumption of food, abdominal adiposity was still increased in HF-fed IUGR rats, together with elevated tissue and circulating levels of lipids.</p><p>Another interesting finding was that IUGR offspring had a modest decrease in physical activity relative to controls independent of the diet they were receiving. The reduced physical activity was associated with decreased oxygen consumption (<italic>V</italic><sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>). Because energy consumption was also diminished in IUGR rats, the development of intra-abdominal adiposity and other metabolic changes cannot be entirely attributed to reduced energy expenditure. However, it is well known that exercise can improve dyslipidemia and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and it is plausible that decreased physical activity could be associated with accumulation of lipids in the tissues and impaired glucose homeostasis in IUGR offspring fed a HF diet. Although increased adiposity and reduced physical activity in adult IUGR rats may be perceived as a pathological response to the hypoxic insult, it is also reasonable to consider that these adaptations could represent compensatory mechanisms programmed during fetal growth. These compensatory mechanisms may be an adaptation aimed to prepare the developing organism to survive in an oxygen-depleted environment after birth by increasing the ability to accumulate energy and reduce energy demand through decreased physical activity. Consistent with this observation, it has been reported that teenagers born with extremely low birth weight participate much less in sports and are more sedentary than normal birth weight teenagers, despite reporting equal enjoyment of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Whether or not the compensatory adaptation to a growth-restricting environment could also determine the site of adipose tissue deposition is currently unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>IUGR, HF diet, and impaired glucose metabolism.</title><p>Insulin resistance has previously been associated with both the consumption of a HF diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and being born with IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). However, in the current study, we clearly identified an interaction between these two factors by showing that IUGR increases the severity of the hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance that resulted from the challenge of a HF diet. We also show that the changes in glucose homeostasis cannot be attributed to long-term effects of a hypoxic insult on pancreatic development, since pancreas size and pancreatic insulin content were comparable among all experimental groups. In the absence of changes in pancreatic insulin content, the increase in circulating levels of insulin could be attributed to an increase in the secretary activity of the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Moreover, the data presented herein identified defects in the insulin-signaling cascade in relevant organs that play pivotal roles in the development of insulin resistance, such as liver and skeletal muscle. As such, these data suggest that nutritional interventions that decrease the consumption of foods high in fat and sucrose, combined with increased physical activity, could be even more beneficial in preventing or ameliorating the detrimental long-term effects of IUGR on lipid and glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Considering that inflammation has been identified as a potential mediator of obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), it is interesting that no differences were observed in inflammatory markers among the groups. Because these parameters were measured early in life after a short nutritional intervention (9 weeks of diet), it is possible that a proinflammatory phenotype had not yet been established in these animals. Interestingly, changes in insulin homeostasis were notable at this point, which suggests that the major synergistic effects of IUGR and HF diet on glucose homeostasis may not be mediated via inflammatory pathways.</p><p>One limitation of our hypoxia-induced IUGR murine model is that the hypoxic insult affects not only the fetuses, but also the dam; therefore, the potential interaction between fetal and maternal responses to hypoxia should also be considered. Despite these potential confounding variables, the hypoxia-induced IUGR murine model used in this study was extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and is the only noninvasive technique available to induce isobaric fetal hypoxia in rodents.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides strong evidence to support the programming effects of hypoxia-induced IUGR on metabolic function by causing a change in the adipose tissue response to a HF diet and increased the severity of diet-induced adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance. Our results suggest that prenatal insults causing IUGR could play a fundamental role in determining the long-term systemic response to HF diets. Indeed, our results suggest that early metabolic programming could contribute to the observed variability in the response to nutritional interventions and could further the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life, particularly in environments where HF diets are prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db10-1239/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db10-1239/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a research grant from the Women and Children&#x02019;s Health Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a personnel award from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (H&#x00026;S).</p><p>C.F.R.-C., V.W.D., and J.S.M. were supported by H&#x00026;S and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR).
