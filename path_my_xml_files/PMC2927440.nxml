The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels in an avascular retina during the first week of the optical induction of refractive errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three-day-old hatchling chicks were randomly assigned to three groups and either did not wear lenses or were monocularly goggled with &#x000b1;10D lenses for varying times up to 7 days before biometric assessment. Retinal tissue was prepared either for western blot analysis to show the presence of the AQP4 and Kir4.1 protein in the chick retina or for immunolocalization using AQP4 and Kir4.1 antibodies to determine the regional distribution and intensity of labeling during the induction of refractive errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As expected, ultrasonography demonstrated that all eyes showed rapid elongation post hatching. Negative lens-wearing eyes elongated faster than fellow eyes or normal non goggled eyes and became progressively more myopic with time post lensing. Positive lens-wearing eyes showed reduced ocular growth compared to normal controls and developed a hyperopic refraction. Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed the upregulation of AQP4 channel expression on M&#x000fc;ller cells in the retinal nerve fiber layer during the first 2 days of negative lens wear. Kir4.1 channel upregulation in the inner plexiform layer was only found on day 4 of positive lens wear during the development of refractive hyperopia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results indicate that the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels on M&#x000fc;ller cells is associated with the changes in ocular volume seen during the induction of refractive errors. However, the sites of greatest expression and the temporal pattern of the upregulation of AQP4 and Kir4.1 were dissimilar, indicating a dissociation of AQP4 and Kir4.1 function during refractive error development. Increased AQP4 expression in the nerve fiber layer is suggested to contribute to the rapid axial elongation and movement of fluid into the vitreous cavity in the presence of minus lenses; whereas, upregulation of Kir4.1 channels appears to play a role in limiting axial elongation in the presence of plus lenses.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>corr-author</meta-name><meta-value>Crewther</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The processes by which osmoregulation is maintained during rapid growth of organs such as the young eye are unknown. Indeed, fluid dynamics in the eye are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], but it is generally accepted that osmoregulation of the retina is primarily controlled by solute-linked transport through the ion channels and transporter mechanisms of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the M&#x000fc;ller glial cells that span the retina from the vitreal border to the sub-retinal space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>The importance of the M&#x000fc;ller glial cells in retinal osmoregulation began to emerge after the discovery of specialized transmembrane water channels known as aquaporins (AQPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. AQP0, AQP1, AQP4, and AQP9 proteins have all been found in mammalian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], but it is the AQP4 channel that has been localized to the M&#x000fc;ller cell endfeet in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] and chicks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] and has been linked to the redistribution and absorption of ischemia-induced edema in the retina and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>AQP4 expression has also been reported to be co-localized with Kir4.1, the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, on the endfeet processes of astrocytes in the brain and retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Typically, these retinal regions of co-localized Kir4.1 and AQP4 channels act as potassium [K<sup>+</sup>] sinks for regulating high concentrations of [K<sup>+</sup>] in the extracellular space around active neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. This physical coincidence led to early suggestions of the coupling of water transport and K<sup>+</sup> regulation by M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], though more recent studies have failed to demonstrate changes in Kir4.1 expression or K<sup>+</sup> currents in AQP4 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].</p><p>The temporal and spatial relationship between AQP4 and Kir4.1 channel expression has not been explored thoroughly and never in a retina without intrinsic blood vessels, where the lack of blood vessels means K<sup>+</sup> shunting is more tightly regulated by M&#x000fc;ller cells. Indeed the absence of inner retinal blood vessels and astroglia allows a unique opportunity for the study of the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 on M&#x000fc;ller cells. Thus it was chosen to investigate the spatial and temporal sequence of the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels during ocular growth in the avascular chick retina, where control of the axial length and volume have been linked to alterations in the rate of transretinal fluid transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>].</p><p>Refractive compensation to minus lenses leads to abnormal increases in axial length and ocular volume and myopia; whereas, compensation to plus lenses leads to smaller than normal eyes with hyperopic refractive errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. To date, there has been little consideration of the expression of proteins expected to be involved in the osmoregulatory mechanisms of fluid transfer that are required to achieve these rapid changes in ocular volume, apart from our recent reports demonstrating changes in the distribution of the ions across the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] and an upregulation of AQP4 channel expression during the induction of form deprivation myopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. This is the first study investigating the spatial and temporal changes in the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels in an avascular retina during the first week of the development of optically induced myopic and hyperopic refractive errors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and rearing</title><p>One hundred and two hatchling chicks (Leghorn/Australorp) were raised with unlimited food and water in a controlled environment on a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle and with the temperature maintained at 30&#x02013;31&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C from the day of hatching. All chicks were randomly assigned to one of three monocular goggle groups: No Lens (n=35), optical defocus of &#x02212;10D goggles (n=33), or +10D goggles (n=34). Monocular defocusing goggles (&#x000b1;10D made with modified human polymethyl methacrylates (PMMA) contact lenses of 8.1&#x000a0;mm in diameter) were attached to Velcro<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> and affixed to the periocular feathers for varying times from day 3: T=0 h (day 0; n=3), T=days 1&#x02013;2 (n=37), days 3&#x02013;4 (n=38), and days 5&#x02013;7 (n=24). These particular time points were chosen to represent important times in the normal development of ocular growth and the early changes in growth seen in response to the introduction of ocular defocus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Fellow eyes from experimental animals and both eyes from untreated age-matched No Lens animals acted as controls. Chick health and lens cleanliness were monitored twice daily. Retinal tissue was taken from four adult Hooded Wistar rats at 6 months of age. Rats were raised with unlimited food and water in a controlled environment on a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle. They were killed by decapitation, and the tissue was then harvested for protein extraction within 1 min. All animals were raised and sacrificed in strict accordance with the La Trobe University Animal Ethics Committee guidelines. The regulations of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and the United States NIH document &#x0201c;Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals 1996&#x0201d; were followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Biometric analysis</title><p>At the end of the period of defocus induction, biometrics were conducted using retinoscopy (Riester, Jungingen, Germany) to determine the refractive error and ultrasonography (Ophthasonic A-Scan III: 7 MHz probe, Teknar, Inc. St Louis, MO) to determine the axial length (anterior cornea to internal limiting membrane of the retina). All experimental procedures were performed under general anesthesia induced by an intra-muscular injection of a mixture of Ketamine (45&#x000a0;mg/kg) and Xylazine (4.5&#x000a0;mg/kg). Following anesthetic overdose and decapitation, the eyes from both the chicks and rats were enucleated and the anterior one-third of the eye was dissected away to reveal the eye cup. Posterior eyecups were immediately prepared for immunohistochemical labeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Posterior eyecups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 0.01M phosphate buffer, 0.0027 potassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH7.4; Sigma-Aldich, St Louis, MO) for 5 min each, and incubated overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Prior to sectioning, the eyes were embedded in O.C.T. compound (ProSciTech, Thuringowa, QLD, Australia) and frozen on dry ice. Embedded tissue was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Sections of the posterior eye cup (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) were cut on a Leica CM 1850 cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) and thaw-mounted and dried on StarFrost positively charged slides (ProSciTech) before being stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunolabeling of AQP-4 and Kir4.1 was conducted using immunohistochemistry as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Briefly, following rehydration with PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h in a 3% goat serum blocking solution with Triton X-100, followed by primary antibody application overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with either rabbit anti-rat AQP4 antibody (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or rabbit anti-rat Kir4.1 antibody (1:333; Chemicon) and rabbit anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP; 1:100 or 1:500; Sigma, Carlsbad, CA), a reactive marker for M&#x000fc;ller cells. Sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa 596-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) diluted to 1:400. Negative control sections were processed with the primary antibody omitted from one section per slide. All sections were coverslipped with gel mount mounting medium (ProSciTech). Labeled sections were observed under a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). Labeling at the posterior pole was examined for both regional distribution and change in intensity. Sections were viewed at 40&#x000d7; magnification and images captured with the Leica software set at 6&#x000d7; full frame averaging. Images were obtained from pre-determined photomultiplier settings (700 V and 750 V) and constant laser intensity for comparisons of the intensity of labeling between the optically defocused eyes and control eyes.</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis</title><p>Mean luminance values for labeling were determined from brightness histograms, as it is generally accepted that pixel intensity is proportional to chromagen concentration under particular defined conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. In all images, the inner retina was labeled brightest; hence, labeling intensity (luminance) was analyzed for the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and the inner plexiform layer (IPL). For both experimental and control groups, mean luminance values were obtained from the luminance histogram determined using the NIH Image (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) to select the area for analysis across the breadth of one field of view for the NFL and IPL. The fellow control eye was chosen as the point of comparison in all analyses to control for between-animal differences in eye size.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>To obtain material for western blot analysis, retinal tissue (retina/RPE/choroid) was obtained from three normal white leghorn chicks and from three adult Hooded Wistar rats for comparisons between species. The extraction of proteins was conducted by homogenization of tissue in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.5% (V/V) Triton X-100, 0.1% (W/V) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Protein content was determined using a Pierce Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Waltham, MA). For SDS&#x02013;PAGE, protein samples (120&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/lane) were diluted in Laemli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Gladesville, NSW, Australia) and resolved on a ready-made 12% TRIS-HCl gel (Biorad Laboratories). Following electrophoresis, immunoblotting was performed by electrotransferring the protein to a Nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in transfer buffer (25&#x000a0;mM Tris, 192&#x000a0;mM glycine, 20% methanol [v/v], pH 8.3). The membrane with blotted proteins was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder, 1% (w/v) BSA (BSA), and 0.1% TWEEN 20, followed by incubation overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with polyclonal rabbit antirat AQP4 (diluted 1:1,000; Chemicon International). After four washes with TBS containing 0.05% TWEEN 20, the membrane was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Peroxidase activity was visualized using Lumiglo chemiluminescence reagents (Roche) processed on autoradiographic film. Blots were re-probed with &#x003b2;-actin antibody (1:10,000; mouse monoclonal antibody; Sigma) to verify equal protein loading.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>ANOVA (SPSS) was performed between the optically defocused eye and the fellow control eye to determine differences in labeling intensity according to the degree of lens defocus applied and the length of defocus time. Post hoc analyses were undertaken using either Student&#x02013;Newman&#x02013;Keuls or Games-Howell tests where appropriate. Quantitative data are presented as means&#x000b1;SEM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Axial length and refraction changes</title><p>As evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, all chick eyes examined continued to grow in the first week of life, though the rate of growth varied with the sign of the applied defocus.

This is the first time AQP4 and Kir4.1 channel expression has been examined concurrently in an in vivo model during the development of optical defocus-induced changes in the rate and volume of eye growth. It is readily apparent that an upregulation of Kir4.1 was not associated with a concomitant increase in AQP4 channel expression; rather, we have demonstrated a dissociation of the expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels on M&#x000fc;ller cells in the avascular retina.</p><p>Abnormal axial elongation induced by negative optical defocus was associated with an early upregulation of AQP4 channel expression in the NFL but not in the IPL; whereas, restriction in axial elongation induced by plus lens defocus was associated with an upregulation of Kir4.1 channels in the IPL but not in the NFL later in the induction of hyperopia. Furthermore, we have shown an association between the expected rapid increase in ocular volume and myopic refraction and AQP4 expression in the NFL, but no significant changes in Kir4.1 expression were found compared to No Lens eyes. However, during the induction of hyperopic refractions and the associated restricted ocular growth, Kir4.1 channel expression was only found to increase at days 3&#x02013;4 even though AQP4 expression did not significantly differ from that measured in the No Lens eyes in any layer. As suggested earlier, this dissociation was not entirely unexpected because such a dissociation has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. In a recent in vitro patch clamp study of isolated M&#x000fc;ller cells, Ruiz and colleagues report little effect on Kir4.1 channel activity and no changes in Kir4.1 expression or K<sup>+</sup> currents in AQP4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present study of the avascular chick retina, Kir4.1 expression was predominantly found on M&#x000fc;ller cell processes extending throughout the inner retina, from the vitreo-retinal border and at the outer limiting membrane. Enhanced expression localized to sublaminae within the IPL has been assumed to be associated with Kir channels on the horizontal processes of the M&#x000fc;ller cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. The lamination and division of the numerous fine filamentous processes in the IPL of the avian retina are believed to represent a specific adaptation to the high need for the spatial buffering of K<sup>+</sup> ions following neuronal activity in the extracellular space of the inner retina in the absence of retinal blood vessels and associated astroglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Thus, in the present study, the enhanced expression of Kir4.1 in the IPL in hyperopic eyes may suggest that Kir4.1 function in the chick exhibits properties relating to K<sup>+</sup> influx, as opposed to the efflux properties suggested to be characteristic of Kir4.1 channels located at the vitreo-vascular interface in vascularized mammalian retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Indeed, Kir4.1 is known to facilitate both inward and outward K<sup>+</sup> currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The increase in Kir4.1 expression found in the chick IPL during hyperopia could be in response to increased K<sup>+</sup> release in the extracellular space surrounding synapses following neuropil activation in a retina lacking inner retinal capillaries. Further, the enhanced Kir4.1 expression was found particularly in sublamina A of the IPL, which could reflect an increase in K<sup>+</sup> release in the extracellular space surrounding OFF center bipolar ganglion cell synapses following activation of the OFF pathway under the influence of positive lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, our previous biometric studies have also demonstrated that inhibition of the OFF response by pharmacological suppression results in the inhibition of hyperopic development to plus lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Thus, enhanced Kir4.1 expression in the inner retina appears to be functionally linked to reduced axial elongation and growth and refractive compensation to plus lens defocus. By comparison, no significant difference in Kir4.1 expression was observed in normally growing No Lens eyes or the faster growing minus lens-wearing myopic eyes.</p><p>As expected from our earlier studies that demonstrated upregulated AQP4 channel expression during form-deprivation myopia (FDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], the elevation of AQP4 at the vitreo-retinal border during minus lens-induced myopic development was also seen here. These findings support our earlier suggestion that myopic development is associated with the upregulation of water channels during the time of greatest axial growth changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Such an increase in AQP4 channels at the vitreo-retinal border would support enhanced water movement from the inner retina to the vitreous cavity via the M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. In addition, the timing of this upregulation corresponds with the time of greatest change in myopic refractive development.</p><p>As AQPs are known to facilitate transcellular water movement in response to osmolarity changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], the AQP4 upregulation observed during the induction of myopia in the present study is consistent with previously described changes to ion and water distribution patterns in FDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Recovery from FDM has been shown to be accompanied by rapid dissipation of the abnormally high levels of potassium ions in the sub-retinal space and outer retina and more gradual dissipation of elevated sodium and chloride ion levels in the inner and outer retina and choroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Ultrastructural studies also show the expansion of the choroidal blood vessels and lymphatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] during refractive recovery and return of ionic homeostasis. The results of the present study showing a change in the expression of both AQP4 and Kir4.1 channels during imposed optical defocus provides further support for the involvement of osmoregulatory mechanisms in ocular growth. To date, the osmoregulatory mechanisms associated with the induction of hyperopia have received little attention; in fact, this study is the first to examine the changes in expression of some osmoregulatory mechanisms during the induction of hyperopic refractive errors. Further studies investigating the change in transretinal fluid movements and the associated osmoregulatory mechanisms underlying hyperopic development are necessary to elucidate this area more completely.</p><p>In summary, we have reported significant changes in the expression of molecular mechanisms associated with retinal osmoregulation and water movement, i.e., AQP4 and Kir4.1 expression within the inner retina in response to imposed defocus and rapid changes in ocular volume. The results demonstrate that the upregulation of AQP4 channel expression in the NFL is likely to be the conduit for water movement during the most rapid expansion of the vitreous chamber volume during early development of myopia. Furthermore, the later increase in the expression of Kir4.1 channels in the IPL of the retina, particularly in sublamina A, during the restriction of ocular growth is likely to be in response to the need for potassium movement out of the extracellular space and around the OFF pathway neurons as a consequence of refractive compensation to plus lens defocus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors would like to thank Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council Development Grant # 448606 to D.P.C. and S.G.C.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><name><surname>Takanosu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Le Goff</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayne</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of the posterior ciliary body in the biosynthesis of vitreous humour.</article-title><source>Eye</source><year>2002</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>454</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12101453</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Candia</surname><given-names>OA</given-names></name><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fluid transport phenomena in ocular epithelia.</article-title><source>Prog Retin Eye Res</source><year>2008</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>197</fpage><lpage>212</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18289913</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>To</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name><name><surname>Shahidullah</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Do</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The mechanism of aqueous humour formation.</article-title><source>Clin Exp Optom</source><year>2002</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>335</fpage><lpage>49</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12452784</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Hughes BA, Gallemore RP, Miller SS.
