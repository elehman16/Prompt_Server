Exenatide, the first GLP-1 agonist to be Food and Drug Administration approved, and other members of this class of drugs have been shown to improve fasting and postprandial blood glucose and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (A1C) and to promote weight loss, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Few reports have focused on GLP-1 agonist treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes. Herein, we report the effects of 6 months of therapy with exenatide in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes focusing on outcomes related to glucose homeostasis, including fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin sensitivity, as determined by the reference glucose clamp method (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><sec id="s1"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>The current ancillary study to a clinical trial was conducted to ascertain whether exenatide could improve &#x003b2;-cell function in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This study (clinical trial reg. no. NCT00064714, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) was performed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, after obtaining institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Twenty subjects (nine male) with long-standing type 1 diabetes (mean duration 21.3 &#x000b1; 10.7 years) were enrolled, and their insulin treatment was optimized as previously reported (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). After a 3-month run-in period during which no further insulin dose changes were made, patients were randomized to continue insulin or insulin plus exenatide (with or without daclizumab) for 6 months, after which treatment assignment for exenatide was reversed. Exenatide was administered subcutaneously at a starting dose of 2.5 &#x003bc;g twice a day and gradually increased to 10 &#x003bc;g four times a day. Prandial insulin doses were reduced by 50% at the initiation of exenatide therapy and then gradually increased, with blood glucose goals of 80&#x02013;140 mg/dL (home blood glucose monitoring was performed approximately seven times a day and recorded on an electronic worksheet).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design and timeline for testing. Twenty patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes were enrolled, 14 completed both treatment periods, and 13 completed two hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies at the end of periods A and B. Analyses focused on exenatide treatment. The interaction between exenatide and daclizumab was nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.87); thus, the daclizumab and no-daclizumab groups were combined in the analyses of exenatide.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="666fig1"/></fig><p>Thirteen of the 14 subjects who completed the trial participated in two 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, which were conducted at the end of the 6-month treatment periods on and off exenatide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These 13 subjects comprised the subgroup included in the present analyses. Subjects fasted overnight, and a basal insulin drip (Humulin; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was adjusted to maintain euglycemia overnight. Glucose concentrations were maintained at 100 &#x000b1; 10 mg/dL, and no insulin dose changes were made for 4 h before the clamp study. A cannula was placed into the dorsum of the hand, which was warmed with a heating blanket to 41&#x000b0;C to arterialize the blood. Insulin was infused at a constant rate of 120 &#x000b5;U/m<sup>2</sup>/min with a Razel calibrated syringe pump. After starting the insulin infusion, glucose analyses were performed every 5 min at the bedside with a blood glucose analyzer (YSI 2300 Stat; YSI, Yellow Springs, OH). Dextrose infusion (20%) was adjusted to maintain blood glucose at &#x0223c;90 mg/dL. The amount of glucose infused during the last 60&#x02013;120 min of the clamp at steady state reflected the glucose disposal rate, which was normalized for body surface area and steady state clamp plasma insulin concentration to calculate an insulin sensitivity index (SI) expressed in mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min per &#x000b5;U/mL.</p><p>Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS Enterprise Guide version 5.1. Because 50% of subjects also received daclizumab, two-way ANOVAs were run to assess daclizumab treatment and its possible interaction with exenatide. Because the interaction was nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.87), the daclizumab and no-daclizumab groups were combined in the analyses of exenatide. Mixed models (PROC MIXED) were used to determine changes in weight, fasting and postprandial glucose, A1C, and insulin requirements on versus off exenatide, assessing the effect of treatment order (exenatide first vs. second) as a covariate. There was no significant effect of treatment order for any outcome; thus, paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess differences between on and off exenatide periods. Mixed models were used to assess change in SI on and off exenatide, adjusting for change in body weight. Data are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the 13 subjects at enrollment are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was 37.3 &#x000b1; 10.7 years, and mean diabetes duration was 20.5 &#x000b1; 11.8 years. Mean BMI was 26.1 &#x000b1; 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and mean A1C was 7.0 &#x000b1; 0.8%. At the conclusion of the run-in period, weight was 77.7 &#x000b1; 11.0 kg, A1C was 6.4 &#x000b1; 0.7%, and insulin requirements were 0.55 &#x000b1; 0.12 units/kg/day (0.31 &#x000b1; 0.08 units/kg/day meal associated and 0.24 &#x000b1; 0.09 units/kg/day basal). Exenatide use was associated with an average weight loss of 4.2 kg over 6 months (from 76.9 &#x000b1; 11.3 kg off exenatide to 72.7 &#x000b1; 11.8 kg on exenatide, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Postprandial glucose has emerged as a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk compared with fasting glucose (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This effect mostly resulted from a slowing of gastric emptying (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Unlike in subjects with type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), we did not observe lower fasting glucose concentrations in the present patients, which might be explained by the inability of exenatide to effectively inhibit glucagon secretion with resultant unopposed hepatic glucose production (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We and others have shown a lack of glucagon suppression with exenatide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), which contrasts the findings of Dupr&#x000e9; et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Possible explanations for the discrepancy among these studies are variable disease duration and duration of exenatide treatment.</p><p>Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes has recently received more attention (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Of note, 70% of the subjects had an initial SI at or below the cutoff for insulin resistance (5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/min per &#x000b5;U/mL), and 85% had a marked improvement beyond what was expected as a result of weight reduction alone. This action of exenatide leading to improvement of whole-body insulin-mediated glucose utilization has previously been shown in animal models (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), but the exact mechanisms in humans remain unclear. Possible pathways include activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leading to increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and fat concordant with results in L6 myoblasts and 3T3 adipocytes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The present study is limited by its small sample size, higher doses of exenatide than typically administered in clinical practice, and subjects&#x02019; excellent glycemia at baseline. We also did not differentiate between hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity by using stable isotopes in the clamp studies. Nevertheless, the observed effects of exenatide have potential clinical applicability. This pilot study suggests the need for further investigation to determine whether the improved insulin resistance we observed can be achieved with conventional doses of GLP-1 agonists. In summary, exenatide holds promise as an adjunctive agent to insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes, mainly for its beneficial effects on postprandial blood glucose and insulin sensitivity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.</p><p><bold>Duality of Interest.</bold> A Co-operative Research and Development Agreement was established between the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which provided funding for a research nurse, T-cell assays, and hormone assays performed by Esoterix.
