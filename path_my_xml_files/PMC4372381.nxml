The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of combined supplementation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and arginine on intermittent sprint performance in simulated handball games on 2 consecutive days. Methods: Fifteen male and seven female handball players consumed 0.17 g/kg BCAA and 0.04 g/kg arginine together (AA trial), or placebo (PB trial) before exercise. Each trial contained two 60-min simulated handball games on consecutive days. The game was consisted of 30 identical 2-min blocks and a 20 m all-out sprint was performed at the end of each block. The performance, measured by percentage changes of sprint time between day 1 and 2, was significantly better in the AA trial (first half: AA trial: -1.34&#x000b1;0.60%, PB trial: -0.21&#x000b1;0.69%; second half: AA trial: -1.68&#x000b1;0.58%, PB trial: 0.49&#x000b1;0.42%). The average ratings of perceive exertion throughout the 2-day trial was significantly lower in the AA trial (14.2&#x000b1;0.3) than the PB trial (15.1&#x000b1;0.4). Concurrently, post-exercise tryptophan/BCAA ratio on both days in the AA trial was significantly lower than the baseline. This study showed that BCAA and arginine supplementation could improve performance in intermittent sprints on the second consecutive day of simulated handball games in well-trained athletes by potentially alleviating central fatigue.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is supported by the grant,NSC-98-2320-B-028-001-MY3, from the National Science Council, Taiwan.

One of the proposed mechanisms that contribute to central fatigue is the increase in blood concentration of free tryptophan and hence the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The elevated plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration during sustained exercise could increase the plasma level of free tryptophan because they compete for the same binding site in albumin [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The transport of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier is the rate-limiting step in the cerebral synthesis of serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Serotonin in the brain is involved in the control of arousal, sleepiness and mood. Therefore, it has been suggested that the activation of the brain serotonin system would lead to the development of fatigue during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To support this hypothesis, the time to exhaustion in endurance exercise was significantly decreased by the administration of serotonin agonists, while it was increased by serotonin antagonists or inhibitors of serotonin synthesis in humans and rats [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been proposed to alleviate central fatigue due to their ability to compete with tryptophan in crossing blood-brain barrier through the same L-system transporter [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the decreased plasma tryptophan/BCAA ratio after BCAA supplementation would reduce the cerebral uptake of tryptophan and, subsequently, serotonin synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Indeed, animal studies have shown that BCAA could increase running time to exhaustion, which is accompanied by the reduced plasma free tryptophan/BCAA ratio and exercise-induced cerebral synthesis and release of serotonin [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, most human studies have failed to find improvement in endurance performance [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although the indicators of central fatigue, such as perceived ratings of fatigue and cognitive functions, were improved after BCAA supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>One possible explanation for the lack of effect of BCAA supplementation on exercise performance in humans is the accompanied further increase in NH<sub>3</sub> production, resulted from the elevated BCAA oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It would result in elevated cerebral uptake and accumulation of NH<sub>3</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], leading to central fatigue by alterations of cerebral energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and signaling pathways within the neuron [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the potential benefit of BCAA on central fatigue may be offset by the simultaneous increase in NH<sub>3</sub>. Arginine has been suggested to be able to reduce exercise-related accumulations of NH<sub>3</sub> by increasing urea cycle [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and vasodilation [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the current study combined BCAA and arginine to alleviate central fatigue by decreasing tryptophan/BCAA ratio while preventing hyperammonemia.</p><p>Most studies investigating the effect of BCAA on central fatigue and performance focused on a single bout of endurance exercise. One form of exercise that has received little attention is the intermittent sprint, an important activity pattern in many team sports, such as handball, basketball, and soccer. A recent study has shown the decreases in cognitive function and reactive motor skills after exhaustive intermittent exercise in athletes, indicating the presence of central fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The fatigue factors may become more prominent during national and international tournaments in these sports because the competitions are usually arranged on consecutive days. However, the role of central fatigue in consecutive days of intermittent exercise has not been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the combined supplementation of BCAA and arginine on performance in intermittent sprints in simulated handball games on 2 consecutive days in well-trained athletes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were 15 male and 7 female well-trained handball players recruited from National Taiwan University of Sport, Taichung, Taiwan.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that showed the combination of BCAA and arginine could induce a small but significant improvement in performance in intermittent sprints on the second consecutive day in well-trained subjects. The improvement may result from the reduced central fatigue as indicated by lower RPE in the AA trial. However, the central fatigue may be mediated by factors in addition to the reduced serotonin synthesis.</p><p>The development of fatigue on day 2 was evident in the PB trial. The sprint time was significantly increased by 1.01&#x000b1;1.49% on the second half, compared to the first half on day 2. On the other hand, in the AA trial the average sprint time on the second half was similar to that in the first half on day 2. In further analysis, the difference between the sprint time on day 1 and day 2 were significantly decreased in the AA trial, compared to the PL trial, indicating an improvement in sprint performance on day 2 in the AA trial.</p><p>The average RPE throughout the 2-day trial was indeed significantly lower in the AA trial (14.2&#x000b1;0.3) than the PB trial (15.1&#x000b1;0.4, p = .005). Concurrently, post-exercise tryptophan/BCAA ratio on both days in the AA trial was significantly lower than the baseline level. Nevertheless, post-exercise tryptophan concentration and tryptophan/BCAA ratio remained unchanged in the PB trial, indicating no change in the cerebral serotonin production. It is plausible that the lower tryptophan/BCAA ratio in the AA trial would further reduce the cerebral serotonin synthesis, resulting in lower RPE and better performance.</p><p>The central fatigue theory proposed by Blomstrand et al. (1988) has been supported in animal studies. The administration of BCAA or L-system transporter inhibitor significantly increased exercise time to exhaustion in rats by decreasing synaptosomal tryptophan and serotonin synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, most human studies failed to find ergogenic effect of BCAA in a single bout of intermittent [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or endurance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], despite that some researchers reported reductions in central fatigue. In the present study, significant reductions in tryptophan/BCAA ratio after exercise were found on both days in the AA trial. However, the improvement in sprint performance was only found on day 2. It is possible that the negative effect of central fatigue on physical performance only becomes evident under more physiologically and psychologically stressful conditions after the accumulation of fatigue from the previous day. It could also at least partially explain the disconnection between central fatigue and physical performance in studies using a single bout of exercise.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the subjects in both trials did not show an increase in total tryptophan concentration after exercise. As the result, total tryptophan/BCAA ratio remained unchanged after exercise in the PL trial. Although free tryptophan concentrations were not measured in this study, it is reasonable to assume that they were increased after exercise in both trials because the elevated plasma free fatty acid would compete with tryptophan for the same binding site in albumin [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, post-exercise free tryptophan/BCAA ratio would be higher than the baseline level in the PL trial. The higher free tryptophan/BCAA ratio would lead to increased serotonin production and central fatigue. In the AA trial the elevated plasma BCAA level would be sufficient to offset the increased free tryptophan concentration, resulting in lower post-exercise free tryptophan/BCAA ratio. Another possibility is that central fatigue in intermittent exercise is mediated by factors in addition to tryptophan/BCAA ratio. Brain function is extremely complicated and involves numerous neurotransmitters. It is very likely that more than one neurotransmitter is responsible for central fatigue. The serotonin functions may be regulated by the interactions with other neurotransmitters such as catecholamines and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The hypothesis that serotonin/dopamine ratio, rather than serotonin alone, contributes to central fatigue has also been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The AA trial showed significantly higher post-exercise NH<sub>3</sub> concentration on both days than that in the PB trial. This is similar to the previous studies using BCAA supplement [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The arginine supplementation failed to prevent the additional NH<sub>3</sub> production, possibly from BCAA oxidation, during the simulated games. It is possible that the large amount of NH<sub>3</sub> production during intermittent sprints may exceed the effect of arginine on urea cycle [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, our well-trained subjects may already have high levels of NO production [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the supplementation of arginine did not provide additional effect on vasodilation and removal of NH<sub>3</sub>. An addition of BCAA-only trial in the future studies would further clarify the role of arginine when co-ingested with BCAA.</p><p>The unique experimental protocol in this study, a simulated game on 2 consecutive days, tried to mimic the actual tournament situations. It allows the investigation of BCAA and arginine effects beyond a single bout of exercise that was used in all previous studies. The activity pattern in the simulated game in this study was similar to real professional competitions. A time-motion analysis study showed that professional male handball players performed 22.0&#x000b1;10.0 sprints with distance of 18.0&#x000b1;6.91 m during a match [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, the simulated game in this study is consisted of 30 sprints of 20 m. The average heart rates during the simulated games (143&#x02013;159 bpm) also resembled those recorded in real competitions (157&#x000b1;18 bpm) [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the simulated game used in this study could reflect the physiological demands of high-level handball competitions.</p><p>In the AA trial, the sprint performance was slightly improved on day 2, compared to day 1. During the simulated game on day 2 in both trials, higher portions of energy were derived from fat, indicated by the higher post-exercise plasma glycerol and NEFA concentrations. It has been shown that BCAA could increase lipid oxidation and the time to exhaustion in glycogen-depleted subjects [<xref rid="pone.0121866.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that BCAA could improve the performance on day 2 by promoting lipid oxidation, in addition to relieving central fatigue. This hypothesis warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggested that supplementation of BCAA and arginine could improve the performance in intermittent sprint on the second consecutive days of simulated games, possibly by alleviating central fatigue. The suppressed serotonin production, resulted from decreased tryptophan/BCAA ratio may play a role in reducing central fatigue. The results of this study have significant practical applications because the athletes of team sports frequently compete on consecutive days in tournaments. The effect of BCAA and arginine on other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and catecholamines that may be involved in central fatigue need to be further examined. In addition, future studies could add a BCAA-only trial to further clarify the role of arginine on NH<sub>3</sub> removal and central fatigue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121866.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist information.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121866.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121866.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dataset of the results.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121866.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0121866.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
