Knowing the exact position of the fetal head is a pre-requisite for safe instrumental delivery. Traditionally, diagnosis of the fetal head position is made on transvaginal digital examination by delineating the suture lines of the fetal skull and the fontanelles. However, the accuracy of transvaginal digital examination can be unreliable and varies between 20% and 75%. Failure to identify the correct fetal head position increases the likelihood of failed instrumental delivery with the additional morbidity of sequential use of instruments or second stage caesarean section. The use of ultrasound in determining the position of the fetal head has been explored but is not part of routine clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A multi-centre randomised controlled trial is proposed. The study will take place in two large maternity units in Ireland with a combined annual birth rate of 13,500 deliveries. It will involve 450 nulliparous women undergoing instrumental delivery after 37&#x02009;weeks gestation. The main outcome measure will be incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position. A study involving 450 women will have 80% power to detect a 10% difference in the incidence of inaccurate diagnosis of the fetal head position with two-sided 5% alpha.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is both important and timely to evaluate the use of ultrasound to diagnose the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery before routine use can be advocated. The overall aim is to reduce the incidence of incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery and improve the safety of instrumental deliveries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN72230496</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fetal head position</kwd><kwd>Second stage of labour</kwd><kwd>Intrapartum ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Instrumental deliveries are commonly performed in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with rates of 12 &#x02013; 17% in most centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Few studies have addressed error rates in ultrasound determined fetal head position among novice ultrasonographers and only two studies have reported error rates of transabdominal scan within a research setting (6.8% and 7.9% respectively) with another study reporting inability to diagnose the fetal head position in 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Clinical assessment prior to instrumental delivery, factors associated with difficulty in determining the fetal head position, approaches used to enhance determination of the fetal head position, perceived accuracy rates in assessment of the fetal head position and willingness to participate in a clinical trial of ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery were explored. There were conflicting opinions on the role of abdominal ultrasound in enhancing determination of the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery, indicating the need for evaluation within a randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. More than half the obstetricians agreed that there was a need for a trial and would participate in such a trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation study</title><p>Prior to starting this study, it was important to compare the accuracy of diagnosis of the fetal head position in the second stage of labour by ultrasound scan performed by a novice sonographer and by clinical assessment, to that of an expert sonographer (gold standard); and to evaluate the acceptability of ultrasound in the second stage of labour to women and clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We recruited sixty women who had: (i) an abdominal scan performed by a novice; (ii) an abdominal scan performed by an expert ultrasonographer; and (iii) a clinical assessment performed by an obstetrician or midwife; in the passive second stage of labour. Each assessor was blinded to the findings of the others. The ultrasound findings of the novice and expert ultrasonographer were consistent in 52 (87%) cases for the fetal head position and the novice made no occipito-anterior/occipito-posterior (OA-OP) errors. The clinical diagnosis of the fetal head position was incorrect in 25 (42%) cases with 8 (13%) OA-OP errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We used these findings as an estimate of the primary outcome for the power calculation, Women and clinicians did not consider the ultrasound assessment to be intrusive. In summary, we found that an abdominal scan by a novice ultrasonographer is an accurate and acceptable method of diagnosing the fetal head position in the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><sec><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of this study is to compare routine clinical assessment of the fetal head position alone versus clinical and ultrasound assessment of the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The primary outcome is to compare the incidence of incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position</title><p>The secondary outcomes are:</p><p>to compare the incidence of neonatal trauma, low Apgar scores, fetal acidosis or admission to the neonatal unit</p><p>to compare the incidence of primary postpartum haemorrhage, third and fourth degree perineal tears or prolonged postnatal admission</p><p>to compare the incidence of sequential use of instruments, instrumental delivery with more than one operator, failed instrumental delivery, transfer to theatre or caesarean section</p><p>to compare the decision-delivery intervals</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recruitment and intervention</title><p>Recruitment of women to the study will follow a three stage process.</p><p>(1) All potentially eligible women will be given written information about the study in the antenatal clinic.

The women will be assessed by abdominal and digital vaginal examination prior to instrumental delivery. Following clinical assessment, location of the fetal occiput in relation to pelvic landmarks will be indicated visually by way of a cross on a data sheet depicting a circle, like a clock, divided into 24 sections, each of 15 degrees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The position will then be classified as OA for direct occipito-anterior, ROA and LOA for right and left occipito-anterior respectively; OP for direct occipito-posterior, ROP and LOP for right and left occipito-posterior; ROT and LOT for right and left occipito- transverse respectively. The obstetrician may then proceed to instrumental delivery. The full clinical assessment, delivery procedure, delivery outcome and measures of early morbidity will be recorded on a standard instrumental delivery proforma.

In addition they will receive an ultrasound scan to assess the position of the fetal head and spine. Immediately before or after the clinical examination and before application of the instrument, the fetal head position will be determined sonographically by a trained research fellow. The research fellow will be trained before the start of the trial by a consultant sub-specialist in fetal and maternal medicine and perform a minimum of thirty five ultrasound assessments in the second stage of labour as described in the validation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For all ultrasound assessments, image- directed pulsed Doppler equipment (Sonosite Titan) with a multifrequency sector array transabdominal transducer, and a 3.5&#x02009;MHz sector ultrasound probe, will be used.</p><p>With the patient in a supine position the ultrasound transducer will first be placed transversely over the maternal abdomen and moved longitudinally to identify landmarks for the fetal spine and head position as described in the validation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The transabdominal probe is then rotated through 90 degrees, to obtain the transverse view of the fetal spine. Following this, a sliding motion towards the fetal head will be made to obtain a view of the following midline fetal cranial structures: midline cerebral echo, falx cerebri and thalamus and anterior or posterior cranial structures including the orbits and nuchal region. The fetal head position will then be classified as previously described. The obstetrician will be informed of the ultrasound findings to facilitate decision making and may then proceed to instrumental delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome measure is incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position. Most errors of clinical diagnosis are where the position is classified as occipito-anterior but is in fact occipito-transverse or occipito-posterior. Incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position will be established according to any of the following criteria:</p><p>i) Position of the head at the time of delivery</p><p>If the position of the fetal head was classified as occipito-anterior and is delivered occipito-posterior the diagnosis of the fetal position will be considered incorrect.</p><p>ii) Instrument markings on the neonatal head and face</p><p>The neonatologist or midwife who attends the delivery will examine the baby. He/she will be asked to record the markings of the instrument on a drawing of the head and lateral aspects of the face (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The recorded markings will be used to indicate misplacement of the instrument at a distance from the flexion point (vacuum) or over the face (forceps). If for example the recorded position prior to instrumental delivery was occipito-anterior and the instrument placement suggests an occipito-transverse or occipito-posterior position the diagnosis of the fetal position will be considered incorrect. Furthermore, the diagnosis will be considered incorrect if the markings are more than 45<sup>0</sup> from the documented fetal head position.</p><p>iii) Position at caesarean section</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Data sheet: instrument markings on neonatal head and face.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2393-12-95-2"/></fig><p>If the delivery is completed by caesarean section the operator will record the position of the head at delivery. If the position of the fetal head was defined as occipito-anterior but is in an occipito-posterior position at caesarean section the diagnosis of the fetal position will be considered incorrect. This information will be cross-referenced with the instrument markings recorded by the neonatologist in cases where there was an initial attempt at instrumental delivery.</p><p>The primary outcome will be validated independently by a single investigator who is not involved in scanning or the delivery by reviewing the trial documents (fetal head position recorded by the obstetrician, diagrammatic records of instruments markings on the neonate and documented position of the head position at delivery as described above). Trial allocation will be concealed from this person. Two additional data items will be recorded; i) where the position has been correctly identified the application of the instrument will be classified as optimal or sub-optimal based on the instrument markings and ii) where there is discordance between the findings of the clinician and ultrasonographer the researcher will record whether the ultrasound finding was accepted or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary neonatal outcomes will include trauma, low Apgar scores, low arterial blood gases and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Neonatal trauma will include bruising, laceration, cephalhaematoma, retinal haemorrhage, facial nerve palsy, brachial plexus injury and fractures. Paired cord blood gases will be taken routinely to measure arterial and venous pH and base excess. Arterial pH below 7.10 and base excess greater than &#x02212;12.0&#x02009;mmol/l will be used as the threshold to define significant fetal acidosis.</p><p>Secondary maternal outcomes will include extensive perineal tearing involving the anal sphincter (third or fourth degree tears), postpartum haemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, and length of postnatal hospital stay. Primary post partum haemorrhage is defined as an estimated blood loss at delivery and in the first 24&#x02009;hours of more than 500mls. Postnatal stay will be considered prolonged if more than 3&#x02009;days&#x02019; duration. Maternal and neonatal complications will be defined clinically according to the attending clinicians.</p><p>Procedural issues will be recorded in terms of place of delivery, need for senior obstetric support, transfer to theatre, use of sequential instruments, failure of instrumental delivery or proceeding directly to caesarean section and the decision to delivery interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Clinical follow-up of the mother and neonate will be completed prior to hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial end</title><p>The trial will be considered complete after the final review of the last subject participating in the trial. Trial completion will be notified to the Competent Authority and the Ethics Committee using the appropriate form.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis and reporting will proceed according to CONSORT guidelines for randomised controlled trials, and will be conducted blinded to group status by the trial statistician and researcher. The first stage of analysis will be to use descriptive statistics to describe recruited individuals in relation to those eligible, and to investigate comparability of the trial arms at baseline. The primary analysis will involve an intention-to-treat comparison between the two groups for the primary outcome adjusted for stratification/minimisation factors &#x02013; this will include study centre. Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar way. All analyses will use appropriate (that is, logistic or linear) regression models, with results presented as point estimates (odds ratios or difference in means), 95% confidence intervals and p values. Further secondary analyses will involve planned subgroup analyses and will use multivariable regression models with appropriate interaction terms to ascertain any differential effects in relation to, choice of instrument and operator experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility</title><p>We have completed a prospective cohort study and multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing restrictive versus routine use of episiotomy at instrumental delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interventional studies in the second stage of labour require great sensitivity in terms of appropriate recruitment, randomisation and follow-up. A large number of women need to be approached in the antenatal period of whom only a small proportion will ultimately be invited to participate in the trial. The number of women who are eligible but not recruited needs to be recorded. Obstetricians and midwives are under pressure when planning instrumental delivery in the second stage of labour which needs to be taken in to consideration when designing a second stage clinical trial. Our research team has extensive experience of performing studies in this context and the proposed study design and sample size reflects an accurate estimate of what is feasible within the proposed time frame and available resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The rate of inaccurate diagnosis (difference of more than 45 degrees) was hypothesized to be 20% in the usual care arm (clinical assessment alone) and 10% in the intervention arm (clinical assessment and ultrasound). With 225 women per arm, the study will have 80% power with 5% two-sided alpha, to detect the hypothesized 10% difference. However, it is possible that inaccuracy rates are being under- or over- estimated. It could be argued that any difference in effect on the primary clinical outcome would be worth detecting. Rather, given the need for timely delivery of evidence, we have specified detectable differences for realistic sample sizes recruited within a reasonable time frame within the constraints of the available funding.</p><p>The combined annual birth rate for the two recruiting hospitals is 13,500, and around 40% of women will be nulliparous, of whom 30% will have an instrumental delivery. We estimate that there will be a total of 3240 instrumental deliveries among nulliparous women over the 24&#x02009;month recruitment period based on hospital statistics for 2007. Allowing for 30-50% exclusion and non-consent, 95% collection of the primary outcome, and recruiting for 24&#x02009;months during office hours yields a conservative estimate of 450 participants (225 per arm) for analysis. This would enable detection of a between-group difference of 10&#x02013;13 percentage points (odds ratio 0.44 to 0.55) with 80% power and 5% two-sided alpha, and would certainly be considered by women and clinicians as worthwhile. These conservative recruitment estimates take account of eligibility criteria, non-english speaking women and the potential difficulty of randomisation and ultrasound evaluation in the context of suspected &#x0201c;fetal distress&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Timetable</title><p>Total 36 months: Commencing 01.12.10 - Estimated completion date 31.12.13</p><p>1&#x02013;6 months: regulatory approvals, pre-trial ultrasound training and pilot study</p><p>7&#x02013;31 months, recruitment, intervention, data collection</p><p>32&#x02013;36 months, data analysis/reporting; Peer-review publications; Presentations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Governance issues</title><sec><title>Ethical committee permission</title><p>Ethical committee approval from the Coombe Women &#x00026; Infants University Hospital and the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital, Limerick, have been granted for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Data management</title><p>Data will be collected on a case report form (CRF) at the time of recruitment by a trained researcher.

To date most studies relating to the use ultrasound for diagnosis the fetal head position have been observational studies with only one small randomised controlled trial found and although the results are promising, this use of ultrasound needs to be formally evaluated within the setting of a clinical trial before its routine use can be advocated.</p><p>Misdiagnosis of the fetal head position at digital vaginal examination is more likely with the clinically important malpositions, especially OP, leading to attempts to deliver vaginally with incorrectly applied instruments. Furthermore, uncertainty about the fetal head position may be a factor in the decision to transfer more women to theatre for a trial of instrument, causing in some cases an unnecessary delay in delivery and wasting valuable theatre time; equally failed instrumental delivery in a labour room due to incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position is associated with increased physical and psychological morbidity. Accurately diagnosing a malposition of the fetal head prior to instrumental delivery may lead to appropriate use of senior support, transfer to theatre for trial of instruments or indeed abandoning the procedure in favour of a caesarean section. The overall aim is to reduce the incidence of incorrect diagnosis of the fetal head position prior to instrumental delivery and improve the safety of instrumental deliveries.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>We aim to raise awareness of this clinical question and our proposed research approach at local, national and international meetings.
