Temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) therapy provides asthma patients at BTS/SIGN step 4/5 an add-on treatment option that is non-invasive and has been shown in clinical studies to improve quality of life for patients with poorly controlled allergic asthma. The objective of this study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness of TLA (Airsonett AB) technology as an add-on to standard asthma management drug therapy in the UK.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The main performance measure of interest is the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for patients using TLA in addition to usual care versus usual care alone. The incremental cost of TLA use is based on an observational clinical study monitoring the incidence of exacerbations with treatment valued using NHS cost data. The clinical effectiveness, used to derive the incremental QALY data, is based on a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial comprising participants with an equivalent asthma condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For a clinical cohort of asthma patients as a whole, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is &#x000a3;8998 per QALY gained, that is, within the &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000/QALY cost-effectiveness benchmark used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Sensitivity analysis indicates that ICER values range from &#x000a3;18&#x02005;883/QALY for the least severe patients through to TLA being dominant, that is, cost saving as well as improving quality of life, for individuals with the most severe and poorly controlled asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our results, Airsonett TLA is a cost-effective addition to treatment options for stage 4/5 patients.

The National Health Service (NHS) spends approximately &#x000a3;1 billion<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> a year on managing people with asthma.</p><p>Patients with severe asthma account for a disproportionate share of the annual healthcare costs given more frequent exacerbations, and an overall higher use of the medical system. In addition to the direct costs, indirect costs, those incurred by patients, family, friends and other care providers, amount to a significant economic impact for society as a whole. Asthma U.K. reports that 1.1 million working days were lost due to breathing problems in 2008/2009.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Asthma in children is a common cause of school absence and, consequently, compromised education, exam results, and therefore, lifetime career opportunities and earnings. There remains an unmet medical need for alternative and complementary approaches to managing asthma that reduce exacerbations, increase symptom control and provide patients with longer term effective therapy.</p><p>The Temperature-controlled Laminar Airflow (TLA: Airsonett AB) device is a non-pharmaceutical treatment that delivers filtered, allergen-free and particle-free air to the patient's breathing zone at night.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It has been shown in two placebo-controlled clinical trials and a pragmatic study to be safe and effective in reducing symptoms of asthma, including exacerbations and airway inflammation, and to improve quality of life.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>TLA is targeted at patients with moderate to severe perennial allergic asthma whose disease control is poor despite compliance with recommended drug therapy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> TLA is intended to complement or obviate the need for use of expensive and/or potent drug therapies that are associated with a greater risk of side effects. However, in order for a novel therapeutic approach to become accepted and recommended strategy, it is necessary to not only demonstrate efficacy but also cost effectiveness.</p><p>The objective of this study was to quantify the health economic value of TLA technology in the UK, based on published evidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The economic analysis is based on the medical resources used by asthma patients participating in the clinical study described in detail in the paper by Schauer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We evaluated the reported usage of health services for all 30 clinical study participants on an intention-to-treat basis for the 12&#x02005;months pre-TLA and post-TLA adoption using English health service costs to determine the incremental cost of treatment.</p><p>For consistency with the Schauer study<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the economic cost-effectiveness of TLA is initially calculated based on the reported clinical outcomes.

These were compared with corresponding data (available for 29 patients) collected retrospectively for the study baseline from medical records at the hospitals or clinics where patients had been treated during the prestudy year. The close alignment between German and UK asthma management guidelines, and the consistent definition of exacerbations enables the usage of medical resources observed in the study to be valued in a UK context based on NHS costs.</p><p>For the purposes of the economic analysis, a record in the clinical study of a patient receiving inpatient treatment is interpreted as &#x02018;One hospital admission in 12&#x02005;months&#x02019;. This approach is conservative for quantifying the economic savings as, in reality, patients may have been admitted on more than one occasion.</p><p>The assumption is that all A&#x00026;E, ICU and hospitalisation events occur as a result of asthma exacerbations. In the majority of cases, the number of exacerbations reported for a patient exceeds the aggregate number of A&#x00026;E, ICU and hospital visits reported. The incremental exacerbations in these cases are presumed to have been treated by a General Practitioner (GP) dispensing medication for the patient to self-administer at home, or the patient increasing their medications following a self-management action plan.</p><p>Two patients in the year prior to using Airsonett reported three hospital episodes without exacerbations. Two patients reported one hospital episode without recording any exacerbation when using the TLA. In each case the cost of the hospital episode has been included in the economic analysis on the assumption that the inpatient visit was asthma related.</p><p>The overall reduction in inpatient episodes during the clinical study is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJRESP2015000117TB1">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="BMJRESP2015000117TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of exacerbations and inpatient episodes reported</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exacerbations</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Emergency room visits</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensive care admissions</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hospital general admissions</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outpatient visits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;Months prior to TLA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">107</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02005;Months with TLA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">39</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reduction</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>TLA, temperature-controlled laminar airflow.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The time a patient remains in hospital is a key driver of treatment cost. For the two modes of admission, A&#x00026;E and general ward admission, the length of stay will vary according to the patient's needs, for example, A&#x00026;E admission is followed by discharge within 4&#x02005;h, or hospital admission, either for a short or long stay.

Results indicate that TLA remains cost-effective with ICER values of &#x000a3;11&#x02005;170, &#x000a3;15&#x02005;108 and &#x000a3;6515 per QALY, respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Severity of condition</italic>: The severity of the patient's condition on arrival at hospital determines the degree of medical attention a patient receives, and their rate of recovery determines their duration of hospital stay; both factors impact the healthcare resources required, and thus, treatment cost.</p></list-item></list></p><p>TLA is targeted for patients with severe uncontrolled perennial allergic asthma, thus, the actual cost to the health service would be greater than the average cost of treatment of patients classified by DRG codes DZ15F and PA12Z.</p><p>To illustrate the variation in treatment costs, the analysis ranks the total actual episode cost per patient from highest to lowest, segregates into quartiles, and calculates the net cost and cost-effectiveness using the average cost by quartile.</p><p>The analyses indicate that valuing the cost of treatment based on the highest cost rates delivers the greatest savings, that is, largest cost reduction, and results in the use of TLA being dominant, that is, cost saving while improving the patient's utility. Treatment costs based on the lowest cost rates results in TLA being cost-effective at an ICER of &#x000a3;15&#x02005;829/QALY.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Inpatient events</italic>: Participants in the Schauer study<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> recorded if they had &#x02018;At least one&#x02019; A&#x00026;E, ICU or hospital visit in the year prior to, or the year following, TLA use.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the absence of more detailed information, the most conservative interpretation of &#x02018;At least once&#x02019; is exactly one inpatient admission. Given that the patient cohort was specifically selected to comprise the more severe and less controlled asthma patients, it is likely that some patients would have experienced more than one A&#x00026;E, ICU or hospital visit during each year in question, particularly for patients with multiple exacerbations.</p><p>Of the eight patients who reported just one exacerbation, these also reported inpatient admission on six of those occasions, that is, a 75% admission rate. Patients who reported three or fewer exacerbations were admitted as inpatients for 73% of their exacerbations. However, patients reporting four or more exacerbations were admitted for only 22% of their exacerbations. The low admission rate for patients with more frequent exacerbations is likely to be attributable to the under-reporting, there is no clinical reason why people with more frequent exacerbations should be admitted to hospital less often.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis assumes that patients reporting four or more exacerbations in a year who were admitted to hospital did so for 50% (rather than 22%) of their exacerbations. This results in the use of TLA being dominant.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Length of inpatient stay</italic>: The shorter the length of stay the lower the treatment costs, and the lower are cost savings using TLA. Under the following two scenarios, first, only half the patients admitted via A&#x00026;E or a general ward remained for a long stay, with half discharged the same day or, second, patients admitted via A&#x00026;E are discharged within 4&#x02005;h (one-third), hospitalised for a short stay (one-third), or hospitalised for a long stay (one-third); the resulting ICERs are &#x000a3;11&#x02005;163/QALY and &#x000a3;13&#x02005;656/QALY, respectively, that is, the use of TLA remains cost-effective.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Intention to treat</italic>: Of the 30 participants in the clinical study, all completed 4&#x02005;months use of TLA, and 27 completed the full 12&#x02005;months. To test the economic impact of using the last observation carried forward for the three individuals who did not complete the full 12&#x02005;months with TLA, the 4-month exacerbation and frequency of inpatient admission for these participants were extrapolated at the observed rate over the full 12&#x02005;months. The resulting ICER under this scenario was &#x000a3;10&#x02005;400/QALY. While this ICER value is higher than the base case &#x000a3;8998/QALY the difference does not impact the overall conclusions drawn from the economic analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Incidence of inpatient admissions without reported exacerbations</italic>: Elimination of inpatient admissions where no corresponding exacerbations had been reported results in an ICER of &#x000a3;9588/QALY, the increase being immaterial to the overall conclusion.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>QALY value</italic>: A change in QALY gain results in an inversely proportional change to the ICER outcome. A 55% decrease in the QALY to 0.0277 is required to generate an ICER of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000/QALY, the cost-effectiveness threshold. A similar increase of 55% in the QALY to 0.0953 reduces the ICER to &#x000a3;5800.

We believe that TLA, by reducing particulate allergen exposure over long periods, is more likely to alter the long-term outcomes beneficially. However, we consider it inappropriate in the absence of long-term trials to make such assumptions.</p><p>Given the significant burden of uncontrolled asthma, TLA as a treatment option that provides short-term clinical and economic benefits, is of interest to patients and society.

Incomplete data may have been obtained from patient records during the pre-TLA period leading to an underestimation of usage of hospital resources, compared with the TLA period consequently an underestimate of savings.</p><p>As there was no control group, spontaneous improvements in medical morbidity would not be identified. While not quantifiable, this is considered a low risk.</p><p>Adherence to treatment may have improved during the observation period of TLA use; the risk of bias was considered minimal given that patients selected had a history of good compliance with treatment. Eligible patients had a considerable disease burden for several years, making previous non-adherence to treatment unlikely.</p><p>From an economic perspective, the valuation of usage of health resources pre-TLA and post-TLA adoption were based on a common set of health service resource costs to eliminate any introduction of economic bias, and to neutralise the possible impact of inflation.</p><p>A degree of uncertainty arises from the QALY calculation. In the absence of quality-of-life data directly available from the Schauer study,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> QALYs were derived from participants in the clinical study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with common characteristics of asthma. The QALY calculations are derived from AQL-5D values, which in the majority of cases are obtained directly from answers to the mini-AQLQ and/or PAQLQ, with good reliability. However, the degree of uncertainty associated with the QALY calculation is not considered material to the overall conclusion regarding the cost-effectiveness of TLA.</p><p>From the Schauer study,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> economic savings in direct NHS medical costs is estimated at &#x000a3;1535 per patient per annum (pp pa). This saving is offset by the TLA cost of &#x000a3;2088 pp pa resulting in a net cost of &#x000a3;553 pp pa to the NHS. The resulting ICER is &#x000a3;8998, that is, it is less than half the &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000/QALY threshold considered as the acceptable cost-effectiveness benchmark used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.</p><p>There is a positive correlation between severity of condition and poor asthma control, and the economic burden to the health service with the most severe cases accounting for a disproportionately large share of both direct and indirect healthcare costs (ie, lost time at work and education).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For certain high-risk individuals, with more severe and less well-controlled asthma, avoidance of two hospital admissions (via A&#x00026;E or general admission), or one ICU admission per year, would result in the TLA therapy being a cost saving to the NHS.</p><p>The economic value of TLA as presented, is likely to be understated due to the prudent interpretation of inpatient episodes from the clinical study, that is, a maximum of one inpatient episode by mode of hospital admission irrespective of the number of exacerbations reported. Increasing the assumed frequency of inpatient visits per exacerbation would result in TLA being more cost-effective and potentially cost saving.</p><p>Improved asthma control provides additional economic and clinical benefits, for example:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The patient's rate of recovery, and hence, duration of hospital stay is a key cost driver of actual costs incurred by the NHS. Improved asthma control, through TLA use, may result in less intensive care or shorter inpatient stay when treating an exacerbation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduced use of rescue medication.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Less absenteeism from work or education for the individual patient, family and care providers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decreasing the incidence of asthma exacerbations improves lung function, thereby, particularly for children, reducing the risk of developing persistent severe asthma.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p>The analysis in this study has shown that TLA provides asthma patients a treatment option that is non-invasive, with demonstrable health and economic benefits. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the economic and clinical value of TLA treatment for asthma sufferers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>Our primary analysis of cost is based on one uncontrolled observational study, and a large placebo-controlled trial to derive the ICER. Our health economic evaluation also uses a number of assumptions, namely, that the pathways of care in Germany are similar to those in the UK, and extrapolates healthcare costs based on UK national averages.</p><p>Clearly, a placebo-controlled trial powered to detect an effect on exacerbations will provide the ultimate confirmation of cost-effectiveness, and such a study is now in progress: Laminar Airflow in Severe Asthma for Exacerbation Reduction (LASER).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>However, we believe, that based on our results, Airsonett TLA provides a cost-effective additional option for the treatment of BTS/SIGN stage 4/5 patients. Further studies into the long-term outcomes of TLA therapy would provide valuable clinical and economic insights.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> US and EH led the clinical research study evaluating temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) as an add-on treatment for patients with moderate to severe atopic asthma poorly controlled with standard medication.
