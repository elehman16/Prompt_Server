In the sub-study, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone were measured during the post-meal period of a mixed-meal breakfast at the final visit.

Glucose incremental area under the concentration curve significantly correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone incremental area under the concentration curve. Insulin incremental area under the concentration curve correlated inversely with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; incremental area under the concentration curve. However, after adjusting for glucose incremental area under the concentration curve, these inverse correlations were no longer significant. Triglyceride incremental area under the concentration curve was not correlated with any biomarker incremental area under the concentration curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with prandial + basal insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes attenuates meal-induced increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; compared with basal insulin.

Post-meal increases in glucose and triglycerides can be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, glycative stress and endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Treatments that target post-meal hyperglycaemia are recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>], but few studies have investigated the impact of therapeutic interventions on the meal-induced inflammatory response in Type 2 diabetes. Decreasing post-meal hyperglycaemia with oral glucose-lowering agents such as mitiglinide and repaglinide can attenuate meal-induced increases in several inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>] and can decrease carotid intima-media thickening in Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the effect of controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with prandial + basal insulin on meal-induced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 in patients with Type 2 diabetes has not been reported.</p><p>Basal insulin is widely recommended for patients with Type 2 diabetes who cannot achieve glycaemic goals with oral glucose-lowering medications alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. Because this regimen may fail to control post-meal hyperglycaemia, an alternate approach is to use prandial + basal insulin as a mixture of short- or rapid-acting and basal insulin in various ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. In individuals without diabetes, approximately 50% of daily insulin secretion is basal, while the remainder is prandial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. Therefore, a 50/50 mix of prandial + basal insulin can approximate normal insulin secretion and we recently showed that it can be used to control both pre- and post-meal hyperglycaemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>].</p><p>We now report a sub-study of the parent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>], where our current goal is to simultaneously measure the changes in plasma hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin-6 after a mixed-meal breakfast in patients with Type 2 diabetes and relate these changes to those of post-meal glucose, insulin and triglycerides. We postulated that controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with a prandial + basal insulin regimen can attenuate meal-induced increases of these inflammatory cytokines. Because post-meal inflammation is potentially influenced by glycative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>], we also studied the concomitant changes in the alpha-dicarbonyls, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone, in the post-meal period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Parent study</title><p>For logistical reasons, this test-meal sub-study was carried out in the cohort of patients enrolled by clinics in the USA who participated in the parent study, a multi-country, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 24-week clinical trial conducted in seven countries, comparing the two insulin regimens on long-term efficacy and safety in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Fifty-six of the 96 patients from US clinics participated in this sub-study. The study was conducted according to the guidelines from the Declaration of Helsinki with approval from a local ethical review board. All patients gave written informed consent.</p><p>The entry criteria and results of the parent study have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Briefly, patients with Type 2 diabetes [ages 35&#x02013;75 years; HbA<sub>1</sub>c 48&#x02013;97 mmol/mol (6.5&#x02013;11%)] using oral glucose-lowering medication(s) alone and/or with once- or twice-daily insulin were recruited. All patients were changed to a regimen containing insulin lispro mix 25 (25% insulin lispro, 75% insulin lispro protamine suspension; LM25; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) subcutaneously before breakfast and evening meal. This was to ensure that insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients would accept insulin therapy and that all patients were on the same insulin regimen when randomized. Metformin was taken orally twice daily and titrated to a maximally tolerated daily dose of 1000 to 2000 mg.</p><p>After 6 weeks of this regimen, patients were randomized to one of two groups: to receive insulin lispro mix 50 (50% insulin lispro, 50% insulin lispro protamine suspension; LM50; Eli Lilly and Company) subcutaneously thrice daily before meals (prandial + basal group) or insulin glargine (Lantus&#x000ae;; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) subcutaneously once daily at bedtime (basal group). Metformin was continued unchanged in both regimens. Both insulins were adjusted to achieve a target fasting blood glucose level &#x0003c; 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl). In addition, patients in the prandial + basal group targeted a 2-h post-meal blood glucose level &#x0003c; 8.0 mmol/l (144 mg/dl). The diet, exercise and concomitant medications plan was not altered during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Test-meal study</title><p>To assess the meal-induced responses of the biomarkers at baseline and ensure that the two groups had similar post-meal responses, test meal 1 was given at the end of the lead-in period (2&#x02013;10 days before randomization). After continuing the specified insulin regimens for 24 weeks, test meal 2 was conducted to test the study hypothesis.</p><p>The standardized test-meal breakfast consisted of a standard commercial breakfast [one bacon, egg and cheese biscuit, one hash brown patty and 8 oz (237 ml) of orange juice], containing 39 g fat, 78 g carbohydrate, 24 g protein and 750 kCal. The night before test meal 1, patients ate their usual evening meal and fasted overnight. All patients took metformin 30 min before and injected LM25 15 min before breakfast. The night before test meal 2, patients ate their usual evening meal and fasted overnight. All patients took metformin 30 min before the test meal. Patients treated with insulin glargine injected it at bedtime the previous night and those treated with LM50 injected it 15 min before breakfast, as they had been doing for the previous 24 weeks. The lunchtime dose of LM50 was omitted on the study day. After the test-meal breakfast, patients were placed under observation and were not allowed to eat for the next 8 h, but had free access to water.</p><p>Blood samples were collected 5 min before the test meal (0 h) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h after to measure the levels and timing of post-meal responses. Levels of plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, chylomicron triglycerides, hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin-6 were measured at each time point. Methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone were measured at 0, 1, 2 and 3 h as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Specimens were shipped to a central laboratory and then to specialized laboratories for analysis as required.</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (Variant; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany) at Covance Central Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Glucose was determined using a hexokinase method (Roche Modular Analyser; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Insulin was measured with a micro-particle enzyme immunoassay (IMX Insulin reagent pack; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Immunonephelometry with the hsCRP reagent from Dade Behring Inc., (Newark, DE, USA) was used to measure hsCRP. Commercially available ELISA kits (Bender MedSystems Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria) were used to assay interleukin-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone were assayed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Plasma and chylomicron triglyceride levels were determined by enzymatic methods with a Beckman Synchron CX7 chemistry analyser (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). Chylomicron fractions (Sf &#x0003e; 400) were isolated using a two-step ultracentrifugation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The outcomes were comparisons between treatment groups for the plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, chylomicron triglyceride, hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone concentrations at each time point. Post-meal total area under the concentration curve (AUC) and incremental AUC of each biomarker during the test meal were also compared. The incremental AUC measured the integrated excursion during the post-meal period by subtracting the fasting value from each parameter value at the designated time during the sampling period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on a previous report that post-meal triglyceride change is associated with changes in interleukin-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], the power calculation for the test-meal sub-study was based on the AUC for chylomicron triglycerides. The study required 48 patients, 24 in each treatment group, to allow detection of a 9.6% between-treatment difference in the change from baseline AUC, tested using a two-sided test at a significance level of 0.05 with 90% power.</p><p>Analyses were performed on data from those patients who completed both test meals: one before randomization and the other after they had been on their study insulin regimen for 24 weeks. Patient characteristics and demographic variables were summarized by treatment group and compared using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for the numeric measurements and a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-square test for the categorical measurements. Statistical analyses for total plasma and chylomicron triglycerides were performed using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test if the normality test passed. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney rank sum test was used if the normality test failed (SigmaStat; Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All other analyses were conducted using SAS version 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). No adjustments for missing data were performed except for the last-observation-carried-forward. An analysis of covariance model was used to compare treatment differences. The test-meal fasting analysis included the corresponding fasting value at the test meal before randomization as a covariate. For the total and incremental AUC analysis, the corresponding test-meal baseline value was used as a covariate and treatment was considered as fixed effect.</p><p>The incremental AUC of the patients who had both test meals was analysed for statistically significant associations with the variables. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the independent effect of post-meal plasma glucose, insulin or triglycerides (the independent variables) on hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone. Statistical adjustments were made for fasting plasma glucose or insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, age, gender and BMI covariates. Partial correlation analysis was performed to explore the strength and direction of the association between plasma glucose, insulin and triglycerides with hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone while adjusting for fasting plasma glucose or insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, age, gender and BMI covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient baseline characteristics and disposition</title><p>Fifty-six patients completed test meal 1 at the end of the lead-in period before randomization. Ten patients discontinued the study before test meal 2 at 24 weeks: four prandial + basal patients (two because of protocol violation, one because of an adverse event and one because of patient decision) and six basal patients (two because of perceived lack of efficacy, two because of move or loss of contact, one because of protocol violation and one because of patient decision). Among those completing both test meals, 25 patients were in the prandial + basal group and 21 patients were in the basal group. Analysis included data from these 46 patients.</p><p>Baseline patient characteristics were similar in both treatment groups, except for younger age in the prandial + basal group (55.1 vs. 59.5 mean years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In this sub-study, 10 (40%) of the 25 patients taking LM50 switched from LM50 to LM25 as their pre-evening meal injection. In the parent study, 53 (33.8%) of the 157 patients taking LM50 switched their pre-evening meal injection to LM25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>].

There were also significant decreases of incremental AUC of inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, interleukin-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) associated with the incremental AUC of glucose. The strong correlations between attenuation of the acute rise in post-meal glucose and inflammatory markers suggest that glucose may be a factor in their release. This is the first study to show that controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with a prandial + basal insulin regimen vs. a basal insulin regimen can attenuate the meal-induced increases in hsCRP, interleukin-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in patients with Type 2 diabetes on metformin.</p><p>Previous studies on post-meal changes in inflammation in patients with Type 2 diabetes showed varied results. For example, a high-fat breakfast increased post-meal plasma interleukin-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], whereas a mixed meal decreased interleukin-6 and TNF- &#x003b1; in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. A commercial meal equivalent meal increased post-meal hsCRP, but not interleukin-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>] and was partially confirmed by a report that a high-fat and high-glucose meal increased plasma interleukin-6 and hsCRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Two previous studies on the relationships between the meal-induced changes in inflammatory markers relative to plasma triglycerides and glucose have also shown mixed results in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Nappo <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant relationship between post-meal changes in triglycerides and TNF- &#x003b1;/interleukin-6 and between post-meal changes in glucose and interleukin-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], while Carroll and Schade found no such correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>].</p><p>Hyperglycaemia has previously been shown to be a major initiator of glycative (dicarbonyl) stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] and the significant relationship of methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone with post-meal glucose in this study confirms this relationship. Cause-and-effect relationships have also been shown to exist between inflammation and glycative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>], suggesting that the elevation of methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone seen in this study could initiate inflammation in the post-meal state. In the current study, however, we observed lower, but not statistically significant, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone incremental AUC group differences in the prandial + basal group relative to the basal group. These findings may be partly attributable to substantial inter-subject data variability and the modest sample size of the study populations. Our decision, based on prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], to measure methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone only during the initial 3 h of the post-meal period could also have led us to miss post-meal changes at later time points, where significant changes were observed for other biomarkers.</p><p>Our finding of an inverse correlation between insulin incremental AUC and that of three inflammatory biomarkers supports the hypothesis that insulin has anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. The loss of this effect when the insulin data were corrected for glucose effect by multivariate analysis suggests that this apparent correlation may be primarily related to glucose change. Dandona <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that insulin has direct anti-inflammatory effects, but, to the best of our knowledge, Dandona <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>] did not correlate the magnitude of the change of anti-inflammatory effect with the change in insulin dose or plasma insulin level. Nor did they correct for the effect of glucose in their studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of insulin. In one study of patients with acute myocardial infarction without diabetes, the rise in inflammation was attenuated in the group receiving insulin infusion compared with the group not receiving insulin, although glucose levels were similar in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. Our study differs from these other studies in the aims and designs of studies, study subjects (subjects with Type 2 diabetes vs. subjects without diabetes), meal challenge (mixed meal vs. oral glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>], except for one study using mixed meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]) and use of constant insulin infusion vs. bolus insulin analogue.</p><p>Although we observed a modest improvement in post-meal plasma and chylomicron triglyceride concentrations with pre-meal prandial + basal over the first 3 h of the post-meal period, we did not see a relationship between changes in plasma triglyceride concentrations and changes in inflammatory markers or glycative stress. This outcome differs from the findings of Nappo <italic>et al</italic>. who showed that post-meal triglyceride change is related to changes in interleukin-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Possible explanations for the difference between our study vs. that of Nappo <italic>et al</italic>. include the amount of fat consumed (39 vs. 50 g), the type of fat consumed, the duration of diabetes (11&#x02013;13 years vs. newly diagnosed) and the type of correlation analysis used (area under the curve over 8 h vs. presumed individual time points). Another study, also using a standard commercial meal, reported no correlation between changes in post-meal triglycerides and those of hsCRP and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>].</p><p>A possible limitation of this study is the age difference between the treatment groups, which could contribute to the differences in biomarker changes. This is unlikely, however, because of the relatively small difference in age between the two groups and our correction by statistical adjustment for age in the regression and correlation analyses. Other factors known to affect inflammatory markers (gender, duration of diabetes or treatment, lipid-altering and anti-hypertensive medications) were similar in both insulin treatment groups. The two groups also did not differ in weight before randomization, nor did either group show significant weight gain during the 24 weeks in this sub-study. It is unlikely that differences between the two groups in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at 24 weeks influenced the acute response in inflammatory biomarkers, because both groups had good overall glycaemic control [HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 46 vs. 52 mmol/mol (6.4 vs. 6.9%)]. Similarly, we do not believe that fasting blood glucose differences (8.2 vs. 6.3 mmol/l) influenced the acute response. Esposito <italic>et al</italic>. reported that changes in hsCRP and IL-6 correlated with changes in 2-h post-meal glucose and not with fasting plasma glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>], and Festa <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that CRP is more strongly related to post-load oral glucose tolerance testing than to fasting glucose in subjects without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. In the current study, statistical adjustments were also made for fasting plasma glucose or insulin and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, age, gender and BMI covariates in all of the regression and correlation analyses to assure that the reported correlations were independent of these factors.</p><p>The intent of this study was to compare biomarker responses to a mixed-meal breakfast after 24 weeks of treatment with two insulin regimens and to test the hypothesis that controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with prandial + basal insulin attenuates the meal-induced increases in hsCRP, interleukin-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone more than basal insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The test meal before randomization was performed to ensure the two groups were similar in their post-meal responses at baseline, while the test meal after 24 weeks of treatment was performed to test the study hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, our study shows that controlling post-meal hyperglycaemia with prandial + basal insulin attenuates the meal-induced increases in hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin-6 compared with basal insulin once daily, both plus metformin. We also demonstrated that post-meal changes in hsCRP, TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone levels are significantly correlated with post-meal glucose. As people consuming three meals daily are in the postprandial state for most of the 24 h, these findings suggest that controlling post-meal glucose can potentially have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular events in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular outcome studies where post-meal hyperglycaemia and meal-induced inflammation are reduced over a longer time period are needed to prove that these changes can decrease vascular disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company and is related to study protocol F3Z-MC-IOOI (clinicaltrials.gov, identifier number NCT00191464).
