T-cell lines reactive to 9 different peptides of the myelin antigens, MBP, MOG and PLP were raised from the patients' peripheral blood. The patients were randomized into two groups: 19 were treated with TCV (four subcutaneous injections of 10&#x02013;30&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> T-cells, attenuated by irradiation, on days 1, 30, 90 and 180) and 7 patients were treated with sham injections. Twenty-four patients (17 in the TCV group and 7 in the placebo) were eligible for per-protocol analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At one year following the inclusion, an increase in the EDSS (+0.50) and an increase in 10-meter walking time (+0.18 sec), were observed in the placebo group; in the TCV group there was a decrease in the EDSS (&#x02212;0.44; p&#x0003c;0.01) and in the 10-meter walking time (0.84 sec; p&#x0003c;0.005). Sixteen of the 17 patients (94.1%) in the TCV group remained relapse-free during the year of the study, as compared to 42.9% in the placebo group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01 and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03 with adjustment).

These findings provide the rationale for using T-cell vaccination (TCV) to induce down-regulation of the pathogenic T-cells in MS.</p><p>TCV was first introduced in 1981 in the EAE rat model of MS using activated and irradiated MBP-specific T-cell lines and clones <xref rid="pone.0050478-BenNun1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. TCV was found to suppress EAE and induced the generation of regulatory T-cells (CD4 or CD8) specific for the anti-myelin T-cell receptors of the T-cells that were used in the vaccine, a phenomenon described as anti-idiotypic regulation <xref rid="pone.0050478-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Regulatory T-cells were also found to respond to molecules expressed by activated T cells, acting thus as anti-ergotypic regulators <xref rid="pone.0050478-Quintana1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Such T-cell ergotopes included CD25 <xref rid="pone.0050478-Mimran1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, HSP60 and the TNFa receptor epitopes <xref rid="pone.0050478-Quintana2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subsequently, regulatory networks involving CD4 and CD8 T-cells were demonstrated in rats following TCV <xref rid="pone.0050478-Lider1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These T-cell interactions showed MHC restriction to standard Class II and Class I antigens and to non-standard Q1a antigens <xref rid="pone.0050478-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Seven clinical trials of TCV at various stages of MS have been reported, and six additional trials are in progress or have recently been completed, but not yet reported (reviewed by Hellings, Raus and Stinissen <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hellings2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and by Vandenbark and Abulafia-Lapid <xref rid="pone.0050478-Vandenbark1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). However, none of these studies have been classified as double-blinded and placebo controlled.</p><p>Our study is a double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCV in progressive MS patients. We carried out multiple autologous T-cell vaccinations with a mixture of attenuated T-cell lines reactive to three or more, among 9 different peptides from the sequences of the three major myelin proteins implicated as autoantigens in MS: MBP, PLP and MOG. The trial subjects suffered from relapsing-progressive MS with progression of at least one degree in the EDSS scale during the year before the study. T-cell lines were prepared from all of the subjects, but the TCV treatments were given only in the active treatment group following randomization; the patients in the sham/placebo received saline injections instead of the cell lines. TCV-treated subjects received 10&#x02013;30 million attenuated T-cells by subcutaneous injections on days 0, 30, 90, 180, and the clinical effects were measured at one year.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050478.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050478.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>1. Participants</title><p>Thirty patients with definite MS and relapsing-progressive course were initially enrolled in the study. All patients signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board and the National Ministry of Health Review Board of Israel. All patients had severe progression in their functional status (increase of at least one degree in the EDSS scale) during the year prior to inclusion. The included patients were tested for their peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivites against 9 different peptides of MBP, PLP and MOG (the major known autoantigens in MS pathogenesis). T-cell lines specific for the peptides with the highest reactivity in each individual, were prepared from all the patients. The calculation of the sample size was based on the following assumption: If the relapse rate in the placebo group would be 0.8/year (as was the mean of the preselected 54 patients from our database), the power of the study would be 88% to detect a 75% reduction of the relapse rate in the TCV group with an 1&#x02236;1 design (ie 15 patients in each group, as initially intended). For a similar anticipated efficacy, the power would be 85% for a 1&#x02236;2 (placebo vs TCV) design. As mentioned, the initial design was 1&#x02236;1 (placebo&#x02236;TCV) but the Ethics committee of our Institution requested to have more patients (1&#x02236;2) assigned to the active treatment group. Such change in the design reduced somewhat the power of the study, but the total number of the patients could not increase, due to the limitations of the license from the Israeli Ministry of Health.</p><p>All randomized patients were not aware of their group allocation (including the four who finally did not enter the study).</p><p>For the initial, pre-randomization process, we scanned our patients database at the Hadassah MS Center and calculated several disease parameters using the Excel and the SPSS15 statistical software, to identify a rather homogeneous group of candidate patients according to various disease characteristics (EDSS, progressive disease with relapses, age range and relapse rates). Thereafter, the patients from the previously formulated group (54 patients) were asked if they would be interested to participate in the trial. Thirty of them who were finally selected and confirmed their willingness to participate (signing and informed consent), were randomized into the two groups (2&#x02236;1 treatment vs placebo). The final randomization was done with the help of an external monitoring agent (Dr Moshe Neuman, B.R.D, Bio-Medical Research Design: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brd.co.il">www.brd.co.il</ext-link>) based on only 2 parameters, EDSS and age.</p><p>Additional secondary disease characteristics which were registered but not used as the primary stratification parameters included the annual relapse rate and the duration of the disease.</p><p>Twenty six of them (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26, 15 males, 11 females; mean age of 39.07&#x000b1;9.81) with a mean EDSS at inclusion of 4.42&#x000b1;1.66 (range: 3.0&#x02013;7.0) and disease duration of 8.61&#x000b1;4.63 years, were finally included in the study. Four patients out of initial number of 30 patients (3 assigned to placebo and one in TCV) were not included due to withdrawal of their consent or lost to follow up, before the day 1 of the trial. Of these 26 patients, 19 were assigned to the TCV-treatment group and 7 to the sham treatment/placebo group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050478-g001">Figure 1</xref>: Flowchart of the trial).</p><fig id="pone-0050478-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0050478.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Consort flow chart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0050478.g001"/></fig><p>Patients from the first (TCV) group were treated on days 0, 30, 90, 180 with subcutaneous TCV injections, composed of 10&#x02013;30 million attenuated T-cells; patients from the second (placebo) group, received at the same time points saline injections instead of the cell lines.</p><p>Our treatment protocol included multiple autologous T-cell vaccinations with a mixture of attenuated T-cell lines reactive to three or more peptides, those which showed the highest proliferation rates in each individual patient (patient-tailored vaccine). The whole study design was double-blinded. All patients were followed up clinically and neuroradiologically for a period of one year and examined at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months visits by two neurologists, the treating physician who recorded adverse events and the evaluating physician who performed the neurological examination, the EDSS status recording and the additional functional tests, which included, the 10-meter walking test, the 9-hole peg test and the PASAT cognitive test. Both neurologists were &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; concerning the treatment arm to which each patient was assigned. MRI was performed before the TCV injection and at 12 months. The duration of the study was one year. Two patients from the 19 in the TCV group withdrew from the study (lost to follow up). These patients did not receive the full protocol of TCV injections. Since an ITT analysis including patients who either did not show at all on visit 1, or did not receive the full treatment protocol, would be less meaningful in such a small study, all the analyses between the groups were performed for the 24 (17 in TCV and 7 in the placebo arms) patients who received the treatment protocol (per protocol analysis).

In addition, each patient's BPMC were stimulated with 0.3 mg/ml PHA, 7.5 Lfu/ml Tetanus toxoid and 20 mg/ml Candida, used as positive control antigens. Patients responding positively to at least one of the myelin peptides (manifested by a S.I. above 2.0) were enrolled to the study; the S.I. was calculated as the ratio of CPM of H<sup>3&#x02212;</sup>Tymidine uptake in response to a peptide, to the background CPM in the absence of the antigen. T-cell lines were selected according to the proliferation results and prepared for injection. Patients who did not respond to any of the myelin peptides were excluded.

The reactive lymphocytes that showed a stimulation index&#x0003e;2.0 were expanded in vitro into T-cell lines and an individually-tailored vaccine was prepared. Briefly, PBMC obtained from the patients were stimulated with the relevant peptides of the above mentioned myelin proteins (those against which there was a positive proliferative response in each patient) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050478-t002">Table 2</xref>). Several rounds of restimulation using irradiated autologous antigen-presenting cells were performed until sufficient numbers of T-cells for four injections were available (around 60&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells). The specific T-cell lines were attenuated by irradiation (6000 rads) and injected subcutaneously at 4 time points, on days 1, 60, 90 and 180 (of 10&#x02013;30&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells for each injection).

Effect of TCV on the lymphocyte reactivities against myelin proteins</title><p>For the immunological follow-up of the patients in the trial, the responses to the myelin proteins used for the TCV were tested by means of a proliferation assay at 1 year after TCV (month 12) and compared with the baseline values before the treatment. Following one year from the first TCV injection PBMC were isolated and cultured in the presence of the myelin peptides described in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050478-t002">Table 2</xref>. Their proliferate responses to the myelin peptides were tested by H<sup>3</sup>- Thymidine uptake assay as described in above. The highest responses to all of the peptides from the same protein were used as a measurement of MBP or MOG or PLP responsiveness. The results are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050478-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050478-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In the TCV group, of the nine patients tested after 1 year of TCV, seven showed reduction in the responsiveness to all the myelin proteins tested, patient P3 showed an increase in MOG and PLP and a mild reduction in MBP responsiveness (from a S.I. of 2.7, to 2.1). Patient P15 showed a mild increase in the responsiveness to MBP (from a S.I. of 2.2, to 3.5). In the placebo group, only 3 patients were tested and two showed an increase in their responses to all proteins tested; patient P1 showed a mild decrease in the MBP response (from a S.I. of 2.3 to 1.8) but an increase in MOG- (from a S.I. of 2 to 6.1) and in PLP reactivities (from a S.I. of 1.1, to 11.2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050478-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the responses against myelin peptides in three representative TCV and 3 placebo patients.

This is the first double-blind study with TCV in progressive MS (and to our knowledge, the only controlled study in MS, in general), using multiple (4) injections (vaccinations) of attenuated T-cell lines reactive to 9 different myelin peptides. TCV was proven safe and no serious adverse events were documented. There was a profound clinical effect on relapses and a beneficial effect on disability, as evidenced by the follow-up EDSS scores and the performance in the timed 10-meter walking test. The PASAT and the 9-holes peg tests showed a trend for improvement in the TCV group, but this did not reach statistical significance. No significant effects could be detected in the MRI parameters. The discrepancy between the clinical and radiological effects, although somehow puzzling, is not surprising. Physicians are frequently confronted by such discrepancies between the clinical course of MS and the MRI manifestations. Other immunotherapies which were proven clinically effective in MS, showed borderline or no beneficial effects on MRI <xref rid="pone.0050478-Achiron1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Comi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The small size of our study may also be one of the reasons for failure to detect a positive effect on MRI parameters. Interestingly, additional TCV studies failed to show significant MRI effects <xref rid="pone.0050478-Achiron2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hermans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hermans2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Medaer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Stinissen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms involved in TCV include induction of anti-idiotypic and anti-ergotypic immune mechanisms. Vaccination with at least 10 million whole attenuated T-cells results in the expansion of a second set of T-cells specific for both idiotypic and ergotypic determinants. Anti-idiotypic T-cells have been shown to consist of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, with fine specificity for hyper-variable TCR regions, including both CDR2 and CDR3 determinants that are likely self-presented by the targeted myelin reactive clones <xref rid="pone.0050478-Zang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The CD8+ T-cells may be cytotoxic and/or inhibitory for CD4+ effector T-cells, thus causing deletion or inhibition of pathogenic Th1 T-cell clones present in the vaccinating lines. The CD4+ T-cells are the major cytokine producers, and secrete a variety of cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10 (Th2 cell phenotype), that may exert regulatory effects on the potentially pathogenic Th1 cells selected for the TCV <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hermans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Zang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, the regulatory CD4+ subset specific for the vaccinating T-cells may include FoxP3+ Treg cells that inhibit the activation of target T-cells non-specifically, through T-T interactions <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Buenafe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Vandenbark2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The major effect of TCV is to delete or down-regulate the activation of the autoimmune effector T-cells. The disappearance of the T-cell clones that were used in the vaccination procedure has been one of the most consistent findings of the various studies <xref rid="pone.0050478-Achiron2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and ours as well. In our trial, in the TCV-treated group, at one year following the treatment, T cell responsiveness to myelin antigens was reduced significantly, as shown in the results of the proliferation assay in three representative TCV patients and three placebo patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050478-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050478-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>There are seven different clinical trials with TCV at various stages of MS that have been already reported in the literature <xref rid="pone.0050478-Achiron2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hermans1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hermans2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Medaer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Stinissen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050478-Correale1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and six additional studies which are in progress or have been recently completed, but not yet reported (reviewed by Hellings, Raus and Stinissen <xref rid="pone.0050478-Hellings2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and more recently by Vandenbark and Abulafia-Lapid <xref rid="pone.0050478-Vandenbark1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). These studies confirmed the consistent reduction of MBP-specific T-cells following TCV and showed some indications of clinical efficacy as documented by the prolongation of the time to MS-progression in both RR-MS and SP-MS patients, as compared to the pre-vaccination rates. More recently, in an open-label TCV study, 20 RR-MS patients were vaccinated with MBP and MOG (panel of peptides) T-cell lines <xref rid="pone.0050478-Achiron2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The results of this study showed that vaccinated patients had a reduction in the annual relapse rate, EDSS stabilization and reduction in MRI activity at one year of follow-up. All the above promising results provided the rationale for our randomized, double-blind clinical TCV trial using T-cell lines selected with MBP, PLP and MOG peptides and multiple injections, in progressive MS patients.</p><p>TCV appears to be a very safe procedure, with the attenuation step used in both animal and human studies effectively preventing encephalitogenicity of the injected myelin-reactive T cells. Overall, the previous and our TCV studies lend direct support to the involvement of inflammatory myelin-reactive T-cells in MS pathogenesis strengthening the autoimmunity concept. However, the trends reported in the pilot studies needed to be validated by controlled double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The present trial provides clear indications of clinical efficacy of TCV on MS. Of importance is the fact that in our study we performed multiple vaccinations and used 9 peptides and a &#x0201c;cocktail&#x0201d; of anti myelin cell lines, which may all account for the more significant efficacy detected in several clinical parameters in our trial.</p><p>In conclusion, this blinded clinical trial with TCV in patients with relapsing-progressive MS using anti-myelin cell lines and not T-cell clones, despite its limitations due to the relatively small number of participants and the lack of significant MRI data, shows the feasibility and safety of the procedure and provides indications of clinical efficacy of TCV in MS.
