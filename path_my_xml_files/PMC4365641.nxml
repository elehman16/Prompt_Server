As part of their application to the FDA, these devices underwent an Investigational Device Exemption clinical trial and 2-year follow-up results were presented.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> All 3 studies showed non-inferiority of the investigational device compared with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). The ProDisc-C (Synthes USA Products, LLC, West Chester, Pennsylvania) TDR was also able to prove superiority in many clinical outcomes in comparison to ACDF.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, there was still a significant concern in the medical community regarding performance over the longer term and whether these areas of superiority compared with ACDF would bear out over time.</p><p>Widely accepted as one of the most successful spine procedures performed today, ACDF was first described by Smith and Robinson<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> in 1958 and remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when anterior cervical plates were introduced.

Patients remained blinded to randomization until immediately after surgery.

CA patients had only reached the 24-month follow-up time point at the time of this report. Patient self-assessments included Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, Short Form 36 (SF-36), neck and arm pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), and VAS for patient satisfaction. Physical and neurologic examinations included root tension, reflexes, muscle strength, and sensory deficits. Radio-graphic evaluation consisted of anteroposterior and lateral standing, flexion, and extension films. Radiographic analysis of range of motion (ROM) was measured by an independent third party (Medical Metrics Inc., Houston, Texas).</p><p>For between-treatment group comparisons of continuous measurements such as NDI, VAS for pain, and SF-36 scores, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. To compare the mean improvement from baseline within the treatment groups for the patient self-assessment data at each follow-up visit, paired <italic>t</italic> tests were performed. The Fisher's exact test was used to compare success rates between treatment groups such as neurologic success and the percentage of patients indicating that they would have the surgery again.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0002"><title>Results</title><p>From August 2003 to October 2004, 209 randomized patients (103 PDC-R and 106 ACDF) had surgery at 13 investigational sites across the United States and are continuing to be followed up for 7 years. After closure of randomized enrollment in 2004, an additional series of 136 CA patients had ProDisc-C TDR surgery from March 2005 to January 2008. Follow-up rates at 24 months were 98.0% for PDC-R, 94.8% for ACDF, and 77.4% for CA. At the time of this publication, the follow-up rates for PDC-R and ACDF were 63.0% and 46.2%, respectively, at 48 months. Overall patient demographics showed no difference between randomized and CA cohorts of ProDisc-C-treated or ACDF-treated patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>). Operative time (PDC-R, 107.4 minutes; ACDF, 98.7 minutes; and CA, 108.8 minutes) and estimated blood loss (PDC-R, 83.5 mL; ACDF, 63.5 mL; and CA, 84.2 mL) were statistically lower for ACDF compared with PDC-R patients (P = .0063 and <italic>P =</italic> .0094, respectively). There was no difference between PDC-R or ACDF patients and CA patients in operative time or blood loss.

By 24 months, 3 cases of bridging bone were identified at the index level in the PDC-R group. Between 24 and 48 months, an additional 2 cases of bridging bone were identified in the PDC-R group. No cases of bridging bone were observed in the CA group at up to 24 months.</p><p>At 24 months, 91.2% of the ACDF patients had &#x0003c;2&#x000b0; ROM; by 48 months, 95.5% of the ACDF group had &#x0003c;2&#x000b0; ROM</p><p>Secondary surgical procedures were defined as any reoperation, revision, supplemental fixation, or removal of the implant. By 24 months, of the patients originally enrolled in the study, 2 (1.9%) in the PDC-R group and 9 (8.5%) in the ACDF group required a secondary surgical procedure. From 24 to 48 months, 1 additional PDC-R patient and 3 additional ACDF patients required secondary surgery.

One patient reported worsening pain; the TDR was removed and the level converted to a fusion. The second case involved removal of the TDR and revision to a 2-level ACDF because of return of nonspecific neck pain. The third patient underwent a posterior decompression with supplemental fixation at C6-T1; the TDR was left intact.</p><p>Of the 12 secondary surgeries that occurred in the ACDF group, 6 included an adjacent level in addition to the index level. The primary reason for revision at the index level was pseudarthrosis; 1 patient underwent revision because of dysphagia associated with plate liftoff, and 1 patient underwent posterior decompression for foraminal stenosis. Of the 6 patients (5.6%) who required procedures at the adjacent level, an ACDF was performed at 1 adjacent level in 3 patients and at both adjacent levels in 3 patients.</p><p>In the CA group, 3 patients required a secondary surgical procedure by the 24-month follow-up time point. In 1 case the implant was repositioned 4 days after surgery. Increasing radiculopathy developed in 1 patient due to hypermobility at the index level, and this patient underwent revision to anterior fusion. One patient reported increasing trapezial and arm pain; the implant was removed, and the index and adjacent levels were converted to anterior fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S0009"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although a hypothesized benefit of TDR surgery is the reduction of adjacent segment disease alone, this prospective study shows a reduction in the overall rate of secondary surgical interventions at both the index and adjacent levels. A 4-fold increase in reoperation rates at the index and adjacent levels for ACDF-treated patients compared with PDC-R-treated patients was shown in these longer-term results. The reoperations in the ACDF group were mainly for pseudarthrosis at the index level or the development of symptomatic degeneration at an adjacent level. By 48 months, 5.6% of ACDF patients required further surgery at an adjacent level. This rate was higher than the 1.9% rate observed in the PDC-R group. Though preliminary, these results indicate that TDR does slow the rate of adjacent-level disease.</p><p>The rate of reoperation for symptomatic adjacent segment disease after cervical fusion was 1.4% per year in this study, slightly lower than the 1.5% to 4% rate reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, it must be noted that the patients enrolled in this study were limited to single-level disease, whereas the large patient series reported by Hilibrand et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Goffin et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> include a substantial number of multilevel procedures. Many clinical series have established that patients with multilevel cervical fusions have a higher incidence of adjacent-level disease progression when compared with single-level fusions.</p><p>In the PDC-R group, radiographic evaluation showed 5 cases of bridging bone. Three of these cases were observed at 12 to 18 months follow-up and two were noted at the 48-month follow-up. This radiographic finding was asymptomatic in these 5 patients. Extensive analysis has shown that in none of these cases was there any correlation between the development of bridging bone and an effect on clinical outcomes compared with the remainder of the PDC-R group. There were no cases of bridging bone reported in the CA group. This difference is likely because of greater attention to soft-tissue handling, endplate preparation, controlling bleeding, and use of bone wax. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not required in this study, and most investigators did not administer them.</p><p>With any new technology, there are always the questions of how steep the learning curve is and how experience affects patient outcomes. In this study the clinical outcomes of the randomized and CA ProDisc-C patients observed up to 24 months were comparable. Given the relatively straightforward surgical technique, it appears that a learning curve does not play a factor and patient outcomes are not affected.</p><p>This report is limited by the lower patient accountability at 48 months compared with 24 months. This is a continuing study, and follow-up is ongoing. Nevertheless, these preliminary data at 4 years show that both TDR and ACDF are viable surgical options for patients with symptomatic cervical disk disease. Although it appears that ACDF patients are at higher risk for having an additional surgical intervention at the index level or an adjacent level, patients in both groups continue to show good clinical results at longer-term follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors thank Johanna Hantel, Synthes USA Products, LLC, for her editorial collaboration, and Jeff
