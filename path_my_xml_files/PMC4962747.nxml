Children were previously randomized (3:1) to receive either MenACWY-TT or control vaccine (MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> in 1-&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;y olds; MenACWY-polysaccharide vaccine [Men-PS] in 2-&#x0003c;11&#x000a0;y olds). Subjects with rSBA-MenC titers &#x0003c;1:8 at any time point were revaccinated with MenC conjugate vaccine and discontinued from the study. A repeated measurement statistical model assessed potential selection effects due to drop-outs. At year 5 in MenACWY-TT-vaccinated-toddlers for serogroups A, C, W, and Y respectively, percentages with rSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 were 73.5%, 77.6%, 34.7%, and 42.9%, hSBA &#x02265;1:8 were 35.6%, 91.7%, 82.6% and 80.0%. For MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> recipients, 63.6% had persisting rSBA-MenC titers &#x02265;1:8 and 90.9% had hSBA-MenC &#x02265;1:8 (not significantly different versus MenACWY-TT for either assay: exploratory analyses). In 2-&#x0003c;11&#x000a0;y olds rSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 in MenACWY-TT-vaccinees were 90.8%, 90.8%, 78.6%, and 78.6% and 15.4%, 100%, 0.0%, 7.7% in Men-PS-vaccinees (significantly different for serogroups A, W and Y, exploratory analyses). Serogroups A, W and Y rSBA GMTs were &#x02265; 26-fold higher in MenACWY-TT-vaccinees. As expected, GMTs modeled at year 5 to assess the impact of subject drop out (mainly for revaccination), appeared lower for serogroup C. No vaccine-related SAEs were reported. Antibody persistence was observed for all serogroups up to 5&#x000a0;y after MenACWY-TT vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bactericidal activity</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>conjugate vaccine</kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd><kwd>quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine</kwd><kwd>toddler</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ATP</term><def><p>according to protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRM<sub>197</sub></term><def><p>mutant diphtheria toxoid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DT</term><def><p>diphtheria toxoid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMT</term><def><p>geometric mean titer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hSBA</term><def><p>serum bactericidal activity assay using human complement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMD</term><def><p>invasive meningococcal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MenACWY</term><def><p>quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W and Y polysaccharide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MenC</term><def><p>meningococcus serogroup C</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHE</term><def><p>Public Health England</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>rSBA</term><def><p>serum bactericidal activity assay using baby rabbit complement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TT</term><def><p>tetanus toxoid</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasive infection and meningitis caused by <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> remains an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> The introduction of meningococcal conjugate vaccination to childhood immunization schedules is estimated to have decreased invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) incidence rates in Europe by approximately 50%.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Nevertheless, the highest incidence of IMD continues to be in infants and young children, and mortality in infected individuals remains unchanged at approximately 10%.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,3,4</sup></xref></p><p>Monovalent meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) vaccines have been available for use in infants and young children since 1999.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, in Europe, serogroup B as well as serogroups W and Y are also important causes of IMD.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In Finland, meningococcal serogroup B causes the majority of IMD, followed by serogroup Y, C and W (2012 data).<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Finland is one of several northern European countries, such as Sweden, in which serogroup Y has emerged as an important cause of IMD.

</p><p>This is supported by the observed rSBA-MenC GMT at year 4 (where the same rSBA assay was used) for toddlers who returned at year 5, which was 109.7 in the MenACWY-TT group and 137.2 in the MenC-CRM group, contrasting with GMTs of 11.2 and 11.4, respectively among all subjects tested at year 4, of whom a percentage subsequently received MenC re-vaccination and were withdrawn from the study. In children, the observed year 4 rSBA-MenC GMT in those who returned at year 5 was 118.3 and 206.8 in the MenACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively (vs. 21.7 and 23.5, respectively, in the cohort who returned for the year 4 persistence visit). This suggests that subject drop-out due to revaccination between year 4 and year 5 influenced the results for MenC at year 5.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-0002-0003"><title>Safety</title><p>No related serious adverse events were reported from 6&#x000a0;months after primary vaccination study up until the visit at Year 5.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>Five years after vaccination of toddlers with MenACWY-TT, rSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 persisted in the majority of subjects for serogroups A and C, but declined to 34.7% for serogroup W and 42.9% for serogroups Y.

However these data should be interpreted cautiously given that subjects whose MenC titers had decreased to below the assay cut-off were discontinued from the study. Longitudinal modeling suggested that MenC titers in both age groups and in both vaccine groups were likely to be overestimated, but also suggested that persistence of rSBA-MenC may have been higher after MenACWY-TT than after control vaccines in both groups. The modeling exercise also helps explain the apparent observed increase in rSBA antibody titers between year 4 and year 5 for all treatment groups and age strata.</p><p>Assessment of hSBA in toddlers showed a gradual increase in the percentage of subjects who were not originally vaccinated with A, W, and Y conjugates with hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 for serogroups A, W and Y. This is suggestive of the acquisition of natural immunity in these children due to exposure to meningococci or to cross-reacting bacteria. It is noteworthy that at all time points after vaccination both hSBA GMTs and the percentage with hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 were observed to be higher in the MenACWY-TT group than in the control group for serogroups A, W and Y, suggesting a benefit of vaccination during the second year of life over acquisition of natural immunity.</p><p>Although the high drop-out rate limits the utility of these data in informing on booster policy, the observation that around 50% of toddlers in both groups required re-vaccination before year 5 suggests that a booster dose earlier than 5 y after priming may be warranted. This is supported by results of a recent study (NCT00955682) in which MenACWY-TT-primed toddlers received a booster dose of the same vaccine 4&#x000a0;y after priming. Robust booster responses (rSBA and hSBA) to all serogroups were observed, with more than 95% of children maintaining rSBA and hSBA titers &#x02265;1:8 one year after the booster dose.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In our study, fewer children vaccinated with MenACWY-TT as 2-&#x0003c;11&#x000a0;y olds required re-vaccination by year 5, suggesting that a longer interval between boosters may be possible when priming occurs beyond infancy and a benefit in terms of the durability of the immune response after conjugate versus Men-PS vaccination.</p><p>To our knowledge this is one of only a few studies that have assessed antibody persistence extending 5&#x000a0;y after vaccination with a quadrivalent MenACWY vaccine during childhood or adolescence. <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,15,20,21</sup></xref> Our study adds to a growing body of persistence data following MenACWY-TT vaccination in toddlers and children. Comparisons with other studies are hampered when different assays (rSBA or hSBA) have been used and because of inter-laboratory variation within the same assay. Within these limitations, rSBA (and hSBA where available) persistence for serogroup C following MenACWY-TT appears to be comparable to that following vaccination with other meningococcal conjugate vaccines licensed for use in children (MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> and HibMenC-TT).<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22,23</sup></xref> Moreover, our results in toddlers appear to be in line with rSBA observed 2-to-3&#x000a0;y after a single dose of MenACWY-DT in 2-to-3&#x000a0;y olds (% rSBA &#x02265; 1:128: 75% for serogroup A, 52% for C, 61% for W and 90% for Y).<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> While the percentage with hSBA serogroup C &#x02265;1:4 reduced markedly 2-to-3&#x000a0;y after MenACWY-DT vaccination at 2&#x000a0;y of age (14.6%),<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we observed good hSBA-MenC persistence until year 5 (hSBA serogroup C &#x02265;1:8: 91.7%), although the high drop-out rate means that our estimate is likely to be overestimated.

Finally, attrition of subjects due to the re-vaccination policy meant that low responders were discontinued from further participation. This also led to a low number of subjects in control groups at year 5, which implies an imprecision in the point estimates, and potentially limited applicability to the wider population. Nevertheless, correction of the selection effect using a repeated measurement statistical model confirmed that MenC antibody persistence in toddlers was similar 5&#x000a0;y after MenACWY-TT or after MenC-CRM<sub>197</sub> vaccination; and that in children, antibody persistence to all 4 serogroups appeared better 5&#x000a0;y after MenACWY-TT vaccination than after Men-PS.</p><p>In conclusion, antibody persistence was observed for all serogroups up to 5&#x000a0;y after MenACWY-TT vaccination in 1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;year-old children.

GMTs with 95% CIs were tabulated.</p><p>For each of the serogroups, an exploratory evaluation of the differences in the immune response at each time point was performed in terms of differences in the percentage of subjects with rSBA antibody titers &#x02265;1:8 and &#x02265;1:128 (and hSBA titers &#x02265;1:4 and &#x02265;1:8 in toddlers) with standardized asymptotic 95% CIs and the ratio of the GMTs with 95% CIs between the MenACWY-TT and control groups. The hSBA GMT ratio was calculated using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model on the logarithm<sub>10</sub> transformation of the titers using the pre-vaccination logarithm<sub>10</sub> transformation of the titers, the age strata and the vaccine group as covariates. For rSBA data an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model was used. A significant difference was indicated if the value &#x02018;1&#x02019; was excluded from the 95% CI on the GMT ratios or if the value &#x02018;0&#x02019; was excluded from the 95% CI on differences between groups. Note that potential differences should be interpreted with caution considering that there was no adjustment for multiplicity for these comparisons, and that statistically significant findings may have occurred by chance alone.</p><p>To investigate potential selection bias in the persistence analysis due to the drop-out of subjects due to any reason, including re-vaccination with MenC conjugate vaccine, a longitudinal repeated measurement statistical model (mixed model, SAS Proc mixed) was fitted, taking into account the group and the rSBA titer values (using the GSK rSBA or PHE rSBA assay, as appropriate) for subjects until they dropped out, to correct for the estimation of the GMTs at each time point.</p><p>NIMENRIX, MENITORIX and MENVEO are registered trademarks of the GSK Group of Companies.
