At baseline, HRQOL is lower in HCV patients compared to national norms. The norm based HRQOL domain scores for the different domains of the SF-36 instrument were as follows: physical functioning = 47.13, role-physical = 46.87, bodily pain = 48.00, general health = 44.01, vitality = 45.39, social functioning = 47.05, role-emotional = 48.88, mental health = 48.76, physical component score 43.26 and mental component score = 46.17. The scores decreased during therapy in those who would be responders and non-responders, but the pattern of change was different. During the treatment, the HRQOL domain scores of responders decrease notably in the domain of vitality. At week 48 vitality scores were worst in responders. 5 of the 8 domain scores were lower compared to baseline in non-responders. At 24 weeks post treatment follow up, HRQOL in those refractory patients who respond to re-treatment tended to be better than the national average in the domains of vitality (p = .06), social functioning (p = .06) and role-emotional (p = .03) while the non-responders improved their scores in domains of physical function and bodily pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that patients who are to be responders and non-responders behave differently in terms of the HRQOL domain scores when re-treated with a combination of interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The responders sustained a significant decrease in the domain score of vitality while 5 of the 8 domain scores decrease in non-responders at the end of treatment. At the end of follow up, in responders, the HRQOL score tended to be better than the national average notably in the domains of role-emotional, vitality and social functioning. On the other hand, in non-responders, the domain scores of physical function improve, while that of role-emotional worsened.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common pathogen in the US and globally with a prevalence of 3%. Three million chronically infected persons reside in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients with HCV have a lower Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measure compared to general population, as documented by multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Over the past several years, the treatment of Hepatitis C has evolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The approved therapies at present include monotherapy with different interferon preparations and combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin. The majority of patients are treated for 48 weeks. The treatment for HCV infection inflicts significant side effects on patients and, at best, provides only modest rates (38&#x02013;43%) of sustained viral suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The development of pegylated interferon with a slower rate of clearance and a longer half-life has improved the antiviral effects and has decreased the frequency of injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The side effects of interferon-based treatment include fatigue, flu like symptoms, depression, inability to concentrate and decrease in libido. Discontinuation of therapy is commonly due to side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A patient who has been previously treated and now has persistent viremia is often considered for re-treatment with a newer interferon or combination treatment. The decision to re-treat a patient for refractory hepatitis C infection is difficult and is influenced by the expected response rates, pattern of response to previous treatment, side-effect profile and effects of treatment on HRQOL. The HRQOL of patients with HCV undergoing na&#x000ef;ve treatment is affected significantly by the therapy and has been looked at previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this paper, we report the HRQOL data from patients with HCV infection refractory to prior therapy undergoing re-treatment with a combination of pegylated interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin. We hypothesized that the HRQOL will improve in those patients who attain a sustained viral response, similar to na&#x000ef;ve patients undergoing treatment. In this study, 25 of the 152 patients (17%) initiated on the study achieved a sustained viral response. The details of the clinical study and outcomes other than HRQOL measures are reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>HRQOL data was obtained from patients enrolled in a randomized study for treatment of HCV refractory to prior therapy. One hundred and sixty-five patients with refractory Hepatitis C were recruited from the 6 private practice centers and a tertiary care facility, The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. These patients were enrolled into the open label randomized control study with two arms. In both arms patients received pegylated interferon alpha 2b for 48 weeks (Schering-Plough Institute, Kennelworth, NJ) along with ribavirin, one group at a dose of 1.5 mcg/kg/week (high dose group) and the other at a dose of .5 mcg/kg/week (low dose group). The ribavirin dose was weight based. Patients weighing more that 165 lbs received 1200 mg while those weighing less received 1000 mg.</p><p>The entry criteria included chronic hepatitis C documented by a positive HCV RNA, abnormal liver tests and liver biopsy consistent with HCV. Minimum hematological criteria included hemoglobin &#x0003e;10 gm/dl for females and 11 for males, WBC counts &#x0003e;3000/ml and platelet count &#x0003e;70000/ml. Patients with hepatitis B or HIV co-infection, neoplastic disease, severe cardiac or pulmonary disease and psychiatric disorders were excluded. Sustained virologic response was defined as loss of serum HCV RNA at follow-up 24 weeks after discontinuation of treatment.</p><sec><title>Measurement and scoring of quality of life</title><p>The HRQOL data was collected using the SF-36 instrument (version 1), which is a widely used and well-validated instrument for measuring HQROL. The data was collected at baseline, 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and at 72 weeks (24 week follow-up after treatment). Each patient score was generated using the tool made available at the official web site for SF-36 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sf-36.org"/>. The scores were then transformed into the norm-based scoring and compared to age and sex adjusted national norms. On the norm-based scale, the national mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10 for US general adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The changes in HRQOL measures in the different domains of SF-36 instrument during treatment, were assessed at the previously mentioned time points and the data was compared to the baseline. In addition, the responders were compared to the non-responders. In this repeated measures design, a mixed-effects linear model, having an unstructured variance-covariance matrix was fit to each quality of life outcome to assess changes across time (weeks) within and between responder status (responder/non-responder). This was performed using the MIXED procedure of the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). P-values and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the method of Bonferroni. We also compared the domain scores with the national age and sex adjusted mean domain scores using Student's <italic>t </italic>-test. All dropouts were considered treatment failures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled in the study and randomized into the two arms. After randomization, 13 patients withdrew from the study. Ten of the 13 that withdrew did not complete a baseline questionnaire. Thus at baseline HRQOL data on 155 patients were available. Seventy-eight were in the low dose and 77 were in the high dose arm. Of the 152 patients who proceeded with the study 112 were men (74%) and 40 were female (26%). Twenty-five of the 152 (17%) patients achieved a sustained viral response. The mean age was 46 (range 28 &#x02013; 69). There were 136 Caucasian (90%), 9 African American, 4 Asian and 3 Hispanic patients. HRQOL data was available from 108 patients during treatment and from 82 patients at the 24 week post treatment follow up.

During the treatment, the scores in many HRQOL domains dropped significantly. In several domains the decline was around 5 points on the norm based scale and hence were likely clinically significant. This is similar to the observation in na&#x000ef;ve patients with HCV infection undergoing treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Hassanein et al in their study, showed a decrease in the HRQOL domain scores of those patients treated with Pegylated interferon alfa-2a during the treatment period. They also showed an improvement in several HRQOL domains in those who were responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. They also noted that addition of ribavirin increased the magnitude of decrease in the HRQOL but the pattern of decrease in the HRQOL domains was similar to those patients on interferon only treatment. Similarly, McHutchison et al reported improvement in HRQOL in those patients who achieved sustained virologic response in their study comparing interferon Alfa-2 b monotherapy and combination therapy for na&#x000ef;ve HCV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In both the above studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the domains mostly affected were role-physical, vitality, social functioning and role-emotional. The exact reason for the decline in HRQOL during therapy is unclear. Interferon alone seems to affect the HRQOL domains less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Successful eradication of the virus has been documented previously to cause improvements in the HRQOL, suggesting a causal relationship to HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Curiously, at baseline, the score tended to be better in those who would successfully respond to therapy. Compared to age and sex adjusted national mean scores, the responder group domain scores were not statistically different. On the other hand, the scores of non-responders were significantly lower compared to the national age and sex adjusted average. Why the scores were different and whether it has any bearing on the response to treatment is unclear. It is possible that the prior relapsers have better HRQOL scores (compared to prior non-responders) as the majority of those who responded were prior relapsers. Also, those with better HRQOL may be more likely to tolerate the treatment better and complete the course.</p><p>The dose of interferon did not have much bearing on the HRQOL scores. HRQOL scores in patients on the lower dose of interferon were similar to those on the higher dose arm at all the time points.</p><p>During the course of treatment, the pattern of change in the HRQOL scores of responders and non-responders was different. At 24 weeks, the decline in vitality scores appeared more dramatic in those who eventually will be responders. More HRQOL domains were affected in those who would be non-responders compared to responders. The scores continued to decrease in non-responders after 24 weeks while in the responders, it stayed steady, if not improved, in all areas except vitality. Vitality measures were significantly affected in both groups and were more pronounced in those who eventually become responders throughout the course of treatment. The scores of the vitality domain were lowest in the responders at the end of treatment. Compared to the baseline the responders sustained a significant decrease in the domain score of vitality, while 5 of the 8 domain scores declined in non responders at the end of treatment.</p><p>At the 24 week post-treatment follow up, the change in domain scores from baseline for both responders and non-responders were not statistically significant. However, the scores of responders tended to be better than the national average in the domains of role-emotional, vitality and social functioning. On the other hand the non-responders experienced a decrease in the role-emotional domain scores and had improvement in the physical function and bodily pain domains, such that the scores in these domains were no longer significantly lower from the national mean scores. It is unclear why the score should improve in non-responders. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, the domains with notable change were different in the responder and non-responder groups.</p><p>We used a repeated measures design for paired comparisons between the points of observation to do the statistical analysis. The repeated measures model is a powerful statistical model and is especially valuable in a smaller sample. This model nullifies any intra-patient effects on the observations, and hence, the differences noted in the HRQOL are more likely to be real, probably dependent on the effect of treatment. Despite this model, the important limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size and in particular, the low number of responders. The changes of the scores in responders may have been important, but statistical significance might have not been achieved due the small numbers. A sample size of approximately 2000 patients will be required to detect a 2 point change in the norm-based HRQOL scores. It should also be noted that we experienced a significant drop-out rate from the study. Some of the drop-outs were due to side effects, but more often represented patients with persistent viremia at week 24 of therapy who declined further treatment. Chances of clearing the virus if positive at week 24 is slim, and patients were aware of this. All drop-outs were considered as treatment failures in this study. Only 106 (73%) completed 24 weeks of therapy and (88) 58% completed 48 weeks of therapy. We did look at the physical and mental component scores from 24 weeks and did not find a difference between the ones who did and did not drop-out during the course of the study, suggesting that a lower HRQOL was not likely the cause of their dropping out.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Refractory chronic HCV patients who are to be responders and non-responders behaved differently in terms of the HRQOL domain scores when re-treated with a combination of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin. Compared to the baseline, the responders sustained a significant decrease in the domain score of vitality while 5 of the 8 domain scores declined in non responders at the end of treatment. Twenty four weeks after the treatment, the HRQOL score in responders tended to be better than the national average notably in the domains of role-emotional, vitality and social functioning. On the other hand, in non-responders, the domain scores of physical function improved while that of role-emotional worsened.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that we have no conflict of interest pertaining to any of the products discussed in this paper.
