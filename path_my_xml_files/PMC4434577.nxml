Undiagnosed HIV infection, as well as a lack of retention in care among those diagnosed, are both primary factors contributing to ongoing HIV incidence. Further, there are racial/ethnic disparities in undiagnosed HIV and engagement in care, with African Americans/Blacks and Latinos remaining undiagnosed longer and less engaged in care than Whites, signaling the need for culturally targeted intervention approaches to seek and test those with undiagnosed HIV infection, and link them to care with high retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study has two components: one to seek out and test heterosexuals at high risk for HIV infection, and another to link those found infected to HIV care with high retention. We will recruit sexually active African American/Black and Latino adults who have opposite sex partners, negative or unknown HIV status, and reside in locations with high poverty and HIV prevalence. The &#x0201c;Seek and Test&#x0201d; component will compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of two strategies to uncover undiagnosed HIV infection: venue-based sampling and respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Among those recruited by RDS and found to have HIV infection, a &#x0201c;Treat and Retain&#x0201d; component will assess the efficacy of a peer-driven intervention compared to a control arm with respect to time to an HIV care appointment and health indicators using a cluster randomized controlled trial design to minimize contamination. RDS initial seeds will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control arm at a 1:1 ratio and all recruits will be assigned to the same arm as the recruiter. Participants will be followed for 12&#x000a0;months with outcomes assessed using medical records and biomarkers, such as HIV viral load.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Heterosexuals do not test for HIV as frequently as and are diagnosed later than other risk groups. The study has the potential to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the majority of heterosexuals at high risk are African American/Black or Latino, the study has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01607541">NCT01607541</ext-link>, Registered May 23, 2012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Protocol</kwd><kwd>Health status disparities</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Undiagnosed HIV</kwd><kwd>Engagement in care</kwd><kwd>Venue-based sampling</kwd><kwd>Respondent-driven sampling</kwd><kwd>Peer-driven intervention</kwd><kwd>African American</kwd><kwd>Latino</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Despite advances in antiretroviral treatment, prevention strategies, and HIV diagnostic testing technologies, HIV disease incidence in the United States has remained steady, with over 50,000 individuals becoming infected annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Undiagnosed HIV infection is a major driver of these incident infections, although only 18&#x000a0;% of infected persons nationally are unaware of their HIV status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Moreover, there are serious racial/ethnic disparities in undiagnosed HIV, with African Americans/Blacks and Latinos remaining undiagnosed longer than Whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Further, undiagnosed HIV is more common in males compared to females, and among heterosexual males compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

This paper summarizes the study protocol for our STTR study funded under this initiative, which is being conducted in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City, called the &#x0201c;Brooklyn Community Action Project&#x0201d; (BCAP).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>High-risk heterosexuals in the U.S</title><p>The National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system estimates the prevalence of HIV infection in three high-risk populations on a rotating basis in 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas across the U.S.: heterosexuals at high risk (HHR), men who have sex with men (MSM), and persons who inject drugs (PWID). The NHBS studies use two main sampling frames across study locations, as determined by the CDC: venue-based sampling (VBS), generally used for the MSM studies, and respondent-driven sampling (RDS), used to enroll PWID and HHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, VBS and RDS have never been directly compared in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area in terms of recruiting populations who may benefit from STTR interventions.</p><p>Nationally, over 25&#x000a0;% of incident HIV infections have been attributed to heterosexual activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2010, the national NHBS with HHR found an estimated HIV prevalence of 2.3&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The NHBS study design for HHR targets adults who are sexually active with opposite sex partners and who are socially and geographically connected to areas with high HIV prevalence, which also happen to be high-poverty areas, in which African American/Black and Latino persons are the predominant race/ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indeed, the HIV disease burden in these communities is much higher in these geographical areas than across the U.S. generally, where the overall HIV prevalence is estimated at 0.6&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Locally, in the 2006 New York City NHBS study of HHR, for which detailed data have been published, HIV prevalence was 8.6&#x000a0;%, with an estimated HIV incidence in this population of 3.31&#x000a0;% per year and 2.59&#x000a0;% per year among those with no history of drug injection or male-to-male sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further, Brooklyn had the highest HIV prevalence and the highest rates of risk factors (unpublished observations, Holly Hagan, 2010), and is therefore the geographic focus of the present study.</p><p>Yet HHR are understudied relative to other HIV risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One difficulty in establishing research priorities for HHR has been the lack of a universal definition of the population. Heterosexual activity alone is overly broad to define a high-risk subgroup, while the CDC surveillance definition of documented heterosexual contact with someone known to be HIV-infected is too narrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The NHBS definition of HHR is persons with sexual partners of the opposite sex linked within urban geographical areas with high rates of heterosexually transmitted HIV, which also have high rates of poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; these geographical locations are called &#x0201c;high-risk areas&#x0201d; (HRAs). Due to the marked over-representation of African American/Black and Latino populations in these high prevalence/high-poverty neighborhoods, the majority of HHR are from these two racial/ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus the CDC has called for research to test culturally appropriate interventions to overcome barriers to HIV testing and increase linkage to HIV care for heterosexuals in high-risk urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Testing, linkage, and retention for HHR</title><p>Diagnostic HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention, and the CDC recommends annual testing for vulnerable populations such as HHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet rates of regular HIV testing are inadequate in this group, and as a result, late diagnosis of HIV is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A recent local NHBS study found that while over 90&#x000a0;% of HHR had encountered at least one setting where HIV testing is offered in the past year, only a third had actually been tested, suggesting that HHR often decline testing when it is offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, vulnerable subgroups of HHR encounter settings where testing is offered infrequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus culturally acceptable and efficient active approaches to seek out HHR and engage them in high-quality HIV testing are needed.</p><p>Post diagnosis, there are a number of serious gaps in HIV care engagement, and clinical and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV, 60&#x000a0;% are not retained in care; 63&#x000a0;% have not been prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART); and only 30&#x000a0;% have undetectable HIV viral load levels, the latter being the ultimate goal of HIV treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The CDC has called for improvement in outcomes across this HIV care continuum, with particular efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], since African Americans/Blacks and Latinos show lower rates of engagement in every indicator. Moreover, by risk group, HHR may experience longer delays before entering HIV care compared to MSM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Barriers to HIV testing and timely engagement in HIV care for HHR</title><p>In our study, we conceptualized the multi-level barriers that African American/Black and Latino HHR experience to HIV testing and engagement in HIV care within the Theory of Triadic Influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This social cognitive theory emphasizes three &#x0201c;streams of influence&#x0201d; on health behavior: the individual/attitudinal, the social, and the structural.</p><p>At the individual/attitudinal level of influence, barriers to testing for HHR include lack of awareness of recommended testing frequency, and low perceived risk of HIV infection stemming from beliefs that HIV affects mainly PWID and MSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. At the same time, fear of HIV testing and of the consequences of a positive test result are common powerful barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], along with mistrust of medical environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Substance use, which is common among HHR, has also been shown to serve as a barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, the population has other competing priorities, complicated by low socioeconomic status, such as mental health problems, unstable housing, and family and child-care responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. At the social level, the potential stigma of a positive test result serves as a barrier to HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Peer norms regarding health care, including that regular HIV testing is not necessary for HHR, may impede testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. At the structural level, HHR have poorer access to settings where high-quality HIV testing is offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Theoretically, barriers at these three levels of influence interact to impede access to HIV testing and reduce motivation to test among HHR. Furthermore, this same set of barriers also impedes linkage to and retention in HIV primary care among HHR diagnosed with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The present protocol describes two culturally targeted STTR intervention strategies for HHR to reduce these barriers to HIV testing and timely engagement in HIV care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Peer-driven intervention and respondent-driven sampling</title><p>Our study features a peer-driven intervention (PDI), in which participants are educated by peers on a set of core messages, then engage in structured facilitated sessions, followed by the opportunity to educate their own peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The core messages target the specific barriers to the health outcome of interest - HIV testing and engagement in HIV care in this case - and are repeated and expanded upon throughout the intervention activities. Peers who receive the education from study participants are also invited to join the research study, and during the course of the intervention, they are trained to educate their own peers. (The BCAP intervention manual is available from the first author).</p><p>Because PDI involves peer-to-peer contact, it can serve as the basis for a sampling methodology for studying subpopulations that are hard to define, reach, and/or engage: respondent-driven sampling (RDS). RDS is network-based method for recruitment, similar to traditional snowball sampling, but with the goal of minimizing biases typically associated with those traditional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In RDS, a modest number of individuals are recruited directly by project staff (called &#x0201c;initial seeds&#x0201d;), and then trained to recruit a small number of their peers into the study. These peers then enter the study and peer recruitment continues until the sample size goals are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The RDS method has four essential elements: tracking of recruitment chains; rationing of recruitment (usually 2-5 peers each); information on personal networks must be gathered (network size, recruitment refusals); and recruiters and recruits must have a pre-existing relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aims</title><p>The present study has two phases, a Seek and Test Phase and a Treat and Retain Phase. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the PDI/RDS study component includes activities to seek out and test HHR and strategies to link those found to be HIV-infected to medical care in a timely fashion. However, by design, we do not hypothesize differences in acceptance of HIV testing, which is&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;% in similar research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], or in the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV between intervention and control arms, although these will be documented in the Seek and Test Phase. Thus the main aim of the study is to measure the efficacy of the BCAP PDI compared to a time- and attention-matched control intervention on the second-phase Treat and Retain outcomes, including 1) time to an HIV clinic appointment; 2) time to initiating ART if indicated; 3) HIV viral load suppression; and 4) retention in care among the newly diagnosed. These outcomes are assessed with serology (viral load suppression) and medical record abstraction. We hypothesize the PDI arm, compared to the control arm, will produce a shorter time to care entry and ART initiation, higher viral load suppression, and superior retention in care. The study also will project the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of these two strategies (PDI vs. control) for care linkage and retention. Thus although the Seek and Test Phase temporally precedes the Treat and Retain Phase, we begin by describing the Treat and Retain phase, because it is the primary focus of the present study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Two-phase BCAP PDI/RDS Model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1816_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Part 1: Treat and retain phase</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study setting</title><p>In the planning stage of the study in 2011, a core high-risk area (HRA) was defined within Brooklyn, the borough in New York City with the highest heterosexual HIV prevalence in the 2006 NHBS study, which were the most up-to-date available NHBS data at the time. The classification of the HRA was based on the definition created in the NHBS studies in 2006, namely, a small set of zip codes with both the highest prevalence of poverty and rates of heterosexual HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We selected a new HRA cluster for the present study using updated HIV surveillance and 2011 demographic data, based on the approach described in the next section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>HRA index</title><p>Two inputs were obtained for all of the 52 Brooklyn zip codes: 1) the percent of households in poverty, based on 2009 projections from U.S. Census [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; and 2) the number of HIV diagnoses from 2005 to 2009, from New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene case surveillance data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For each zip code in Brooklyn, a numerical &#x0201c;HRA index&#x0201d; was calculated by standardizing the poverty and heterosexual HIV prevalence to the overall levels in Brooklyn. The HIV prevalence was calculated based on a denominator of adults in each zip code, assuming the fraction of non-heterosexually active adults was relatively small and evenly distributed across the geography. The final HRA index for each zip code was the sum of the standardized HIV and poverty scores.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Selecting the HRA cluster</title><p>The 52 indexed zip codes were then geographically mapped to establish a threshold for the final HRA cluster selection. The goal was to select a set of zip codes based on a high index value that would form a geographic cluster corresponding to a contiguous set of neighborhoods. This cluster analysis was completed qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative assessments were made by examining maps with HRA thresholds from the top 10 to 40&#x000a0;% of index values. Quantitatively, we used a global spatial autocorrelation statistic (Moran&#x02019;s I) to determine the extent of clustering, then a locally indicated spatial autocorrelation statistic (LISA Moran&#x02019;s I) to quantify the location of any clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Based on this analysis, the HRA for the present study was defined as the top 25&#x000a0;% of the zip codes (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the light grey region), a contiguous block of 7 zip codes that included several neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. We refer to this region as the &#x0201c;core HRA&#x0201d;. Since HHR move freely across the boundaries of the core HRA, we also selected a lower threshold to reduce artificial restriction of RDS recruitment chains.

In the present study, initial seeds are randomized to an intervention or control arm at a 1:1 ratio. Further, eligible and consenting peers who are subsequently recruited into the study are assigned to the same arm as their recruiter. Thus each initial seed and the peers subsequently enrolled in his/her recruitment chain are considered a cluster. This cluster randomized controlled trial design is necessary because intervention activities begin at the time of recruitment, when recruiters educate peer recruits on core messages. Because the statistical power of a clustered trial increases with the number of clusters, we plan to recruit more seeds than is typical in RDS (namely 40 seeds per arm), with a target sample size of 3000 individuals. The PDI/RDS study component also includes those with previously diagnosed infection (called &#x0201c;known positives&#x0201d;), and will describe HIV health indicators and engagement in HIV care among this subgroup.

If there are no major barriers to care, the navigator can monitor and support engagement in care. If there are barriers (e.g., mental illness or substance abuse), navigation involves several options: communication with the primary care provider; screening and &#x0201c;fast track&#x0201d; referrals for substance use, mental illness, housing and other services; accompaniment to health care appointments; phone call reminders; and in-person meetings to support adaptation to the HIV diagnosis and linkage to care.

A baseline interview assesses the domains noted above, supplemented with data on HIV health status, engagement in care, experience with providers, and ART prescription and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Participants then engage in a single intervention session and are trained to recruit/educate (intervention arm) or recruit (control arm) peers, and their past-year HIV health care attendance patterns and satisfaction with care are evaluated to determine whether navigation to HIV care is required.

A number of changes were made to the initial study protocol over the first six months of implementation in response to high rates of ineligibility (&#x0003e; 40&#x000a0;%), insufficient rates of enrollment which stopped recruitment chains, low numbers of female participants, an imbalance between intervention and control arms, and low rates of HIV-infected participants in the study&#x02019;s early phase of implementation. These study inefficiencies were reviewed by the study Principal and Co-Investigators, who made recommendations for adjustments. In response, changes to some eligibility criteria were instituted. Initially, participants were eligible if they had not been tested for HIV in the past year; were HIV negative or unknown status; were aged 18-<italic>50</italic> years; and resided only in the core seven zip code HRA. Further, there was initially no steering incentive for women. Third, the control intervention Session 1 was very brief (~5-10&#x000a0;min to orient participants and train them how to recruit peers, which was not sufficient for engagement). The changes to eligibility criteria reflected in the section above were designed to reduce ineligibility and improve study efficiency; steering incentives to boost the proportion of women in the sample; and increasing the duration of the control Session 1 is intended to improve engagement among the control arm participants.

Logistic regression will be used to compare groups on viral load suppression. Since HIV viral load assay results range from &#x0003c;50 to &#x0003e;100,000 copies/ml, other generalized linear models will examine intervention impact on median viral load, log transformed viral load, and on viral load dichotomized at 1,000 or 10,000 copies/ml, which have been associated with greater HIV transmission risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].

Although the NHBS uses both VBS and RDS methods, they have not yet been directly compared in terms of their efficacy and cost-effectiveness to identify undiagnosed HIV among HHR in the U. S.

VBS starts by identifying days and times at which the target population gathers at specific venues, constructing a sampling frame of venue-day-time units (VDTs), randomly selecting and visiting VDTs (the primary sampling units), and systematically intercepting and collecting information from consenting members of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Hypotheses and endpoints</title><p>We hypothesize a higher proportion of newly diagnosed participants will be recruited by RDS than VBS, after controlling for socio-demographic differences between the samples.

A venue is defined as a public space where a threshold number of the target population may congregate or pass through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Typically VBS studies target discrete venues such as churches, hair salons and barbershops, recreational centers, bars, city parks, parks or street corners outside public housing facilities, and grocery stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. While members of the target population naturally congregate in these locations, these types of venues may require the permission of a manager or other gatekeeper before recruitment. Indeed, parks and public housing are regulated by the local authorities, and private venues can close during the study period. Thus targeting these types of venues is labor-intensive.</p><p>However, the population density, built environment, and population transportation dynamics of central Brooklyn suggested an alternate means of defining a venue, namely, as city blocks where the target population congregates or passes through. But since central Brooklyn is geographically large (70.82 sq. miles) and densely populated (2.6 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], we needed to narrow the scope of potential venues to reduce redundancy and increase study efficiency.</p><p>To select specific venues for sampling during the study&#x02019;s planning phase, we drew on Department of Urban Planning geographic data showing the location, land use (residential vs. commercial), and other attributes of every building in Brooklyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].

Study staff then reviewed a random sample from this sampling frame to qualitatively assess whether this approach would yield sufficient foot traffic for study recruitment. To supplement this block approach, we also included public parks and public housing projects as discrete venues for sampling.</p><p>Venue-day-time periods (VDTs) were chosen for each venue. VDTs were defined as four-hour blocks where a sufficient number of the target population passes through the venue. For each venue defined above, we included a morning, afternoon, and evening VDT for potential recruitment.

Sampling is done without replacement for each month, but previously selected VDTs are eligible for sampling in subsequent months. For each selected VDT, we also sample two alternate VDTs in the event that recruitment within the main VDT is infeasible due to safety concerns or low attendance. One week prior to the recruitment event, study staff members observe the selected venue to determine its suitability with respect to safety and other logistical concerns. Study staff also secures a location to conduct confidential study activities, or used a large mobile van.

The guiding hypothesis for the Seek and Test aim is the following: compared with VBS, and controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across the samples, participants recruited by RDS will be more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV. This hypothesis is assessed using logistic regression analysis. Newly diagnosed HIV infection (Yes/No) is regressed on a dummy variable created to contrast participants recruited at venues with participants recruited by RDS. If the coefficient for this variable is positive and significant, we will conclude that RDS is a more effective approach for seeking HHR likely to have undiagnosed HIV infection. Covariates will include prior HIV testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study seeks to examine two approaches to uncovering undiagnosed HIV infection in an under-studied population: heterosexuals at high risk for HIV. Further, it tests components to link those with HIV-infection to HIV primary care with high retention, both newly diagnosed and those with previous HIV diagnoses. Study results will provide guidance on the most efficient and cost-effective means of uncovering this largely hidden and vulnerable population (by comparing RDS vs. VBS), and to link HIV-infected individuals to HIV care (by comparing the PDI arm vs. control). The ultimate aim of the present study is to provide an efficient, cost-effective, reproducible, and scalable sampling method and intervention approach to address the critical public health problem of undiagnosed HIV infection and delays in engagement in HIV care among HHR. This protocol provides background for other investigators interested in researching this population, which is challenging to define, reach, and engage.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MG conceived of the overall study concept and design and played a primary role in writing the manuscript.
