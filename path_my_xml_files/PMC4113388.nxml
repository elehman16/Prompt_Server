An arithmetic pre-test contained in the Scholastic Performance Test was administered to 300 children between 7 and 10 years old, including 162 males and 138 females, in the second grade of primary school. Twenty-six children whose scores showed a low level of mathematical knowledge were chosen and randomly divided into the control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups. The EG participated to the virtual environment and the CG participated in reinforcement using traditional teaching methods. Both groups took a post-test in which the Scholastic Performance Test (SPT) was given again. A statistical analysis of the results using the Student's t-test showed a significant learning improvement for the EG and no improvement for the CG (<italic>p</italic>&#x02264;0.05). The virtual environment allows the students to integrate thought, feeling and action, thus motivating the children to learn and contributing to their intellectual development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MASB and SCMR gratefully acknowledge financial support from the FAEP - Foundation for Support to Education and Research and FAPESP - S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation.

It is a basic tool for performing daily activities and encompasses various areas of knowledge. During childhood, mathematics is used for such tasks as dividing candy among friends, counting allowance money and tracking time while playing video games. During adulthood, mathematics is used for such tasks as tracking medication times and managing receipts, payments and finances <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ginsburg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Dehaene1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>However, individuals commonly have some type of difficulty in acquiring mathematical skills. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) classifies mathematical proficiency in six levels, with level 6 being the highest. Approximately 90% of the countries evaluated by PISA had 10% or more of their students at level 1 <xref rid="pone.0103354-Program1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. At this level the students are able to answer questions clearly defined involving familiar contexts and other relevant information. In sum, the students need to be able to identify information in explicit situations and also performing actions according to direct instructions <xref rid="pone.0103354-Program1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Learning disabilities in mathematics include deficits in multiple mathematical abilities depending on the student's age and education level: counting in your head, number patterns, operations (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication), area and shape and size and measurement <xref rid="pone.0103354-American1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Santos1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Children with mathematical learning disabilities are classified as having Dyscalculia <xref rid="pone.0103354-Geary1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> if they present a specific deficiency in the acquisition of mathematical skills <xref rid="pone.0103354-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103354-Archibald1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Children with mathematical learning disorders, especially children with Dyscalculia, may show a lack of motivation, feelings of guilt or math phobia <xref rid="pone.0103354-Butterworth1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Some children with mathematics learning disabilities are discriminated against or bullied by classmates, which further discourages them in a school environment <xref rid="pone.0103354-Coelho1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. They may drop out of school, thus affecting their ability to function in society. They may also avoid professional activities that use math in their adult life <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ponte1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, thus affecting their professional and personal development <xref rid="pone.0103354-Shalev1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, these children are not &#x0201c;stupid or lazy&#x0201d; and are inside the normal intelligence pattern, but their brains process information in a different way <xref rid="pone.0103354-National1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Education experts believe that pedagogical strategies based on games may remediate the learning disabilities of these children, because the natural way for children to learn about the world around them is often through play. Experts believe that the use of computer games based on situational problems with pedagogical goals may stimulate the children's thoughts and generate positive attitudes, thus contributing to their intellectual development and motivating them to create their own strategies <xref rid="pone.0103354-Moita1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Children can teach themselves mathematical concepts and specific skills by playing <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, if applied properly, computer games can encourage child involvement in the learning process. Firstly, because the games contain challenges that can motivate children to search for a solution to the presented mathematical problem <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Papastergiou1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Secondly to stimulate the construction of logical-mathematical thinking processes <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> while having fun. Therefore, the more stimulating the challenges, the more the children are interested in the game <xref rid="pone.0103354-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, computer games facilitate self-correction by allowing the child to immediately see the result of his or her actions, which helps the child understand his or her errors. Thus, games can be used as a learning tool to promote child participation <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Because computer games are an object of curiosity, exploration and interaction for children, they can become an efficient pedagogical tool if developed with a pedagogical purpose and with well-planned activities. As result, the computer games can motivate, entertain and also facilitate the learning process by training mental functions and promoting the development of logical reasoning and thought <xref rid="pone.0103354-Moita1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Aguilera1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Many virtual environments and computer games have been developed with educational goals to help children with learning disabilities.

These studies showed that student performance has improved significantly by using computer-based games when compared with traditional computer-assisted teaching techniques <xref rid="pone.0103354-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Both entertainment and educational computer games addressing certain mathematical skills were found in the literature <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103354-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but these games did not cover mathematical thinking in its entirety. Only two of these games were used to remediate Dyscalculia: the game &#x0201c;Number Race,&#x0201d; which was developed to improve basic numerical cognition <xref rid="pone.0103354-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and the game &#x0201c;Graphogame-Math,&#x0201d; which was developed to improve exact numerosity and number symbols <xref rid="pone.0103354-Rsnen1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. An adaptive E-learning tool that teaches with an entertaining numerical comparison task <xref rid="pone.0103354-Brunda1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> was also tested on children with mathematical learning disabilities. The results obtained from these computer-based methods show that they may be useful for remediation of Dyscalculia in children.</p><p>However, there are not many studies on interventions that both remediate Dyscalculia and promote participant discussion on a specific problem, combining the games' entertainment resources with an educational environment <xref rid="pone.0103354-Gee1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>This article presents a virtual environment that incorporates 18 educational computer games, which are designed to contain elements of entertainment games, into a fun theme <xref rid="pone.0103354-Gee1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

In addition, it was also developed to confront the children with fun situational problems, previously planned with the pedagogical goal of helping, to children develop necessary mathematical skills for functioning socially.</p><p>This virtual environment is composed of two settings, a city and a forest, which contain objects that are linked to entertaining and educational mini-games. The storyline of the virtual environment was designed to promote child interaction and follows a character named Tom. Tom is a small turtle from a community located in a forest near the city who was captured to be sold in an open-air market in the city. Some members of his community are upset at Tom's capture and plan a rescue, which is led by a monkey named Caco. Caco is the avatar controlled by the child using the keyboard.</p><p>The environment is accessed with an Internet Explorer-compatible web browser.

The child can ignore the invitation by moving the avatar to another area or can easily accept the invitation and be transported to a mini-game focused on one or more mathematical skills. The games accessed through the links were developed by the author with consideration of the intrinsic motivation factors that should be in computer games as challenge, control, feedback, curiosity and fantasy <xref rid="pone.0103354-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Once the user &#x0201c;guesses&#x0201d; it correctly, the avatar will be able to climb to the above floor. In this stage, known as second phase, the avatar (&#x02018;Caco&#x02019;) should collect the boxes with eggs. In this moment, the number of eggs inside the box will be displayed and the user should again to identify the right position from the number displayed by the game on the screen as previously described. Once the user has completed this phase, the game will be automatically advanced to the next phase (phase 3). In the third and last phase, the monkey Caco needs to pick the bananas, but for that the user should answer correctly the mathematical questions presented on the screen every time that Caco finds a bunch of bananas.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Slot Machine</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Slot Machine - The child can invest the money earned in other games located in the game room of the City scenario.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Off Road</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Off Road &#x02013; Racing game where the child should control a truck to get to the end of the trail overcoming obstacles. If one reaches some pineapple, shall inform the result of a mathematical expression and if hit earns points and can continue playing. If one does it wrong nothing happens and one can keep trying until get it right. To start the game, the child must turn off the alarm system, hitting a number between one and ten randomly selected by computer. Every child attempt, the system provides a hint written and spoken (generated by the speech synthesizer), indicating if the secret number is higher or lower than that reported. In this game, the child can hit through trial and error, but it is expected the child realizes that it is important to associate the response of each result to move faster on the track. The alarm sounds if the child exceeds three attempts, but the child can try again at another time.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number Race 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Racing game where the child should control a car and pass upon the right sequence of numbers.

Otherwise, nothing happens and the child should continue looking for another card with the same sound that initially clicked.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shark</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In this game the ability to add is crafted in getting the result always equal to five. The child must control the shark (in the avatar Caco is ridden) on the seabed for it to eat the right fish, avoiding the drowning of Caco. Each fish represents a number. During the game, some fish appear with hidden numbers, this happens to arouse more emotion, as if the child chooses a fish without number, the lucky will be at risk.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Selling Corn</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Selling Corn &#x02013; The child must act on Caco avatar for him to sell corn in a tent.

To every game session numbers involved in the cards are randomly generated. The child has a time of 60 seconds to solve the problems, which decrease according to the evolution of each phase. If the child cannot hit the cards in the estimated time, the game offers a new session with other numbers drawn.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Noggin Breaker e Monkey Puzzle</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">These games focus on memory, reasoning and observation to assemble puzzles with images of low complexity.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Motocross</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In the first phase, the child should ride a bike and grab stars with the number requested by the ant (on the top). If the child picks the wrong number, the fox advises that it is not the correct number, otherwise earn points. In the second phase, even and odd numbers are worked and the child avoids the odd stars and rescues the even stars, earning points.

The pre-test results show that some children performed excellently for their grade level (a score above 13) while others performed badly (a score below 9).</p><p>According to their teachers, 61% of the children who performed badly on the arithmetic subtest had persistent difficulties learning math during their traditional classes. These children were chosen to test the virtual environment, which was developed to help children with this type of learning disability.</p><p>Statistical analysis using a Student's t-test on the pre-test scores obtained by these children (randomly grouped as CG and EG) showed that the difference between the groups was not significant before the intervention (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7533).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103354-g014">Figure 14</xref>, the average score on the post-test for the EG (5.09) was higher than the average score for the CG (3), indicating a positive effect of the virtual environment.</p><p>The improvement in scores for the EG probably occurred because the children tried to perform analyses and predictions by acquiring mathematical skills and using mathematical thought processes to resolve a specific problem or challenge that they encountered. This process may promote the development of abstraction, a cognitive skill essential for mathematical understanding <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, the children could freely explore the virtual environment and interact with the games without a pre-established sequence, playing the same game several times to beat it. The virtual environment did not have a mechanism to punish the children for incorrect answers. Thus, the frustration of losing was avoided, and the children could replay the games as they gained mathematical skills and their determination to beat the game grew. A design that avoids frustration and allows free exploration is very important for children with a history of frustration in the classroom.</p><p>According to reports from parents and teachers, the children were excited to participate in the training. They were also happier, showed more effort in solving math problems in the classroom and were more autonomous and willing to continue their studies. For example, one of the children that had persistent difficulties learning mathematics brought the workbook that she had performed in class and proudly showed a note from the teacher praising her correct answers.</p><p>The act of playing appears to have enriched the teaching-learning process of this child, helping her to develop a mathematical way of thinking as observed in literature <xref rid="pone.0103354-Moita1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Aguilera1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The act of playing permitted this child, as well as the others, to reflect, make predictions and compare objects, events and attitudes.

Among these mathematical skills are the abilities to understand the concept of numbers and their size, to count, to sort and to perform arithmetic operations.

Statistical analysis of the results showed that the virtual environment helped the EG significantly improve their scores on the post-test, whereas the CG did not improve their scores. The improvement in scores for children who had computer-based reinforcement compared with children who had reinforcement using traditional teaching confirmed that learning and training can change the human brain and generate measurable benefits for the children <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ansari1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Zamarian1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. The computer is an instigating, attractive and stimulating tool, in opposition to the use of notebook and blackboard of what children are used to. Thus, it is believed that using computer games in the teaching methods can stimulate the intellectual autonomy growth of these children <xref rid="pone.0103354-OECD1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, since some students that are difficult to motivate in the classroom or that have difficulty to perform certain tasks in traditional classes, surprisingly and actively participate in the teaching strategies that include ludic methods (plays and games) and/or the use of computer.</p><p>When the children were invited to play, they participated effectively in the game as a consequence from the children's immersion by the software <xref rid="pone.0103354-StielerHunt1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Arnab1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. From that moment, the child establishes a relationship with the game that allows him to interact with the computer, through a graphical interface, that involves it using immediate feedbacks with visual and sound effects, challenges, storyline, plot and playfulness that only computerized games are able to offer <xref rid="pone.0103354-Arnab1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Papastergiou1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus, the child ceases to act as a passive subject starting to act actively. With the immersions, the child interacts with the reality of the game becoming represented by the figure of the avatar <xref rid="pone.0103354-StielerHunt1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Thus, it is possible to observe that the software has the function of awaken the children's interest to interact with the character and to involve it to meet the challenges accepting the rules and limits proposed by the game <xref rid="pone.0103354-Papastergiou1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The results were positive not only because the computer was enticing to the children, as observed by <xref rid="pone.0103354-Moita1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, but also because of the learning strategy implemented in the virtual environment as suggest in <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. According to <xref rid="pone.0103354-Csikszentmihalyi1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, children may stop playing when discouraged, which can occur when the implemented challenges are not exciting. The results showed that the fun nature of the virtual environment pleased all of the children, as a growing interest was recorded during the intervention sessions. In addition to playing the games more than once, they asked for the time to be extended so that they could continue playing. The teachers also commented that the children in the EG performed better in the classroom during and after the intervention. This is probably because interacting with the virtual environment led the children to be more willing to learn, as mentioned by <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bottino1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Papastergiou1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and to develop necessary mathematical skills <xref rid="pone.0103354-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.The fact is that the ludic cannot be disregarded for exercising significant influence in the language, thinking and concentration development of the child <xref rid="pone.0103354-Valentini1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Vygotsky1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Through ludic the child has the curiosity stimulated <xref rid="pone.0103354-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, which leads to act and to acquire initiative to acting and self-confidence <xref rid="pone.0103354-Castelhano1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. When playing, the child acts spontaneously and, when motived by challenge <xref rid="pone.0103354-Voss1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, the child uses all acquired knowledge besides creating new cognitive processes as she continues playing <xref rid="pone.0103354-Bertolo1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Echeverra1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. However, in the game, the act of making mistake is not negative, but just a stimulus to learning. During the game, the mistake can produce less frustrating results <xref rid="pone.0103354-Ardito1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref> and children can developed attention and concentration focus <xref rid="pone.0103354-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103354-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>.</p><p>The virtual environment was designed to incorporate distinct, entertaining games that address mathematical skills into a common storyline and to be played on the Internet with the possibility of interacting with other players through chat. The positive results of this virtual environment on mathematical skills show that pedagogical approaches implemented using games may help children learn and make efficient, flexible use of learning time if the games are connected to a virtual environment that permits free exploration without an established an order of execution. Therefore, using virtual environments similar to the ones shown in this study can help educators to create a teaching plan that improves their students' practical knowledge.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jo&#x000e3;o Salinet for his valuable suggestions and manuscript revision.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0103354-Biembengut1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Biembengut MS, Hein N (2000) Mathematical modelling in teaching.
