An incidence between 80,000 and 250,000 ACL ruptures was estimated in young athletes.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The prevalence of ACL and meniscal injuries could be as high as 0.35%, and risk is increased by higher body height or mass index (BMI). ACL is associated with secondary osteoarthrosis and can lead to functional impairment and economic burden.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The recent increase in the frequency of ACL injuries might be related to an increase in school sports participation. ACL mostly arises via noncontact mechanisms. Although radiographs are used to rule out associated conditions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the criterion standard diagnosis method for ACL rupture.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>ACL arthroscopic reconstruction surgery typically involves autologous graft, such as the central third of the patellar tendon or the flexor tendons (semitendinosus and gracilis). The results and complications of such approaches are well described in the literature.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> A lengthy rest period is usually required after surgical reconstruction of complete ACL rupture. Although new methods have been proposed to shorten the time required for the graft healing process, the clinical and pain improvements of these methods remain controversial.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Several new rehabilitation modalities have been proposed after ACL reconstruction. Range of motion (ROM), strengthening, early high-intensity electrical stimulation, and functional exercises have been proposed as beneficial supplementary treatments during rehabilitation. There is no evidence to suggest that accelerated rehabilitation is harmful. However, further research is needed to evaluate rehabilitation timing and clinical improvement when supplementary treatments are applied.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>Despite the lack of studies about trigger points prevalence or incidence in this condition, trigger point dry needling (TrP-DN) treatment has been proposed as a useful addition to the rehabilitation of ACL reconstructed patients with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), reducing pain intensity, increasing knee flexion range, and modifying the mechanical properties of the quadriceps muscle during late stage rehabilitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Indeed, MPS may be considered as a set of sensitive, motor or autonomic signs and symptoms generated by hyperirritable spots in a muscle taut band, which are myofascial trigger points (MTrPs).<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Active MTrPs may produce spontaneous and recognized pain in patients with MPS.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Recently, a systematic review addressing dry needling (DN) in subjects with MTrPs in the lower quarter concluded that TrP-DN is effective at reducing pain in the short term. Nevertheless, further research is needed to investigate the effect of TrP-DN in conjunction with other interventions.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> A single treatment of TrP-DN (under anesthesia) before total knee arthroplasty was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing pain intensity after 1 month.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Also, the addition of TrP-DN to a proprioceptive and strengthening exercise program was able to improve function and stability in the lower limb.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Finally, the passive mechanical properties and referred pain elicited by active MTrPs in the vastus medialis may improve after TrP-DN intervention.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>To date, this is the first randomized clinical trial (RCT) to support the use of DN in the early rehabilitation process after ACL reconstruction. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the pain intensity, ROM, stability, and functionality improvements in mid term after quadriceps vastus medialis TrP-DN in conjunction with a rehabilitation protocol after surgical reconstruction of complete ACL rupture.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>A single-blinded RCT was carried out from February 2016 to January 2017, following the CONSORT guidelines, flow diagram, and checklist.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Therefore, a blinded evaluator and a consecutive sampling method were used. Randomization into 2 intervention groups was performed &#x0201c;per protocol&#x0201d; using opaque closed letter envelopes.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Ethical and trial registry</title><p>First, the Ethics Committee of <italic>Nuestra Se&#x000f1;ora de Sonsoles</italic> Hospital (&#x000c1;vila, Spain; November 26, 2015) approved the study.

Therefore, 44 participants were recruited at the <italic>FisioSalud &#x000c1;vila</italic> (&#x000c1;vila, Spain) private clinical center and divided into 2 intervention groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22 per group).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were: 18- to 55-year-old subjects, in the subacute phase (from 7 to 21 days) after unilateral surgical reconstruction of complete ACL rupture, confirmed by MRI in the medical record.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Also, the presence of at least 1 active MTrP in the vastus medialis ipsilateral to ACL rupture had to have been detected by palpation following the recommended clinical diagnostic criteria (nodule, taut band, spontaneous and patient&#x02032;s recognized pain, and ROM limitation at full stretch).<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>The exclusion criteria were: bilaterally previous diagnoses in the medical record, such as neuropathic pain in the lower limb, lumbosacral radiculopathy, saphenous nerve entrapment, meralgia paresthetica, fractures, rheumatoid or systemic conditions, other surgeries, post-surgery complications (i.e., thrombosis or osteomyelitis), belonephobia, legs lenth difference in the lower limb (&#x0003e;0.5&#x0200a;cm), and the presence of any condition considered an MTrPs perpetuating factor (i.e., fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, or iron deficiencies).<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Sociodemographic and descriptive data</title><p>The sociodemographic descriptive characteristics were collected at baseline: sex (male or female), age (years), number of associated injuries to ACL rupture (meniscopathy, ligament injuries, or chondropathy),<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> TrP-DN adverse effect (considering hemorrhages &#x0003e;4&#x0200a;cm<sup>2</sup>),<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> use of heparin during TrP-DN,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> postsurgery time (days from the surgery to the beginning of the rehabilitation protocol),<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and ACL reconstruction surgery type (patellar bone-tendon-bone or hamstring tendon grafts methods).<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>Pain intensity was the primary outcome. In addition, ROM, stability, and functionality were the secondary outcomes. Pain intensity, ROM, and functionality outcome measurements were performed at baseline (A<sub>0</sub>), immediately after the first intervention (A<sub>1</sub>), as well as 24&#x0200a;hours (A<sub>2</sub>), 1 week (A<sub>3</sub>), and 5 weeks (A<sub>4</sub>) after the first treatment day (before the treatment beginning on this day). Stability was only assessed at A<sub>3</sub> and A<sub>4</sub>. All assessments were carried out by a blinded examiner. The assessment times were chosen to coincide with the different TrP-DN stages of muscle regeneration and reinnervation (in short term [A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2,</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>] and mid term [A<sub>4</sub>]).<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>First, the pain intensity was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) of 10&#x0200a;mm (from 0 [no pain] to 10&#x0200a;mm [maximum pain]). Patients marked on the scale their spontaneous subjective pain intensity of the affected ACL knee using a marker pen. The VAS is a recommended, reliable, and valid tool, and had been previously used in knee conditions after TrP-DN.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>Second, the ROM was evaluated with an analogue universal goniometer (UG), which is a 0 to 360 degree plastic instrument with 2&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;25&#x0200a;cm moveable arms and a scale marked in 1 degree increments. The prone position, the lateral femoral epicondyle coinciding with the center of the fulcrum, and the 0 degree normal physiological full knee extension were considered to assess the knee flexion movement parameter. The UG has been shown to be a reliable and valid and has been recommended for use in clinical practice for adults with musculoskeletal conditions of the knee, as well as been used in previous TrP-DN studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>Third, stability was measured using the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). The SEBT is a reliable and valid objective measure for identifying deficits and improvements in dynamic postural control related to lower extremity conditions and induced fatigue. The recommended protocol of 5 repetitions in each of the 8 directions of the star (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral) was applied. The distance from the star center (coinciding with the affected ACL lower extremity) to the farthest marked point (with the distal part of the nonaffected lower limb) for each star direction was measured in centimeters. The final punctuation was calculated with the mean of the 5 repetitions in each star direction, divided by (8&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;lower limb length) cm and multiplied by 100.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup></p><p>Finally, The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to measure the physical function of the knee. This scale was shown to be a valid and reliable tool, which was utilized to assess the physical function in patients with knee surgery after TrP-DN. This tool comprises 24 questions: 5 questions about pain (0&#x02013;20 points), 2 questions about stiffness (0&#x02013;8 points), and 17 questions about physical functions difficulty (0&#x02013;68 points), which may be completed in &#x0003c;5&#x0200a;minutes. Higher WOMAC scores indicate a larger deterioration degree.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Intervention</title><p>The patients were randomly assigned into 2 intervention groups, which received either the rehabilitation protocol plus TrP-DN (Rh&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;TrP-DN group; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) or the rehabilitation protocol only (Rh group; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22). Both groups were treated by an experienced physical therapist with &#x0003e;6 years and 30&#x0200a;hours per week of clinical practice, following the previous recommendations to achieve a good interexaminer reproducibility (&#x003ba;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.63) in the active MTrPs palpation diagnosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>Only 1 session of a TrP-DN intervention on the most hyperalgesic active MTrP of the vastus medialis ipsilateral to the affected ACL knee was applied on the first treatment day of the Rh&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;TrP-DN group.

Furthermore, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to determine the LTRs effect in the outcome measurements of the Rh&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;TrP-DN group.</p><p>In addition, a multiple regression analysis was carried out to determine the variables which produced a significant effect on the outcome measurements (VAS, WOMAC, and ROM) after 24&#x0200a;hours of the intervention. The followed methodology was calculated by punctual estimation of the model parameters, individual significance of the variables and model constant, regression contrast (ANOVA) to study the model global validity and verify the coefficient of the prediction model, and model verification by the residues analysis.</p><p>Considering &#x003c1; as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and <italic>k</italic> as the number of measurements (<italic>k</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2), the intrarater reliability study was based on the Spearman-Brown formula:&#x000a0;<disp-formula id="MU1"><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6726-g003.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>Therefore, the Spearman-Brown reliability index of <italic>&#x003c1;k</italic> &#x0003e;0.9 was considered excellent intrarater reliability.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Baseline measurements and flow diagram</title><p>Comparing the Rh and Rh&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;TrP-DN groups, we found no significant differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;.05) in the sociodemographic characteristics, descriptive data, or outcome measurements at baseline (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).
