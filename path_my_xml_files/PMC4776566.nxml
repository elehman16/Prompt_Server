These complications are the most significant contributor to morbidity, mortality, and expenses associated with the hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Development of pulmonary complication is associated with impaired oxygenation and inconsistencies in gas exchange.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] As the investigations have shown, arterial hypoxemia following CABG is 100%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Because of the close relation between heart and pulmonary system, any change in the pulmonary system may affect the cardiac functions. Therefore, identification of the complication and early interventions are needed to prevent the incidence of most postoperative pulmonary complications.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Some of the interventions are to prevent the pulmonary complication after CABG, which can be highlighted by deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry (IS), continuous positive airway pressure, and early mobilization.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] We can use some methods for the improvement in the pulmonary function, but no single method is preferred.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In this study, the IS has been used for improvement in exchange of gases and oxygenation, depending on the cooperation of the patient and easy fulfillment.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In most of the studies, this method has been widely used, especially in the management of patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery, but the results supporting the use of such equipment to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications are not yet established, which has led to controversies in the improvement of pulmonary function in the exchange of gases and oxygenation after coronary artery bypass surgery, and there is a need for further studies to clarify the effect of this technique.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Afrasiabi <italic>et al</italic>. have studied the effect of IS on arterial blood gases after coronary artery bypass surgery. In this study, patients used the IS during 6 h after extubation and it measured the arterial blood gases preoperatively, 1 h after extubation, and 7 h after extubation. At the end of study, they reported that the use of IS has no significant beneficial effect on artery blood gas parameters.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>. and Overend <italic>et al</italic>. have stated that the evidence supporting the use of the IS to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications is not established yet, and they suggest that there is a need for more studies to clarify this subject.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Agostini and Sing, with a different viewpoint, have reported that this method can be useful in improvement of pulmonary function.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Because the postoperative pulmonary complications present high rates of morbidity and mortality, increased hospital costs, and prolonged hospital stay after coronary artery bypass surgery, it is obvious that the need for the breathing exercises is important.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Because there are no planned breathing exercises, on one hand, in our open heart surgery intensive care unit (ICU) nowadays, and on the other hand, there are various results and controversies among related studies in this context, researchers decided to examine the effect of IS on the gas exchange and oxygenation after coronary artery bypass surgery. To evaluate the impact of this method on oxygenation and gas exchange, the arterial blood gases can be measured because the measurement of arterial blood gases is one of the most reliable indices for determination of gas exchange and oxygenation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the postoperative cardiac surgery period, the hemodynamic monitoring and maintaining hemodynamic stability are controled by inserted arterial line;[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as a result, sampling for arterial blood gas analysis is really convenient. Finally, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of IS on arterial blood gases after coronary artery bypass surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was a clinical trial. The tested cases in this study were patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in open heart ICU of Chamran and Sina hospitals in Isfahan in 2012 (No: IRCT2013050913280N1). A sample size of 25 patients per group was selected. The sample size calculation was based on standard deviation of a similar study,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and considered a 95% level of significance and a power of 80%. The inclusion criteria were: Willingness to participate in the study, having undergone non-emergency open heart surgery, having neither mental and neuromuscular disorders or any severe pulmonary disease [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] nor renal dysfunction, mechanical ventilation for less than 24 h after admission to the open heart ICU, and the ability to use the IS machine. We excluded patients with hemodynamic instability (dangerous dysrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, severe hypotension) after surgery, those having neurological and mental disorders after operation, those who required re-intubation or re-operation, patients who were willing to quit the study, and those who died. Informed consent was got from the patients, and the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences ethics committee approved the study.</p><p>The patients were randomized to IS group (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and control group (<italic>n</italic> = 25). The intervention group used IS (flow-oriented) and the control group practiced usual breathing exercise (unplanned breathing exercise). Preoperatively, patients in the intervention group were informed and edjucated the breathing technique with IS. After that, it was done by the patients and controlled for its correctness. The intervention was started an hour after extubation, and the patients were encouraged to perform 10 times deep breathing with IS every 2 h in the daytime for three postoperative days. Patients were encouraged to inhale slowly to raise the balls in the chamber and continue inhaling and try to raise more balls; when they could not inhale any longer, we removed the mouthpiece and they were asked to hold their breath for 3 s and finally they exhaled slowly.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This device promotes effective inspiration by visual feedback and encourages enthusiasm among patients who use it.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The patients were instructed to perform deep breathing with IS in the sitting or semi-sitting position and patients held their hands on the incision to support it. The control group was not instructed to do any breathing exercise by the researchers; they only did the usual exercise (unplanned breathing exercise).</p><p>The arterial blood gases (partial pressure oxygenation, arterial saturation, and partial pressure carbon dioxide) were measured before the induction of anesthesia, on the first, second, and third postoperative days (after extubation). The background variables including age, gender, history of smoking, and history of diseases were obtained by referring to the medical records of the patients and by asking the patients.</p><p>All data were analyzed using SPSS software 18 version.

A systematic review was conducted by Agostini <italic>et al</italic>. of seven studies about IS after thorax surgery. Three studies reported that IS can improve gas exchange and others stated that IS is ineffective after thorax surgery. Finally, they concluded that IS can promote oxygenation and gas exchange after thorax surgery.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] So, it supports the results of this study. Mordian <italic>et al</italic>. showed planned breathing exercise (IS and deep breathing together) significantly improved PaO2 and SaO2 on the postoperative day of coronary artery bypass surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Indeed, it cannot explain exactly which method (IS and deep breathing) was more effective in the improvement of oxygenation and gas exchange, but it also does not deny these exercises (IS and deep breathing exercise) causing improvement in pulmonary function with respect to gas exchange and oxygenation. On the other side, there are controversial results reported by the studies conducted. Afrasiabi <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that the IS does not have significant effect on improvement of arterial blood gases.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Afrasiabi <italic>et al</italic>. measured the arterial blood gases only 6 h after extubation; in our study also, there were no significant differences in the mean arterial blood gas parameters between the two groups on the second postoperative day, but there was a significant difference in the mean arterial blood gas parameters between the groups on the third postoperative day. Also, Brage stated that improvement in blood oxygenation by respiratory exercises is temporary and is reversible after a short time; so, for improvement in oxygenation repetitive exercises are needed.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Carvalho <italic>et al</italic>. in systematic review study reviewed 30 studies in relation to IS. They reported that there was no power evidence to support the use of IS after CABG, and there is a need for studies to clarify the effect and justify the use of this technique.</p><p>Finally, it can be stated that the usage of IS caused significant improvement in the arterial blood gas parameters (PaO2, SaO2, and PaCO2) after coronary artery bypass surgery.</p><p>The main limitation in this study is no having an real control group because if the patients did not use any respiratory exercises, it would mean we do not meet ethical principles. So, the control group followed the usual respiratory exercises (unplanned respiratory exercise).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>This article has been extracted from a dissertation approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences No.391339.
