The conventional pedicle screw (CPS) was inserted directly into vertebrae in CPS group; PMMA was injected prior to insertion of CPS in PMMA-PS group; and the EPS was inserted in EPS group. Sheep were killed and biomechanical tests, micro-CT analysis and histological observation were performed at both 6 and 12 weeks post-operation. At 6-week and 12-week, screw stabilities in EPS and PMMA-PS groups were significantly higher than that in CPS group, but there were no significant differences between EPS and PMMA-PS groups at two study periods. The screw stability in EPS group at 12-week was significantly higher than that at 6-week. The bone trabeculae around the expanding anterior part of EPS were more and denser than that in CPS group at 6-week and 12-week. PMMA was found without any degradation and absorption forming non-biological &#x0201c;screw-PMMA-bone&#x0201d; interface in PMMA-PS group, however, more and more bone trabeculae surrounded anterior part of EPS improving local bone quality and formed biological &#x0201c;screw-bone&#x0201d; interface.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>EPS can markedly enhance screw stability with a similar effect to the traditional method of screw augmentation with PMMA in initial surgery in osteoporosis. EPS can form better biological interface between screw and bone than PMMA-PS. In addition, EPS have no risk of thermal injury, leakage and compression caused by PMMA. We propose EPS has a great application potential in augmentation of screw stability in osteoporosis in clinic.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (2007AA02Z468).

A main possible drawback of PMMA augmentation is neurologic injury resulting from cement leakage or thermal effects. To address these issues, some researchers and our group designed an expansive pedicle screw (EPS). It expands radially at the anterior half part of screw in vertebral body and keeps the diameter of the posterior half part of screw unchanged in pedicle. It has already been proved <xref rid="pone.0074827-Stephen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Wan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Cook2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> that EPS can significantly improve screw fixation strength and reduce the risk of pedicle penetration in situations of compromised bone quality.</p><p>Intriguingly, we found from the related literatures <xref rid="pone.0074827-Kiner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Frankel2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Moon1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> that, in spite of neurologic injury risk, PMMA is widely used for pedicle screw augmentation in osteoporosis due to its distinguished mechanical performance. However, neither biomechanical nor interfacial comparisons of EPS and polymethylmethacrylate-augmented pedicle screw (PMMA-PS) were found, especially in primary spinal instrumentation. It had been proved that, despite specific differences in various morphologic indices, the anisotropy of lumbar cancellous bone in sheep showed the same trend as that of human beings, so sheep lumbar vertebrae may be a good choice for experiments of spinal instrumentation <xref rid="pone.0074827-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074827-Sheng1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we chose sheep as experimental material <italic>in vivo</italic> in this study. The biomechanical fixation strength of EPS and PMMA-PS was compared through axial pullout tests.

Each lamina from the first lumbar vertebra (L1) to the sixth lumbar vertebra (L6) was exposed by the posterior midline approach. Six lumbar vertebrae were divided into three groups randomly (two vertebrae with four pedicles in each group). In all groups, the screw insertion point was at the intersection of the upper 1/3 line of transverse process and the vertical tangential line of the lateral margin of the zygapophyseal joint. The pilot hole was prepared 20.0 mm in depth with a 2.5-mm drill in both pedicles of each vertebra, following an angle of 40&#x000b0; to the spinous process in the sagittal plane. The hole was then checked with a probe to ensure that the pedicle had not been violated. Each hole was then tapped using a 3.0-mm tap (Medtronic-Weigao Orthopedic Device Company, Shandong, China). The hole was again checked with a probe to verify an intact pedicle. In CPS group, CPS was inserted through the pilot hole into vertebral body without any augmentation. In PMMA-PS group, PMMA (1.0 ml) was injected into the pilot hole prior to the insertion of CPS. The bone cement powder was mixed with the cement solution at ratio of 2&#x02236;1 (gram to milliliter) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The cement was injected in the toothpaste-like phase. In EPS group, EPS was inserted through pedicle into vertebral body. All screws were inserted by hand using a ratcheted screwdriver (Medtronic-Weigao Orthopedic Device Company, Shandong, China) until the hub of the screw was firmly seated against the posterior cortex. The incision was sutured by layers after insertion of all screws. A medicine (cefazolin sodium, 2.0 mg/d) for the prevention of injection was administrated through intramuscular injection for five days. Eight sheep were randomized into two study periods of 6 weeks post-operation (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4) and 12 weeks post-operation (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4). The sheep were sacrificed and lumbar vertebrae (L1-L6) were harvested at the end of the assigned study periods. For two pedicle screws in each vertebra, one side was selected randomly for axial pullout tests. After biomechanical tests, the contralateral side was prepared for micro-CT analysis and histological evaluation of screw-bone interfacial properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Axial Pullout Tests</title><p>The screw-placed vertebrae were mounted onto a special jig, which allowed for rotation about the x- and z-axis.

The results showed that PMMA could make notable contributions to augmentation of screw stability in osteoporosis.</p><p>However, to our knowledge, there were few studies about biomechanical and interfacial comparisons between EPS and PMMA-PS, especially in primary spine instrumentation in osteoporosis. In a pilot research <xref rid="pone.0074827-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we found that EPS could markedly enhance screw stability with a similar effect to the traditional PMMA-PS in primary surgery in osteoporotic cadaveric lumbar vertebrae. Due to the osseointegration between screw and bone tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>, the stability and interfacial comparisons of EPS and PMMA-PS will be detected in osteoporotic animal spine. Thus, we induced osteoporosis sheep model firstly and then performed this comparative study in osteoporotic sheep lumbar vertebrae.</p><p>In our previous study <xref rid="pone.0074827-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we found significant reduction on BMD, micro-architectural parameters and mechanical properties one year after only OVX. There was 23% decrease on BMD of lumbar vertebrae between pre-OVX and post-OVX. In order to ensure the successful induction of osteoporosis model, therefore, we prolonged the injection period of steroids to 10 months in this study and considered more than 25% decrease in lumbar BMD as the standard of model establishment in this study. With 12-month OVX and 10-month glucocorticoid-application, there was mean 27.2% decrease on BMD of lumbar vertebrae between pre-induction and post-induction.</p><p>In the present study, micro-CT analysis and histological observation revealed that the expanded anterior part of EPS formed a clawlike structure holding bone tissues firmly. The two fins of expanding part performed strong stressing to surrounding bone tissues, which induced the local bone growth and improved the quality of bone tissue (amount and dense of bone trabeculae). The clawlike structure and the surrounding denser bone tissues interacted with each other to maintain the stabilization of screw in theory and it was proved in biomechanical tests that EPS showed higher fixation strength than CPS at both 6-week and 12-week. With the continuous stress stimulation of expanded anterior part from 6-week to 12-week, there was a significantly improvement on the quality of local bone tissue (amount and dense of bone trabeculae) in micro-CT analysis. The fibrous tissue at 6-week were replaced by the mature bone tissue connected with each other forming the cavitas medullaris and the better biological interface at 12-week. Based on the improved bone quality, EPS showed a further significantly improved stability from 6-week to 12-week.</p><p>There were no degradation and absorption of PMMA and no significant change on screw stability from 6-week to 12-week. Due to the property of nondegradation, however, PMMA existed around screw and hampered the direct contact between bone and screw for long term. It led to no biointegration of bone and screw and formed the non-biological interface, which may influence the long-term stability of screw. However, it needs the further study on screw stability at the longer study periods post-operation.</p><p>However, there were several limitations in present study. It is more scientific and rigorous to monitoring BMD of sheep lumbar vertebrae after insertion of screw until the sacrifice of sheep. In the future study, we will measure the BMD of proximal femur after insertion of screw in spine to assess the change on bone quality. The significant change on sheep bone quality would bring significant influence on screw stability in vivo. As showed in micro-CT reconstruction, PMMA interdigitated with surrounding trabecular bone. It is very difficult to distinguish them completely using density slicing in histomorphometric analysis of bone tissue, which possibly brings bias to our results. Therefore, we just analyzed histomorphometry of bone tissue around EPS and CPS, which may accurately reflect the stabilization mechanism of EPS compared with CPS through histomorphometric analysis. It also did not affect the observations on the interface between bone tissue and screw in all groups. We will connect screws with rod and transverse connection to mimic the biomechanical environment in spinal posterior instrumentation in next research. The same kind of screws will be inserted in one sheep lumbar vertebrae, which is similar to the real condition in clinic. As we found in preliminary study in vitro, three was significant different fixation strength between CPS and EPS and between CPS and PMMA-PS. If we inserted these different kinds of screws in one sheep and connected these screws together with rod and transverse connection, the loading distributed along two rods and transverse connection into all screws and the stress concentration would happen to the screws with lower fixation strength. In this condition, loosening may firstly happen to the screws with lower stability, which would lead to failure of whole structure. We will also prolong the study periods post-operation in order to evaluate the long-term screw stability and observe the long-term interface between screw and bone tissue, which will be more similar to the real condition of follow up in clinic and be more helpful to our clinical assessments. There was just qualitative assessment in histological observation in present study. Therefore, we will perform fluorescence double labeling with tetracycline and calcein in order to evaluate the bone growth in vivo through objective quantitive parameters. It will be more objective to demonstrate the condition of bone growth through several parameters.</p><p>In this study, we proved that EPS could markedly enhance screw stability with a similar effect to the traditional method of screw augmentation with PMMA in initial surgery in osteoporosis. EPS shows excellent early stability and interface in vivo. In addition, EPS have no risk of thermal injury, leakage and compression caused by PMMA. In conclusion, we propose that EPS is an effective, safe and easy method and has a great application potential in augmentation of screw stability in osteoporosis in clinic.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Senior Engineer Jun Wang and Senior Technician Rong Lv for their cooperations in micro-CT scanning analysis and histological observation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0074827-Fisher1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
