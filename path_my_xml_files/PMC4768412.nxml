Current surgical treatment provides relief to the accompanying pain and disability but does not restore the biological function of the intervertebral disc. NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc plus, an autologous cell compound for autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation, was developed to reduce the degenerative sequelae after lumbar disc surgery or to prophylactically avoid degeneration in adjacent discs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical phase I/II combination study. A total of 120 adult patients are allocated in a ratio of 2:1:1. Sample size and power calculations were performed to detect the minimal clinically important difference of 10 units, with an expected standard deviation of 12 in the Oswestry Disability Index, which is the primary outcome parameter. Secondary outcome parameters include the visual analog scale and the EQ-5D questionnaire. Changes in physical and mental health are evaluated using the Short Form-12 (SF-12). Moreover, radiological and functional outcomes are evaluated. The major inclusion criterion is a single lumbar disc herniation that requires sequestrectomy. Transplantation is performed 90&#x000a0;days thereafter. Study data generation (study sites) and data storage, processing, and statistical analysis are clearly separated.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this phase-I/II study, NDplus is being investigated for its clinical applicability, safety, and efficacy in the repair of herniated, nucleotomized discs, and of adjacent degenerated discs, if present. To date, autologous disc chondrocytes have not been transplanted into degenerative discs without previous disc herniation. As such, this is the first study to investigate a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic approach to treat degenerative discs of the lumbar spine.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>EudraCT No: 2010-023830-22, ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu">NCT01640457</ext-link>, 8 November 2010</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation</kwd><kwd>Degenerative disc disease</kwd><kwd>Lumbar back pain</kwd><kwd>Sequestrectomy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The vast majority of low back pain (LBP) is self-limited or successfully treated conservatively, whereas a small proportion of patients develop chronic LBP intractable to nonsurgical treatments. These patients present an increasing medical and socioeconomic problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is emphasized as an important cause of LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With progressive degeneration, the effectiveness of the nutrition mechanism of the intervertebral disc decreases; in consequence, the nucleus pulposus cells lose their ability to produce proteoglycan and other important extracellular matrix proteins, which results in disc desiccation and progressive instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most treatment approaches, for example, the aggressive removal of the pathological disc or spondylodesis, do not address options of restoring structural or biological deteriorations when IVDD is the underlying problem. However, cell retransplantation and restoration, as a procedure used in this trial, would offer a less invasive and biological alternative to lumbar fusion in an attempt to obviate the LBP associated with IVDD earlier in the degenerative cascade. Until now, an intervertebral disc may only be repaired biologically after a herniation through the transplantation of the patient&#x02019;s disc chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Results of the application of ADCT showed that cellular revitalization of the intervertebral disc is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and the results of a prospective randomized and controlled multicenter trial for ADCT were promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For the survival and the adaptation of the cultivated cells to the harsh environment in the disc space, the availability of nutrients, the number of injected cells required to avoid nutritional problems due to cell overpopulation, and the pro-inflammatory environment play a crucial role. These problems should be overcome with a suitable biomaterial, which is used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>By using an initially liquid biomaterial, which polymerizes after being injected, the cells adhere much better to the disc tissue. NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc plus (NDplus), an autologous cell compound for autologous disc chondrocyte transplantation (ADCT), was developed to provide rehydration and maintain the biological integrity of degenerative lumbar discs to prevent secondary diseases such as recurrent lumbar disc herniation, osteochondrosis, or segmental instability. The important properties of NDplus are anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic and antiosteogenic. Moreover, NDplus is hydrophilic, supports cell morphology, and stabilizes the chrondrogenic phenotype.</p><p>In this phase-I/II study, NDplus is being investigated for its clinical applicability, safety, and efficacy in the repair of herniated, nucleotomized discs and of adjacent degenerated discs, if present.</p><p>The objective of this clinical study is to provide the basis for a confirmatory study design (endpoints and methodologies) (phase II) and to develop a safety profile for the surgical procedure as well as for NDplus (phase I). This study further aims at developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of NDisc plus as requested in the context of identity, purity, and potency characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc study is a nonconfirmatory, prospective, multicenter, unmasked, randomized study with two phases aimed at gathering preliminary clinical information on NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc plus and NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc basic used in the treatment of a herniated disc. Phase I aimed to develop a safety profile of the investigational medicinal product NOVOCART&#x02122; Disc plus. The objectives of phase II are mainly to provide a basis for a confirmatory clinical trial design and proof of concept. Twelve trial sites are planned to participate in this combined phase-I/II study; three of them have already participated in phase I. In total, 120 patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized, treated according to the randomization, and followed up for 5&#x000a0;years. The primary study endpoint of the phase II is the difference in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) between treatment groups 2&#x000a0;years after the intervention. This index has emerged as the most commonly recommended condition-specific outcome measure for spinal disorders. It is a self-administered questionnaire divided into 10 sections designed to assess the limitations of various activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and EuroQuality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) are applied to assess changes in health status and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, changes in leg and back pain are assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Numerical measurements in the disc height, volumetry, and signal intensity of index and adjacent discs and categorical evaluations, such as degeneration scale and the presence or absence of stenosis, are determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neurological and functional status and the quantity of current pain medication and time to return to work after surgery are documented. The serology of HIV, hepatitis and <italic>Treponema palladium</italic> are determined preoperatively. Laboratory values (IL-6, Leukotriene, and CRP) as safety vales are being evaluated only in phase I of the study. Adverse events and serious adverse events are documented.

NDisc plus is an injectable, in situ-polymerizing, modified albumin, hyaluronic acid gel with ex vivo-expanded autologous disc derived chondrocyte cells as the active ingredient. NDisc plus is composed of two components: Component A is a suspension with 3.6 to 4.4 million autologous intervertebral disc cells contained in a solution of modified human albumin, human serum, culture media components, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. The total volume is 4&#x000a0;ml suspension placed in a 6&#x000a0;ml glass vial. Component B is a bis thio-polyethylene glycol (BTPEG) solution; the total volume is 1&#x000a0;ml in a 2&#x000a0;ml glass vial. Components A and B polymerize in situ using a dedicated application system (special dual-chamber syringe) to form the desired hydrogel. The preparation is for single use during the ADCT. The dosage is individual, and the volume of injection is, depending on the capacity of the treated disc, between 0.5 and 2&#x000a0;ml cell suspension volume. NDisc basic is used as the placebo in the NDisc study and is the cell-free hydrogel carrier material with an identical composition but without growth factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sequestrectomy</title><p>Surgery is performed by two trial-designated surgeons with the assistance of an operating microscope while the patient is under general endotracheal anesthesia and in a prone position.

A change of 10 units is considered as a clinically meaningful difference. Moreover, a standard deviation of 12 is assumed, based on results of a previous trial (H&#x000e4;gg, Fritzell, Nordwall, 2003). A sample size calculation was performed based on a two-group t-test (nQuery Advisor&#x02122; Software, version 7.0). The width of the respective confidence intervals were calculated using a large sample approximation, with 60 patients to be enrolled in the NDplus group, 36 patients in the NDbasic group, and 24 patients in the SC arm (120 patients in total).

For this purpose, it is assumed that effects of treatment with SC, NDbasic, and NDplus are additive so that treatment effects can be assessed by location shifts (like mean change or median change) between treatment groups. Differences between NDbasic and SC are the total effect of NDbasic, the transplantation/implantation procedure to inject the NDbasic, and the time interval between tissue harvest and transplantation/implantation. Observed differences between NDplus and SC are the total effect of NDplus, the chondrocytes, the transplantation procedure to inject the NDplus, and the time interval between tissue harvest and cell transplantation. Consequently, observed differences between NDplus and NDbasic are assumed the sole effect of chondrocytes. All efficacy data will be presented for patients in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Primary and secondary efficacy variables and their changes from baseline will be summarized by treatment group. An analysis of variance with factors treatment and the presence or absence of a degenerative adjacent disc (ADD/HD) will be used to evaluate continuous and quasi-continuous, approximately normal data. Confidence intervals will be based on estimated means (least square means) and the corresponding t-statistic. Additional covariates, such as baseline measurements, will be included in the model as appropriate. VAS readings will be summarized by treatment group and visit over the course of the study. MRI parameters and variables to assess functional neurological status will be summarized descriptively. Survival analysis will be used to evaluate time to return to work after surgery. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator will be used to estimate the probability to return to work over time by treatment group for all patients in the FAS. Imputation of missing data has not been planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Safety variables</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded according to the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA&#x02122;) version available at the day of database closure. The analysis of adverse events will focus on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). The frequency and percentage of TEAEs and possibly related TEAEs (that is, any possibly, probably, or definitely related TEAEs) will be summarized according to primary system organ class and preferred term and tabulated by treatment group. All laboratory values will be classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratories&#x02019; normal ranges. Morphological parameters like the Modic Score, the detection of an extra discal fluid collection and re-herniation of the treated disc will be monitored by a MRI protocol. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has reviewed the phase I data, and no concerns have been raised. An ongoing evaluation by the DSMB will be undertaken during phase II. If relevant concerns should be detectable like increased reherniation rates, a discontinuation of the trial must be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Interim and final analysis</title><p>Data collected in the study may be analyzed and reviewed continuously. Early findings may be used to stop the study in case of safety concerns or lack of efficacy or futility with regard to a positive outcome in the NDplus group.

Autologous chondrocyte cell transplantation has been shown to reduce intervertebral disc degeneration in animal models, as well as to be safely applicable in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The avascularity of the lumbar disc is a promising precondition for autologous chondrocyte cell transplantation. Limited blood flow inhibits cell migration and provides an immunologically privileged environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Controversially, transplanted cells must survive in a limited blood supply and in a mechanically stressful environment that can cause a loss of native chondrocyte cells and leads to a decreased extracellular matrix production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the choice of biomaterial is important.</p><p>By using an initially liquid biomaterial, which polymerizes after being injected into the intervertebral disc, the cells adhere much better to the disc tissue. In an animal experiment, a significant increase in the survival rate of cells that were injected into the intervertebral disc was achieved with a polymerizing biomaterial as opposed to the application in a watery solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The use of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate in a defined concentration and composition stabilizes the phenotype of the expanded cells and allows an environmental conditioning, a more balanced nutrient distribution, and ultimately a higher cell survival rate after transplantation, by anti-inflammatory and osmotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the polymerizing hydrogel has anti-osteogenic and anti-angiogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The hydrodynamic properties of hyaluronic acid have been known for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Glycosaminoglycan plays a major role in the extracellular matrix of the healthy human intervertebral disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In an intervertebral disc with degenerative changes, however, the proteoglycans, the level of hyaluronic acid, and subsequently, the fluid content are already substantially reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides a high bio- and cell compatibility, a polymerizable biomaterial must also possess other important properties in order to be suitable for the biological disc reconstruction. It must ensure that the biomaterial stays in the disc after its in vivo polymerization and during the remobilization of the patient, that is, during increased physical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The goal of ADCT is to reduce the degenerative sequelae after lumbar disc surgery or to prophylactically avoid degeneration in adjacent discs. Injection of material into the disc, however, theoretically carries several risks, such as extrusion of the injected material, increased intradiscal pressure, potentially provoking disc herniations, and local or systemic inflammatory reactions.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>Phase I of the trial started in October 2012 with one site in Austria (the Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University Innsbruck), followed by two sites in Germany (the Department of Neurosurgery, BG Clinic Halle-Bergmannstrost (February 2013) and Department of Neurosurgery, BG-Clinic Murnau (March 2013)).
