Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma were assigned to ELLIPTA vs DISKUS (Accuhaler), metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or Turbuhaler. Patients with COPD were also assigned to ELLIPTA vs Handihaler or Breezhaler. Patients demonstrated inhaler use after reading the patient information leaflet (PIL). A trained investigator assessed critical errors (i.e., those likely to result in the inhalation of significantly reduced, minimal or no medication). If the patient made errors, the investigator demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler, and the patient demonstrated inhaler use again. Fewer COPD patients made critical errors with ELLIPTA after reading the PIL vs: DISKUS, 9/171 (5%) vs 75/171 (44%); MDI, 10/80 (13%) vs 48/80 (60%); Turbuhaler, 8/100 (8%) vs 44/100 (44%); Handihaler, 17/118 (14%) vs 57/118 (48%); Breezhaler, 13/98 (13%) vs 45/98 (46%; all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Most patients (57&#x02013;70%) made no errors using ELLIPTA and did not require investigator instruction. Instruction was required for DISKUS (65%), MDI (85%), Turbuhaler (71%), Handihaler (62%) and Breezhaler (56%). Fewer asthma patients made critical errors with ELLIPTA after reading the PIL vs: DISKUS (3/70 (4%) vs 9/70 (13%), <italic>P</italic>=0.221); MDI (2/32 (6%) vs 8/32 (25%), <italic>P</italic>=0.074) and significantly fewer vs Turbuhaler (3/60 (5%) vs 20/60 (33%), <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). More asthma and COPD patients preferred ELLIPTA over the other devices (all <italic>P</italic>&#x02a7d;0.002). Significantly, fewer COPD patients using ELLIPTA made critical errors after reading the PIL vs other inhalers.

Between 36 and 49% of patients with COPD perform critical inhaler errors with currently used inhalers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and in a review of studies by Cochrane <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> efficient inhalation technique was demonstrated by only 46&#x02013;59% of asthma patients. The development of an easy-to-use inhaler device that delivers the drug to the lungs effectively is important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> In addition, patient preference and satisfaction has been of increased interest over the past decade; preference for a particular medication or inhaler device may be associated with improved adherence with therapeutic regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> The choice of inhalation device is an important consideration because it can influence patients&#x02019; adherence to treatment, and thus potentially affects the long-term outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Although device preference is interesting, errors in use are likely to have a greater effect on outcomes.</p><p>A dry powder inhaler, the ELLIPTA multi-dose inhaler, has been developed for the delivery of inhaled medication in patients with both COPD and asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> This study aimed to assess the proportion of COPD and asthma patients making critical and overall errors when using the ELLIPTA inhaler and other commonly used commercially available inhaler devices such as the DISKUS/Accuhaler inhaler, metered-dose inhaler (MDI), Turbuhaler, Handihaler and Breezhaler. Critical errors were assessed by trained respiratory nurses after patients had read the patient information leaflet (PIL). The errors were assessed using an error checklist that was developed based on the respective PILs, existing literature and with the input from external experts. This study also assessed the time needed for instruction, ease-of-use and patient preference between the ELLIPTA inhaler and other commercially available inhaler devices.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><sec><title>COPD patients</title><p>A total of 567 patients with COPD were randomised, and all completed this single-visit study.

After reading the PIL alone, there were differences between devices in the proportion of patients achieving good technique. The majority of both COPD and asthma patients made no errors using the ELLIPTA inhaler and, therefore, did not require further instruction. However, a minority of patients did make errors, confirming that face-to-face instruction with a trained professional is required when commencing any new inhaler device. In contrast, using the comparator inhalers, the majority of COPD patients did make errors and thus required nurse instruction. COPD patients took less time to demonstrate correct inhaler use with the ELLIPTA inhaler after reading the PIL and receiving nurse instructions compared with the five comparator inhalers. For asthma patients, there was no significant difference in time to correct inhaler use between inhalers.

These findings are consistent with the previous data showing that error rates are higher for the MDI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Turbuhaler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28 bib29 bib30">28&#x02013;30</xref></sup> and Handihaler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> The low error rates for the ELLIPTA inhaler compared with the other inhalers may reflect fewer steps, a shorter PIL and a more intuitive design.</p><p>Across all substudies, we observed good consistency in the error rates in both COPD and asthma patients using the ELLIPTA inhaler. The observed error rates for the comparator inhalers varied to some extent from those reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35">32&#x02013;35</xref></sup> possibly reflecting differences in the types of study conducted, the populations assessed and the assessment procedures used. Our study is likely to be more reproducible than those previously reported as patients in this study were recruited from routine care settings, were naive to the comparator inhalers, used standardised and explicit training and assessment protocols, and trained nursing assessors across the study sites. The observed critical error rates for devices other than the ELLIPTA inhaler were close to or lower than those assumed in the sample size calculation. The observed critical error rates for the ELLIPTA inhaler (5&#x02013;14%) were lower than those assumed in the sample size calculation (20&#x02013;30%). The standardised nurse training and the use of very specific checklists developed from the PILs may have also contributed to the low critical error rates. These errors rates are likely to be reproduced in future studies recruiting device-naive patients from &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; clinical settings and to reflect the realities of errors associated with starting new inhaler devices in routine care.</p><p>A common error for the MDI is not to shake the inhaler before use. Although solution-formulated MDIs do not require shaking before firing, we know that many patients are switched between inhalers regularly. For these patients, it could be confusing if they were instructed differently for each MDI. Therefore, we assumed the &#x02018;worst&#x02019; case scenario where shaking is necessary.</p><p>For one of the overall errors, the inhalation manoeuvre, it was expected that the number of errors would be similar for the dry powder inhaler devices, as in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> However, fewer patients made an inhalation manoeuvre error with the ELLIPTA inhaler and the HandiHaler than other inhalers. This could be due to human factors such as preference and comfort of the mouthpiece as patients did favour the comfort of the mouthpiece of these two devices, or to the challenges of getting trained assessors to evaluate consistently. Recently, nurse assessments of the inhalation manoeuvre showed greater variability than those made by retrospective assessment of the videoed inhaler demonstrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p><p>For COPD patients, the difference in the number of nurse instructions required was statistically significant between the ELLIPTA inhaler and each of the five comparator inhalers (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001); the majority of patients required nurse instruction for the comparator inhalers.</p><p>Factors reported in the literature that have an impact on error frequency include older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and female gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> In addition, a higher frequency of errors has been found in patients with COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and a higher level of education has also been reported to be associated with a lower frequency of errors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> In this study, the mean age of COPD patients enrolled was similar to that of the general COPD population. Literacy was assessed only in the UK populations, where between 94 and 96% of patients scored at the high school reading level. Therefore, literacy in this study may not be representative of a general real-world population, where health literacy/reading scores may be more variable.</p><p>Preference for an inhaler device may be associated with increased patient satisfaction and improved adherence to the treatment regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> A larger proportion of COPD and asthma patients reported preference for the ELLIPTA inhaler compared with the comparator inhalers across most of the criteria in the preference questionnaire, except for the size of the inhaler and comfort of the mouthpiece, which was similar to some of the inhalers tested. Similar findings have been seen in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>Although all patients in this study were naive to the ELLIPTA inhaler and the comparator inhaler to remove prior experience influencing error rates, there are several limitations to the current research. Although every effort was made to standardise the training and training providers were attached to independent academic and clinical units with no contact with the study sponsor, the study was nevertheless open-label and involved subjective assessments and was hence open to potential nurse bias. There is also a tendency to over-assess in these studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> In addition, our study looked at initial training in a new device, and so does not provide information on the persistence of good technique and its relationship with long-term clinical outcomes. A study by Press <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> showed that patients&#x02019; technique wanes over time following nurse instruction and reading the PIL.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>In summary, this study assessed the ease of mastery of technique for new inhaler devices in COPD and asthma patients recruited from the community and routine care settings, who were familiar with inhaler use but were naive to the devices assessed. The ELLIPTA inhaler was compared with other commonly used devices. Although some patients achieved good inhaler technique based on reading the manufacturers insert instructions only, instruction from a trained professional was needed for most patients. Poor inhaler technique is a common cause of treatment failure in patients with COPD and asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>This study highlights the need for patients using a new device to be adequately trained and assessed at the time of initiation, for periodic reinforcement of training, and also the need to ensure that the device selected is suitable for the patient.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>These were randomised, open-label, placebo, cross-over, multicentre studies (GSK study numbers 200301 and 200330; ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02184624 and NCT02195284). Patients were randomised at two centres in the United Kingdom and six in the Netherlands.

Patients were required to be naive to ELLIPTA inhaler use and at least one other inhaler device (patients who were naive to the Breezhaler and Handihaler must have also been naive to all other inhaler devices that required a capsule). Those with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity to lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or to any other excipient found in commercially available inhaler devices were not enrolled in this study. COPD patients with a current diagnosis of asthma were excluded from the COPD study arms; asthma patients with a current diagnosis of COPD were excluded from the asthma study arms.</p><p>Patients received inactive treatment (placebo) via the ELLIPTA inhaler and were assigned to one of the other comparator inhaler devices to which they were naive. In substudy 1, COPD and asthma patients used the ELLIPTA inhaler and DISKUS/Accuhaler inhaler; in substudy 2, they used ELLIPTA inhaler and MDI; and in substudy 3, they used ELLIPTA inhaler and Turbuhaler. In substudy 4, COPD patients only used the ELLIPTA inhaler and Handihaler, and in substudy 5, COPD patients only used the ELLIPTA inhaler and Breezhaler (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

After randomisation, patients were asked to read the PIL of the first device and then were asked to perform inhaler use. Overall errors made by the patient while using the first inhaler were recorded by a trained respiratory nurse. If the patient made any errors in inhaler use after reading the PIL, the nurse demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler to the patient, and the patient was asked to perform the inhaler use again. If the patient continued to make errors in inhaler use, the nurse demonstrated the process again up to a maximum of three times.
