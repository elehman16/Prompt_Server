Interventions to reduce time spent in sedentary behavior could improve outcomes. The primary purpose was to investigate the impact of telemonitoring with supportive phone calls on daily exercise times with newly established home exercise bicycle training. The secondary aim was to examine the potential improvement in health-related quality of life and physical activity compared to baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective crossover-randomized study was performed over 6 months in stable COPD patients. The intervention phase (domiciliary training with supporting telephone calls) and the control phase (training without phone calls) were randomly assigned to the first or the last 3 months. In the intervention phase, patients were called once a week if they did not achieve a real-time monitored daily cycle time of 20 minutes. Secondary aims were evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Health-related quality of life was measured by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), physical activity by the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 53 included patients, 44 patients completed the study (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 47.5%&#x000b1;15.8% predicted). In the intervention phase, daily exercise time was significantly higher compared to the control phase (24.2&#x000b1;9.4 versus 19.6&#x000b1;10.3 minutes). Compared to baseline (17.6&#x000b1;6.1), the CAT-score improved in the intervention phase to 15.3&#x000b1;7.6 and in the control phase to 15.7&#x000b1;7.3 units. The GLTEQ-score increased from 12.2&#x000b1;12.1 points to 36.3&#x000b1;16.3 and 33.7&#x000b1;17.3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Telemonitoring is a simple method to enhance home exercise training and physical activity, improving health-related quality of life.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>telehealthcare</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>COPD assessment test</kwd><kwd>telephone support</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important disease worldwide, with increasing rates of morbidity and mortality; it is estimated that COPD will become the fourth-most common cause of death by 2020.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Compared to healthy peers, patients with COPD show significantly lower levels of physical activity.

The training data were monitored regarding a potential telephone intervention. That facilitated the intervention program, because motivational phone calls took place only when required. Less than three telephone calls per patient were accomplished on average during the 3 month intervention phase &#x02013; thus only one call per patient per month. Therefore, the presented method seems to be easy to implement in everyday life. Educated staff of general practitioners or pulmonologists could be entrusted with the task to survey the training.</p></sec><sec><title>Improvement of physical activity levels and quality of life by means of monitored training</title><p>The low baseline TLA score of the GLTEQ (12.2&#x000b1;12.1 points, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-2821">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-11-2821">Figure 4</xref>) &#x02013; representing the last week before patients started their home exercise cycle training &#x02013; aligns with the level of regular physical activity that is known to be already considerably reduced in COPD patients with just moderate airflow limitation. Less than half of patients are moderately physically active for at least 30 minutes per day, also if the duration of activity is divided into several shorter bouts per day.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b44-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b45-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>The TLA score increased in both of our study arms, up to 36.3&#x000b1;16.3 (intervention) and 33.7&#x000b1;17.3 (control) points, respectively. That increase reflects the newly &#x02013; in the context of the study &#x02013; started home exercise cycle training. The physical activity level of our patients was thus improved by a simple method. On the one hand, an exercise device was made available. On the other hand, the real-time telemonitoring surveillance was already perceived as supportive, resulting in a significantly higher TLA score in relation to baseline, also in the control arm without any counseling by telephone.</p><p>The CAT score reduction of more than 2 units versus baseline in the intervention and control arm indicates an improvement in HRQL, which is induced by the enhancement of regular physical activity. Two other studies that investigated an exercise intervention also found a moderate improvement in HRQL.<xref rid="b27-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Moy et al used an Internet-mediated, pedometer-based exercise intervention. In fact, the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire total score did not improve significantly after 4 months compared to control, yet a significantly larger proportion of patients in the intervention group showed at least a 4-unit improvement, which is considered the MCID. At the same time, patients in the intervention group also significantly increased their mean daily step counts.<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Yet, the association of physical activity and HRQL is still up for discussion. It also remains equally uncertain, whether a CAT score reduction of 2 units already reliably meets the MCID.<xref rid="b36-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-copd-11-2821" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Most affected patients in GOLD Group D of the combined COPD assessment achieved an improvement in quality of life of almost 3 units, and the increase in the TLA score also surpassed that of the total group, while exercise duration per day in Group D was only about 1 minute shorter. That implies that domiciliary training with telemonitoring might be useful therapy, particularly for severely afflicted patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study was accomplished in a very close approach to clinical practice. The major strength of this study is the implementation of an easy-to-handle procedure. Nearly all patients should be able to accomplish training at home with a simple exercise ergometer, which can be used regardless of weather conditions or details of their home environments. Referring to the GSM surveillance, there is no need for special education. Motivational phone calls are only occasionally performed and only a small amount of time is required.</p><p>Yet, the limitations of this study need attention as well. First, we chose a case-crossover design with the absence of a control group. The reason for that was to reduce the number of patients to be recruited. But, this resulted in potential bias: patients who started with the intervention achieved a higher daily training time in the intervention as well as in the control phase compared to the phases of patients who were first randomized to the control phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-copd-11-2821">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we did not record the number of eligible patients approached by the resident doctors to participate in the study. Therefore, this study is not applicable to determine the percentage of COPD patients to be motivated to enhance their daily physical activity by means of such an intervention program. But, the aim of the study was rather that of a pilot study to prove feasibility. Before a widespread implementation, more studies with a considerably larger number of patients and over longer periods of time are required.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Home exercise cycle training is able to improve regular physical activity and HRQOL in patients with COPD in a stable phase of their disease. Therefore, simple telemonitoring with supporting phone calls if required, seems efficient to trigger a necessary change in behavior, at least over a period of 6 months.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was financially supported by Vitaphone, Germany, concerning the purchase of the bicycle ergometers and the GSM modules.
