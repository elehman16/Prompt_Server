exercise program could improve the level of physical fitness of community-dwelling elderly
women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-two healthy community-dwelling elderly women were
randomly allocated to either an experimental or a control group. Experimental subjects
performed a multicomponent exercise program that consisted of balance, strengthening, and
stretching exercises for 4 weeks, whereas the control subjects did not perform any
specific exercise. The subjects&#x02019; level of physical fitness was assessed prior to and after
training using the Senior Fitness Test which assesses muscle strength, flexibility,
dynamic balance/agility, aerobic endurance, and body composition. [Results] Subjects in
the experimental group showed significant improvements in lower and upper body strength,
lower and upper body flexibility, dynamic balance/agility following training, but not in
aerobic endurance or body composition. Significant group differences were shown in lower
and upper body strength, lower body flexibility, and dynamic balance/agility. [Conclusion]
The results suggest that a multicomponent training program that consists of balance,
strengthening, and stretching exercises is a relevant intervention for the improvement of
the level of physical fitness of community-dwelling elderly women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly women</kwd><kwd>Physical fitness</kwd><kwd>Multicomponent exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>People 65 years and older comprise about 12% of the Korean population, with a significant
increase projected within the next 20 years<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average life span of Koreans has increased rapidly over the
past several decades<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This extended life
span has resulted in increased medical costs and age-related chronic disorders that are
often accompanied by functional impairments.</p><p>Regular physical activity reduces the risk of various chronic diseases, e.g.,
cardiovascular disease and psychological problems in older adults<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study has also shown that physically active elderly
adults demonstrate higher functional ability in activities of daily living than those with a
relatively low level of physical activity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conversely, among the elderly, limited physical activity is a major
cause of diminished functional ability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is significantly associated with a
high risk of mortality<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical fitness is defined as &#x0201c;<italic>the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and
alertness, without undue fatigue and with ample energy to enjoy leisure-time pursuits and
to meet unforeseen emergencies,</italic>&#x0201d;<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and it has been used to estimate the level of functional ability of
the elderly. The components of physical fitness, especially related to health, include
muscle strength and endurance, cardiovascular and pulmonary endurance, flexibility, and body
composition<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical fitness is
significantly related to the functional limitations of older adults regardless of chronic
disease progress<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that to
maintain an adequate level of physical function, the elderly need to participate in
appropriate physical fitness activities.</p><p>Decreases in physical fitness in older adults are associated with higher risks of fall<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and injury<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A systematic review indicated that multicomponent exercises reduce
the incidence of falls and risk of fall of elderly people<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A multicomponent exercise program that includes resistance
exercise, balance exercise, and functional training, has been recommended for improving in
physical fitness<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies have
demonstrated that elderly women could improve physical fitness following multicomponent
exercise, although the benefits were limited to only certain components of physical
fitness<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have also reported the positive effects of visual feedback
on the static<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and dynamic balance of
older adults<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the functional balance of elderly women
significantly improved following 4 weeks of visual feedback-based training<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, the appropriate types and
intensity of exercises that would benefit the physical fitness of community-dwelling elderly
women have not been clearly identified.</p><p>We developed a 4-week exercise program that combines balance, strengthening, and stretching
exercises with a visual feedback-based balance exercise for older adults. The purpose of
this study was to investigate whether the multicomponent exercise program could improve the
physical fitness (muscle strength, flexibility, aerobic endurance, dynamic balance/agility,
and body composition) of community-dwelling elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-two community-dwelling healthy elderly women from the Jeungpyung area in Korea
were recruited through an advertisement. The study included female subjects who were aged
65&#x02005;years or older, able to follow the instructions for testing and training, and able to
walk 10&#x02005;m without walking aids. Subjects who had any prior musculoskeletal problems,
neurological diseases, or vestibular disorders that limited their exercise ability were
excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental
State Examination test<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prior to
participating in this study, subjects signed a written informed consent form in accordance
with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; physical fitness was assessed using the Senior Fitness Test which measures
lower and upper body strength and flexibility, dynamic balance/agility, aerobic endurance,
and body composition prior to and after the training<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Senior Fitness Test is a valid measurement<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> and has shown an excellent test-retest
reliability<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lower body strength was evaluated using the 30-second chair stand test which measures the
number of sit-to-stand movements with arms crossed on the chest for 30 seconds. Upper body
strength was assessed using the 30-second arm curl test. This test measures the number of
right elbow flexion and extension movements completed in a sitting position while holding
a 5-pound weight in a 30-second period. Lower body flexibility was evaluated using the
chair sit-and-reach test. This test measures the distance between the tip of the subject&#x02019;s
middle finger and the tip of the shoe, when a subject reaches to the foot maximally while
sitting with one leg flexed (up t&#x003bf; 90&#x000b0; of hip and knee flexion) and the other leg fully
extended with the heel on the floor and the ankle flexed at approximately 90&#x000b0;. Upper body
flexibility was assessed by calculating the distance between the tips of the subject&#x02019;s
middle fingers using the back scratch test with two hands (one above the shoulder, the
other under the shoulder). Dynamic balance/agility was evaluated using the 8-foot
up-and-go test. This test measures the time it takes for a subject to rise from a sitting
position, stand up, walk a distance of 8 feet from the chair, and return to sit in the
chair. Aerobic endurance was assessed using the 2-minute step test which measures the
number of times a subject is able to step in place with each knee lifted to a height at
least even with the iliac crest. Body composition was evaluated by calculating body mass
index (BMI) using the subject&#x02019;s weight in kilograms divided by her height in meters
squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>For training, subjects were randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups.
Subjects in the experimental group participated in a 4-week multicomponent exercise
program consisting of 60-minute sessions, three times per week. Each multicomponent
exercise session comprised three stages of group exercise (i.e., warming up, main
exercises, and cooling down) and an individualized visual feedback-based balance exercise.
Five minutes of warming up and 5 minutes of cooling down included head turns, head half
circles, single arm crossovers, calf stretches, hamstring stretches, hand flexor
stretches, and trunk side bending<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The main training exercises consisted of balance (20 minutes), strengthening (20 minutes),
and stretching exercises (5 minutes). Subjects performed balance exercises while sitting,
standing, standing from sitting, hopping, walking, and tandem walking. Strengthening
exercise was focused on trunk muscles and the major muscle groups of the lower and upper
extremities and used Therabands or body weight for resistance. Stretching exercise mainly
involved the lower extremity muscles (e.g., hip flexors and ankle plantar flexors). Each
exercise had 2&#x02013;4 levels of difficulty that progressed based on the subjects&#x02019; abilities.
The subjects were allowed 1&#x02013;2 minutes rest between exercises. For the visual
feedback-based balance exercise, the subjects attended an individualized dynamic balance
training program (5 minutes) using the Good Balance System (Metitur Ltd., Finland)
following the group exercise sessions. Using visual feedback, each subject completed two
tasks that focused on controlling the center of gravity and increasing the limit of
stability, while standing on a computerized force platform<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group was instructed to maintain their level of
activity without participating in any specific physical fitness exercises during the 4
weeks.</p><p>For statistical analysis, non-parametric statistical analyses were selected based on the
results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and Levene&#x02019;s test of homogeneity of
variances. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to examine group differences in subjects&#x02019;
characteristics and dependent variables of physical fitness at the pre-training test.
Changes in physical fitness variables following training were assessed in both groups
using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to
identify the changes in dependent variables over 4 weeks between the two groups. All data
were analyzed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics Software 22.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA).
The level of statistical significance was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in subjects&#x02019; characteristics were found between the experimental

of balance, strengthening, and stretching exercises, and visual feedback-based balance
exercise, on the physical fitness of community-dwelling elderly women. The incorporation of
a multicomponent exercise program has been strongly recommended for elderly populations by
the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The outcomes of the present study show that
the elderly women in the experimental group, who participated in the multicomponent exercise
program, significantly improved their physical fitness levels of lower and upper body muscle
strength, lower and upper body flexibility, and dynamic balance/agility following training.
Their improvements in lower and upper body strength, lower body flexibility, and dynamic
balance/agility were significantly different from those shown by the control group.</p><p>Lower and upper body strength of the subjects in the experimental group significantly
increased following 4 weeks of training, but no changes were observed in the control group.
The results of the experimental group are in agreement with those of previous studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, the amount of improvement
appears somewhat greater than those of the previous studies. The increase in muscle strength
was noticeably higher in the lower-body (52.8%) than the upper-body (22.5%). The fact that
the strengthening exercises used in this study contained more training for the lower
extremities than the upper extremities may be accountable for the difference.</p><p>The experimental subjects&#x02019; upper and lower body flexibility also significantly improved
after training, which is consistent with findings of the earlier studies<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conversely, other studies have reported
no significant change in flexibility or only a change in lower body flexibility following
multicomponent exercise training, although the training period of 12 weeks was longer than
that of our study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The improvement in
flexibility was considerably greater in the lower body (232.4%) than in the upper body
(25.9%). This trend is similar to the change in muscle strength described above. No
significant difference between the two groups was revealed in upper body flexibility. This
may be because the control group also demonstrated improvement in upper body flexibility
over 4 weeks. The results are still inconclusive due to the significant difference between
the two groups at the time of initial testing. In addition, the control subjects&#x02019; lower body
flexibility decreased 37.7% after 4 weeks. Although the change was not significant, the
result suggests that older women who do not perform specific exercises may lose their lower
body flexibility in a relatively short period of time.</p><p>A significant increase in dynamic balance/agility was observed following exercise training
in the experimental group, but not in the control group. This result is consistent with the
findings of other studies<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those studies
demonstrated that dynamic balance can be enhanced by exercise programs, which specifically
include a balance component<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, as well as
other types of exercise, e.g., strengthening<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> and step aerobic training<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, one study reported that a 12-week multicomponent exercise
program including aerobic, endurance, balance, and flexibility exercises did not improve the
dynamic balance/agility of elderly women<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, a recent systematic review revealed that the evidence
for an effect of strengthening training on the balance of the elderly population is not
conclusive<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>No significant change in aerobic endurance was found in our study. In contrast, other
studies that included aerobic exercise, either as a primary exercise<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, or as part of the exercise training<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, have reported
significant improvements in aerobic endurance. In addition, a study involving a 12-week
multicomponent exercise training program (the Strong Women Program) that did not include
aerobic exercise demonstrated a significant increase in the aerobic endurance of elderly
women<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that to
facilitate a change in the aerobic endurance of older women, an exercise training program
that includes aerobic exercise or an extended period of exercise may be required.</p><p>There was no significant change in the subjects&#x02019; body composition following training, which
is consistent with the findings of previous studies<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Altering the BMI of the
elderly is difficult, regardless of the types of exercise or training periods involved. Our
subjects presented with BMIs lower than the 50th percentile of normative data for
community-dwelling adults age 60 and older<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> prior to training. This made modification of their BMIs even more
difficult.</p><p>The exercise program in this study was group-based exercise that included balance,
strengthening and stretching exercises. Group-based exercise improves balance control<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>
and decreases the risk of fall<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> for elderly populations. In addition,
group-based resistance exercise has been found to be more effective than home-based exercise
at improving the physical fitness of the elderly<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aging commonly causes not only muscle weakness<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>
but also balance and flexibility impairments<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. A systematic review indicated that progressive resistance
strengthening exercise improved lower limb strength, but not balance control<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, we believe it is necessary to
develop a training program that combines strengthening with balance and flexibility for
improving the physical fitness of older adults. This study also included visual
feedback-based balance training which is known to be an effective training method for the
elderly<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A training approach that combines group-based exercise with
individual visual feedback-based exercise may facilitate the participants&#x02019; motivation and
activity enjoyment during exercise. In fact, the excellent attendance rate of 99.2% achieved
in this study suggests that the subjects were highly motivated and engaged in the exercise
program.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that a 4-week multicomponent exercise
program including balance, strengthening, and stretching exercises is an effective
intervention for improving the physical fitness of community-dwelling older women.
Nonetheless, the outcomes may not be generalized to other elderly women because of the
relatively small sample size. Further study of the multicomponent training program which
includes aerobic exercise or an extended training period may provide a better understanding
of the relationship between multicomponent exercise training and physical fitness in elderly
populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from the 2011 program for visiting professors
