The open surgical procedure with a large incision (OC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] has been succeeded by small incision open cholecystectomy (SIOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], robotic cholecystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and single port robotic cholecystectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is essential to scrutinise such changes in surgical technology in terms of cost and quality of life, to ensure fair distribution of resources. A meta-analysis of earlier randomised controlled trials showed no statistically significant differences, in terms of postoperative clinical outcomes, between SIOC and LC, but a significantly shorter operating time for SIOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similar findings were reported in an expertise-based randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The aim of the present study is to compare LC and SIOC concerning costs and quality of life assessed by the EuroQol-5D-3L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] using data from this expertise-based randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Details concerning surgical teams and surgical techniques including intra-operative cholangiogram have been described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Primary outcomes were costs and health related quality of life, reported in the current paper, and pain. Secondary outcomes were complications within 30&#x000a0;days, operative time, length of hospital stay, conversion rate, frequency of ambulatory surgery and readmissions within 30&#x000a0;days, which together with pain have been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In short, SIOC was performed via a transverse incision over the right rectus muscle and laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a four-trocar technique. If the SIOC incision exceeded 8&#x000a0;cm, the operation was classified as an open cholecystectomy as this was the cut-off in the Swedish registry for gallstone surgery (GallRiks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two hospitals participated in the trial, Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital and Lycksele County Hospital. The study was designed as a randomised pragmatic expertise-based trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], where participating surgeons were asked to join one of two teams, performing either SIOC or LC, according to their personal preferences. Team members performed their specific method (SIOC or LC) as a first-choice operation, but converted to OC when necessary, and even began the operation using OC when neither LC nor SIOC were considered possible.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were asked to enrol in the trial at the time when cholecystectomy was decided. Written informed consent was obtained before randomisation. The trial was not blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x000a0;years or older with biliary disease where cholecystectomy was considered the best treatment according to published recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were asked to participate in the trial. Both elective and emergency patients were enrolled. Patients with acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, jaundice, pancreatitis, obesity and co-morbidity were included if cholecystectomy was considered the best treatment. The exclusion criteria were: inability to understand given information, surgeons from either the LC team or the SIOC team unavailable for emergency cholecystectomy, cholecystectomy performed for malignant disease or suspicion of malignancy, and cholecystectomy performed as part of another operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation was made using an internet-based system with computer-generated random numbers. Patients were automatically stratified at three levels: hospital, age (&#x0003c; or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 70&#x000a0;years), and degree of priority (elective, emergent, or surgery for life-threatening disease). The patients were randomised when the decision for surgery was made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>The economic analysis was conducted from a societal perspective, calculating both direct public healthcare costs and indirect costs generated by the loss of productivity (sick leave). Cost generating posts in health care were calculated from the time the patient was admitted for surgery. Preoperative investigations (preoperative radiology, preoperative visits to outpatient clinic, etc.) were not included. Costs for pre-, intra-, and postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram (ERC), sphincterotomy and endoscopic stone extraction were regarded as a part of the operative procedure and were thus included. Detailed calculations of cost items were performed in one hospital (Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital). All costs are given as USD. Where reliable item costs could be found, they were retrieved from the Hospital Department of Economics (costs for perioperative and secondary cholangiogram, in hospital stay, postoperative recovery unit). Other costs were calculated manually, (disposables, reusable instruments, including laparoscopic equipment). Costs for LC were calculated with the presumption of reusable trocars. Personnel costs per minute were calculated using mean wages for each category of personnel obtained from the Department of Economics, Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital. Costs for social benefits and employer fees, at a rate of 43.71% (mean for hospital staff), were added to the mean wages. Operational costs were calculated with one resident and one senior surgeon participating from incision to last stich for each operation. A standard cost for counselling and administration (hospital record, sick leave certificate and prescription of drugs) were added. The cost for surgical theatre staff was calculated from the moment patients arrived at the theatre until they left for the recovery unit, individually for each patient. All patients were estimated to spend 4&#x000a0;h in the postoperative recovery unit. Patients undergoing ambulatory surgery were estimated to spend 8&#x000a0;h in the surgical ward. An average cost for ERC, sphincterotomy and endoscopic stone extraction of 1216 USD, was estimated by the Hospital Department of Economics. Indirect costs due to loss of production were calculated based on mean wages obtained from Statistics Sweden (SCB) for men and women, respectively, including social benefits and employer fees at a rate of 41.15% (mean for all employed). Indirect costs were calculated only for patients that reported taking a sick leave from work due to the operation.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Health-related quality of life</title><p>Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EQ 5-D-3L (EuroQol Group, Rotterdam, The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) which consists of five questions concerning patient mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In this study, a value set derived from the Swedish population was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The EQ-5D-3L index values were further calculated to AUC and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), please see <italic>Sample size, analysis and statistics.</italic>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection</title><p>The operating surgeon registered the operative data (except for operative time) in the Swedish registry for gallstone surgery, GallRiks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An independent assessor, as defined by GallRiks, registered operative time, length of hospital stay and complications within 30&#x000a0;days. Complications were graded according to Dindo-Clavien [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Health-related QoL was recorded by the patient before surgery and on postoperative days 3, 7, 11, and 30, as well as 1 year after surgery. The patient reported length of sick leave at 30&#x000a0;days. Data from GallRiks were controlled against patient hospital records for all patients. Where registration errors were detected, they were corrected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size, analysis and statistics</title><p>The power calculation to determine the sample size for the trial was based on earlier publications on cholecystectomies where the main differentiating factor between the two interventions was duration of the operation. It was assumed that SIOC would take 16&#x000a0;min less compared to LC, based on three previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The calculation was made for 90% power, 5% significance level and an anticipated data loss of 25%. With these assumptions, it was calculated that the study should consist of at least 350 patients. The sample size was estimated to be sufficient for detecting significant differences of routine costs, but not for comparing relatively rare complications between groups. All analyses were made with the intention-to-treat principle. Quantitative results were presented as median values, 25 and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles whenever the distribution of the data was skewed. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical tests of significance. AUC (Area Under Curve) values up to 1 year were calculated using the EQ-5D-3L scores at five different postoperative time points and the assumption that the change between time points was linear. Missing EQ-5D-3L values were imputated if the case had at least two registered genuine EQ-5D-3L values at different time points, otherwise the case was excluded from AUC calculation. We used the principle to add (or subtract) the mean change between specific time points for the group (LC or SIOC) to the last genuine value to generate the value for the next time point if it was missing. In all, 128 imputations for missing values were added to the 1372 genuine values. Thirty-three cases were excluded because of more than three missing EQ-5D-3L scores. The EQ-5D-3L scores and AUC values were calculated from raw data using Microsoft&#x000ae; Excel for Mac version 14.2.3 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA), and Stata&#x000ae; software release 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for statistical calculations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p>A flow diagram describing the progress from enrolment to analysis according to the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this expertise - based RCT, LC carried significantly higher costs than SIOC, direct as well as indirect costs but there were no significant differences in health-related QoL between the LC and SIOC group when measured with EQ-5D-3L.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the present trial has not demonstrated significant differences in complication rate between LC and SIOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was designed as a pragmatic randomised expertise-based trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with the intention to minimise exclusions and differential bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The expertise-based setting made it possible to include patients otherwise unfit to be included in a regular trial such as patients with prior upper gastro-intestinal surgery, patients with mild biliary pancreatitis, and patients with acute cholecystitis. Therefore, we had a high percentage of patients assessed for cholecystectomy included in the trial (75%). Operating times in the present study were longer for LC than for SIOC in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our operating times were long reflecting the high inclusion ratio with the ambition to include also acute operations. A setting with disposable trocars and clip applier would have added an estimated 304 USD to the perioperative costs for the LC group.</p><p>There are some potential limitations to this study. First, after completion of the study we found that time from randomisation to cholecystectomy was longer for SIOC than for LC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We had fewer SIOC surgeons than LC surgeons, 6 vs 11. This increased the time on waiting list for SIOC patients, some of which had to be operated emergently. Consequently, more patients with acute cholecystitis appeared in the SIOC group, which explains the slightly higher pain score and VAS-QoL score preoperatively for SIOC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in the present report only the validated EQ-5D-3L instrument was utilised for quality of life estimation. Second, measuring indirect costs (e.g. sick leave) can be considered controversial, as it may reflect local traditions as well as political and cultural differences. In Sweden, a doctor&#x02019;s certificate is required after the seventh&#x02019; day of sick leave. The study protocol stated that sick leave certificates should not routinely be written after uncomplicated surgery. In this study, LC patients had a higher cost for loss of production (indirect costs) without QoL difference. This might reflect that surgeons in the SIOC group, after the SIOC training phase were more compliant to the study protocol than the LC group surgeons. This imbalance in sick leave was also found in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Several reasons necessitate a discussion of cost-effectiveness in treatment of gallstone disease. The increasing population age in industrialized countries escalates health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Sphincterotomy has separated treatment of bile duct stones and gallbladder stones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although SIOC, with choledochotomy, and primary closure of the common bile duct during cholecystectomy is safe, effective and inexpensive when performed by trained surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The decline in training in open surgery for residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] is of concern for the treatment of gallstone disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. After appropriate training, SIOC is an alternative to LC wherever the health-care budget is limited, not only in the third world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From this trial we conclude that LC is more costly, but SIOC and LC are comparable in terms of QoL.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p>
