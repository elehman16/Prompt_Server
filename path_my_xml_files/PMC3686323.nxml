hypothesis that other pathways could mediate this form of hair loss, including infection and/or
microinflammation of the hair follicles. In this study, we prepared a multimodal microemulsion
comprising minoxidil (a dihydrotestosterone antagonist), diclofenac (a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agent), and tea tree oil (an anti-infective agent). We investigated the stability
and physicochemical properties of this formulation, and its therapeutic efficacy compared with a
formulation containing minoxidil alone in the treatment of androgenic alopecia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We developed a multimodal oil/water (o/w) microemulsion, a formulation containing minoxidil
alone, and another containing vehicle. A three-phase diagram was constructed to obtain the optimal
concentrations of the selected oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant. Thirty-two men aged 18&#x02013;30
years were randomized to apply 1 mL of microemulsion containing the multimodal formulation
(formulation A, n = 11), minoxidil alone (formulation B, n = 11) or placebo
(formulation C, n = 10) twice daily to the affected area for 32 weeks. Efficacy was
evaluated by mean hair count, thickness, and weight on the targeted area of the scalp. Global
photographs were taken, changes in the area of scalp coverage were assessed by patients and external
investigators, and the benefits and safety of the study medications were evaluated. The physical
stability of formula A was examined after a shelf storage period of 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Formulation A achieved a significantly superior response than formulations B and C in terms of
mean hair count (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), mean hair weight (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;
0.001), and mean hair thickness (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). A patient self-assessment
questionnaire demonstrated that the multimodal minoxidil formulation significantly
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) slowed hair loss, increased hair growth, and improved
appearance, and showed no appreciable side effects, such as itching and/or inflammation of the scalp
compared with the minoxidil alone and placebo formulations. These improvements were in agreement
with the photographic assessments made by the investigators. Formula A was shown to be an o/w
formulation with consistent pH, viscosity, specific gravity, and homogeneity, and was physically
stable after 24 months of normal storage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>A multimodal microemulsion comprising minoxidil, diclofenac, and tea tree oil was significantly
superior to minoxidil alone and placebo in terms of stability, safety, and efficacy, and achieved an
earlier response in the treatment of androgenic alopecia compared with minoxidil alone in this
32-week pilot study.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

antihypertensive agents or modulators of androgen metabolism, implying that other pathophysiologic
pathways may be involved in this condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-413">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dddt-7-413">4</xref> Androgenic alopecia is
considered to be an alteration of hair growth and/or premature aging of the pilosebaceous unit, with
a multifactorial and even polygenic etiology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-7-413">1</xref></p><p>Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the causes of androgenic alopecia, of which
none can be said to account fully for the condition. Infection and microinflammation of the hair
follicles has been considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of androgenic alopecia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-7-413">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-7-413">9</xref> However, only 55% of patients with male-pattern androgenic alopecia and
microinflammation were shown to have hair regrowth in response to treatment with minoxidil, which
was less than the 77% recorded for patients with no signs of inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-7-413">3</xref> This suggests that perifollicular inflammation may be a
contributing factor in some cases of androgenic alopecia that do not respond to minoxidil.
Inflammation may be effective in initiating androgenic alopecia by altering local androgenic hormone
metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-7-413">2</xref> Several studies of hair follicles
taken from subjects with androgenic alopecia have reported moderate lymphohistiocytic inflammation
in 30% of subjects with androgenic alopecia versus 15% of controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-7-413">9</xref></p><p>Localization of the inflammatory infiltrate at the level of the upper follicle suggests that the
primary causal event triggering inflammation might occur in the vicinity of the follicular
infundibulum. One could speculate that colonization of the infundibulum by microbes and/or antigens
could be involved in generation of an inflammatory response due to oxidative tissue injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-7-413">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-7-413">10</xref> In
line with this hypothesis, Pi&#x000e9;rard et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-7-413">11</xref>
found that use of topical antimicrobials may be beneficial for the treatment of androgenic alopecia.
Combinations containing minoxidil-pyrithione zinc,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-7-413">12</xref> minoxidil-ketoconazole,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-7-413">13</xref> and
minoxidil-hydrocortisone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-7-413">14</xref> have been shown to
improve hair growth compared with use of minoxidil alone.</p><p>The aim of the present investigation was to prepare and evaluate a pharmaceutically stable and
therapeutically effective multimodal topical treatment that can address the multifactorial etiology
of androgenic alopecia, including excessive sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgen, microbial
infection, and/or microinflammation. The formula tested was a microemulsion containing minoxidil (an
antiandrogenic agent), tea tree oil (a widely used natural antifungal/antibacterial agent),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-7-413">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-7-413">16</xref>
and diclofenac (a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent marked in the form of
Voltaren<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Emulgel&#x02122; 1% and Voltaren Ophthalmic 0.1%
eyedrops by Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Diclofenac was chosen to diminish hair follicle
microinflammation because it has less pronounced side effects in comparison with cortisone
derivatives. A microemulsion formulation was used because of its many advantages, including ease of
preparation, improved drug solubility, ability to protect drugs with poor stability from
environmental conditions, better transdermal drug delivery, and long shelf-life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dddt-7-413">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dddt-7-413">20</xref>
The physical properties of a freshly prepared multimodal microemulsion, including pH, viscosity,
refractive index, dilution test, dye staining test, optical transparency, specific gravity, and
centrifugal stress, were compared with those after a shelf storage period of 24 months. A pilot
study was also performed in men with androgenic alopecia to compare the efficacy and safety of
microemulsions containing multimodal minoxidil, minoxidil alone, and placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Minoxidil USP was sourced from Alan Pharmaceuticals (London, UK), pharmaceutical grade diclofenac
sodium from Ningbo Samreal Chemical Co, Ltd (Zhejiang, People&#x02019;s Republic of China), premium
grade tea tree oil (<italic>Malaleuca alternifolia</italic>) from Malaleuca Plantation of
Bungawalbyn Pty Limited (Coraki, NSW, Australia), and high-performance liquid chromatography grade
acetone and pharmaceutical grade propylene glycol and absolute alcohol from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO, USA). Labrasol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (containing caprylocaproyl polyoxyl-8 glycerides EP) was
obtained from Gattefoss&#x000e9; (Saint-Priest, Cedex, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of microemulsions</title><sec><title>Construction of ternary phase diagram</title><p>The ternary phase diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-7-413">Figure 1</xref> was
constructed to investigate the range of concentrations needed for the components of the
microemulsions using the water titration method and different oil/surfactant/cosurfactant ratios.
The optimum composition was 0.5% diclofenac, 5% tea tree oil, 5% minoxidil,
5% lauryl alcohol, and 35% water in combination with 55%
Labrasol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [(surfactant)/(propylene glycol-ethanol mixture at 1:1 as
cosurfactant) at (1:1)].</p><p>The compositions of the microemulsions containing multimodal minoxidil, minoxidil alone, and
placebo are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-7-413">Table 1</xref>. The microemulsion
containing multimodal minoxidil was prepared by homogenously mixing 5% w/v of tea tree oil
with 5% w/v of lauryl alcohol, chosen for its good drug solubilizing capacity. Specified
amounts of minoxidil and diclofenac were dissolved in the Labrasol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
surfactant/propylene glycol-ethanol mixture as a cosurfactant. Next, the two mixtures were combined
by gentle stirring. A designated amount of double-distilled water was added to the mixtures
dropwise, and the multimodal microemulsion was obtained at ambient temperature. The procedure was
repeated to prepare the microemulsions containing minoxidil alone and placebo. The preparations
obtained were individually packed in 50 mL amber brown glass bottles each equipped with a calibrated
dropper. All bottles were labeled in a blinded fashion as A (multimodal minoxidil), B (minoxidil
alone), or C (placebo).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization and physical stability of multimodal microemulsion</title><p>Characterization of microemulsions is difficult because of the complex structures and components
involved in these systems, as well as the limitations of the assessment techniques that can be used,
but such knowledge is essential for their successful commercial exploitation. Therefore, studies
using a combination of complementary techniques are usually required to obtain a comprehensive
understanding of the physicochemical properties and structure of microemulsions. Because this was a
pilot study, the multimodal microemulsion was characterized on the basis of its physical properties,
which can not only explain the performance of the system but also help in predicting its physical
stability over time, prior to and after 24 months of storage.</p><p>The multimodal microemulsions (formulation A) were examined for basic physical stability after 24
months of normal storage conditions and compared with the results obtained for the freshly prepared
multimodal samples. The tests were carried out on five specimens from each preparation and observed
for phase separation, flocculation, or precipitation. The microemulsions were centrifuged for 30
minutes at 25&#x000b0;C and inspected for any change in their homogeneity after storage for 24
months under ambient conditions and away from direct light. Chemical assays and testing of the
active ingredients are planned in further broader investigations of the study formulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Staining/dye solubility tests</title><p>A few drops of the microemulsion were spread on a slide after mixing with a diluted drop of
aqueous solution containing methylene blue as a water-soluble dye or a drop of Sudan III solution as
an oil-soluble dye, and observed under an optical microscope. The blue color of the water-soluble
dye appeared as a continuous phase within which microscopic oil droplets were scattered. The red
color of the oil-soluble dye appeared as dispersible red microscopic droplets in a noncolored
continuous phase, indicating that the multimodal formulation was an oil/water (o/w) microemulsion.
These tests were repeated on the stored samples, and the results were similar, indicating no phase
conversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Transparency/translucency</title><p>The droplets of the microemulsions being smaller than 1/4th the wavelength of visible light,
permit white light to pass through the dispersed system. The microemulsion systems were inspected
for optical transparency and homogeneity prior to and after storage by routine observation under
strong light. The formulations were also checked for the presence of undissolved drug or other solid
ingredients.</p></sec><sec><title>Dilution testing</title><p>O/w microemulsions are homogeneous when diluted with water, whereas a w/o microemulsion is not
and undergoes phase inversion into an o/w microemulsion. Dilution tests were used to compare the
freshly prepared A, B, and C microemulsions with corresponding formulations that had been stored for
24 months to determine if the microemulsion underwent phase inversion from o/w to w/o during
storage. To do this, a few drops of the freshly prepared and stored microemulsions were placed on
clean glass slides. A couple of drops of water were mixed in using a glass rod, and the transparency
or turbidity of the microemulsions were examined.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-dddt-7-413">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Centrifugation stress testing</title><p>Next, 2.5 mL samples of the freshly prepared and stored microemulsions were aliquoted into
centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 5000 rpm for 30 minutes at ambient temperature to
assess their physical instability, including phase separation, phase inversion, aggregation,
creaming, and cracking.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of pH</title><p>pH changes could affect product stability and drug bioavailability from a microemulsion at the
site of permeation. Accordingly, the pH of the freshly prepared and stored microemulsions was
determined using a microprocessor pH meter (pH 211, Hanna Instruments, Cluj-Napoca, Romania)
calibrated using pH buffer solution. The pH of each microemulsion was determined in triplicate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dddt-7-413">20</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of specific gravity</title><p>The specific gravity of the freshly prepared and stored multimodal samples was determined using a
specific gravity bottle. The bottle was washed, dried completely, and weighed empty at room
temperature (about 25&#x000b0;C). The bottle was then filled with the microemulsion and weighed.
Specific gravity (g/mL) was calculated using the following formula: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Specfic</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>gravity</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Weight</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>filled</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>bottle</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>weight</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>empty</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>bottle</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Volume</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>bottle</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of viscosity</title><p>Viscosity measurements were performed using a viscometer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation,

pattern androgenic alopecia based on the Norwood-Hamilton scale of baldness in men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dddt-7-413">22</xref> were enrolled into the study. Men with stage
V&#x02013;VII androgenic alopecia were excluded. All subjects were healthy Saudis or Egyptians with
fair skin and black hair who also complained of a noticeably oily and slightly itchy scalp. Subjects
who were using hair restorers or systemically active drugs, including steroids, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories, cytotoxic agents, topical antiseptic and/or antifungals, vasodilators,
antibiotics, antihypertensive agents, diuretics, or specifically contraindicated agents (such as
spironolactone, cimetidine, diazoxide, cyclosporine, finasteride, or ketoconazole) during the
previous six months were also excluded. All patients were informed of the likely pharmacological and
therapeutic effects of the study formulations as well as their potential adverse effects, based on
available drug information. Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were
obtained before the participants were enrolled in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, 32-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation of the safety and

hand-clipped during the initial baseline screening procedure and at eight-week intervals thereafter,
for a total period of 32 weeks. Treatment was started immediately after the first clipping and
continued for four successive clippings at eight-week intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Hair clipping technique</title><p>A 2 cm<sup>2</sup> rigid transparent plastic template was placed over the chosen scalp site. The
hair within the square area was carefully pulled through, then grasped and hand-clipped close to the
scalp with small straight surgical scissors. After removing the template, two diagonal corners of
the outlined square were marked permanently with sterile Indian ink from a 21-gauge needle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dddt-7-413">23</xref> Hair clipping was performed at eight-week intervals,
and the cut hairs were carefully placed on collection paper. Before removing the template, the
clipped area was inspected with a magnifying lens for any missed or loose hairs that should be
included.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of treatment</title><p>Following hair clipping, the subjects were provided with the test solutions in a randomized
manner. The assigned medications were provided in identically appearing prelabeled bottles. The
subjects were instructed to use a calibrated dropper for application of 1 mL of each test
microemulsion twice daily to the frontoparietal or vertex area of the scalp, starting at the clipped
site. The test products were applied to a dry scalp and spread with a finger tip, and the hair was
allowed to dry naturally without a hair dryer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment</title><p>Numerous methods are available for assessment of hair variables, ie, density, growth rate, and
mean hair weight, count, and thickness. These techniques can be classified as invasive (eg, biopsy),
semi-invasive (trichogram, unit area trichogram), or noninvasive (eg, global hair count, global
photographic assessment, and phototrichogram).</p><p>The phototrichogram<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dddt-7-413">24</xref> is a simple,
reproducible, and sensitive noninvasive technique that is used to determine the rate of hair growth,
size of hair fibers, and proportion of hair follicles in telogen phase, and to quantify the amount
of hair shed. All hairs in a 2 cm<sup>2</sup> area are trimmed 1 mm from the skin surface and a
baseline photograph is taken. After a week, the same region is photographed and the hairs are
trimmed again. This process is repeated until an adequate number of photographs are available for
comparison. Comparison with baseline photographs identifies hair fibers that have grown (follicles
in anagen) and those that have not (follicles in telogen), rate of hair growth over seven days, hair
density (number of hairs counted in the photograph), and which hair fibers are missing five days
later (hair shedding).</p><p>In 2001, Hoffmann developed a commercial fully computerized phototrichogram technique using
automated software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-dddt-7-413">25</xref> whereby a 1.8 cm<sup>2</sup>
area of hair loss showing a transition between normal hair growth and a balding area for men with
androgenic alopecia and an area in the mid vertex for women with diffuse hair loss is chosen for
clipping. The area on the scalp is marked with a central black tattoo. Clipped hairs within the
target area are dyed and photographs are taken immediately afterwards and then 2&#x02013;3 days
after shaving using a digital closeup camera with epiluminescence microscopy. Two photographs are
then compared using a software system that can recognize images of individual hair fibers. By
comparing the two photographs, the computer can determine which hairs are growing and which are not.
Because the results are reproducible, this software can be used to monitor the success of treatment.
However, in this pilot study, we used previously reported noninvasive techniques,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dddt-7-413">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dddt-7-413">23</xref>
including determination of mean hair weight, hair count, and hair thickness, as well as a global
photographic method.</p><sec><title>Determination of mean hair weight, count, and thickness</title><p>The hair samples were degreased and then weighed in high-performance liquid chromatography grade
acetone for at least one hour. When completely dry, the hair was transferred to a light aluminum
weighing pan with a 5 digits readability balance. The relative humidity of the balance chamber was
measured using a digital hygrometer calibrated at 20% and 90% relative humidity
using saturated solutions of potassium acetate and zinc sulfate, respectively. The relative humidity
of the balance chamber was recorded at 65% after conditioning for two hours, and the hair
samples were then weighed. The entire hair samples were then individually laid out for counting in
groups of ten on a marked grid using a wide-field zone projection microscope.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dddt-7-413">23</xref> After counting, subsamples containing 25 hairs each were measured for
thickness. For convenience and reproducibility, only two subsamples were taken from each subject at
baseline and after 32 weeks of treatment. The hair subsamples were mounted on large slides and
covered with a piece of thin plastic wrap film to enable simple visual observation. Hair thickness
was measured at the midpoint of each individual hair by tracking the projected image with a 10

minoxidil, minoxidil only, and placebo groups, respectively, and a 79%, 41%, and
13% improvement according to photographic assessment, all favoring the multimodal minoxidil
microemulsion.</p><p>Both the investigator assessment and patient reports indicated that signs and symptoms of contact
dermatitis (ie, stinging, burning, itching, dryness, scaling) were more prevalent in the group
treated with the 5% minoxidil solution (seven of 11 patients, about 64%) than in the
placebo group (four of 10 patients, about 40%). In contrast, symptoms in the group treated
with the multimodal minoxidil formulation were less prevalent (one of 11 patients, about
9%). These results are indicative of better tolerability and safety using the multimodal
minoxidil formulation in comparison with the minoxidil only and placebo options. The superior
tolerability of the multimodal minoxidil formulation could be attributed to the inclusion of
ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, that ameliorates inflammation of both the scalp
and hair follicles. Reduced inflammation could minimize sebum production, which provides a good
nutrition medium for bacterial and fungal infections. Inclusion of tea tree oil has the additional
advantage of helping to eliminate bacterial and fungal organisms that could modify androgen
metabolism and lead to hair fall. It appears that the multimodal formulation further potentiates the
effect of minoxidil in increasing hair density, improving hair growth, and reducing inflammation and
risk of bacterial infection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>All evaluations showed highly significant improvements using the multimodal minoxidil
microemulsion in comparison with the minoxidil only formulation which, in turn, was significantly
more effective than placebo. The pronounced effects of the multimodal minoxidil formulation compared
with minoxidil alone could be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effect of diclofenac in reducing
scalp and follicular microinflammation and the tea tree oil in resolving any existing microbial or
fungal colonization of the hair follicles. These results indicate that androgenic alopecia is
multifactorial and perhaps polygenic in nature. Hence, an effective multimodal microemulsion
comprising minoxidil, an anti-inflammatory agent, and an anti-infective agent is recommended as
being more promising than minoxidil alone. Diclofenac was used in the multimodal formulation instead
of a cortisone derivative to reduce the risk of side effects, and tea tree oil was used on the basis
that it is a highly effective natural anti-infective agent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-7-413">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-7-413">16</xref> Further study is
