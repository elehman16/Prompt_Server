In particular, the study explored the use of Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a multivariate data analysis in order to assess and clarify the process of regaining independence after stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized double-blind controlled trial was performed. Thirteen subjects with residual hemiparesis after a single stroke episode were measured in both in- and outpatient settings at a district hospital. All subjects were able to walk before suffering the stroke and were hemodynamically stable within the first week after stroke. Control and target groups were treated with conventional physiotherapy for stroke, but specific techniques were added for treatment of the target group depending on patients&#x02019; functional levels.</p><p>Independence level was assessed with the Barthel Index (BI) throughout 7 evolution stages (hemodynamic stability, beginning of standing, beginning of physical therapy sessions in the physiotherapy ward and monthly assessment for 6&#x000a0;months after stroke).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>FPCA was applied for data analysis. Statistically significant differences were found in the dynamics of the recovery process between the two physiotherapy protocols. The target group showed a trend of improvement six months after stroke that was not present in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>FPCA is a method which may be used to provide greater insight into the analysis of the rehabilitation process than that provided by conventional parametric methods. So, by using the whole curves as basic data parameters, subtle differences in the rehabilitation process can be found.</p><p>FPCA represents a future aid for the fine analysis of similar physiotherapy techniques, when applied in subjects with a huge variability of functional recovery, as in the case of post-stroke patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1743-0003-11-134) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Functional principal components analysis</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Functional recovery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>With an ageing population worldwide and the prediction of an ever-increasing burden of stroke-related morbidity and mortality in the elderly, trends of independence recovery have become a key factor in the rehabilitation of subjects who suffer from hemiplegia after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, there is a huge variability in the functional recovery patterns after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and its influence on the statistical analysis of data should be taken into account when predicting the gain associated to a specific physiotherapy protocol as it plays an essential role in rehabilitation research. Moreover, knowing subjects&#x02019; recovery dynamics can help to find differences between the evolution of patients treated with different physiotherapy protocols. In this regard, Functional Data Analysis (FDA) offers significant advantages for a better understanding of trends. FDA can extract further information contained in the mathematical function and its derivatives not normally available through traditional statistical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In addition, it represents a new conceptualization of the handling of time series and correlated data because this approach treats the whole curve as a single entity. Consequently, there is also no concern about correlations between repeated measurements because it is assumed that an underlying functional relationship governs the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical technique, which aims to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data sets by computing another much smaller set of uncorrelated variables (Principal Components), which best represent the original data-set, each new variable being a linear combination of the original ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The main method employed in the statistical analysis of this study was Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). It is based on the PCA however, rather than using variables, the FPCA uses functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to conduct the process. FPCA is one of the most popular multivariate analysis techniques for the extraction of information from FDA.</p><p>FPCA is applied for the study of human motion in race walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], for the analysis of joint coordination data in motor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], for the analysis of the different concurrent mechanisms involved in the learning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and also for forecasting age-specific mortality and fertility rates observed over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, its application in studies focused on recovery processes is scarce. FPCA demonstrates how a set of functional data varies with regard to its mean, and in terms of these modes of variability, it quantifies the discrepancy with regard to the mean of each individual functional datum. Accordingly, it could be a useful approach to estimate recovery trends.</p><p>The aim of this study was to provide a valid method for the purpose of assessing and clarifying the process of regaining independence after stroke. Particularly, since FPCA is an emerging methodology in the field of rehabilitation research, the objective of this paper was to explore the advantages of this multivariate data analysis over traditional statistical methods in the analysis of functional recovery trends in subjects that presented a huge variability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from Hospital Universitari i Polit&#x000e8;cnic La Fe of Valencia, Spain. This study was approved by the Hospital&#x02019;s Ethical Committee and all patients enrolled were informed and they signed informed consent. 13 patients, with a mean age of 73.1 (SD 8.5) were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: having suffered a single stroke episode with residual hemiparesis (regardless of the aetiology and the hemiplegic side), being candidate to begin a rehabilitation programme, being able to walk before suffering the stroke, having the ability to understand and follow simple instructions and being hemodinamically stable within the first week after stroke. Exclusion criteria included poor vital prognosis; pathologies or disorders hampering the development of the study such as: blindness, prosthetics, sensory disorders, severe cognitive impairment and so on; absence of motor impairments after stroke; and pre-stroke disorders that affected the ability to walk.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the target or the control treatment; randomization was performed using SPSS 15 for Windows, licensed from the University of Valencia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study consisted of a randomized double-blind controlled trial: subjects did not know which group they belonged to and the physical therapists making the assessments were blinded to the group treatment assignment. Control and target groups were treated with conventional physiotherapy for stroke, but specific techniques were added to the treatment of the target group depending on patients&#x02019; functional levels. Hospital of Sagunto (HS) Functional Scales were used to determine the functional level of each patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additional techniques used in the target group aimed to strengthen balance, dissociation of movement and sensitivity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To avoid differences, the same physiotherapist treated the patients of both groups. Patients were not aware of their group allocation as they were not together at the same time in the physiotherapy unit. All patients underwent five sessions of physiotherapy per week during inpatient rehabilitation and three weekly sessions for outpatient treatment. Each session was 90&#x000a0;minutes long and patients could rest whenever they needed.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Probably due to this factor, various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in this research area have not found statistically significant differences through the use of standard statistical analysis techniques. In this paper, traditional analysis (ANOVA) and FPCA were applied to study the functional recovery of 13 subjects who randomly participated in two physiotherapy protocols in order to establish which was more suitable for function recovery after stroke. The ANOVA between groups was not significant (p-value 0.331), however, we found statistically significant differences through FPCA as this method deals with the subjects&#x02019; dynamics of recovery instead of particular values at given times. Therefore, through the use of FPCA the relevance of additional techniques used in the target group for the functional recovery process after stroke was established. Don&#x000e0; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] also studied the limitations of conventional statistical analysis and they demonstrated the potential benefits of FDA, providing greater insight into subtle differences in kinematic and kinetic patterns for athletes having different skill levels. However, they did not study the effect of any therapy and to our knowledge, there are scarce studies using FPCA to analyse the results of different rehabilitation treatments for functional recovery after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, FPCA is a useful approach to estimate recovery trends when variability between subjects is very large, as accounting for inter-subject variability ensures that essential trends for recovery patterns are not overlooked due to limitations of the statistical analysis procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is widely known that recovery after stroke usually occurs in the first six months following the event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, we found a significant difference in the dynamics of recovery between groups. A positive trend of recovery which continued after 6&#x000a0;months following the stroke was found in the target group, while a plateau was observed in the recovery process of the control group. Moreover, we can be sure that these differences were due to the physiotherapy protocol because both groups were homogeneous at baseline characteristics and there were no differences in the FPC1 which quantifies the general level of independence recovery from the first session in the physiotherapy ward up to six months after stroke. It showed that subjects categorized with a poorer level, likewise had a poorer recovery, which agrees with the findings of other authors in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, independence recovery was faster during the first three months after stroke as suggested by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, FPC2 refers to a trend of variability based on the differences in the time of recovery; the results showed that it was statistically significant for the treatment group, p-value less than 0.05 (0.005). Finally, FPC3, that refers to recovery trend development in the middle period of recovery, was statistically significant during inpatient rehabilitation (p-value 0.014), which means that subjects had a lower level of independence.</p><p>Therefore, this methodology is able to clarify the process of functional recovery after stroke. So, as first component of this pattern accounts for 80% of total variance, the final functional outcome mainly depends on subject&#x02019;s initial condition: individuals with lower BI rates at the beginning of the recovery reach lower BI rates six months after stroke and recover more slowly than subjects with higher BI at the beginning (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Moreover, 16% of variance is accounted for the physiotherapy protocol applied, suggesting that the use of specific physiotherapy techniques can influence the recovery process and final outcomes even beyond six months after stroke.</p><p>Finally, determining if a protocol of physiotherapy is more appropriate than other is a hard task as researchers find several limitations. Mainly, the size of patients is often small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] because it is very difficult to find an adequate amount of subjects who meet the inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and frequently, there is a huge variability in functional recovery process between subjects after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These limitations were also found in the present study.</p><p>Nevertheless, FPCA has proven to be useful for the detection of significant outcomes that are not found by the use of conventional statistical analysis techniques. The main limitation of FPCA is the difficulty to interpret the results. Interpretation of results in parameter based analysis is straightforward, however, in FDA and particularly in FPCA, interpretation is based on the whole function.</p><p>In short, FPCA has some limitations but it is useful to analyse recovery trends when variability is very large while improvements do not so much involve increased scores on a given scale (i.e. BI), yet relate to the dynamics of recovery. Thus, in this paper we used FPCA as a method to assess differences in the recovery processes of subjects after stroke, thereby establishing which techniques are more effective than others and promoting standardized treatment protocols in the rehabilitation area. Future research for the application of FPCA in larger samples could be interesting specially for determining which physical therapy techniques are more effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>FPCA provides a useful approach for the purpose of analysing recovery trends because it deals with subjects&#x02019; dynamics of recovery and not with specific values at given times. Furthermore, FPCA allows the detection of statistically significant differences hardly detectable through conventional statistical analysis. So this methodology could be useful for the determination of functional recovery patterns after stroke.</p><p>This type of analysis can be used to establish differences between treatments when subjects present a huge variability, this being one of the largest research gaps in the field of stroke rehabilitation. In fact, further study on the influence of different physiotherapy protocols on functional recovery after stroke is needed in order to determine which techniques are more effective.</p><p>Finally, study results support the use of FPCA in stroke rehabilitation and other research in health sciences where initial measurements involve time series data and huge variability.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="12984_2014_673_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12984_2014_673_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM2"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 2</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12984_2014_673_MOESM3_ESM.tiff" id="MOESM3"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 3</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>ML has developed the concept and design of the study and she has also written and revised the manuscript.
