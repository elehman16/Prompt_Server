The hormonal and mechanical factors make pregnant women require less local anesthetic than nonpregnant women to attain the same level of spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] They stand at a greater risk of toxicity to local anesthetics due to the increased penetration through tissue membranes, decreased plasma protein binding and progesterone enhanced cardiotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Any dose alterations can cause hemodynamic instability leading to increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Studies on hemodynamic alterations in spinal anesthesia show that the hypotension after spinal anesthesia is caused due the enhanced sympathetic segmental block due to higher doses of local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Among the local anesthetics hyperbaric bupivacaine is the preferred local anesthetic. The unique characteristics of this drug are the highest potency, slow onset of action (5-8 min) and longer duration. Further, studies have shown that the combination of isobaric bupivacaine and fentanyl produce less hypotension.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies have also shown that by adding intrathecal opioids to bupivacaine in caesarean section enhance the quality of surgical analgesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Among the synthetic opioids, fentanyl is favorable due to greater potency, faster onset of action and rapid redistribution with an associated decrease in the plasma concentration of the drug[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and thus enhancing the early postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>However, these studies have used varied dosage and baricity of bupivacaine and have not defined the minimum dose required to avoid hypotension without affecting surgical anesthesia. Hence, we conducted the present study to hypothesize that the low dose of 7.5 mg of hyperbaric (0.5%) bupivacaine combined with 25 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl produce better analgesia and stable hemodynamics than the conventional dose of 10 mg of (0.5%) hyperbaric bupivcaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted from 2008 to 2011 as a prospective randomized double-blinded, controlled study at a single tertiary academic hospital on 50 singleton patients between the age of 18 and 30 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] I and II scheduled for elective caesarean section. The study design was approved by the institutional ethics committee prior to data collection and written informed consent was taken from all the patients. Patients with preexisting hypertension or pregnancy induced hypertension requiring treatment, those with cardiac/renal or other end-organ disease, patients in active labor, placenta previa and those with contraindication to neuraxial block were excluded from the study. Obese patients and patients with extreme height (&#x0003c;140 cm or &#x0003e;180 cm) were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Before proceeding with the spinal anesthesia fasting status of patients was confirmed, and antacid prophylaxis was given. The Boyle anesthesia machine was checked, appropriate sized endotracheal tubes, two working laryngoscopes, a working suction apparatus and emergency drugs along with mephentermine and naloxone were kept ready. Intravenous access was secured with a large bore catheter and ringers lactate infusion was started. Standard monitors such as electrocardiography, Pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pressure cuff were applied.</p><p>Baseline systolic, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate readings were taken in the supine position with a wedge under the right buttock. A two operator technique was employed to maintain blinding. Patients were allocated into two groups of 25 patients each by computer-generated random allocation into a study group (group S) and a control group (group C). Study group received a total volume of 2 ml with a combination of 25 &#x003bc;g fentanyl and 7.5 mg of (0.5%) hyperbaric bupivacaine, whereas group-C also received 2 ml but with 10 mg of (0.5%) hyperbaric bupivacaine. The enrolling investigator prepared the intrathecal solution and subsequently had no role in patient's assessment.</p><p>Under aseptic conditions, lumbar puncture was performed with 25 gauge spinal needle at the level of the L3-4 interspace. After the free flow of cerebro-spinal fluid the specified drug in each group was injected slowly over 20 s, with the orifice of the spinal needle pointing cephalad. Patients were positioned immediately in supine position. The wedge was placed under patient's right buttock to avoid the supine hypotension syndrome. Oxygen was supplemented by Hudson's mask. An independent investigator blinded to anesthetic technique evaluated the effects.</p><p>Systolic and DBP and maternal heart rate were recorded every 2 min for the first 30 min and thereafter for every 5 min intraoperatively. A decrease of systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;95 mmHg or decrease &#x0003e;25% from baseline was considered as hypotension and treated with 3 mg-5 mg of mephenteramine. Vasopressor requirements were noted. Sensory level of the block was assessed by loss of cold sensation bilaterally at 2 min intervals and confirmed by a pinprick method. All patients were evaluated for quality of sensory block on a descriptive scale (good, satisfactory, poor).</p><p>Degree of motor block was assessed by modified Bromage scale as:</p><p>

</p><p>An intraoperative pain assessment was done using visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10 cm where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever felt). Postoperative pain was also assessed using a VAS scale. Duration of effective analgesia was taken from the time of intrathecal injection to a VAS score &#x02265;4. Side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and shivering were noted. Duration for two segment regressions of the sensory blockade was noted, Apgar score of newborn was recorded at 1 min and 5 min.</p><p>The statistical power analysis suggested that a sample size of 25patients/group was required to achieve a power of 80% and a level significance of 0.001 to be able to detect a difference of analgesia of 50 min between the groups. Interpretation of the data was carried out, and analyzed using Microsoft excel and by the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS Inc. Released 2006, (SPSS for Windows, Version 15.0. Chicago).</p><p>Data is represented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for continuous data. The two groups were compared using analysis of variance to compare the demographic data and hemodynamic parameters. The proportion of adverse effects was compared using Chi-square test and level of analgesia was compared with the help of VAS with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever. <italic>P</italic> value was assessed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The age, weight, height, ASA physical status were comparable in both the groups and statistically insignificant as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-9-122-g001"/></table-wrap><p>There were no significant changes in the blood pressure in both the groups till 3 min after spinal block.

It carries high efficiency, involves less drug doses, minimal neonatal depression and lesser incidences of aspiration pneumonitis. However, it also produces a fixed duration of anesthesia, lesser control of block height, postdural puncture headache and hypotension.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Subsequently, hypotension is known to result in maternal morbidity, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and can also directly influence the neonate well-being by reducing uteroplacental blood flow.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The link between the extent of sympathetic block and the incidence of hypotension has led to numerous attempts at reducing the dose of local anesthetic and also the addition of opioids due to their synergistic action with local anesthetics on the sensory block without increasing sympathetic block for cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Various authors have used different dosages of local anesthetics and the volume required for spinal anesthesia in caesarean delivery. Nagata <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported that 8 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine is preferable to 10 mg in spinal anesthesia for cesarean section to obtain adequate analgesia and avoid maternal hypotension. In Ben David study, they used 5 mg of isobaric bupivacaine intrathecally with 25 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl, but there were a number of patients who expressed brief and moderate intraoperative pain which was unacceptable. Subedi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] observed that the relatively low dose of bupivacaine use restricted spinal block segments and thus the extent of sympathetic block, thus improving the safety margin of hemodynamic effects seen after spinal anesthesia. Hence, in our study, we were interested to assess the efficacy of the combination of low-dose (7.5 mg) of (0.5%) hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl in spinal anesthesia. Patients scheduled for caesarean section were chosen for the study because it is well known that they show visceral discomfort and pain under spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the hemodynamics, duration of effective analgesia with the combination of fentanyl and low dose hyperbaric bupivacaine. We observed that the systolic and DBPs were decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) after 3 min and 5 min of spinal anesthesia in the control group when compared to the study group, mostly due to more sympathetic blockade by higher doses of bupivacaine in the control group. Similar findings were observed by Bogra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and also by Seyedhejazi and Madarek[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] wherein they studied by using 8 mg of bupivacaine and 10 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl for spinal anesthesia in caesarean section.</p><p>In our study, we observed that the time required for the onset of sensory blockade up to T6 was faster in the group-S than in the group-C and is statistically significant with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, which corroborate with the study of Singh <italic>et al</italic>., However, it differs from the observations of Randall's <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which states that the onset of sensory block to T6 gets faster with increasing bupivacaine dose. The complete motor block was achieved in 90-100% of patients in our study, this is in accordance with the results of Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Quality of sensory blockade was good as there was no analgesic supplementation required in study group even when the uterus was exteriorized and to the pulling of fallopian tubes, this may be due to the addition of opioid like fentanyl which blocks the visceral pain, but the difference between the groups was NS.</p><p>The quality of analgesia which was assessed by VAS was excellent in the study group, similar observations were made by Choi <italic>et al</italic>., Biswas. The duration of effective analgesia was significantly prolonged with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in the study group, which also correlates with the study done by Ngiam and Chong[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who observed that the duration of effective analgesia was significantly prolonged with the addition of fentanyl to hyperbaric bupivacaine. The time of the first request for analgesics was significantly delayed, which strongly suggest a synergism of action between intrathecal fentanyl and local anesthetics. The duration of two segment regression of sensory blockade was prolonged in the study group than in the control group, which was statically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and concurs with the study made by Idowu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Further, in the group-S, one patient complained of mild pruritus, maybe because of side effect of fentanyl, but the etiology of it was not ascertained. Similar findings were observed by Cowan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] but the study by Jashri <italic>et al</italic>., observed no incidence of pruritus. No patients complained of nausea and vomiting may be due to reduction of dose of bupivacaine from 10 mg to 7.5 mg causing less hypotension in the study group. Negligible incidences of shivering or respiratory depression was observed in both the groups, which were similar to the findings of Kang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In our study, none of the newborn babies had 5 min Apgar score &#x0003c;7. Similar observations were made by Belzarena,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Biswas, indicating that the dose of fentanyl used may not have a significant effect on the newborn. By reducing the doses of bupivacaine from 10 mg to 7.5 mg and the addition of fentanyl, we have been able to decrease the incidence of episodes of low blood pressure and subsequently poor neonatal outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the present clinical comparative study, we conclude that the addition of 25 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl to 7.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section shows faster onset of sensory block with better hemodynamic stability and significantly prolong postoperative analgesia than hyperbaric bupivacaine alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are thankful to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Gandhi Hospital for their support.
