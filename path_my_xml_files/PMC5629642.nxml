Health professionals report lack of knowledge, skills and confidence to effectively manage smoking among pregnant women in general. We developed a behaviour change intervention aimed to improve health professionals&#x02019; management of smoking in Indigenous pregnant women&#x02014;the Indigenous Counselling And Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy. This intervention includes webinar training for health professionals, an educational resources package for health professionals and pregnant women, free oral nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant women, and audit and feedback on health professionals' performance.</p><p>The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy intervention to improve health professionals' provision of evidence-based culturally responsive smoking cessation care to Australian Indigenous pregnant smokers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This protocol describes the design of a step-wedge cluster randomised pilot study. Six Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs) are randomised into three clusters. Clusters receive the intervention staggered by 1&#x02009;month. Health professionals report on their knowledge and skills pretraining and post-training and at the end of the study. Pregnant women are recruited and followed up for 3&#x02009;months. The primary outcome is the recruitment rate of pregnant women. Secondary outcomes include feasibility of recruitment and follow-up of participating women, and webinar training of health professionals, measured using a designated log; and measures of effectiveness outcomes, including quit rates and NRT prescription rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>In accordance with the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, this study has been developed in collaboration with a Stakeholder and Consumer Aboriginal Advisory Panel (SCAAP). The SCAAP provides cultural consultation, advice and direction to ensure that implementation is acceptable and respectful to the Aboriginal communities involved. Results will be disseminated to AMSs, Aboriginal communities and national Aboriginal bodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration details</title><p>This protocol (version 4, 14 October 2016) is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Ref #: ACTRN12616001603404).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>step wedge randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>indigenous</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hunter Cancer Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NSW Ministry of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first study in Australia to target specifically Indigenous smoking during pregnancy that covers three different states and different settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study is designed to overcome specific implementation issues identified in previous research, including ensuring community representation in governance of the research; participant recruitment by known health staff from the service; and adequate reimbursement for time and effort of services and women.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention tested in this study was informed by theory and based on extensive formative research beforehand.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study is a pilot study aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability, and is not powered to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study covers health professionals treating Indigenous pregnant women who work at Aboriginal Medical Services only, and does not cover other general antenatal care settings that Indigenous women may attend.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco smoking in pregnancy is the most important preventable risk factor for poor maternal and infant health outcomes.</p><p>In 2013, 12% of women who gave birth in Australia smoked during pregnancy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Indigenous Australian women have the highest smoking prevalence during pregnancy (47%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Indigenous women also quit smoking during pregnancy at a lower rate compared with the general population (11% compared with 25%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Smoking has been identified as an important contributor to the health and life expectancy gaps between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Australia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Pharmacotherapy</title><p>In a Cochrane review on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnancy, the use of NRT increased cessation rates by 40% (RR 1.41, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.03 to 1.93); the exclusion of non-placebo controlled trials resulted in a lower, non-significant increase in the cessation rate (RR 1.28, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.99 to 1.66).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The discrepancy between these findings, and the apparent effectiveness of NRT for the general population,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> may be explained by the faster nicotine metabolism in pregnancy, requiring higher doses than those used in the included studies.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 20</xref> Importantly, the use of NRT was not associated with any significant differences in pregnancy or birth outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Experts agree that NRT is always safer than smoking in pregnancy, and guidelines from several countries, including Australia, recommend the use of NRT, if a woman has been unsuccessful in quitting.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref> These guidelines recommend first using oral forms of NRT, and if the woman is still unsuccessful quitting smoking, adding an NRT patch.

</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Need for health professionals&#x02019; training</title><p>Health professionals report that they lack the knowledge, skills and confidence to assist pregnant women to quit smoking.

Surveys with other antenatal health professionals in Australia (Aboriginal health workers, midwives, nurses) report similar findings.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

</p><p>On the basis of these ABCD guidelines,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> we used the Theoretical Domains Framework,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> the Behaviour Change Wheel<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and Behaviour Change Techniques recommended in pregnancy,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> to develop a theory-based behaviour change intervention aimed to improve health professionals management of smoking in Indigenous pregnant women&#x02014;ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy. The Theoretical Domains Framework and Behaviour Change Wheel are used to identify barriers and facilitators to achieving evidence-based care to inform intervention design.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</p><p>The intervention was developed in collaboration and negotiation with two Aboriginal Medical Services&#x000a0;(AMSs) in New South Wales (NSW). The chief executive officers of those AMSs are associate investigators on the study and partnered with the research team to establish a Stakeholder and Consumer Aboriginal Advisory Panel (SCAAP), to advise on the design of the study.

All of the sites will receive the same intervention which will be sequentially delivered 2&#x02009;months following commencement of the study, staggered by 1&#x02009;month between clusters (the intervention is described below). Two cohorts, one of health&#x000a0;professionals and one of pregnant women, will provide data with repeated measures: from 2&#x02009;months prior to receiving the intervention until 6 months following the intervention.

Estimated completion time is 15&#x02009;min.</p></sec><sec id="s2l3d"><title>Breath carbon monoxide</title><p>At the three study visits, a breath carbon monoxide test will be performed to validate smoking status, and estimate fetal carboxyhaemoglobin.

The survey will commence with a question regarding which health professional she saw on that occasion (GP/midwife/nurse/Aboriginal health worker/other). Eleven dichotomous questions (yes/no) will be used to form a composite score representing quality of smoking cessation care. For example: <italic>Did any of the health professionals you saw today give you the following care: Asked you about smoking? Gave you advice to quit&#x02026;? Assisted you with making a quit plan? Explained how smoking affects&#x02026;? Offered you NRT&#x02026;? Measured your breath&#x02026;? /Discussed with you&#x02026;? Gave you support&#x02026;? Made arrangements for follow-up appointments or referral? Gave you resources&#x02026;?</italic> Two Likert Scales will be used to rate (1) her perceived involvement in making a decision about quitting (no involvement to very much involved) and (2) her overall satisfaction with the help she received (not satisfied at all to very satisfied).</p></sec><sec id="s2l3f"><title>Recording of consultations for behaviour change techniques analysis</title><p>A digital audio recording of provider-patient sessions relating to smoking cessation will be undertaken, including a mix of initial and follow-up consultations (ie, prequit attempt, and during or postquit attempt up to the 4-week follow-up point).

</p><p>The Stakeholder and Consumer&#x000a0;Aboriginal Advisory Panel (SCAAP) invites at least one member from each of the pilot study AMSs and will convene bimonthly. The role of the SCAAP will be to provide cultural consultation, advice and direction to ensure that the implementation of the ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy project pilot is acceptable and respectful to the Aboriginal communities involved. The SCAAP is instrumental in ensuring research practice, data collection and dissemination of findings is appropriate to each community. Members of SCAAP will be included in the writing and publication of research results.</p><p>Furthermore, an Aboriginal cultural liaison position is maintained throughout the study to ensure appropriate level of cultural safety, Aboriginal community ownership and engagement is upheld. The research team includes three Aboriginal chief investigators and four Aboriginal associate investigators who are involved in various aspects of the project, including the design, implementation, data analysis and interpretation.</p><p>Pregnant smokers who are mature minors (aged over 16 years&#x000a0;but under 18 years) will be included if judged by the research facilitator able to give informed consent. Consent to the audio&#x000a0;recording is an additional option for both health professionals and participating pregnant women, which they can agree to or decline.</p><p>All of the data collected, at all levels, are deidentified. Pregnant women participating in the study are given a unique code by the research facilitator. Any data collected are only identified with this code. Health professionals' surveys are linked using the date of birth and the last three digits of their surname.</p><p>All serious adverse events, and study related adverse events considered severe in nature that do not otherwise fulfil the definition of a serious adverse event, will be reported immediately by sites during follow-up. For the purposes of this study those events that will be considered severe study related adverse events include, but are not limited to, severe allergic reaction to NRT and clinical depression. A data monitoring committee will not be convened for this study and was not deemed necessary by the human research ethics committee, as NRT will be used according to current clinical guidelines.</p><p>Study outcomes will be discussed with participating services. Sites will receive a lay summary of the study outcomes, to be distributed to their community and participants of the study as they see fit. A policy brief will be distributed to Aboriginal and Government peak bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Significance of the&#x000a0;study</title><p>The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy intervention trial was designed to overcome implementation problems identified in previous research.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46 72 73 74</xref> This includes ensuring community representation in governance of the research; participant recruitment by known health staff from the service; adequate reimbursement for time and effort of the services and women participants. This pilot phase will enable us to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and make further adjustments as necessary, prior to the expense of a large cRCT. The ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy pilot trial will provide valuable information to advance the much needed reduction in smoking rates among pregnant Indigenous women.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e242" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016095.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e243" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016095.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors thank the Aboriginal communities who have co-developed the ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy intervention.
