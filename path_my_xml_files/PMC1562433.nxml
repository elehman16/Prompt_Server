The EMG signals were collected using a computerized EMG VIKING II, with 8 channels and three pairs of surface electrodes. EMG activity was obtained from MVIC knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of flexion in a seated position and MVIC hip abduction at 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; with patients in side-lying position with the knee in full extension.

Our findings demonstrate that hip abduction do not facilitated VLL and VLO activity in relation to the VMO, however, this study included only healthy subjects performing maximum voluntary isometric contraction contractions, therefore much remains to be discovered by future research</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) presents one of the most perplexing pathologic conditions in orthopedic and sports medicine clinics, as well as in rehabilitation departments, and it was referred to by Dye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] as the "black hole of orthopedics" because of the lack of clarity regarding the etiological factors that contribute to dysfunction or to specific treatment protocols and the causative mechanisms remain imprecisely defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Dysfunction of the quadriceps muscle has been hypothesized as a cause of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) with great emphasis placed on the role of VMO and VL muscular imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Quadriceps dysfunction in PFPS patients has been assessed in various ways including decreased magnitude of the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the quadriceps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], diminished EMG activity of the VMO in relation to that of the VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the delayed onset of VMO activation in relation to the VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] caused by the inhibition of pain, effusion and atrophies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Improved control of patella tracking is necessary for symptomatic relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the recovery of quadriceps function is essential to the resolution of the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Consequently, there have been numerous studies that have sought to identify exercises to selectively recruit the VMO in an effort to retrain this muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, Mirzabeigi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] suggested that the VMO muscle cannot be significantly isolated during nine sets of different exercises.</p><p>Since fibers of the VMO attach to the adductor magnus muscle, it has been hypothesized that activation of the VMO may be enhanced by combining active knee extension with volitional hip adduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Research in clinical studies on the treatment of PFPS has reported that VL activity may also be enhanced by combining knee extension exercises with hip abduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Fulkerson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] noted retinacular tenderness in patients with patellofemoral pain, including some who demonstrated histological changes within the perineural tissues of the lateral retinaculum on examination of surgical biopsy specimens. Bevilaqua-Grossi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in their anatomical study dissected the thighs of 32 human cadavers and showed that the distal fibers of the Vastus Lateralis Obliquus (VLO) were interdigitated with the lateral retinaculum and the iliotibial tract in all specimens, were subsequently joined in a common tendon with the VLL on the superolateral border of the patella (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and that tightness of lateral retinaculum could potentially alter the tracking of the patella in the trochlear groove. Based on this anatomic correlation, Hip abduction exercises are often contraindicated by physical therapists because some group of patient with patellofemoral problems may have tight lateral structures and hip abduction exercises would enhance VMO and VL muscular imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Lateral view of the right thigh showing the origin of the obliquus portion of the vastus lateralis muscle (vastus lateralis obliquus &#x02013; <bold>VLO</bold>) in the lateral intermuscular septum (<bold>LIS</bold>) and its insertion in the superior -lateral border of the patella (<bold>P</bold>). <bold>VLL </bold>&#x02013; vastus lateralis longus.

Before the electrode placement the sites were prepared by shaving, abrading and cleaning with isopropyl alcohol to reduce the surface impedance to less than 5 and 10 k&#x003a9; for men and women, respectively. A quadriceps line was drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella for the quadriceps portion placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A surface electrode for the VMO was placed with a medial inclination of 55&#x000b0; from the quadriceps line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The VLL electrode was placed 15 cm from the superior edge of patella at a lateral inclination of 13.6&#x000b0; and the VLO shows its superficial part around 2.2 cm of the lateralis epicondyle with a superficial length of around 8.9 cm with a 50.4&#x000b0; of lateral inclination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A ground electrode was placed over the tibial tubercle of the tested lower limb. The same investigator performed all electrode placements.</p><p>A calibrated Viking II with eight channels (Nicolet Biomedical Instruments) and a computer were used to collect all EMG data (CMRR of 110 dB, sampling 1000 Hz, gain 200, band pass filter of 10 to 1000 Hz). All signals were viewed on a display screen prior to collection to ensure that there were no visible artifacts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Following EMG preparation, the subjects were instructed to perform 3 repetitions of the following three sets of exercises: 1) MVIC knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of flexion in a seated position; 2) MVIC hip abduction at 0&#x000b0; of abduction, with patients in side-lying position with the knee in full extension; 3) MVIC hip abduction at 30&#x000b0; of abduction, with patients in side-lying position with the knee in full extension</p><p>During the MVIC knee extension test, the subjects were positioned seated in a leg extension machine (Queens, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, BRA) with the knee and hip at 90&#x000b0; of flexion and the ankle in a neutral position (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For the MVIC hip abduction (0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0;) tests, the subjects were positioned on their sides lying on a divan with the test lower limb placed above and with both lower limbs positioned at neutral hip and knee flexions, as measured by the investigator.

The results showed that no selective EMG activation was observed when comparison was made between the VMO, VLL and VLO muscles while performing MVIC knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of flexion or MVIC hip abduction at 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; of abduction for both male and female subjects. These results are in agreement with Hertel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] who investigated the EMG activity of the VMO, VLL and gluteus medius in eight healthy young adult volunteers with no history of knee injury while performing uniplanar knee extension, knee extension/hip adduction, knee extension/hip abduction and found no significant differences in the VMO/VL ratio between the exercises. It is well established in the literature that the isolation of any of the quadriceps components or selective strengthening is unlikely, especially concerning the VMO/VLL muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that hip abduction do not facilitated VLL and VLO activity in relation to the VMO in healthy subjects performing maximum voluntary isometric contraction.</p><p>We are unaware of any studies which have demonstrated the characteristics of EMG activity between VMO, VLL and VLO in subjects performing hip abduction in different positions.</p><p>The secondary purpose of the present work was investigating the EMG activity of the VMO, VLL and VLO while performing the three exercises tested. The results showed that the VLO presents a significantly different behavior compared with the VLL, whereas the VLO showed a similar motor unit recruitment to the VMO, producing higher EMG activity in MVIC knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of flexion compared with MVIC hip abduction at 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; of abduction. No significant differences were found in the EMG activity of the VLL among the three exercises tested, thus verifying that the VLL and VLO demonstrate not only anatomical but distinct motor unit recruitment characteristics. Bevilaqua-Grossi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] investigated the EMG activity of the VMO, VLL and VLO muscles in 21 healthy subjects performing open kinetic chain knee extension at 15&#x000b0; and 90&#x000b0; of flexion. The results showed that the VLO and VMO were more active at 90&#x000b0; of flexion compared with the higher activity of the VLL at 15&#x000b0; of flexion, demonstrating that the VMO and VLO muscle have the same behavior suggesting a synchronic antagonist stability role of the patella in healthy people. The striking difference between VLL and VLO behavior concerning the EMG activity observed, could be because the VLL fiber alignment tends to traction the patella, offering greater contribution to knee extension than patella stabilization, different from the VLO which spirally and inclination fibers in relation to femoral dyaphisis promotes patella alignment associated with the VMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]</p><p>Hertel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that both the VMO and VL are more activated in uniplanar knee extension when compared with knee extension/hip adduction or abduction. These results are not entirely supported by our results, in which the VLL showed no significant differences between MVIC knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of flexion compared with MVIC hip abduction at 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0;. These conflicting results concerning the VLL recruitment pattern may be because these authors tested the exercises in closed kinetic chain while the three exercises tested in the current work were performed in open kinetic chain.</p><p>Possible limitations of this study may be related to the non collection of gluteus medius EMG activity during the three exercises tested. Normalization methods using other types of muscle contractions or other angles of the knee joint may result in different VMO/VLL/VLO ratios between studies that use different methods of normalization. The absence of increased EMG activity with hip abduction could have been due limitations in EMG recordings from MVCs. Results might be different when studying submax voluntary contractions. Although normalized EMG data are useful in measuring relative levels of activity between muscles, such information is not indicative of muscular strength or muscular balance [58].</p><p>Future studies of this research group will focus on subjects with patellofemoral pain and investigate the recruitment patterns provided from such subjects performing the same task.</p><sec><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Bevilaqua-Grossi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] dissected the thighs of 32 human cadavers and determined the anatomical organizations of the VLL and VLO muscles. The distal fibers of the VLO were interdigitated with the lateral retinaculum and the iliotibial tract in all specimens, which subsequently joined in a common tendon with the VLL on the superolateral border of the patella. These results agree with previous anatomical studies which describe the origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and insertion of these muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, tightness of the lateral retinaculum, perhaps as a result of increased tension in the iliotibial tract, could potentially alter the tracking of the patella in the trochlear groove, becoming an important factor in the etiology of patellofemoral pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Following this theory, some clinicians contraindicate rehabilitation exercises using hip abduction in patients with patellofemoral complaints based on the premise of avoiding excessive tightness of the lateral structures or a VLL and VMO imbalance, since the anatomical origin of the iliotibial tract has a close relation with the iliotibial band and the gluteus medius muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This theory is not supported by recent works which investigated the role of pelvic control as a contributing factor in the development of anterior knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Ireland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], using hand held dynamometers, investigated hip abduction and external rotation isometric strength in 15 female patients with patellofemoral pain compared with a control group. They found significant weakness of the hip abductors and external rotators of the patellofemoral pain group. It is postulated that in the absence of pelvic control due to hip abductor and external rotator weakness, the femur may adduct and internally rotate, further increasing lateral patellar contact pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These findings suggest that hip abduction exercises may be indicated and necessary for patients with patellofemoral pain who present absence of satisfactory pelvic control.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results showed that no selective EMG activation was observed when comparison was made between the VMO, VLL and VLO muscles while performing MVIC at 30&#x000b0; and 0&#x000b0; of hip abduction and 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion for both male and female subjects. Our findings demonstrate that hip abduction do not facilitated VLL and VLO activity in relation to the VMO, however, this study included only healthy subjects performing maximum voluntary isometric contraction contractions, therefore much remains to be discovered by future research</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dye</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The pathophysiology of patellofemoral pain</article-title><source>Presented at 48th Annual National Athletic Trainers Association Meeting; June 19, 1997; Salt Lake City, US</source></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilk</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinold</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Principles of patellofemoral rehabilitation</article-title><source>Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy Review</source><year>2001</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>325</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/00132585-200110000-00010</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stokes</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Investigation of quadriceps inhibition: implications for clinical practice</article-title><source>Physiotherapy</source><year>1984</year><volume>70</volume><fpage>425</fpage><lpage>28</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hertel</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Earl</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>KKW</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Combining isometric knee extension exercises with hip adduction or abduction does not increase quadriceps EMG activity</article-title><source>Br J Sports Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>210</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15039261</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bjsm.2002.003277</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moller</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name><name><surname>Krebs</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Tidemand-Dal</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Isometric contractions in the patellofemoral pain syndrome.
