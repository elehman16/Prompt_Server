The success in healthy adult patients has led to the introduction of more extensive endoscopic procedures in older and sicker patients, as well as in pregnant and pediatric patients. Despite the potential advantages, Laparoscopic procedures are associated with physiological hemodynamic changes and life-threatening complications such as regurgitation of the gastric contents and potential aspiration due to physiological changes associated with pneumoperitoneum that are usually not encountered with the conventional open procedure. As a result, anesthetic techniques for Laparoscopic surgery have been refined to anticipate these differences from open surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Maintenance of a patent airway remains an important concern of an anesthesiologist.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Even though the time tested and excellent airway securing device, i.e., the Endotracheal Tube (ETT), is available at all times, it too has its demerits. Morbidities such as trauma to the vocal cords and structures of the oral cavity, pressor response, and sore throat are worrisome to the anesthesiologist. This led to the use of supraglottic devices such as ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) for Laparoscopic surgeries.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>PLMA is a double-lumen, double-cuff LMA. The double-tube design separated the respiratory and the alimentary tracks providing a separate passage for the regurgitated fluids. Furthermore, the double cuff provided a better seal around the glottis, thus providing an option of administering intermittent positive-pressure ventilation[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] These properties increase the suitability to use PLMA in patients who are more prone to aspiration of regurgitated fluids.</p><p>The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of PLMA with ETT in patients undergoing Laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>After obtaining approval from Ethical Committee, sixty patients were chosen who were scheduled to undergo elective Laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia. The duration of this study was 1 year. Written informed consents were obtained from the patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I and II, aged 18&#x02013;60 years. Patients were excluded if they had a mouth opening &#x0003c;2 cm, anticipated difficult airway, ASA Physical Status III or IV, body mass index &#x0003e;30 kgm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, upper respiratory tract infection, increased risk of aspiration (gastroesophageal reflux disorder, hiatus hernia, and pregnancy), cervical spine fracture, or instability. The patients were randomly divided into two groups (according to a computer generated plan) &#x02013; thirty patients to the ProSeal group (Group S) and thirty patients to the ETT group (Group C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study procedure</title><p>A thorough preanesthetic checkup was performed 1 day before the day of the surgery. All patients were given tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally at bedtime on the previous night of surgery and kept nil per oral for 12 h before surgery. After the patient was shifted to operation theater, standard monitors such as pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure, and three-lead electrocardiogram were connected. Intravenous (IV) access was gained with 18-gauge cannula and Ringer's lactate infusion was started. The patients were given injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, injection midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV, injection fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV, injection ondansetron 4 mg IV, and injection pantoprazole 40 mg IV and then preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Anesthesia was induced with injection propofol 2.5 mg/kg IV, and injection atracurium 0.75 mg/kg IV was used to achieve neuromuscular blockade. The patients were ventilated for 3 min with oxygen and isoflurane 0.8%, and the device was inserted by trained anesthesia providers with significant experience and expertise in insertion.</p><p>

Once confirmed, positive-pressure ventilation was started with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Closed circuit breathing system with soda lime was used.

If more than three attempts were required for device insertion, the patient was excluded from the study as repeated laryngoscopic response may alter the hemodynamic parameters under study.</p><p>Ease of insertion of the device was noted.</p><p>Ryle's tube was inserted.

IV crystalloids were administered after calculating fluid requirements according to Holliday-Segar formula. CO<sub>2</sub> pressures and flow rates were monitored and ranged between 10 and 15 mmHg and 200 and 400 ml/min, respectively, in all cases.</p><p>Heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure were recorded before induction, at 1 and 5 min after the insertion of the device, during CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation, every 15 min interval throughout surgery, and then 5 min after removal of airway device.</p><p>ETCO<sub>2</sub> values were monitored similarly.</p><p>Intraoperative complications such as regurgitation-aspiration, hypoxia, hypercarbia, bronchospasm, airway obstruction, gastric insufflation, and pneumothorax were looked for.</p><p>At the completion of surgery, isoflurane was stopped. Residual paralysis was reversed with injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg. Postoperative analgesia was administered with IV injection diclofenac sodium 75 mg as infusion.</p><p>The device was removed after thorough Ryle's tube and oral suction.
