Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant is an important option for add-on therapy in major depression. There is insufficient data on mirtazapine in Indian population; hence this study was designed to study the add-on effect of low-dose mirtazapine with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in major depressive disorder (MDD) in Indian population.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In an open, randomized study, 60 patients were divided into two groups. In Group A (<italic>n</italic>=30) patients received conventional SSRIs for 6 weeks. In Group B (<italic>n</italic>=30) patients received conventional SSRIs with low-dose mirtazapine for 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was significant improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) scores (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in both groups. Mirtazapine in low dose as add on therapy showed improvement in scores, had earlier onset of action, and more number of responders and remitters as compared to conventional treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). No serious adverse event was reported in either of the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Low-dose mirtazapine as add-on therapy has shown better efficacy, earlier onset of action and more number of responders and remitters as compared to conventional treatment in MDD in Indian patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Add-on</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>mirtazapine</kwd><kwd>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Depression is one of the leading causes of global disease burden and disability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The consequences of underreporting of depression and lack of treatment for it are enormous. For instance, depression is the most important risk factor for suicide, which claims around 0.85 million lives annually, and is among the top three causes of death in young people ages 15-35.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The current modalities of treatment for depression include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCAs and MAOIs are not preferred these days because of their adverse effect profile and dangerous food interactions respectively. SSRIs are presently the most widely used antidepressants because of their better safety and tolerability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Many current therapies for depression provide remission in only approximately one-third of patients and few have complete resolutions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] These antidepressant medications also have a delayed onset of therapeutic effect. This latency is problematic in that it prolongs the impairments associated with depression, leaves patients vulnerable to an increased risk of suicide, increases the likelihood that a patient will prematurely discontinue therapy and increases medical costs associated with severe depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Thus, there is continuous search for newer novel compounds that have better efficacy or can augment the effect of conventional antidepressants in these patients.</p><p>Mirtazapine, an atypical antidepressant is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NASSA) and is structural analogue of serotonin with potent antagonistic effects at several postsynaptic serotonin receptor types (including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors) and can produce gradual down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors. It also limits the effectiveness of inhibitory &#x003b1;2 adrenergic heteroceptors on serotonergic neurons as well as inhibitory &#x003b1;2 autoreceptors and 5-HT2A heteroceptors on noradrenergic neurons. This effect may enhance release of amines and contribute to the antidepressant effects. Mirtazapine is also a potent histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist and is relatively sedating. Mirtazapine appears to be useful in patients with depression who present with anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbance. Its additional beneficial effects on the symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance associated with depression may reduce the need for concomitant anxiolytic and hypnotic medication seen with some antidepressants. It has low potential for interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including antipsychotics, TCA and some SSRIs. It is also reported to be effective for augmentation or combination therapy in patients with refractory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] This makes mirtazapine an important option for the treatment of major depression in patients who require additional therapy. A few studies reported more number of responders at an earlier time period when mirtazapine was used as add on therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] However, most of the studies on mirtazapine as an add on therapy have been done on a small number of patients. This study is done to evaluate the effect of low-dose mirtazapine as add on therapy with SSRIs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Patients</title><p>This prospective, open, comparative, randomized, parallel group study was conducted in 60 patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) as per ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Patients were enrolled in the study after an informed written consent. Patients of both sexes between the ages of 18-75 years with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17 items) score &#x02265;18 were included in the study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The study plan was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.</p><p>Newly diagnosed patients, non-responders or partial responders to the earlier prescribed antidepressants and patients not tolerating earlier prescribed antidepressants were included in the study. Patients were screened at the beginning of the study. A detailed medical and psychiatry history was obtained. Mental status and physical examination was carried out. Patients with suicidal tendencies, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, concurrent major illness or systemic dysfunction involving hepatic and renal system were excluded. Pregnant women, lactating mothers and women not using contraceptives or desiring to have children were also excluded. Patients who qualified inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Medication</title><p>Patients were randomly divided into two groups using randomization table. Treatment in group A patients was started with SSRIs in the conventional dose range (escitalopram 10-30 mg, citalopram 20-60 mg, sertraline 50-150 mg, fluoxetine 20-40 mg, paroxetine 10-50 mg per day). Group B patients received SSRIs in the conventional dose range along with low-dose mirtazapine 7.5 mg per day. Both drugs were given either in single or divided doses based on the clinical improvement of the patient every week. Compliance was checked by pill count method. Record of concomitant medication was maintained throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Clinical Measurement and Safety Assessment</title><p>Primary outcome measure was changes in total score of HDRS. The HDRS scale is the most commonly used scale focusing on somatic symptomatology. A 17-item version is used with score range from 0-50. A score of &#x0003e;8 indicates depression whereas a score of &#x0003e;23 means severe depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Secondary outcome measures included reduction in the score of Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and Amritsar depressive Inventory (ADI).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The MADRS score is designed to be sensitive to assess treatment effects. It has 10 items of core symptoms of depressive illness. Each item has a score range of 0-6., a score of &#x0003e;12 indicates depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The ADI scores are brief and effective psychological tool, easy to administer, and consists of 30 items with a total score of 30. A score in range of 5-13 indicates reactive depression and a score between 14 and 23 indicates endogenous depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Scores were recorded at baseline and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks after the treatment. Time to onset of action was defined as 40% reduction in the scores as compared to baseline.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Response to drugs was defined as decrease in HDRS, MADRS and ADI score of &#x02265;50% from baseline. Remission was defined when the HDRS score was &#x02264;7 and MADRS score was &#x02264;12[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] in a patient. Safety evaluation was based on spontaneously reported adverse effects and duration of hospitalization in the two groups. Laboratory investigations and ECG examination was also done at baseline and at the end of study i.e., 6 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The data was expressed as Mean&#x000b1;Standard Error (SE). The primary statistical analysis was intention to treat (ITT) analysis for all safety and efficacy variables with the last observation being carried forward (LOCF) for those patients who had at least 2 weeks data. Results were analyzed using nonparametric tests (Chi-Square, Friedman two way analyses, Kruskal Wallis test) and parametric tests (two-tailed test was used for <italic>t</italic>-test analysis).

This is because nearly two-third of all patient are either partially or completely nonresponsive, only one-third experience full remission and many have tolerability concern that limit long-term treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Thus the development of new agents that can meaningfully expand the expected therapeutic effect and tolerability of antidepressant therapy is an important medical need.</p><p>Mirtazapine is a &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic antagonist produces a rapid increase in both noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission with enhance tonic activation of post synaptic serotonergic receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Mirtazapine has shown significant improvement in depressed patients with anxiety and insomnia, including decreased sleep-onset latency, deeper sleep and fewer awakenings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] It is effective for augmentation or combination therapy in patients with refractory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, low dose add on mirtazapine therapy was very effective in improving HDRS score in patients of major depression. Low dose add on mirtazapine therapy also significantly improved MADRS and ADI scores in these patients. These results are in agreement with earlier studies which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the total score on the HDRS-17 and nearly all secondary efficacy measures, including remission, MADRS and ADI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The response rate and number of remitters were significantly more with low dose add on mirtazapine therapy as compared to conventional therapy at the end of study. The HDRS-17 subset scores indicate that add on low-dose mirtazapine therapy was more effective in improving anxiety and somatic symptoms as compared to conventional therapy. These findings are in agreement with earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In this study, times to onset of action with low dose add on mirtazapine therapy, was earlier as compared to conventional therapy, with more responders at an earlier time period as seen with earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>The most common adverse effects reported in our study with add on mirtazapine therapy was somnolence, whereas in the conventional group patients reported with nausea and sexual dysfunction. The adverse effect does not seem to be due to combination of mirtazapine with conventional therapy as the common adverse event reported with conventional therapy is insomnia, so both groups differ with respect to adverse events.</p><p>These results confirm and extend earlier finding, that mirtazapine, a dual action antidepressant is an effective and safe antidepressant in Indian patients of major depressive disorder for short-term augmentation and may be of more clinical utility in alleviation of anxiety symptoms and improvement of quality of life associated with depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that both treatment groups showed significant decrease in HDRS, MADRS and ADI score in both groups as compared to baseline. However, patients treated with add on low-dose mirtazapine had earlier onset of action and more number of responders and remitters. None of the groups had severe adverse events. Long term studies may help us find out whether the adverse event documented could be present on long-term follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, add-on therapy with mirtazapine had earlier onset of action, better efficacy and more number of responders and remitters as compared to conventional therapy in MDD in Indian patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hyman</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Whiteford</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Jamison</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Breman</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Measham</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Alleyne</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Claeson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mental disorders</article-title><source>Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries</source><year>2006</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Oxford University Press for the World Bank</publisher-name><fpage>605</fpage><lpage>25</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>World Health Organization</article-title><source>Mental and behavioural disorders, department of mental health [Online]</source><year>2000</year><date-in-citation>Last cited in 2011</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
