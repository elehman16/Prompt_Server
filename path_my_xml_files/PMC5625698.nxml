To our knowledge, the effect of fatty fish intake on cognitive function in adolescents has not been investigated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) previously. The aim of the present trial was to investigate whether consumption of fatty fish meals three times per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks could alter attention performance in adolescents compared to similar meals with meat or n-3 LCPUFA supplements.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In the Fish Intervention Studies-TEENS (FINS-TEENS), adolescents from eight secondary schools (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;426; age: 14-15y) were individually randomized. Attention performance was assessed with the d2 test of attention. Differences between groups from pre to post intervention were assessed with linear mixed effect models and general estimates equation. The fish group was set as reference. Dietary compliance was recorded for each meal throughout the trial and controlled for in the adjusted analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The improvement in processing speed was significantly lower in the meat (&#x02212;11.8; 95% CI: -23.3, &#x02212;0.4) and supplement (&#x02212;13.4; 95% CI: -24.9, &#x02212;1.8) group compared to the fish group (reference). The supplement group also showed inferior improvement in total performance (&#x02212;10.4; 95% CI: -20.0, &#x02212;0.7) compared to the fish group (reference). The results were slightly affected when controlling for dietary compliance. Omission errors decreased in the meat group compared to the fish group (Incidence rate ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.98), but the difference disappeared when controlling for dietary compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We observed a small beneficial effect of fatty fish, compared to meat meals and supplements on processing speed. However, these results are difficult to interpret due to low dietary compliance. This study shows that different taste preferences among participants is challenging in intervention trials with food. A prospective cohort design may be a better alternative when studying diet in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02350322">NCT02350322</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12937-017-0287-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fatty fish</kwd><kwd>Omega-3 fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Meat</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Supplements</kwd><kwd>Food</kwd><kwd>Dietary intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF) </institution></funding-source><award-id>900842</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par23">Subtle alterations in the diet have the potential to influence cognitive function in humans, even in industrialized countries where the food-availability is good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most studies have focused on the role of nutrition in early childhood when brain development is at its peak and particularly sensitive to insults due to dietary deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the brain continues to develop during adolescence, and relatively little is known about the role of nutrition on cognitive function in adolescents from mainstream school populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A growing body of evidence suggests that an adequate intake of the omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) is of importance for brain development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This association is plausible, since eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are important structural components of neural cell membranes. They influence the brain through membrane fluidity, myelination and neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, the dietary intake of n-6 fatty acids is in excess in the European population, introducing a potential imbalance between the n-6 and n-3 PUFAs in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not found evidence that n-3 PUFA supplementation impacts cognition in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The results are also inconclusive in healthy adolescents, and two independent RCTs found no benefit of supplementing with DHA alone or DHA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;EPA on cognitive performance in schoolchildren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Fish consumption in adolescents has been associated with better school achievements and performance in cognitive tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One RCT found improved reading performance after a school meal intervention including fish approximately once a week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Fatty fish like mackerel, herring and salmon is the dominant dietary source of n-3 LCPUFAs, but these species also contain other micronutrients considered important for the brain, e.g. vitamin D, iodine, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The diet of Norwegian adolescents contains little fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that an increased intake of fatty fish could be more beneficial compared to an intake of meat, and potentially also compared to an intake of supplements with n-3 LCPUFAs. To our knowledge, no RCTs have previously addressed the specific impact of eating fish on cognition in adolescents.</p><p id="Par26">The aim of the present RCT was to investigate whether fatty fish meals three times per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks altered attention performance in adolescents (14&#x02013;15 y), compared to similar meals with meat or supplements with n-3 LCPUFAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and ethics</title><p id="Par27">Fish Intervention Studies-TEENS (FINS-TEENS) was conducted at eight lower secondary schools in Bergen, Norway, between February and May 2015.

Thus, all pupils at 9<sup>th</sup> grade received invitation to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were allergy or intolerance to the study food or supplements. The random allocation was performed individually stratified by sex. Two researchers, (one blinded), assigned every enrolled girl and boy to either the fish, meat or supplement group by drawing lots. Researchers and participants were not blinded to treatment conditions in the present study, but the d2 test of attention was scored blinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dietary intervention procedure</title><p id="Par30">The meals and supplements were delivered to participants at school during their habitual lunch break (usually between 11:00&#x000a0;a.m. and noon). The participants ate together in their respective classrooms. The fish- and meat meals replaced the participants&#x02019; habitual school lunch, whereas participants in the supplement group continued to eat their habitual lunch in addition to consume the supplements. Participants received the meals or supplements three times per week for 12&#x000a0;weeks. The school lunch in Norway usually consists of a packed lunch from home, containing medium dark or dark bread or crispbread with meat, cheese or liver pate as spread, and sometimes a fruit or vegetable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">The fish- and meat meals were prepared by catering service. Meals in the fish group contained salmon, mackerel and herring, whereas the meals in the meat group contained chicken, turkey, beef, lamb and cheese. Halal meat was provided on request and pork meat was not used in the trial. The meals were similar in content except from the meat and fish, and contained vegetables and/or salad and mainly wholegrain pasta-, focaccia-, baguette- or tortilla and sometimes dressing. Gluten free products were provided on request for gluten sensitive participants, but those with celiac disease were excluded from the trial because 100% gluten-free meals could not be guaranteed. The weekly content of n-3 LCPUFAs was matched between the supplement and fish group by using a mean of 90&#x000a0;g fish per serving as reference to determine the number of capsules, which were seven per serving. The supplements were bought at a public pharmacy and each capsule contained 500&#x000a0;mg of concentrated fish oil, of which 158&#x000a0;mg was EPA, 105&#x000a0;mg was DHA and 13&#x000a0;mg was docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (Nycoplus&#x000ae; Omega-3, 500&#x000a0;mg, Takeda Nycomed, Asker, Norway). The meals had a mean weight of 230&#x000a0;g/portion and the meals in the fish group contained on average 2.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/100&#x000a0;g of vitamin D, 4.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/100&#x000a0;g of iodine, 152.3&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;g EPA, 262.3&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;g DHA and 39.9&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;g DPA.

Thus, pre and post data from the d2 test of attention were available for 426 (86%) participants, on which the final data analyses were conducted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Drop-outs and participants lost to follow up did not differ from completers in any of the baseline characteristics (data not shown).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart over participants. n-3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;omega-3</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2017_287_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The intervention lasted for 3 months and included fish approximately once per week. Contrary to our results, no effects were observed on neither TN nor TN-E compared to the control group. They found that the percentages of E1 and E2 errors were higher after the intervention compared to the control period, when the children ate their usual packed lunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, this is not in accordance with the decrease in E1 errors that we found in the meat group in the present study. Our findings in TN (and TN-E, which seems to be driven by TN) suggests that there could be a link between fish intake and the speed of processing information. To our best of knowledge, no other RCTs have examined the effects of fish intake on attention or processing speed in healthy young subjects. However, although not directly comparable to our sample of adolescents, two cross-sectional studies in middle-aged adults (45&#x02013;70 y, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1613) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and elderly (70-74y, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2031) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported positive associations between fish consumption and cognitive speed, motor speed and attention.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] used questionnaire data from male respondents in the same study and linked them with records on intelligence test performance at age 18, collected at the Swedish Military Conscription Register (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3972). These data showed that fish consumption at age 15 was positively associated with higher performances in the domains &#x02018;combined intelligence&#x02019;, &#x02018;verbal performance&#x02019; and &#x02018;visuospatial performance&#x02019; at age 18, irrespective of educational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Finally, De Groot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found no association between fish consumption and attention <italic>problems</italic>, which cannot be directly compared to the d2 test of attention measure, in Dutch adolescents (12&#x02013;18 y, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;700). However, they found an inverted u-shape association between fish intake and more advanced vocabulary and higher end term grades, showing that eating fish was beneficial, but eating more fish than recommended (defined as ~450&#x000a0;mg/d EPA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;DHA) no longer seemed to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">We did not have a pure placebo group, and thus, it is not possible to separate the effects of the intervention from a learning effect that may have occurred from conducting the same test twice. However, since a learning effect should be equally distributed in the groups, the effect of one intervention over the other(s) should be detectable when comparing the groups against each other. Our results are difficult to interpret, because the beneficial effect in the fish group on TN and TN-E was observed even among those with very low dietary compliance. This makes it difficult to conclude on the relationship between fish intake and performance in TN and TN-E. The significant decrease of omission (E1) errors in the meat group compared to fish in the crude analyses is also inconclusive, because it disappeared when adjusting for dietary compliance.</p><p id="Par57">There were no effects on the d2 test in the supplement group which is interesting, because of the relatively good dietary compliance in this group, and the documented roles of n-3 LCPUFAs in brain development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous studies also report inconsistent effects of supplementing with n-3 LCPUFAs on cognitive outcomes in healthy school-aged children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As stated in the meta-analysis by Mazereeuw et al., the contradictory findings in RCTs with n-3 LCPUFA supplements could be due to methodical heterogeneities in the dose, sample size, duration, or the cognitive tests used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The dose of n-3 LCPUFAs used in the present study was smaller compared to most of the previous studies with supplements, because of our aim to keep the dose equal in the fish and supplement group. The superior effect of fish meals compared to the n-3 LCPUFA supplements could also be due to differences in bioavailability. The n-3 LCPUFAs in fatty fish are bound to phospholipids and triacylglycerol in a 40:60 ratio, whereas n-3 LCPUFAs in most supplements are usually exclusively bound to triacylglycerol, which is assumed to be less bioavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As mentioned in the introduction, it could be that the discrepancy between the results in the fish and supplement group in this study were due to additional nutrients, or the combination of nutrients found in fatty fish and not n-3 LCPUFAs alone.</p><p id="Par58">Our results should give implications for future research by shifting the focus from the roles of single nutrients to the roles of food and dietary patterns, reflecting the complexity of diet and eating behavior. These results emphasize the importance of monitoring adherence to protocol in dietary intervention trials, as the records clearly show that interventions with pills or supplements are less demanding for participants compared to interventions with food. The adolescents&#x02019; habitual diet was low in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which probably increased the importance of quality and tastiness of the meals even more to ensure acceptable compliance. We had to serve the meals cold due to practical causes, which could be the main reason for the low dietary compliance observed in the fish group. It should be discussed further whether the RCT design is the most appropriate when studying the effects of diet and intake of foods. Perhaps a prospective cohort study using validated dietary assessment tools and school derived grade-levels as a generalizable outcome could be more appropriate to investigate the relationship between diet and cognition in healthy school children- and adolescents.</p><p id="Par59">The main limitations with the present study are, as previously mentioned, the low dietary compliance particularly observed in the fish group, the lack of a placebo group and the ceiling effect in the reading and spelling test &#x0201c;Kartleggeren&#x0201d;, which left us with only one cognitive outcome. In addition, the duration of 12&#x000a0;weeks might have been too short, but in practice, it is difficult to conduct this type of study for very much longer due to how the schools are organized with several holidays during the year. Even though the study sample was large and derived from nearly all boroughs, generalizability is compromised by the restricted area of Bergen (277,000 inhabitants). In addition, the proportion of university/college education was higher among the responding caregivers than in the general Norwegian population of 30&#x02013;59&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], however adjusting for parental education did not affect the results. It was not possible to blind the participants in this trial, but it was communicated that the aim was to investigate school meals in general and not fish, as an attempt to avoid performance bias. Although the recording of dietary compliance is a strength, it is limited by the fact that it was estimated by eye rather than using an objective measure such as weighing out food portions. An important strength is that we succeeded to administer the cognitive tests at the same time of day, and with the same researchers at each school, which increases internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The registration of dietary compliance is also an important strength. In addition, as the aim was to include a representable sample of adolescents, the study did not exclude those with cognitive disorders or those who already took n-3 supplements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">We observed a small beneficial effect of fatty fish, compared to meat meals and supplements on processing speed compared to intakes of similar meals with meat or n-3 LCPUFA supplements. However, the group differences were small and difficult to interpret due to low dietary compliance. Thus, more studies are needed to understand the implication of our results. This study shows that different taste preferences among participants is challenging in intervention trials with food. A prospective cohort design may be a better alternative when studying diet and cognitive outcomes in the future.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par68">
