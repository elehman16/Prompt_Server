This study examined the effectiveness of home-telemonitoring surveillance with nurse coaching for self-management to improve lung cancer outcomes in mountainous Appalachia where health care access/ service is limited. This randomized clinical trial pilot study compared patient outcomes for telemonitoring versus routine care. A convenience sample (<italic>N</italic> = 47) was enrolled/ randomized (Telemonitored: 26/ Control: 21) from a university hospital and cancer center. Physiologic parameters and symptoms were collected in the telemonitored group for two weeks; all participants were studied for 60 days after the index treatment/ discharge. The telemonitored group showed greater improvement for both functional status (<italic>Wald X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 3.78, <italic>p</italic> = .05) and quality of life (QOL) (<italic>Wald X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 7.25, <italic>p</italic> = .007) from baseline to 60 days post-discharge. Compared to controls, telemonitored patients survived longer; had more scheduled medical visits (96% vs. 75%); made more unplanned calls to doctors/ nurses (32% vs. 30% &#x00026; 64% vs. 50%); had fewer rehospitalizations (28% vs. 40%); and had more ER utilization (36% vs. 30%). The telemonitored group had relative improvements for health utility (.09 on a scale where 0 = death/ 1= perfect health) and QOL (15 on 0&#x02013;100 VAS). Differences in health care utilization and cost were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; .05), likely due to the sample size. Telemonitoring group satisfaction with care was high and recommended by patients and caregivers. Results suggest that it is possible to improve patient outcomes with home-telemonitoring for self-management in rural areas. Short-term, telemonitoring-based coaching is feasible and offers a promising option to develop patient self-management knowledge and skills.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Home-Telemonitoring</kwd><kwd>Lung Cancer</kwd><kwd>Appalachia</kwd><kwd>Self-Management</kwd><kwd>Randomized Clinical Trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In 2016 lung cancer caused 26&#x02013;27% of all cancer deaths in the United States (U.S.), consistently more than any other cancer for both men and women for the past two decades [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Patients with lung cancer and their family caregivers frequently experience unmet needs and lack supportive care. Learning to deal with complex cancer symptoms during their disease trajectory is a challenge. There is a critical need for low-cost interventions to assist patients with self-management in their residential community. Applying appropriate home-health technology can be key to helping rural dwelling patients and caregivers to develop self-management skills needed to live with their diseases [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The literature supports several benefits identified by patients and family caregivers using home monitoring devices: early detection of physical changes, problem-solving self-management using available telemonitor data, and improved communication between health care providers and patients [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Telehealth/telecare has been evolving as a helpful influence applied to current health care systems, policies and practices [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

However, telehealth outcomes have been inconclusive due to a lack of robust research designs as well and broad descriptions of approaches being applied [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, limited evidence is reported for telehealth in oncology, especially studies focused on the first two weeks following hospital/initial cancer therapy discharge, before scheduled follow-up visits &#x02013; a critical symptom-management time. There were no identified studies using home-telemonitor data to inform nurse-coaches and educate adults with lung cancer.</p><p id="P5">In this pilot study that was preceded by a feasibility study [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the objective was to assess the design, implementation and challenges of conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of home-telemonitoring surveillance to develop self-management skills that could improve outcomes for Appalachian adults with lung cancer. The intervention included nurse coaching to help patients proactively manage their multifaceted conditions. The specific aims were to (1) describe changes in physiological measurements and subjective symptoms over 14 days following discharge in the telemonitored group; (2) identify differences in functional status, quality of life (QOL), and satisfaction with home telemonitor-based education for self-management; and (3) analyze differences in nurse/physician contact, health care utilization, and costs between groups. Patients with lung cancer were hypothesized to improve self-reporting signs/symptoms to their clinicians and decrease use of costly health care resources over 60 days after receiving home-telemonitoring surveillance and post-discharge nurse coaching. We anticipated telemonitors would provide early evidence of disease-related changes that could be recognized by patients and relayed to clinicians before patients reached a critical stage.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Conceptual Framework</title><p id="P6">The study&#x02019;s conceptual framework was derived from the Chronic Care Model (CCM) for evaluating &#x0201c;patient-centered&#x0201d; health outcomes, functional status, QOL, satisfaction with care, and decreased use of health care services [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Health outcomes could be impacted by interactions among nurses, patients, clinicians, and patient&#x02019;s self-management. The model&#x02019;s &#x0201c;community resource system&#x0201d; intervention strategy was a program of support that involved nurse-guided education and coaching (decision support). Coaching helped patients acquire knowledge needed to recognize critical changes in physical signs and symptoms and to adopt associated behaviors to &#x0201c;adjust their roles&#x0201d; (to contact clinicians) for optimal function, control of their symptoms, and improvement of their well-being. Patient factors, including age, disease severity (cancer stage), pain, dyspnea, and comorbidity were collected from the hospital/cancer center&#x02019;s electronic medical records. The CCM provided a structured framework to guide the study in bridging the community, hospital, and health system to improve patient-centered outcomes of cancer care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P7">This study examined the effectiveness of a home telemonitoring system to aid patients discharged with lung cancer in understanding how and when to contact clinicians and avoid rehospitalization.

In 2012, a total of 268 potential patients from a teaching hospital/oncology care center in north-central WV were referred and then screened. The majority (&#x0003e; 90%) of the study patients resided in non-metropolitan areas defined as rural Appalachian communities outside the city of Morgantown, including areas in WV, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Inclusion criteria were (1) hospitalized due to lung cancer with discharge to home, or having active cancer treatment for lung cancer as a primary or secondary diagnosis; (2) between 45 and 90 years old; (3) cognitively alert; and (4) able to speak English. Patients were excluded if they were discharged with hospice care or lived outside a 75-mile radius from the study hospital. As reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, approximately 50 percent of the referrals were disqualified/excluded, and 135 qualified for the study. Of the eligible referrals, 55 patients (40.7%) refused to participate for personal/ family reasons; nine were discharged prior to consent; 14 died in hospital; and 57 consented. The study initially studied 10 non-randomized feasibility patients whose data were published previously [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The 47 remaining participants were randomly assigned to either the usual care control or telemonitor intervention group and included in the final analyses (usual care controls: 21; telemonitored: 26). By the end of the study, eight patients had died, and 15 others withdrew from the study.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Telemonitoring Intervention</title><p id="P9">The study intervention used a wireless, in-home telemonitoring system (Honeywell HomMed Genesis&#x02122; DM) and patient-centered phone coaching by nurses in addition to post-discharge usual care (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Objectives of the telemonitoring surveillance were to use nurse coaching based on the data to help patients (1) lengthen periods out of hospital; (2) support self-management of disease-related conditions (e.g. lung cancer and comorbidity symptoms, medications) using home oxygen, medications, and/or problem-solving; (3) reduce unplanned hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits; (4) decrease overall health care costs; and (5) improve patient functional status and quality of life.</p><p id="P10">An eight-hour equipment training course was delivered to all research team members by Honeywell HomMed, Inc. Clinical assessment modules and symptom questions for the population under study were then customized and built into each device as well as into the LifeStream&#x02122; software platform. The surveillance design included placement of a telemonitor in each intervention patient&#x02019;s home post-discharge from hospital or cancer clinic, to be used with nurse coaching for two weeks before scheduled follow-up clinician visits. Patients&#x02019; physiologic parameters and symptoms were measured on a daily basis for 14 days. Intervention patients were scheduled to transmit telemonitored data to the study office each morning to ensure consistency of data collection. In addition to their morning monitoring, they were free to use the device anytime if they felt a need for immediate measurement. Research nurses read the data received daily through the LifeStream&#x02122; platform and called patients to interpret results using a questioning/coaching technique as needed. Telemonitored data alerted nurses to changes in patients&#x02019; daily conditions. Nurses explained changes in physiological signs and symptoms and, based on motivational interview training, coached patients on how to problem solve and when to contact their oncology clinicians. The daily monitoring protocol design also provided early evidence of disease-associated changes. Thus, patients were coached to develop self-management skills and relay recognized changes to their clinician before they became critical. More detail on the telemonitoring process itself is described in the previous feasibility study publication [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Data Collection</title><p id="P11">A total of five data collection time-points were used for both study groups: Time 1 (T1)&#x02013; a hospital/clinic visit for enrollment; Time 2 (T2)&#x02013; a home visit within 48&#x02013;72 hours of discharge; Time 3 (T3)&#x02013; a home visit at 14 days; Time 4 (T4)&#x02013; a phone call follow-up at 30-days; and Time 5 (T5)&#x02013; a home visit at 60 days post-discharge. The telemonitored group received 14 days of home-telemonitoring and nurse coaching following the hospital/ clinic discharge. The control group had usual care as ordered in their discharge plan which might include home health care services and office/ clinic scheduled visits, plus the data-collection home visits/ phone calls for collecting study data. During the study time periods, data collection was continuously monitored. Inter-rater reliability &#x0003e; 90% between data collectors was maintained throughout the study. Total one-year health care costs were obtained through hospital/outpatient administrative systems for each patient participant.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Measurement of Variables</title><p id="P12">Independent variables were study groups, patient demographics, and physiologic baseline measures. Physiologic measurements were collected to detect changes in an individual&#x02019;s day-to-day condition of chronic and progressive symptoms that could impact activities of daily living. Daily telemonitored data for intervention participants included objective parameters (temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, weight, and SpO<sub>2</sub>) and 10 subjective symptom assessments as shortness of breath, cough, tiredness, limited activity, nausea/ vomiting, pain, chest pain, standing/ walking, appetite, and anxiety in comparisons of today with yesterday. Telemonitor variables were also collected by research nurses for both groups at all study data time points, except T4.</p><p id="P13">Patient outcomes were measured by functional status (the short-form Pulmonary Functional Status Scale; PFSS-11), quality of life (the WHO-5 Well-Being Index; WHO-5), satisfaction with telemonitor care, and utilization of health care resources. The PFSS-11 assesses daily activities, social and psychological functional status [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The WHO-5 was developed to indicate an individual&#x02019;s well-being and reflect depressive symptoms [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Its components include mental status, social relationships, environment, and self-perceived health status. All instruments had established high validity and reliability [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Patient/ family satisfaction with telecare was measured by an eight-item ordinal scale of perceived satisfaction from strongly disagree (dissatisfied) &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; to strongly agree (satisfied) &#x0201c;4&#x0201d; at T3 &#x02013;T5. A cooperative agreement with Honeywell allowed use of their telemonitor satisfaction survey for this study (calculated internal reliability Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of .86).</p><p id="P14">An investigator-developed outcome form, &#x0201c;health care resource utilization,&#x0201d; included data on frequency of clinician/ nurse contacts, physician office visits (scheduled or unscheduled), home care nurse visits (scheduled or unscheduled), rehospitalization, and ER visits. Health utility measures (EQ-5D index and one-year direct medical cost) were calculated to evaluate potential cost-effectiveness in comparison with usual care. The EQ-5D-3L (EuroQOL five dimensions with three level version) is a generic measure of health outcomes as well as health utility [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The utility score is widely used in economic analysis as the outcome for cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The score is an input to quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and is calculated as a combination of health attributes and quality of life (1&#x02013;100 rating scale of the EQ-VAS). The scoring algorithm of health attributes is generated as a single index value ranging from 0&#x02013;1 (zero (0) = death and 1 = perfect health) [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The extent of direct health care service costs for patients throughout the entire study, 60 days, was approximated by analyzing one-year of hospital services in three sections: pre-study (six months), during the study (two months), and post-study (four months). Calculations used the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) national mean payment per day for type of service for 2011 (ER $1,354, observation $1,400, inpatient $2,420) as well as cost by type of care.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P15">The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 was used for data entry and analyses, with additional cost analyses completed using STATA standard package (version 13.1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stata.com">http://www.stata.com</ext-link>). Descriptive analyses were performed on baseline and clinical characteristics of the study groups, and two-sample t-test and chi-square were used to examine group differences. Telemonitored data were compared by means/percentages, and these parameter changes were observed over time for patterns by horizontal graphs. The intention-to-treat approach was applied including all randomly assigned participants in the final study analyses, regardless of missing outcome data, by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) method. The GEE was performed for longitudinal data analyses of correlated response estimates with missing values [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, the GEE method was used to examine the potential effect of home-telemonitoring on repeated patient outcomes at five time points across the two months of the study. To analyze the cost-effectiveness outcome, differences in health utility measures were evaluated by grouping Mann-Whitney tests at study time-points compared to baseline. We were unable to estimate cost-effectiveness ratios as we realized that the small group would make it challenging to calculate meaningful cost-effectiveness ratios. Analyses comparing costs before, during, and after the interventions were conducted using STATA. In addition, an exploratory analysis was conducted based on participants with compliance versus non-compliance to participation/ data reporting.

Although not statistically significant, of clinical significance was that the telemonitored compliant group had the least number of ER visits and rehospitalizations compared to the other three subgroups: telemonitored non-compliant, control compliant, and control non-compliant (ER visit: 29% &#x0003c; 30&#x02013;50%; rehospitalization: 18% &#x0003c; 40&#x02013;50%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; .05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">This pilot study aimed to assess the design, implementation and challenges of conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of home-telemonitoring surveillance to develop self-management skills that could improve outcomes for adults with lung cancer who live in remote/rural Appalachia. The challenge of enrollment and retention inhibited finding statistically significant differences in outcomes. Nevertheless, clinical significance supports future study. Study results indicated positive patient outcomes and decreased use of acute care services among compliant telemonitored patients compared to the group receiving routine care. Outcome improvements in this study included enhanced functional status and QOL, positive satisfaction with home-telemonitoring for self-management and lower acute-care utilization, as well as lower follow-up costs four months post-study compared to the six-month time period prior to the study.</p><p id="P24">Patient physiological and symptom measurements fluctuated with no significant difference throughout the two-week daily home-telemonitoring. Although the intervention group&#x02019;s subjective symptoms decreased at the end of telemonitoring, physical conditions such as dyspnea, coughing and activity limitation seemed to worsen over the following six weeks, likely due to the nature of the cancer disease prognosis itself. Perhaps of clinical significance, this deterioration was not statistically significant. This finding was congruent with the results of a recent RCT study with unsuccessful management to ease lung cancer symptom burden after undergoing weekly telephone monitoring for three months [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in other studies telemonitoring was helpful for improving cancer symptom reporting to clinicians using personal computer/tablets as well as increasing cancer treatment adherence and patients&#x02019; capability of self-management [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although telecare could contribute to a degree of cancer symptom control, the effects are not strong enough to overcome the morbidity of the disease itself in terms of patient and clinical outcomes.</p><p id="P25">Telemonitored participants, particularly those in the compliant subgroup, used acute care services less frequently than the control group. Acute-care usage declined as less expensive health care resources were accessed. With nurse coaching, telemonitored patients initiated more phone contact with primary health care providers. Based on telemonitor data, nurses coaching responses to variations in daily health status resulted in patients having an increased desire for contact with their clinician. Bowles and colleagues [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] similarly indicated that in-home nursing visits (5 vs. 4.2), longer home care episodes (54 vs. 35 days) and nurse contacts were significantly increased for tele-homecare versus usual care. Conversely, Shea and Chamoff [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found an inverse relationship between frequent remote patient-nurse communication and patient use of telemonitored data in their daily lives as they self-managed. Changes in signs/ symptoms were detectable through home-telemonitoring surveillance. Our study observed a favorable trend in the telemonitored compliant group of oncology Appalachians toward more positive outcomes than the control group. In respect to the study&#x02019;s patient outcomes, functional status and QOL for lung cancer telemonitored patients throughout 60 days following acute-care or outpatient services were steadily enhanced in contrast to the control group. Responses to telemonitoring in our study were consistent with the overall reports of systematic reviews [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar findings were also reported in other studies using comparable home telehealth programs among diverse patient populations [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Use of telemonitored data conveying sufficient and continued information can improve patients&#x02019; self-management behaviors in community sites [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. On the other hand, it could potentially prompt an overestimate of the actual need for health care, in turn, predisposing more frequent provider contact/ ER visits and jeopardizing the desired balance of cost-effectiveness. It is possible that use of additional health care resources may not have been initiated without patient self-management [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Daily monitoring of physiological parameters with nurse telephone coaching follow-up during the often unstable first two weeks post-hospitalization or post-clinical visit can be a cost-effective nursing approach in terms of patient survival [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Our study suggests that QOL for Appalachians with lung cancer in mountainous, rural settings can be improved, although overall costs might be higher. Higher costs must be interpreted with caution. Unlike previous studies [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], evidence of cost-saving by using the home-telemonitoring alone was restricted in its significance in this pilot. Study data, in fact, showed lower costs for the control group which could be explained by earlier deaths in this group of advanced cancer patients. Nevertheless, longer survival is more expensive for the health care system, and best practices for provision of health care services in remote areas remain unclear. Further study with long-term cost analyses is needed. Moreover, according to a systematic review by Polisena et al. [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a clear majority of home telehealth studies reported having reduced health care costs when telehealth is substituted for more expensive home care services, although two out of the 22 studies did not (one had increased costs and the other had no difference compared to usual care). Our study examined costs, clinical outcomes related to a specific disease, usual care as a comparator, and patients&#x02019; QOL that could be used to calculate QALYs in future studies. Because this was a pilot study, we did not estimate costs at a population level, include varied subject populations, or include marginal and sensitivity analyses. With a longer follow-up, health service costs could be further offset by decreased use of expensive hospital resources. On the other hand, if non-telemonitored patients die sooner than telemonitored patients, the conundrum of death actually lowering costs in the &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; group would continue. It remains to be decided if higher costs and higher QOL for patients with lung cancer may still indicate a reasonable tradeoff.</p><p id="P27">Receptiveness to telehealth care was strong and was perceived as beneficial by lung cancer patients and their families in this sample. Although conveying wireless data in mountainous remote surroundings was challenging, the feasibility of technology use and the at-home intervention protocol was confirmed and highly accepted. From the patients&#x02019; perspective, day-to-day monitoring was easy to use and empowered them with needed information to become more actively involved in managing their disease. Additionally, our data establishing satisfaction with telemonitoring was consistent with improved functional status and QOL. Although the positive patient outcomes found in our study are not evident in all other telemonitoring study results [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the high patient satisfaction findings are consistent with three studies using different types of telehealth technologies (telephone-based and internet/ email alert-based) for cancer interventions [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p id="P28">This pilot study had several limitations. Clearly, in this particular sample with a high critical illness status, we experienced unanticipated difficulty and challenges with enrollment, recruitment, and retention, resulting in a relatively small sample size and a large proportion of missing data over time. The intention-to-treat strategy was employed in dealing with missing data for statistical analysis, and as a pilot study, statistical power was not a major concern. However, high attrition would still have impacted the detection and interpretation of the intervention&#x02019;s appropriateness and effectiveness, similar to other studies with different patient characteristics [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our study findings indicated little strength in representing long-term clinical outcomes and intervention effects on cost. The long-term effect was not generalizable with two weeks of intervention surveillance and a two-month study follow-up. In addition, the cost calculation was conducted using primarily the cost of acute care services, including inpatient and scheduled cancer treatment/ checkups. Other intervention-associated expenditures or indirect costs, such as substituting telemonitor costs, for staff labor and travel time to patient homes were not considered, so a true cost-benefit analysis was not possible. Nevertheless, this pilot study builds a foundation for a future, larger RCT protocols to validate patient and clinical outcomes, particularly if an enrollment and retention research plan and strategies specific to this Appalachian patient group could be developed. In addition, further in-depth cost analysis is needed, including calculation of health care providers&#x02019; time and effort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P29">To our knowledge, this pilot is the first to implement a home-based telemonitoring surveillance program for patients diagnosed with lung cancer in mountainous, rural Appalachian settings. Our study findings suggest that telemonitored data can be used to guide care from a distance and educate these patients to develop self-management skills when living with lung cancer. Although conducting research in critically ill patients residing in remote Appalachian areas is culturally, as well as practically challenging, this home-telemonitoring surveillance study establishes a feasible and acceptable protocol to enhance traditional practice. Telemonitoring-based patient education offers a potentially promising option to encourage patients to develop self-managed individualized care at home, maintain their health status, and ultimately improve patient-centered outcomes. Future research is warranted and essential to confirm the positive findings and cost-effectiveness with statistical significance and identify barriers related to improving patient self-management for optimal clinical outcomes. As a final point, research associated with self-management should continue to focus on the disadvantaged and underserved populations living in remote territories to minimize health disparities.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><p id="P30"><bold>Acknowledgements and Declarations</bold></p><p id="P31"><bold>Funding Sources:</bold> This research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (No. 1R15CA150999-01) to Drs.
