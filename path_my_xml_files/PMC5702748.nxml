The vast majority of compression fractures in elderly patients are caused by low-energy trauma, and are stable because only the anterior column is involved.

In addition, we presumed that early ambulation to a toilet, thereby removing the absolute bed rest period, would be helpful for avoiding patient morbidity. Thus, this study was performed retrospectively to determine the success rate of our conservative treatment method for VCF and to find its prognostic factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient population and inclusion criteria</title><p>We retrospectively performed conservative treatment with the same protocol in 82 eligible patients with an osteoporotic compression fracture in a single center from March 2012 to August 2015. However, in this study, we only included patients with a single level VCF developed within 3 days and without a history of previous vertebra fracture treatment or the presence of medical comorbidity. The other inclusion criteria of patients were being aged more than 55 years old, the presence of localized back pain without any motor or sensory deficit correlated with magnetic resonance image (MRI), all agreed VCF with bone edema by a radiologist and a neurosurgeon with MRI, acute onset lower energy trauma, such as slip down or spontaneous back pain, visiting through the outpatient clinic or the emergency medical center, with a possible follow-up of more than 1 year. Patients whose T-score of bone mineral density (BMD) on spine was less than &#x02212;1.0 were included in this study.</p><p>High-energy trauma-suspected injuries, including traffic accidents, falling down from a high place, or an industrial accident, were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were medical comorbidity, the presence of coagulopathy, a systemic or local spine infection, a suspected pathologic fracture, the retropulsion of bony fragments, combined with another fracture, combined radiculopathy or myelopathy, previous VCF history with or without PVP, multiple compression fractures, impossible follow-up at 1 year, the presence of any psychiatric disorder, and difficulty in communicating. On the basis of those criteria, and after removing 7 patients whose follow-up was lost, 75 patients (22 male and 53 female) whose mean age was 70.5 years old were included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>An MRI was performed and admission and osteoporosis medication were recommended in all patients. We recommended at least 3 month corset application in all patients except four with thoracic lumbar orthosis (TLO) due to an above T8-level fracture. After admission, a transdermal fentanyl patch with a low dose (12.5 &#x000b5;g) application was attempted in all patients. A tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablet or an acetaminophen 250 mg, ibuprofen 200 mg, and codeine phosphate 10 mg combination tablet were prescribed as a pro re nata (PRN) oral medication. Patients were advised that side effects, such as nausea or dizziness, might develop because of the fentanyl patch. When such a side effect developed, even in the use of a low-dose fentanyl patch in 13 patients, we removed it from their medication and used only oral analgesics instead. After the low-dose fentanyl patch application, the patients were asked if there was a change in their pain numeric rating scale (NRS). If it decreased below 5 or was 50% below the initial NRS, we continued to use the low-dose fentanyl patch for 1 month. However, if the patient complained of sustained pain more than NRS 5% or 50% of the initial pain NRS, we increased the dose of the fentanyl patch by 25 &#x000b5;g. After identifying a tolerable toilet ambulation of the patient without any assistance, hospital discharge was recommended. We followed patients at the outpatient clinic over 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Although we tried to cut off the fentanyl patch after 1 month and prescribe only PRN oral analgesics during follow-up, five patients found it necessary to retain the patch for 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome analysis</title><p>We collected the pain NRS at the initial state, 3, 6, and 12 months and short form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) at initial state and 12 months.

Thus, we could achieve shorter hospital stay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) compared to a previous study despite similar clinical result.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref> In comparing our compression rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> to the previous study, our progression of the mean compression rate was nearly 10% and a little more progressive (10% vs. 7%).<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref> Although we agree that this might be caused by relatively early ambulation, we believe that its benefit to avoid complications related with longer bed rest weigh on a little more than subtle progression of compression rate.</p><p>Although analgesia (e.g. paracetamol, salicylates, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) has been recommended as a first-line medication, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and renal insufficiency should be taken into account when prescribing NSAIDs.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref> Opioids, such as oxycodone combined with paracetamol, can be administered for patients failing to obtain adequate relief from first-line medications. However, narcotics have significant side effects, including reduced gastrointestinal motility, urinary retention, reduced respiratory drive, and cognitive deficits with loss of balance, an increase in falls, and depression.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> Because of the development of those possible side effects, we had to recommend that all patients be admitted to the hospital and use individual fentanyl patches under careful monitoring. We could not use fentanyl patches on 13 patients because of nausea and dizziness; however, no patients had a reduction in respiratory drive. Previously, we have shown the efficacy and safety of fentanyl patch use in chronic pain.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> Fentanyl patch offers an interesting alternative to oral morphine, and its effectiveness and tolerability were demonstrated by several trials.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref> In general, fentanyl patch has the same adverse effects as other opioids, mainly sedation, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. In comparison with oral morphine, it causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. The risk of hypoventilation is comparatively low in patients with cancer. In addition to safety and our experience, the most important reason to choose fentanyl patches instead of other oral opioids was the convenience of changing them every 3 days. Because of a concern for safety, we did not want to increase the dose above 25 &#x000b5;g and the compliance of patients was good. Although the consideration of the abuse and addiction of fentanyl led us to stop it possibly up until 1 month's use, it was necessary to continue it for a relatively long duration (until 3 months) in five patients.</p><p>Wearing a brace is important in the conservative care of VCF. The primary goal of bracing is to reduce pain by stabilizing the spine and limiting progression of the kyphosis. Braces can help to reduce movement at the level of the fractured vertebra and thus allow bone healing. Moreover, bracing allows a reduction in the period of bed rest, facilitating earlier mobilization.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref> Although traditionally, the braces were three-point contact rigid plastic braces (e.g. the TLO or the lumbar sacral orthosis brace) were superiorly advocated,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref> some authors recommended a corset instead.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29)</xref> We only intended to improve the compliance of patients, due to lower compliance of uncomfortable bulky plastic brace.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></p><p>The indications for PVP, including kyphoplasty, remain controversial, but they can be an option in patients whose conservative treatment failed. The comparisons between these two procedures have remained equivocal, until now.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31)</xref> However, our results showed an unfavorable outcome in 18 patients (24%) after conservative treatment. Thus, we agree that some proportion of patients might be more favorable if we could perform PVP after the acute period. Considering the results of this study, as higher dose of fentanyl patch was associated with unfavorable outcome after the conservative treatment, the dose of fentanyl patch seems to be helpful in discriminating between favorable and unfavorable patients during the acute conservative treatment period. And this can help to make proper decision for whom PVP should be performed. The reason we suspected that the different dose of patch could discriminate an unfavorable outcome was that it depends on different pain sensitivity according to different people. A patient who is more sensitive to the pain might tend to get PVP at a different hospital or to complain of a longer period sustained pain.</p><p>Our study has several limitations, including a small patient population and no comparison group. Further well-designed comparative studies are necessary to show the efficacy of the fentanyl patch for the conservative treatment of VCF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed the outcomes of conservative treatment in the 75 VCF patients with use of the fentanyl patch as the first-line medication. Among the 75 patients, the clinical outcome of 57 (76%) was favorable, but in 18 (24%) was unfavorable. The only statistically significant prognostic factor for an unfavorable outcome was the use of a higher dose fentanyl patch.
