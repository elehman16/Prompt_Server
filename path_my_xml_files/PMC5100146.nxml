Eighty percent of UTIs are attributable to indwelling urinary catheter use.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Indwelling catheters are used routinely in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs), usually for frequent and accurate monitoring of urinary output. Approximately 15&#x02013;25% of hospitalized patients use a urinary catheter during their stay,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the majority of these patients are catheterized for 2&#x02013;4 days.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the US hospitals, the incidence rate of catheter-acquired urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) is approximately 1 million/year (or 3.1&#x02013;7.5 infections/1000 catheter days).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The cost of treating these infections is estimated at $400 million/year.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In Saudi Arabia, where the present study was conducted, the incidence rate is 8.18 CAUTI per 1000 catheter days for adult ICU units between 2004 and 2011.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The main causal agents of CAUTIs are commensal perineal flora although microbes acquired from other sources, such as hands from healthcare personnel, can also be responsible for the infection. Most CAUTIs are monomicrobial, commonly caused by <italic>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococci, Candida, Klebsiella</italic>, or <italic>Enterobacter</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In addition to pain and discomfort, CAUTIs cause prolongation of hospital stay by 1&#x02013;4 extra days and increased use of antibiotics, with consequent development of resistant microbial strains.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Moreover, CAUTIs can lead to cystitis, pyelonephritis, and in severe cases, end up in bacterial invasion of the bloodstream, i.e., bacteremia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Bacteremia, in turn, can result in septicemia and then septic shock, which has a relatively high mortality rate, underlining the importance of introducing treatment at an early stage of the infection[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and employing strategies to prevent CAUTI. Examples of such preventive measures are: (i) The use of a secured, closed, drainage system that mimics normal voiding, (ii) adequate hand hygiene of hospital personnel, and (iii) the use of preinsertion checklists to avoid catheter insertion without an appropriate indication. Newer strategies have also been introduced, focusing on producing biocompatible and antimicrobial catheter materials to further reduce the risk of infection and inflammatory responses.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] So far, catheters coated with different antiseptic and antimicrobial compounds, i.e. silver, noble metal alloy, chlorhexidine,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] nitrofurazone, hydrogel, and polymeric coating,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been tested with varying degrees of success. Existing data suggest that one promising CAUTI-reducing coating consists of a noble metal alloy and hydrogel layer. These catheters have been introduced into practice in the US and several studies support their efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, the CAUTI-reducing effect observed in these studies varies considerably, suggesting that the efficacy is highly dependent on patient group characteristics, hospital and/or region, catheterization time period, and which definition of CAUTI has been used.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 3-day use of a noble metal alloy and hydrogel-coated catheter, compared to a standard catheter in high-risk ICU patients at the King Fahad University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The primary end-point was the frequency of both symptomatic CAUTI and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB). Additional end-points were to assess safety and occurrence of UTI-related symptoms (such as polyuria and oliguria) and secondary bacteremia. All patients were thoroughly examined just before catheterization (&#x0201c;day 0&#x0201d;) to have a relevant baseline and after 3 days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This was a single-blinded, randomized, single-centered, prospective study of the safety and performance of noble metal alloy catheters in ICU patients requiring urinary catheters for at least 3 days. Data were collected at the medical and surgical critical ICU at the King Fahad Hospital of University of Dammam in Saudi Arabia. The defined inclusion criteria were (1) adult patients (&#x02265;18 years), (2) no UTI, (3) requiring a urinary catheter for at least 3 days, (4) using a closed drainage system. Accordingly, children, patients with UTIs, patients using open drainage system, urinary tract congenital abnormalities or obstetric/gynecological abnormalities, and patients with duration of urinary catheter &#x0003c;3 days were excluded from this study. Data were collected for 60 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomized to the latex noble metal alloy catheters (BIP Foley Catheter, Bactiguard AB, Stockholm, Sweden) or conventional siliconized latex Foley catheters (Jamjoom Medical Industries, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), referred to as a standard group, in a 1:1 ratio. The BIP Foley Catheter is made of latex coated with a noble metal alloy (gold, silver, and palladium) and a hydrogel layer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data collection and nursing management</title><p>Demographic, medical, and clinical data for each patient were collected. The documented demographic data included age, gender, and date of urinary catheter insertion. The recorded medical data included diagnoses, such as renal tubular acidosis, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, diabetic ketoacidosis, drug overdose, and surgery (postoperated). These diagnoses were present before catheter insertion meaning they were not caused by catheterization. To reduce the risk of CAUTI, the catheters were inserted using aseptic technique and sterile equipment. The nurses performed hand hygiene before and after insertion and maintained a closed drainage system and properly secure catheters. If a problem occurred, such as disconnection or leakage, the catheter and collecting system was replaced using aseptic technique and sterile equipment. All clinical data were collected both before the catheter insertion (baseline) and on the third catheterization day, after removal of the catheter. The researcher monitored the body temperature, suprapubic tenderness, costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, and UTI-related symptoms (oliguria and polyuria). In addition, measured clinical parameters included white blood cells in blood and urine (pyuria) and bacterial culture in urine and blood specimens. For both urine culturing and analysis, unspun urine samples were used. All laboratory analyses of urine and blood were conducted according to the standard microbiological procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Definition of catheter-associated urinary tract infection, catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria, asymptomatic bacteremic urinary tract infection, and symptomatic bacteremic urinary tract infection</title><p>In this study, CAUTI is clinically defined based on guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - National Healthcare Safety Network criteria including only symptomatic CAUTI,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] i.e., (1) patient has, or has had, a urinary catheter within 48 h before the specimen collection, (2) a positive urine culture of &#x02265;10<sup>3</sup> cfu/ml or &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml with no more than two organisms, (3) one symptom (fever, dysuria, or suprapubic tenderness), and (4) If the patient has a positive urine culture &#x02265;10<sup>3</sup> and &#x0003c;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml, one laboratory evidence is required (positive dipstick for leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite, pyuria, microorganism seen on Gram stain of unspun urine).</p><p>The criteria for CA-ASB are: (1) Patient has, or has had, a urinary catheter within 48 h before the specimen collection, (2) a positive urine culture of &#x02265;10<sup>3</sup> cfu/ml or &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml with no more than two organisms, (3) If the patient has a positive urine culture of &#x02265;10<sup>3</sup> and &#x0003c;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml, one laboratory evidence is required (positive dipstick for leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite, pyuria, microorganism seen on Gram stain of unspun urine).</p><p>For asymptomatic bacteremic UTI (ABUTI), the patient must meet all the following criteria for diagnosis (based on the CDC criteria):[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (1) Patient has no signs or symptoms of CAUTI, (2) patient has a urine culture with no more than two species of organisms, at least one of which is a bacteria of &#x02265;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/ml, and (3) patient has a positive blood culture with at least one matching bacteria to the urine culture.

Of these three secondary bacteremia cases, one case fulfilled the criteria for ABUTI (see criteria described in the method section) since this patient did not have any CAUTI symptoms while the other 2 cases were SBUTI. Note that the ABUTI case is also considered as a CA-ASB case (and not CAUTI) since this patient had bacteriuria without symptoms.

Some of the patients had symptoms already at catheter insertion and were found to have the same symptoms also after 3 days of catheterization independent of intervention. These patients were hence excluded from the calculations regarding polyuria/oliguria since their symptoms were not related to catheterization and only the symptom-free patients at catheterization initiation were included [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>], which were 17 and 24 patients in the standard and noble metal alloy catheter groups, respectively, both set as 100% for its group.

Our results demonstrate a 90% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) relative reduction in the noble metal alloy catheter group of the CAUTI rate. When considering both CAUTI and CA-ASB, an 83% relative reduction was observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). In addition, polyuria and secondary bacteremia cases were reduced with relative reductions of 65% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.13) and 100% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.24), respectively, in the group using noble metal alloy catheters while oliguria was similar (relative reduction 15%, <italic>P</italic> = 1.0).</p><p>The noble metal coating (Bactiguard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-coating) consists of an extremely thin noble metal alloy of gold, silver, and palladium that is firmly attached to the surface of the catheter. During the last three decades, the clinical efficacy of noble metal alloy catheters has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials, cohorts, and surveillance studies.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Data from these studies show that the coating is nontoxic. There have been no adverse events related to the coating and the vast majority of these studies consistently show that CAUTI is reduced. For example, in a recent multisite cohort by Lederer <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] including 853 patients, a 58% reduction was observed in the metal alloy catheter group (referred to as &#x0201c;silver-alloy and hydrogel-coated urinary catheter&#x0201d; in this report) when considering the revised CDC-defined symptomatic CAUTI[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (excluding asymptomatic bacteriuria) and a 47% reduction when including also clinical CAUTI definitions. Moreover, in another large study including 27,878 patients,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the risk of CAUTI declined by 21% among study wards that were randomized to noble metal alloy-coated urinary catheters (referred to as &#x0201c;silver coated catheters&#x0201d; in this report) and by 32% among patients in whom noble metal alloy-coated catheters were used on the wards. In this study, it was also demonstrated that the use of the noble metal alloy-coated catheters offered cost savings by preventing excess hospital stay costs caused by CAUTI.</p><p>Nevertheless, many of the published studies on catheters with noble metal coating are not randomized and most of them have CAUTI definitions that include only asymptomatic bacteriuria or aggregated numbers for both symptomatic CAUTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria (since bacteriuria was included in the CAUTI definition before 2009). Moreover, many of the studies include broad spectra of patients, which makes it difficult to identify patient groups at most benefit for the noble metal-coated catheters.</p><p>In this study, we overcome many of these weaknesses. Our study is randomized and uses the current criteria of symptomatic CAUTI (including also data on secondary bacteremia, such as ABUTI and SBUTI). The reason why we observed a pronounced relative reduction of CAUTI, already after 3 days of catheterization, may be due to a homogeneous patient group with high infection rates. Furthermore, the same nurses treated the patients and collected the data. Another recent study by Pickard <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] revealed that short-term catheterized, low-risk surgery patients (1&#x02013;2 catheterization days) were not benefited by noble metal alloy-coated catheters in reducing symptomatic CAUTI.</p><p>However, there are several limitations in the present report. First, there is a limited number of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 60) implying that every CAUTI case has a large impact on the relative reduction rate. Second, there was a difference in age distribution between the groups. No difference was observed between the groups with regards to the gender or diagnoses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>CAUTI rates and secondary outcomes such as polyuria and secondary bacteremia were found to be in lower frequency rate in the noble metal alloy group compared to the standard group.</p><p>To obtain further clinical evidence of the anti-infective effects and to assess cost efficiency of these catheters, the next step would be to conduct randomized clinical studies in a larger study population, in different patient types including cost-driving parameters.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System.
