computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training program on the improvement of
cognition and balance abilities of the elderly. [Subjects] Thirty healthy elderly people,
aged 65 to 80, were randomly assigned either to the training group (n=15) or the control
group (n=15). [Methods] Cognitive functions were evaluated using MMSE-K, and the BioRescue
AP 153 (RMINGENIERIE, France) was used to examine subjects&#x02019; changes in static balance.
[Results] The MMSE-K score showed a significant change over the course of the treatment
period in the training group, but not in the control group. The sway area and sway path
length decreased significantly in the training group, but it did not show any changes in
the control group. [Conclusion] Computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training is an
effective intervention method for the improvement of the cognition and balance abilities
of the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd><kwd>Static balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cognitive treatments using computers, which began with memory training, are being widely
used these days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Computer-assisted
cognitive rehabilitation has advantages, in that it provides personalized treatment based on
a subject&#x02019;s neuropsychological pattern to stimulate impaired areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. A computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training
program consists of exercises focused on visual reaction, visual scanning, attention,
information processing speed, memory, and problem solving. These exercises can not only
provide flexibility and adjustment within a treatment regimen, but may also shorten
treatment time. They also provide a means for objectively measuring subject&#x02019;s performance as
well as providing instant feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
causes of decreasing cognitive information processing speeds among the elderly include the
decrease in the number of brain cells, the weakening of motor nerve cells, and a decrease in
general activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive dysfunction
begins with memory decline and is accompanied by miscalculation, disorientation,
misjudgment, and comprehension disability, all of which greatly affect daily life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is the ability to maintain the body&#x02019;s center of gravity within the support base
with minimal sway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sensory process
undertaken during balancing refers to the interaction among the somatic senses, including
proprioception, visual sense, and stereotactic input from the vestibular system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study of cognition and balance reported
that the reduction of balance ability due to aging is associated with cognitive
function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, in a study of
senses and balance, with patients divided into different age groups, Colledge et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the reduction of balance
ability with aging was associated with the slowing of central information processing
speed.</p><p>With the above in mind, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of
computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training on cognition and balance ability, an
area closely related to daily living activities of the elderly, and to present a therapeutic
program for reduced cognitive function and a safe therapeutic approach for elderly people
who have difficulty engaging in physical exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty typical elderly people between the ages of 65 and 80 were randomly assigned to a

visual interruption training found in the RehaCom program and the visual construction
ability program of the attention training program. The subjects performed these exercises
for 30 minutes per session, three sessions per week, for six weeks. For measurement
purposes, their cognitive function was measured using the Korean version of the Mini Mental
State Examination (MMSE-K), and their static balance was measured with the balance
measurement system, BioRescue AP 153 (RMINGENIERIE, France). Data analyses were undertaken
using the independent t-test to analyze the characteristics of the subjects and the
differences between the two groups. This was done using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. In order to
compare the foot pressure training before and after the program, the paired t-test was
conducted. The level of statistical significance was chosen as 0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The MMSE-K scores and balance ability at the start and end of the intervention are shown in

functional activities including daily living abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The evaluation and treatment of the reduced cognitive function of
typical elderly people due to normal aging, and the cognitive damage due to neurological
diseases such as dementia, is critical for the maintenance of independent living and the
quality of life of elderly people. Damage to a person&#x02019;s attention, concentration, and memory
affect his or her problem-solving and inference abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, clinical therapies for the cognitive functions of the elderly include
psychological approaches such as music therapy and reminiscence therapy, cognitive aids to
compensate for cognitive impairment and computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation
training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of
computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training programs used in clinical settings for
cognitive rehabilitation of brain-injury patients, the elderly, and dementia patients have
been confirmed in many studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Gunther et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, some of the effects that appear
immediately after computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training continue even after
five months, and they proposed the use of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation
programs to treat and prevent cognitive defects among the elderly. On the other hand, Chen
et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the application of
a computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation program achieved significant improvement in
various cognitive areas of traumatic brain-injury patients, but no difference was found in a
control group which received a traditional therapy.</p><p>In this study, a six-week-long computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation training program
was carried out using elderly subjects, and its effects on the subjects&#x02019; cognition and
balance were investigated. The MMSE-K score for the period of treatment showed significant
differences in the training group, but not in the control group. To sustain the ability to
balance, an appropriate response to environmental changes needs be followed instantaneously,
and a proper response can be made possible by quick information processing abilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, which heavily rely on selective attention.
For this reason, the sway area and distance also decreased significantly in the training
group, but not in the control group. Based on these results, we conclude that a
computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation program can be used as a therapeutic approach
restoring the cognitive functions and balance abilities of elderly people who have
limitations on their physical activities due to aging. Furthermore, this approach can be
used as an alternative clinical program for preventing the decline of cognitive function of,
and falls by, the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Glisky</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Schacter</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Tulving</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Learning and retention of computer-related vocabulary in
