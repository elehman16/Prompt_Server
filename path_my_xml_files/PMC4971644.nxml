Results from trials in Asia evaluating the effect of chlorhexidine on neonatal mortality have been encouraging but limited data are available on the impact of cord cleansing on bacterial colonization. Further, no data from facility deliveries and impact with time is available. This pilot study was aimed to evaluate the impact of 4&#x000a0;% commercially prepared chlorhexidine on cord colonization and density of colonization among newborns in India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three hundred twenty-six newborns (hospital-247; community-79) were enrolled within 24&#x000a0;h of birth and randomly assigned to one of three groups: chlorhexidine, placebo or dry cord care. Umbilical swabs were collected at baseline, 2- and 48- hours after intervention application.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, growth positivity (any bacterial growth) was 20&#x000a0;% (50 of 247 swabs) and 81&#x000a0;% (64 of 79 swabs) among hospital and community born neonates, respectively. In both settings, chlorhexidine compared to placebo and dry cord care, reduced colonization following 2- and 48-hour post application. Chlorhexidine significantly reduced 48-hour post application colony counts in comparison to placebo [Hospital: mean difference&#x02009;= &#x02212;1.01; 95&#x000a0;% CI: &#x02212;1.72, &#x02212;0.30 Community: mean difference&#x02009;= &#x02212;1.76; 95&#x000a0;% CI: &#x02212;2.60, &#x02212;0.93] and dry cord care [Hospital: mean difference&#x02009;= &#x02212;1.16; 95&#x000a0;% CI: &#x02212;1.93, &#x02212;0.39 Community: mean difference&#x02009;= &#x02212;2.23; 95&#x000a0;% CI: &#x02212;3.18, &#x02212;1.29]. Differences were similar for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cord cleansing with 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine soon after birth reduced colonization as well as density of colonization significantly; however this pilot study does not address the impact of chlorhexidine on mortality. The control preparation neither increased or decreased colonization.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01528852?term=NCT01528852&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01528852,</ext-link> Registered February 7, 2012. </p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12887-016-0625-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neonates</kwd><kwd>Newborns</kwd><kwd>Chlorhexidine</kwd><kwd>Colonization</kwd><kwd>Bacterial count</kwd><kwd>Cord cleaning</kwd><kwd>Umbilical cord</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Gates foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>107456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sazawal</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Neonatal deaths account for 40&#x000a0;% of global under-five mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and are a major health concern in the developing countries, particularly in the south Asian and sub-Saharan countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Each year serious infections account for nearly 13&#x000a0;% of the 3 million neonatal deaths, this proportion is closer to 50&#x000a0;% in settings with high mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Five countries namely India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and China alone account for half (2.440 million) of the global deaths from infections and 53.3&#x000a0;% (1.636 million) of neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Community based studies from developing world suggest that infections are responsible for 8 to 80&#x000a0;% of all neonatal deaths and as many as 42&#x000a0;% deaths in first week of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In neonates, umbilicus acts as a bacterial reservoir and a potential entry point for the infection, especially in first few days of life, when umbilical vein is patent. This may lead to sepsis with or without omphalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The responsible organisms most likely originate in maternal genital tract and are acquired during labor and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In low income countries, many neonatal infections are environmentally acquired because of higher number of home deliveries, unsafe traditional practices, untrained birth attendants and unclean living conditions, all of which pose an increased risk of umbilical cord infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The local signs of umbilical cord infection include pus, redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness and foul odour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and seem to be associated with increased risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Infectious organisms may get directly transmitted from patent umbilical cord to the blood stream without evident signs of local cord infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recommendations for umbilical cord care, particularly in regard to prevention of umbilical cord infection, are controversial. In developing countries, World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] promotes dry cord care. These recommendations were based on lack of evidence for alternative approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Based on currently available evidence, the WHO recommends 7.1&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine digluconate solution or gel, (delivering 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine) among home deliveries in settings with neonatal mortality rate more than 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This interim recommendation awaits review of further data especially the results of two large trials in Africa.</p><p>Of topical antiseptics (eg, ethanol, silver sulfadiazine, triple dye, gentian violet, chlorhexidine, povidine iodine), chlorhexidine with strong residual activity has shown potential as an effective cord care agent during the neonatal period against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has an excellent safety profile, is rarely associated with bacterial resistance, is easy to administer and costs few cents per application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Available high-quality evidence from the recently conducted Cochrane review indicates that cord cleansing with 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine reduces the risk of neonatal mortality by 12&#x000a0;% and sepsis (omphalitis)/infections by 50&#x000a0;% in low-resource community settings including Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, in hospital settings, chlorhexidine cord cleansing reduces the risk of omphalitis/infections by 52&#x000a0;% and may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality as compared to dry cord care. Despite all these data, limited evidence is available on the mechanism of this protective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] published recently suggested an impact on bacterial colonization of the cord and provided information on early neonatal colonization dynamics in community setting. There are no data available evaluating impact of chlorhexidine on colonization among facility births, and spectrum of chlorhexidine overtime. In all the earlier chlorhexidine trials evaluating impact on mortality and/or cord infections, 4.0&#x000a0;% free chlorhexidine were prepared by diluting 20&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine digluconate to the appropriate concentration with purified water at the study sites. As there was no data available from Africa, two large trials in Africa (Pemba, Tanzania and Zambia) were funded by Bill and Melinda gates Foundation to evaluate the mortality impact of the intervention. In the present pilot study, we tested the antimicrobial activity of the commercially prepared 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine solution as a cord-cleansing agent, and evaluated its impact on bacterial colonization and colony counts after 2- and 48-hour post-application in hospital- and community born neonates in comparison to placebo (same solution without active ingredients) and dry cord care. The aim of this pilot study was to ensure and document the efficacy of preparation before evaluating mortality and sepsis impact in large trials (more than 60,000 newborns in African setting). In addition, the pilot study provided data on potential cord colonizing pathogens that could be responsible for sepsis, apart from regular skin flora.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This pilot study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted in New Delhi, India.

Its population is predominantly from the low socio-economic strata of the society. Almost 60&#x000a0;% of the births in Sangam Vihar take place at home (20&#x02013;25 deliveries daily).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Training and reliability</title><p>Training sessions were organized for the field workers, supervisors and hospital staff who were apprised of the study protocol and the various forms that need to be filled at different time points. Swab sample collection from the umbilical cord as well as cleaning of cord using the assigned intervention method was demonstrated using a dummy doll. This was followed by practice and return demonstration by trainees on the dummy. Subsequently, dry run sessions were undertaken by the staff to ensure reliability and effective implementation of study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment and enrollment</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Enrollment in hospital</title><p>Study team was stationed outside the maternity ward from 8.00&#x000a0;am to 5.30&#x000a0;pm.

If the newborn was found eligible (normal delivery, full term healthy newborns of both sexes with birth weight &#x0003e;2500&#x000a0;g, first contact &#x02264;48&#x000a0;h), the study purpose and procedure were explained to the mother once she was stable or else to the nearest kin and the consent for their newborn&#x02019;s participation in the study was sought. The newborn was enrolled in the study after the consent was obtained from the parents. Neonates requiring resuscitation and admission to NICU and also those with major congenital malformation were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Enrollment in community</title><p>A survey was carried out by trained birth attendants (TBAs) to identify the pregnant women in the six blocks of Sangam Vihar. A record of all identified pregnancies with their tentative due delivery dates was prepared. The family members and TBAs were instructed to contact the study supervisor at the time of delivery or immediately thereafter. The study supervisor and fieldworker along with the TBA visited the newborn within 48&#x000a0;h of delivery. They screened the newborn for eligibility (vaginally delivered, term healthy newborns, first contact &#x02264;48&#x000a0;h) and if found eligible, the study purpose and procedure were explained to the mother and the consent for their newborn&#x02019;s participation in the study was sought.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size estimations</title><p>Based on Nepal hospital data (Hodgins et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) the sample size was estimated to be 80 in each intervention group for the hospital setting, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80&#x000a0;%, to detect a reduction in bacterial colonization from 29 to 11&#x000a0;% in the chlorhexidine group. Based on Bangladesh study (Mullany et al, personal communication), the sample size was estimated to be 44 in each intervention group in the community setting, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80&#x000a0;%, to detect a reduction in bacterial colonization from 93 to 69&#x000a0;% in the chlorhexidine group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Masking and randomization</title><p>All enrolled neonates were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 intervention groups: (a) 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine or (b) placebo (mild soap water) or (c) dry cord care group. Both the chlorhexidine and the placebo groups were blinded and the preparations were identical in packaging, appearance, colour, consistency and odour. It was not possible to blind the allocation to the dry cord care group. Each intervention group was identified by a letter code. The manager in the manufacturing unit decided the codes to be used for the solutions and kept the information secret till the data analysis was complete. Thus, neither the mothers of the neonates nor the hospital/field staff knew which intervention was being used. Two separate randomization lists were prepared; one for the hospital and other for the community births. For the hospital, a randomization list containing running serial number and randomly allocated code (A through I) was generated. These letter codes were used to identify three intervention groups. In order to ensure equalization of groups, six letter codes for the solution (3 codes for chlorhexidine and 3 for placebo groups) and three letter codes for the dry cord care were used. In-house computer software generated a random sequence of group codes with permuted block length of 18. Neonates were allocated to one of the groups in the order in which they got enrolled. For the community births, similar randomization procedure was used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention description</title><p>Intervention was prepared by Galentic Pharma (India) Pvt.

All samples (i.e. 10 &#x003bc;L of the neat specimen) were inoculated in 3 media plates i.e. McConkey Agar, Blood Agar and Chocolate Agar. The plates were incubated as per recommended time and temperature and were checked for absence or presence of bacterial isolates. Smear was prepared for identifying gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Based on the morphology and colour of the stain taken by the bacteria, they were classified into gram-positive or gram-negative organisms. Samples were further tested for species identification using standard manual methods and Vitek 2 compact system from BioMerieux France. For colony counts, the samples were put in 1&#x000a0;ml of normal saline for 3 log dilution and sub-cultured using standard subculture technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Presence of bacterial growth, identification to gram-positive/-negative bacterial organisms and semi-quantitative colony count was estimated for all samples.

In this double blind randomized controlled trial with facility and community data, we evaluated the impact of 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to placebo or dry cord care on cord colonization. Cord cleansing with 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine showed significant reduction in colonization and density of pathogens in both facility and community setting. As compared to dry cord care, the impact of 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine was greater in the first 48&#x000a0;h after birth suggesting that chlorhexidine may be a possible intervention for reducing omphalitis and sepsis arising from transmission of bacterial infections via the umbilical remnant. These findings are in line with observations reported in a study conducted in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The potential mechanisms for the chlorhexidine action in reducing the colonization rates could possibly be the result of the increased binding efficiency of the detergent form to the umbilical tissues, resulting in prolonged residual effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine could be attributed to its chemical structure, which is a positively charged hydrophobic and lipophilic molecule that interacts with phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides on the cell membrane of bacteria and enters the cell either through active or passive transport mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Interaction of the positive charge of the molecule with the negatively charged phosphate groups on microbial cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] alters the cells&#x02019; osmotic equilibrium, increasing the permeability of the cell wall thus allowing the chlorhexidine molecule to penetrate into the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Damage to this delicate membrane is followed by leakage of intracellular constituents, particularly phosphate entities such as adenosine triphosphate and nucleic acids. As a consequence, the cytoplasm becomes congealed, with resultant reduction in leakage; thus, there is a biphasic effect on membrane permeability. These early changes are beneficial during the critical first few hours and days of life when most neonatal deaths occur in resource-poor settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Our data also suggests that mild soap and water solution (placebo) was not very effective in reducing bacterial colonization in comparison to dry cord care. This placebo solution only reduced the pathogens in immediate 2-hours post application swabs in the community setting and did not produce extended effect for 48&#x000a0;h. This could be a mere chance finding or cord cleansing process itself mechanically removed the organisms from the umbilical and peri-umbilical region, subsequently decreasing the bacterial load. This indicates that for residual and cumulative effects, antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine are substantially more effective than non-antiseptic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Bacteriologic colonization rates, profile, and dynamics in a community setting might differ substantially from that in the hospital setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the present study, the observed colonization positivity rate was higher in the community-setting (81&#x000a0;%) than in the hospital (20&#x000a0;%) which could be due to unhygienic environment, unclean delivery practices at homes and immediate post-delivery traditional practices. Further, as compared to other studies, the overall pre-application bacterial growth was low in the hospital setting which could be due to differences in neonate handling and infection prevention practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the present study, the reported impact of 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine on the reduction of bacterial colonization was consistently high in both settings.</p><p>This study also describes the specific pathogens colonizing the umbilical cord. Trends in colonization positivity data were assessed by intervention groups, follow-up time and gram stain status of organisms and it was observed that chlorhexidine showed high bactericidal activity. The evidence presented here for the immediate and extended effect of 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine on large and sustained reductions in colonization by gram-negative and gram-positive organisms due to early application with chlorhexidine complements the Cochrane conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that colonization is substantially lower among infants receiving topical antiseptics compared with those with no specific treatment (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28; 95&#x000a0;% CI: 0.22&#x02013;0.36).</p><p>There were few limitations to our study. The sample size limited our ability to definitively determine whether any of the study outcomes could be influenced by one intervention or the other. But the encouraging findings in our study were that most of the results were statistically significant. Our results provide evidence that the application of 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine solution on the umbilical cord provides protection to the baby from bacterial colonization and growth. The findings of our pilot study are important but need to be confirmed in a large community based trial with adequate statistical power as reduction in colonization and colony count in small number of subjects does not have adequate power to evaluate the impact on mortality or sepsis but does provide data on possible mechanisms.</p><p>The study cannot address an impact that these changes can have on the microbiome and its implications. From a comparison study in Pemba and Zambia (personal communication and in submission) it is clear that reduction in omphalitis may not essentially result in reduction in sepsis and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study has shown that cord cleaning with the first time commercially produced 4&#x000a0;% chlorhexidine soon after birth can significantly reduce colonization as well as density of colonization among newborns. The study also demonstrated no impact of the control preparation compared to dry cord care on colonization (increase or decrease). The study showed impact of chlorhexidine on colonization in both hospital and community settings, but does not speak to relationship between this reduction and occurrence of sepsis or mortality. The findings of our pilot study are important but need to be tested in large community based trials to establish linkage between reduction in bacterial colonization and sepsis and or mortality. If the link between reduced colonization and reduction in neonatal mortality is established in larger trials in Africa, this intervention could have impact on neonatal mortality in developing country settings where there is limited availability of resources, stringent customs and poor environmental hygiene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CI, confidence interval; GN, gram-negative; GP, gram-positive; OR, odds ratio; TBA, trained birth attendant</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12887_2016_625_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Supplementary Tables (Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;3).
