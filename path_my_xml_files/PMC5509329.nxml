In Study 1, a sample of 585 parents with at least one child under the age of 18 in the home participated through Amazon&#x02019;s MTurk. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 x 2 design. Participants read either correcting information refuting a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism or a control passage about bird feeding. Additionally, participants either completed a self-affirmation exercise where they reflected on their personal values or in a control condition in which they reflected on least-personally-important values that might be important to others. Participants exposed to the correcting information were less likely to believe that vaccines cause serious side effects, but no less likely to believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism. For parents with initially positive vaccine attitudes, there was no effect of condition on intent to vaccinate a future child. For parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes, self-affirmation was ineffective in the presence of correcting information and resulted in less intention to vaccinate in the absence of correcting information. This effect was partially replicated in Study 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 576), which provided no correcting information but otherwise followed the same procedure as Study 1.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are available in two files (one for Study 1; one for Study 2).

Vaccines are largely responsible for the impressive decline in childhood illnesses [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], many of which are now rare in the United States (e.g., polio, measles). However, lower-than-ideal vaccination rates in the U.S. are a growing public health concern [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and have been implicated in several measles and pertussis outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite the scientific evidence that vaccines are safe for the large majority of children and prevent childhood disease and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], some parents remain resistant to vaccinating their children. Researchers have tested various messaging techniques to decrease negative vaccine attitudes and to increase vaccination rates, but have found it difficult to change parents&#x02019; negative attitudes (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). The present study attempted to apply a psychological intervention&#x02014;a self-affirmation exercise&#x02014;which has proven helpful in health messaging acceptance in other domains (e.g., smoking, healthy eating) [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to vaccine safety messaging for parents.</p><p>Fifteen U.S. states are below the <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> target vaccination rate of 90% and 36 states are below the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation rates of 93% vaccination rates to prevent epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From 2001 to 2010, there were eight years with fewer than 100 cases of measles in the U.S. and two years with fewer than 150 cases [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2011 and 2013 there were approximately 200 cases each year, and in 2014, there were over 600 cases in 23 outbreaks. In all outbreaks, the majority of infected individuals had not been vaccinated [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The largest outbreak in 2014 originated in California at Disneyland [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and there are schools in California where fewer than 50% of kindergartners are up-to-date on their vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The rise in parents choosing not to vaccinate their children may be partially due to parental fears that vaccines cause serious side effects, including autism [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although fears about vaccines have been present since their introduction [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the wave of current fears is due in part to a discredited study by Andrew Wakefield, which purported to show a link between the MMR vaccine and autism [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite that fact that this study was eventually withdrawn and determined to be fraudulent [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and that the scientific consensus is that vaccines are <italic>not</italic> related to the development of autism (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), vaccine safety concerns have persisted [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Nyhan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] tested the effect of several messaging techniques on negative attitudes toward vaccines (beliefs that they cause autism or other severe side effects) and likelihood to vaccinate future children. One technique was to expose parents to scientific evidence, similar to what is provided by the CDC, which refutes a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Interestingly, although exposure to such information decreased agreement with statements that the MMR vaccine is unsafe, exposure also decreased intention to vaccinate future children, particularly among those with already negative attitudes toward vaccines. Thus, although the researchers found evidence of surface acceptance of the health messaging (in that beliefs about vaccine dangers decreased), the health message had a negative effect on intent to vaccinate. Parents with negative attitudes were paradoxically <italic>less</italic> likely to say they would vaccinate a future child than if they had been exposed to no messaging at all.</p><p>One possibility for this paradoxical effect is that the correction of misinformation may have threatened participants&#x02019; sense of self. We are generally motivated to maintain a positive sense of self [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and for parents with negative attitudes toward vaccines, being exposed to conflicting scientific information could be perceived as threatening. In other areas of health messaging, participants who read health messages that are particularly relevant for their lives (e.g., obese people who are unhealthy eaters reading about the importance of healthy eating) may react defensively as if the health message is a personal attack on their self-worth [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, an obese person who is an unhealthy eater may interpret health messages about healthy eating as implying that they lack self-control or are ignorant, which would threaten their self-worth. Thus, they are more likely to dismiss the message.</p><p>When people affirm their sense of self, they are less sensitive to threats to their self-worth and may be more willing to accept health messages [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One method to help participants affirm and strengthen their sense of self is to have individuals reflect on their personal values and why they view them as important [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Individuals who self-affirm tend to see potentially threatening health messages as less threatening [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Self-affirmation may help individuals maintain a positive self-image and seems to improve the acceptance of health messages in the domains of fruit and vegetable consumption and smoking [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The effects of self-affirmation on health message acceptance seem to be largest for relevant high-risk groups. For example, high-risk participants who completed a self-affirmation exercise showed the most willingness to take a Type-2 diabetes risk test following a health message, compared to low-risk participants or high-risk participants who did not self-affirm [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similar results have been seen with consumption of high-mercury seafood and caffeine consumption [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Self-affirmation may be an effective tool at increasing acceptance of vaccine safety messaging, particularly for those who have more negative vaccine attitudes (e.g., those for whom the messages are intended and are the most relevant). Based on research in other health domains, we would expect self-affirmed participants&#x02014;particularly those with initially negative vaccine attitudes&#x02014;to be more willing to accept the safety messaging, and perhaps be more willing to vaccinate future children.</p><p>However, there are important differences between vaccine safety messaging and other types of health messages. The first is that in the case of vaccines, parents are making health decisions not for themselves, but for their children. The effect of self-affirmation for health decisions made for <italic>others</italic> rather than the self has not been studied. Another difference is that parents with negative vaccine attitudes may have deeply held beliefs that vaccines are unsafe, whereas it is unlikely that individuals believe that cigarettes are good for you (as opposed to believe cigarettes are not as bad as health messaging claims) or that eating vegetables is an unhealthy lifestyle. It may be that self-affirmation will actually <italic>strengthen</italic> these negative attitudes and make participants less likely to accept vaccine safety messages. Given these differences, we do not make directional hypotheses testing the effect of self-affirmation on acceptance of vaccine health messaging, particularly for those with initially negative vaccine attitudes. In the absence of self-affirmation, we predict results similar to those of Nyhan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We expect that participants exposed to scientific information refuting the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism will be less likely to agree with statements that suggest vaccines are unsafe, but that those with initially negative vaccine attitudes will be less likely to say they would vaccinate a future child if exposed to correcting information versus a control condition. Again, for participants with negative vaccine attitudes, self-affirmation may strengthen or reverse these results.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Study 1</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><p>The Earlham College IRB approved this research (IRB Approval Number: 1314-e027).

June 2014. A consent form indicated that the study was on memory and health decisions for children. Participation was restricted to parents/guardians of at least one child in the home under the age of 18. Following a demographic form, participants completed a measure of their vaccine attitudes [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], plus two questions about political affiliation. Statements were presented randomly. Participants were then randomly assigned to a self-affirmation or control condition using a standard values affirmation procedure (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Participants were presented (in random order) with 11 qualities they might value (e.g., religious values, humor) and asked to either select the value that was most important (self-affirmation) or least important (control). They then either wrote about why they felt the value was important to them (self-affirmation) or to someone else (control). Finally, they answered four questions on a 6-point Likert scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) about the importance of the value to themselves (self-affirmation) or to other people (control).</p><p>Following the values procedure, participants were randomly assigned to one of two reading passages, both of which were taken from Nyhan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They were told that they would answer questions about the passage later on, although they did not actually do this. The instructions were to increase the likelihood of close reading. In the Control condition, participants read about the costs and benefits of feeding birds. In the Autism Correction condition, participants read information from the CDC refuting the link between autism and the MMR vaccine. There were four total conditions: Autism Correction/Self-Affirmation (<italic>N</italic> = 156), Autism Correction/Values Control (<italic>N</italic> = 139), Control Passage/Self-Affirmation (<italic>N</italic> = 138), and Control Passage/Values Control (<italic>N</italic> = 152).</p><p>Participants were presented (in random order) three outcome questions measuring beliefs about the MMR vaccine and autism (also from Nyhan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) and an attention check question, which asked participants to select &#x0201c;Neutral&#x0201d; on a &#x0201c;Strongly Disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Strongly Agree&#x0201d; scale to demonstrate that they had been paying attention. After entering their MTurk ID, participants were asked to agree or disagree with a statement about whether they had answered honestly and were told that their answer would not affect their payment (and it did not). Participants were then debriefed. The procedure with individual questions is in the appendix.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Measures</title><p><italic>Pre-intervention vaccine attitudes</italic> were assessed using 10 questions from Freed et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], answered on a 5-point Likert scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, such as &#x0201c;Getting vaccines is a good way to protect my child(ren) from disease,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Some vaccines cause autism in healthy children&#x0201d; (reverse scored). The scale was reliable, &#x003b1; = .89. Participants who discontinued after indicating their attitudes had more negative attitudes (<italic>M</italic> = 3.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85) than participants who completed the study (<italic>M</italic> = 4.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.79; <italic>t</italic>(620) = -2.74, <italic>p</italic> = .006), suggesting that the eventual sample was biased toward those with more positive views of vaccines.</p><p>To examine the effect of condition based on initial vaccine attitudes, Nyhan and colleagues used a tercile split. Participants whose vaccine attitudes scores were less than 3.57 were classified as having &#x0201c;least favorable attitudes,&#x0201d; (and referred to as &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; in the conclusion) even though their score is closer on the scale to &#x0201c;Agree&#x0201d; than to &#x0201c;Neither Agree or Disagree.&#x0201d; (Those with scores greater than or equal to 4.125 were classified as having &#x0201c;most favorable&#x0201d; attitudes.) These cut-offs resulted in those with &#x0201c;least favorable&#x0201d; attitudes having a <italic>group</italic> mean of 3.0 (&#x0201c;Neither Agree Nor Disagree&#x0201d;). We felt it was important to examine negative attitudes and to use an objective, rather than relative, cut-off for determining those negative attitudes. Thus, we divided participants based on their position on the scale, not based on their position <italic>relative</italic> to other participants. This approach resulted in participants being classified into a <italic>positive vaccine attitude</italic> group (individual mean scale score at or above 4 or &#x0201c;Agree,&#x0201d; <italic>N</italic> = 399, group <italic>M</italic> = 4.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.44), a <italic>negative vaccine attitude</italic> group (individual mean scale score below 3 &#x0201c;Neither Agree Nor Disagree,&#x0201d; <italic>N</italic> = 38, group <italic>M</italic> = 2.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.43), or being removed from analyses (<italic>N</italic> = 148). However, we have included analyses using both approaches.</p><p>Following Nyhan et al.

Originally, 751 participants opened the survey, but 37 did not advance past the consent form. Eighty-five participants indicated they had no children, did not give their children&#x02019;s ages, or did not advance past the question asking about children. Five participants did not complete past the demographics. Nineteen participants indicated their initial attitudes and stopped participating. An additional 10 participants failed to agree with the statement, &#x0201c;I was honest in answering all questions (including about whether I have children in the home).&#x0201d; Five participants answered an attention check question incorrectly, and two participants did not follow instructions and failed to describe values when prompted.

[<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] regarding the effect of scientific information about vaccine safety on parents&#x02019; beliefs about vaccines and their intent to vaccinate future children. Nyhan and colleagues&#x02019; study demonstrated paradoxical results such that exposure to correcting information decreased beliefs about negative effects of the MMR vaccine (specifically that it causes autism), but also decreased intentions to vaccinate future children among those with initially negative attitudes toward vaccines. We tested a psychological intervention&#x02014;self-affirmation&#x02014;which has increased acceptance of health messages in other domains. The results of our studies partially replicated Nyhan et al., in that exposure to correcting information decreased agreement about the negative effects of vaccines (in our case, that vaccines are likely to cause severe side effects). Our results provide no evidence for the hypothesis that self-affirmation would be an effective strategy. Given the relatively few participants with negative vaccine attitudes, the results provide <italic>weak</italic> evidence that self-affirmation may actually be detrimental for parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Correcting information</title><p>Study 1 used two of the same reading passages that Nyhan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] presented to their participants. In addition to a control passage about bird feeding, we presented participants with scientific information refuting the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism, similar to what is provided by the CDC. Both studies found evidence that exposure to the correcting information was more effective at reducing agreement with statements suggesting vaccines are unsafe, although there were differences. Nyhan and colleagues found that the correcting information decreased agreement that the MMR vaccine causes autism but not with the statement that vaccines are likely to cause severe side effects. We found that correcting information decreased beliefs that the vaccine causes severe side effects, but not beliefs that the vaccine causes autism. The effect in our study was very small. Neither study showed that results differed based on initial vaccine attitude.</p><p>The reason that the pattern of results for these two questions differed between studies is not entirely clear. In both studies, these measures are correlated (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Study 1</xref>: <italic>r</italic>(582) = .541; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Study 2</xref>: <italic>r</italic>(575) = .562, <italic>p</italic>s &#x0003c; .001) and seem to be assessing a similar construct of negative vaccine outcomes. To allow comparisons across studies, we chose to separate these items. In future studies, researchers may want to create a scale with several items, increasing reliability in a single measure. It is also possible that demographic differences contributed. Our study sample was younger, whiter, more educated (although there was a smaller percentage of families in the highest income brackets), and more likely to have only one child compared to Nyhan and colleagues&#x02019; sample. Hispanic parents (19% of Nyhan&#x02019;s sample; 7% of our <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Study 1</xref> sample) are more likely than white non-Hispanic parents to believe that vaccines cause autism [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. They are also more likely to believe that vaccines cause serious side effects, although the ethnic difference for this question is smaller. Furthermore, first born children are more likely to be fully immunized compared to their younger siblings [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the views of parents of singletons may differ and be differentially susceptible to vaccine messages. Although the pattern differed based on specific question, the results of both studies suggest that exposure to correcting information decreases beliefs that vaccines are unsafe.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Self-affirmation</title><p>Nyhan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that for parents with initially negative attitudes toward vaccines, reading correcting information actually decreased intent to vaccinate a future child. In Study 1, we did not find a two-way interaction between passage type (correcting information or control) and initial vaccine attitudes. However, we did find a three-way interaction between passage type, initial vaccine attitudes, and self-affirmation condition (self-affirmation or control) in Study 1, and an interaction between initial vaccine attitudes and self-affirmation condition in Study 2 (which provided no correcting information).</p><p>In the presence of correcting information (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Study 1</xref>), completing a self-affirmation exercise was ineffective for parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes. That is, for parents with negative vaccine attitudes who read correcting scientific information, their intent to vaccinate a future child did not differ if they completed the values affirmation exercise for themselves (self-affirmation) or not. In the <italic>absence</italic> of correcting information (Studies <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">1</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">2</xref>), completing a self-affirmation exercise resulted in <italic>lower</italic> intention to vaccinate a future child among parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes. As with the previous result, the effect of this interaction was very small.</p><p>It is important to note that we used two definitions of initially negative attitudes. We used both an absolute measure, in which those classified as having negative attitudes had mean scores on the &#x0201c;disagree&#x0201d; side of the scale. We also used a relative measure, based on Nyhan&#x02019;s cut-off scores using a tercile split to allow for comparisons between studies. The different analyses resulted in different specific results (a significant interaction with vaccine attitudes in Study 1 using absolute, but not relative, attitudes; a significant interaction in Study 2 using relative, but not absolute, attitudes), but taken as a whole point to the same general conclusion: there is weak and somewhat inconsistent evidence that self-affirmation results in more negative vaccine attitudes for those without initially positive attitudes.</p><p>Although self-affirmation exercises seem to be effective tools in other areas of health messaging (e.g., smoking, healthy eating) [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], important differences led us to propose competing hypotheses. First, in other health domains, participants are making health decisions for themselves, rather than for their children. In the case of childhood vaccines, parents are making decisions for their children. Second, although high-risk individuals (e.g., smokers, those with poor diet) may downplay the warnings in health messages (e.g., likelihood of disease), they are unlikely to strongly believe that smoking is <italic>good</italic> for them or that healthy eating is <italic>bad</italic> for them. In contrast, parents with negative vaccine attitudes may not only downplay the benefits of vaccines for their children, but also sincerely believe that vaccines are unsafe and dangerous for their children. Thus, although it was possible that self-affirmation would affect vaccine safety message acceptance in the same ways that it affects other health messages, the results are more suggestive of the alternative hypothesis. Specifically, engaging in self-affirmation might have made parents more secure in their negative attitudes, particularly in the absence of any correcting information.</p><p>These results have implications both for vaccine attitudes and messaging, as well as for research applying self-affirmation to health issues in general. The current studies add to the body of literature suggesting that vaccine attitudes are difficult to change (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) and combined with Nyhan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggest that interventions with parents who have particularly negative vaccine attitudes may be more detrimental than doing nothing. Of course, in the current studies, there were few parents with negative vaccine attitudes using an absolute cut-off (<italic>N</italic> = 38 divided between four groups in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Study 1</xref>; <italic>N</italic> = 41 divided between two groups in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Study 2</xref>), and we should reach conclusions cautiously.</p><p>Researchers, health providers, and public health officials should continue to develop and test potential interventions. Although the self-affirmation procedure appears detrimental, there are value-focused approaches that may be effective. Self-affirmation, in this study and in previous studies, has generally involved reflecting on potentially unrelated values with the goal of strengthening the sense of self. Researchers in Australia (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) developed a public health decision-making tool for parents that requires parents to rate how important various vaccine-specific values are, such as &#x0201c;my child will be better protected from the potentially serious complications of these diseases&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;if my child experiences a severe complication, I may feel guilty or responsible because I had them vaccinated.&#x0201d; Using pre/post tests, researchers found that using the decision-making aid increased parents agreement that they were &#x0201c;leaning toward&#x0201d; vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Understanding how general values-affirmation versus the use of problem-specific (in this case, vaccine-specific) values affect decision making will be an important avenue of future research.</p><p>Given the importance of high vaccination rates for public safety and public health, researchers and public health officials will have to continue to explore methods to increase parent confidence in vaccines and increase vaccination rates. Recent outbreaks may naturally increase vaccination rates. When choosing whether to vaccinate their children, many parents engage in a risk-benefit assessment. Those who choose not to vaccinate may see the risk of getting childhood diseases as very low and thus emphasize the risks of vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The recent measles outbreaks have garnered nation-wide media attention. This attention may increase parents&#x02019; perceptions of the likelihood that their children could be exposed to measles, potentially altering the risk-benefit analysis of parents who previously refused vaccines for their children. In turn, more parents may choose to have their children vaccinated.</p><p>The current study also suggests future avenues of research for applying self-affirmation to health behaviors and decision-making. No studies to our knowledge have explored the use of self-affirmation in health decisions about others (children, incapacitated adults). Nor have researchers investigated self-affirmation as applied to health decisions where individuals may hold beliefs opposite to public health officials. That is, the effect of self-affirmation may be quite different for a person who simply believes that health messages are exaggerated (e.g., believing that smoking leads to cancer less often than warnings imply) versus believing that health messages are wrong (e.g., believing that vaccines are dangerous when health messages say the benefits far outweigh potential costs). Researchers might investigate the effect of self-affirmation on other deeply held beliefs that may conflict with some health or scientific messages, such as individuals who strongly believe that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are dangerous for their health although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains that they are safe [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another example might be the subset of skiers who state they do not wear helmets because the helmets interfere with vision (and thus safety), although this concern is not borne out by the data [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The interpretation of the results is limited in some ways. First, although we had a relatively large sample size in both studies, only a small percentage (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Study 1</xref>: 6%, <italic>N</italic> = 38; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Study 2</xref>: 7%, <italic>N</italic> = 41) was classified as having negative vaccine attitudes, using the absolute cut-off approach. Although significant interactions were identified in both studies, it is important to note that estimates are less stable with smaller sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and further replication would be important. Future researchers may want to recruit participants in a way that will allow over-sampling of those with negative vaccine attitudes, allowing for a more adequately powered examination of those with truly negative vaccine attitudes (and not just relatively less favorable attitudes). For example, recruiting parents from pre-schools with low vaccination rates and on message boards or groups whose members are opposed to vaccines.</p><p>Second, we did not include any measure of participants&#x02019; suspicions or distrust of the study&#x02019;s intent. Advocates on both sides of the vaccination argument accuse the other side of being propaganda [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and participants with negative vaccine attitudes may be particularly suspicious of the researchers&#x02019; intent. As an anonymous reviewer suggested, this could result in a strengthening of previously held beliefs. Future researchers should directly assess this possibility.</p><p>Third, the measure of intent to vaccinate is an imperfect one. People are often not good at predicting their future behavior [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and a better measure would be parents&#x02019; actual vaccination behaviors. Given that this intervention was ineffective at best and harmful at worst, it would not be appropriate to implement it in pediatricians&#x02019; offices. However, as researchers progress and identify more effective interventions, an important test of them will be if parents actually increase their vaccination rates following interventions, which might be implemented during or prior to well-child visits.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the study offers a reasonable extension of the Nyhan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0181368.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] study, supporting their results overall (that correcting information can decrease belief in misinformation but interventions can be detrimental for parents with negative vaccine attitudes), although the pattern of results for specific questions differed. As demonstrated before, parental vaccine attitudes are difficult to shift. The study also offered a reasonable test of competing hypotheses about the effect of self-affirmation for health messaging, and suggests intriguing new avenues of research that may expand our knowledge of the effectiveness of self-affirmation exercises and under what circumstances they do and do not work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="sec023"><title>MTurk HIT description</title><p>Participants accessed the survey link through the HIT (Human Intelligence Task).

The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is safe and effective.</p><p>Because signs of autism may appear around the same time children receive the MMR vaccine, some parents may worry that the vaccine causes autism. Vaccine safety experts, including experts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for recent increases in the number of children with autism. A 2004 Institute of Medicine report concluded that there is no link between autism and MMR vaccine, and that there is no link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative.</p><p>Many scientific studies have found no link between MMR vaccine and autism. These studies include:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A September 2008 study published in Public Library of Science was conducted to determine whether results from an earlier study claiming to find measles virus RNA in the intestinal tissue of autistic children could be confirmed.

Only one study was able to obtain some sound results. That study found that any benefits of feeding only appear to occur sporadically under extreme climactic conditions. No research has been able to demonstrate a cost. Aside from costs and benefits to birds, there is a cost and benefit to humanity. The costs are obvious&#x02014;the expense of bird feeding supplies.</p><p>The benefits include learning more about birds and the joy of connecting with the natural world. Bird feeding provides a direct, intimate view of the natural world for more than 50 million Americans who feed the birds in their yards. It is most popular in winter, when birds seem to need the most help. Some people worry that birds will suffer unless they make great efforts to the feeder filled, but research indicates that most birds do not depend on feeders.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>All participants were presented with three outcome questions plus an attention question.
