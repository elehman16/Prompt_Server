Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the patients or their next of kin. All patients fulfilled the ARDS criteria of the American European Consensus Conference on ARDS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] which include the following: identifiable associated condition, acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, pulmonary artery wedge pressure &#x02264;18 mmHg or absence of signs suggesting left atrial hypertension, and PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio &#x02264;200. Patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;100 mmHg), significant arrhythmia, or gross baro-trauma in any form (subcutaneous emphysema, pneumo-mediastinum, or pneumo-thorax) were excluded from the study. Also, patients who were having ARDS of more than 3 days duration were excluded from the study. All the patients were intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube, ventilated with a Hamilton Gallileo ventilator which is equipped with a display screen and software capable of plotting and analyzing the pressure-volume curves. All patients had an arterial line and pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter inserted. The patients were sedated with fentanyl and midazolam and paralyzed with cisatracurium bromide.</p><p>Tidal volume was set at 6 ml/kg, and respiratory rate at 12 per minute in volume control mode. PEEP and FiO<sub>2</sub>were set to obtain an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) value of 90-95% or an arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) of 60-80 mmHg (baseline). Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Each group contained 20 patients. Randomization was done centrally by an independent statistician using a random number table generated by Microsoft Excel to ensure proper concealment of the study management until the release of the final statistical results. An investigator who was responsible for the collection of the data was blinded in respect to the study protocol during whole process of data evaluation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group I underwent the following recruitment maneuver</title><p>The ventilator was set on the CPAP mode and a pressure of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was applied for 40 seconds. The ventilator was then set back to its baseline values.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Group II underwent the following recruitment maneuver</title><p>The V<sub>t</sub>-PEEP values were changed to 6-15, 4-20, and 2-25, each step being 30 seconds (inflation phase). After V<sub>t</sub>-PEEP 2-25, the mode was switched to CPAP of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for a duration of 30 seconds (pause), after which the baseline setting was resumed following the reverse sequence of inflation (deflation phase). This maneuver, which is called extended sigh, was performed twice with one minute of baseline ventilation in between.</p><p>After application of recruitment maneuvers in both groups, derecruitment was prevented by applying a PEEP equal to the lower inflection point (LIP) determined in P-V curve + 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. If the LIP couldn&#x02019;t be determined, the PEEP was set at 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>The primary outcome measures were changes in the respiratory mechanics and gas exchange data whereas the secondary outcome measures were changes in the hemodynamic data as follows:</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Respiratory mechanics</title><p>Static and dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (C<sub>st</sub> and C<sub>dyn</sub>) were also recorded from the display on the ventilator digital monitor at baseline, 3, and 20 minutes after application of the recruitment maneuver. Airway pressures (peak, mean, plateau) were read from the display on the ventilator digital monitor at baseline, 3, and 20 minutes after application of the recruitment maneuver. Pressure volume curves were obtained by the quasistatic method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] at baseline, 3, and 20 minutes after recruitment; analysis of the pressure-volume (P-V) curve of the respiratory system was done as follows: the P-V curve was displayed on the screen of the ventilator, the obtained P-V curve was frozen on the screen, and controlled mechanical ventilation was resumed. Two cursors present on the screen were used to determine the lower and the upper inflection points of the P-V. The parameters were calculated automatically by the ventilator after positioning the cursors. The whole maneuver took 2 minutes at the bedside without requiring any special equipment. Values of pressures at the upper and lower inflection points of the P-V curve were quantified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Gas exchange and hemodynamic data</title><p>Gas tensions and pH were measured at baseline, 3, and 20 minutes after application of the recruitment maneuver.

Cardiac output and cardiac index were measured by the thermo-dilution method. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance indexes (dyn s/cm<sup>5</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) were calculated. All these hemodynamic parameters were measured at baseline, 3, and 20 minutes after application of the recruitment maneuver.</p><p>Two chest X-ray films were taken at baseline and one hour following recruitment. Changes in the chest radiographic patterns induced by the recruitment maneuvers were analyzed. The lung was divided into four quadrants and was evaluated for the presence and extent of intense parenchymal opacification (a homogeneous increase in density that obscures the vascular margins and airway walls) or ground-glass opacity (a hazy homogeneous density with preserved vascular margins). The extent of these radiographic densities was scored using a four-point scale: 0=none; 1=1 quadrant; 2=2 quadrants; 3=3 quadrants and 4=4 quadrants. Emphasis was based on the presence of pneumo-thorax, pneumo-mediastinum, or pneumatocoeles for assessment of the safety of the recruitment maneuvers.</p><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>With a two-sided type I error of 5% and study power at 80%, a mean sample size of 20 patients in each group was found sufficient to demonstrate a clinically relevant difference of 5 ml/cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the respiratory system compliance.</p><p>Baseline patient characteristics and ventilator data in both groups were compared by using the Student <italic>t</italic> test for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for nonparametric data.

However, the extended sigh improved both arterial oxygenation and PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio more than CPAP. Also the hemodynamic parameters were better maintained by the extended sigh. No pneumo-thorax or baro-trauma were detected.</p><p>There is no gold standard in the literature for recruitment maneuvers. The ideal timing, duration, pressure, and mode of recruitment maneuvers have not yet been clearly identified.</p><p>Several methods have been employed to carry out recruitment maneuvers in the clinical setting as well as in experimental models. Rothen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] showed that a sustained inflation maneuver of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 7-8 seconds could reexpand all collapsed lung units as detected on computed tomography scans of the chest and improve oxygenation. In another study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] three consecutive sighs of 45 cmH<sub>2</sub>O plateau pressure were added every minute for an hour. This maneuver provided a significant increase in the end-expiratory lung volume, an increase of the PaO<sub>2</sub>, and a reduction of intrapulmonary shunt.</p><p>Lapinsky <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] applied a sustained inflation maneuver using a pressure of 45 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or the peak pressure at a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg, whichever was lower. The maneuver was applied for a period of 20 seconds. Significant improvement in oxygenation occurred in most of the patients within 10 minutes. The oxygen saturation improved from 86.9 &#x000b1; 5.5 to 94.3 &#x000b1; 2.3%. No baro-trauma or significant complications were recorded; only few patients developed hypotension and mild oxygen desaturation during the 20-second inflation which were reversed immediately upon termination of the inflation. They concluded that sustained inflation is a safe maneuver for alveolar recruitment that improves oxygenation in selected patients and is clinically applicable in the ventilatory strategies for ARDS patients.</p><p>Lim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] used an extended sigh as a recruitment maneuver. This included gradually reducing tidal volumes from 8 to 2 ml/kg and increasing the PEEP from 10 to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in a stepwise manner, each step lasting 30 seconds (inflation phase). When a tidal volume of 2 ml/kg and a PEEP of 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O were reached, a CPAP level of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was applied for 30 seconds (pause), after which a reverse sequence was applied until the baseline settings were resumed (deflation phase). This maneuver provided a significant increase in PaO<sub>2</sub> and static respiratory compliance and was free of any major respiratory or hemodynamic complications.</p><p>Recruitment maneuvers may also be practicable in spontaneously breathing patients. Patroniti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] applied a CPAP of 20% higher than the peak pressure or at least 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O on pressure support ventilation (PSV) for 3-5 seconds every minute, for a minimum of 1 hour. This maneuver showed an improvement in gas exchange, lung volume, and compliance.</p><p>Constantin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] compared two different recruitment maneuvers: a CPAP of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 40 seconds without tidal ventilation and an extended sigh (e-sigh) through maintaining a PEEP level at 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O above the lower inflexion point on the pressure-volume curve for 15 minutes on volume-controlled ventilation. Both maneuvers improved oxygenation at 5 and 60 minutes but improvement was significantly higher with e-sigh than CPAP. Only the e-sigh was associated with an increase of recruited volume whereas the CPAP failed to give this effect. The systolic blood pressure decreased below 70 mmHg during the CPAP maneuver on two occasions resulting in interruption of the recruitment maneuver while there was no significant decrease in blood pressure with the e-sigh.</p><p>Other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] also suggested that recruitment maneuvers using a sustained high inflation pressure may have a deleterious effect on the hemodynamics and thereby may not be recommended.</p><p>Brower <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] performed the ALVEOLI trial to compare higher versus lower PEEP in patients with ARDS. The application of higher PEEP levels improved oxygenation but did not affect survival rate, suggesting that higher PEEP does not provide good impact on mortality when used during low tidal volume ventilation.</p><p>It is well known that higher PEEP values may increase the risk of hyperinflation and baro-trauma, so a compromise must be done between PEEP induced lung recruitment and prevention of hyperinflation. Meade <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] performed the &#x0201c;lung open ventilation&#x0201d; trial in 983 patients with ALI or ARDS and the experimental ventilation strategy included tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg, plateau pressures not exceeding 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, recruitment maneuvers (40-second breath hold at 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O airway pressure) and a table-based PEEP using a scale of PEEP versus FiO<sub>2</sub>. The 28-day mortality rate was 28% in the experimental group and 32% in the controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. Also both groups showed no significant difference related to baro-trauma. However, the authors concluded that this &#x0201c;open-lung&#x0201d; strategy provided improvement in the secondary end-points related to hypoxemia and use of rescue therapies.</p><p>Recently, Lowhagen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] performed the SLRM &#x0201c;slow moderate pressure recruitment maneuver&#x0201d; and compared it against a vital capacity recruitment maneuver (VICM). The two recruitment maneuvers were performed on patients with early ALI/ARDS followed by decremental PEEP titration. SLRM provided the best response in compliance, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> and venous admixture at significantly lower PEEP and plateau pressure.</p><p>Our study suffers from a number of limitations, as the duration of alveolar recruitment was progressive in group II, and for a longer time period, as opposed to group I. Group II was thus exposed to longer duration of maneuvers overall. This difference in the duration of recruitment could potentially have an impact on the outcome measures. Time and pressure stand in relation to the efficacy of a recruitment maneuver. A longer recruitment maneuver with a lower pressure results in fewer hemodynamic side effects and give the lung tissue time to reopen in a more gentle way. Another limitation of the current study may result from the fact that the patients were hypoventilated under baseline ventilator data, and accordingly we cannot answer the following question: if the patients were normoventilated at baseline would the effect of recruitment on gas-exchange variables still be there?</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We found that alveolar recruitment maneuvers were effective in improving oxygenation of mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. The extended sigh was more effective than CPAP as a recruitment strategy. However, the difference between both recruitment maneuvers may not be clinically significant and the outcome seems of no apparent difference as the long-term effects were not provided but only short-term or transient improvement in oxygenation was provided whereas a potential influence on clinical outcome is lacking.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the ICU staff of Minoufiya University hospital for their effort in patient care.
