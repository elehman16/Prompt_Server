This immunologically tolerant state is characterized by both innate as well as adaptive immunodysfunction, such as functional defects in leukocytes, downregulation of cytokines and immunostimulatory membrane-bound receptors, accompanied by the upregulation of negative costimulatory molecules[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A similar phenomenon is observed with virulent respiratory virus infections, such as influenza, which predispose to secondary bacterial or fungal infections[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent cause of the common cold[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with prevalence estimates as high as 80% of the adult population[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HRV infection results in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and subsequent recruitment of immune cells into the nasopharyngeal[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and bronchial mucosa, and secretions[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, HRV-specific neutralizing antibodies are produced, resulting in seroconversion approximately 28 days later[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. HRVs consist of three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and the more recently discovered HRV-C[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to its high virulence, HRV-C can cause systemic and severe respiratory infections in previously healthy subjects[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This has mainly been reported for children, although several adult cases have also been described[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although HRV-A and HRV-B may cause severe infections in young children, immunocompromised patients, and/or patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is unknown to what extent these species induce systemic immunological effects or lower respiratory tract disease in healthy adult subjects. Furthermore, although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that HRV can also induce immunosuppressive or tolerance mechanisms[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], this has never been investigated in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the local respiratory tract and systemic immune response following challenge with HRV-16 (a HRV-A species) using the so-called &#x0201c;experimental cold model&#x0201d;. This model is widely used to investigate the pathogenesis of HRV infection, including the effects on pulmonary function[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], allergies[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and asthma exacerbations[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Subjects were re-challenged with the same virus one week after the first challenge, to investigate whether the primary HRV infection modulates the innate immune response against the second HRV exposure. A one-week interval was chosen, as at this time point the innate immune response induced by the first infection is expected to be largely resolved and specific antibodies have not yet been produced to a large extent[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that seropositivity for HRV is associated with a virtually nullified immune response upon HRV challenge [<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, we only analyzed data from seronegative subjects in the current study.</p><p>Our data indicate that, despite similar viral loads upon both challenges, a second HRV challenge one week after the first results in less pronounced response of several innate immune parameters. This could be the result of immunological tolerance and may be associated with increased vulnerability towards secondary infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>This randomized, placebo-controlled study was part of a larger trial also investigating effects of serostatus and gender on the HRV-induced immune response[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01823640, participant recruitment and follow-up: March-May 2013). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. As this was a pilot study, no power calculation was performed. After approval by the local medical ethics committee CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen (NL42503.091.12; CMO 2012/476), 40 healthy, non-smoking, male and female subjects (ratio 1:1), aged 18&#x02013;35 years gave written informed consent to participate in the study. All study procedures were in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were screened and excluded if they had a (febrile) illness within four weeks before the HRV-challenge, a pre-existent lung disease, or a history of allergic rhinitis. Subjects were not allowed to take (prescription) drugs throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>A flowchart of the study, based on infection rate (further detailed in &#x02018;antibody titer analysis&#x02019; section) is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191937.g001">Fig 1</xref> and the study design is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191937.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Stratification was based on sex and serostatus as follows: Subjects with the same sex were grouped in two groups of 10 subjects (2x n = 10 males; 2x n = 10 females; in total n = 40) subjects. Each group of 10 subjects consisted of roughly 50% seronegatives and 50% seropositives, based on the baseline antibody titers to HRV-16, measured at the screening visit (assay and cutoff value detailed in &#x0201c;antibody titer analysis&#x0201d; section below). Subsequently, one group of the same sex (n = 10) was randomized to the placebo-HRV group, while the other (n = 10) was randomized to the HRV-HRV group. Randomization was carried out by an independent nurse using the sealed envelope method. Subjects were inoculated by an independent nurse with either HRV-16 by instillation of 10<sup>2</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose in 50% of subjects, based on previous studies[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) units of HRV-16, diluted in 0.5 mL 0.9% saline, (n = 20; 10 males; 10 females), or placebo (0.9% saline; n = 20; 10 males; 10 females) into each nostril. Subjects remained in the recumbent position for two minutes after instillation and refrained from touching their nose for 30 minutes. Seven days later, all 40 subjects underwent challenge with HRV-16. For the analyses described in this manuscript, only seronegative subjects were included, as serostatus was shown to exert profound effects on the HRV-induced immune response, which was virtually absent in seropositive subjects[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, we did not stratify our analyses for gender, as we found no differences in any parameters between males and females[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0191937.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0191937.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the study.</title><p>S+ indicates seropositive at baseline; S- indicates seronegative at baseline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0191937.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone.0191937.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0191937.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Experimental design of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0191937.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>HRV-16 virus</title><p>Safety-tested Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP+) grade inoculum pools of HRV-16 were supplied by Respivert Ltd.

As a consequence, the observed attenuated response of several innate immune parameters to the second HRV exposure may be the result of tolerance. These results indicate that viruses causing relatively mild illness also induce attenuation of innate immune responses and may lead to increased vulnerability towards secondary fungal / bacterial infections, or reactivation of viruses that reside latent in the human host[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This could have consequences for vulnerable patient groups, such as the elderly, and might influence vaccination strategies. This finding is supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that have shown that HRV can induce immunosuppressive mechanisms[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The effects observed in the present study are reminiscent of &#x0201c;endotoxin tolerance&#x0201d;, observed after challenging healthy volunteers with bacterial lipopolysaccharide[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and might resemble some aspects of the severely immunosuppressed state observed in patients with sepsis[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and influenza infections[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As such, it is tempting to speculate that previous infection with relatively mild viruses such as HRV renders patients increased vulnerable towards secondary bacterial and/or viral infections. However, additional studies are warranted to assess the clinical relevance of our observations. The tolerance effect observed could be due to desensitization effects on local immune cells or a type-I interferon induced CD8 T-cell mediated anti-viral state where no replication occurs[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For instance, it was shown that HRV can survive in alveolar macrophages and impair the cytokine responses to a second challenge with bacterial ligands[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Along these lines, for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), previous work has demonstrated a post-viral desensitization of alveolar macrophages to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, associated with reduced NF-kappaB activation and chemokine production[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we only included seronegative subjects, because previous work has demonstrated that serostatus alters both HRV-induced symptom scores[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] as well as the HRV-induced immune response, which we showed to be virtually nullified in seropositive subjects[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As such, next to the pathophysiological consequences, our results indicate that a crossover design is neither feasible using a short interval, due to a suppressed innate immune response, nor using a longer interval, due to antibody formation that starts approximately one week after HRV infection[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and severely impacts the immune response[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The mucosal immune response observed in the present study, reflected by the increase in cytokines in nasal wash, is in line with various previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In response to HRV infection, IP-10 was in contrast to other cytokines, produced in nasal wash of all subjects following infection. As such, our results are in accordance with previous studies that have demonstrated that IP-10 is a sensitive marker for HRV infection[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. IP-10 plasma levels did not significantly increase upon a single HRV challenge although a trend was apparent, especially following the first HRV inoculation in subjects who were challenged with HRV twice. In addition, more subjects that were challenged twice demonstrated positive infection (11 in the HRV-HRV group vs. 7 in the placebo-HRV group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191937.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Apparently in this short time frame, the host is not yet capable to induce an effective innate immune response to eliminate HRV, supportive of the immunological tolerance theory. The mild increase of IP-10 plasma levels is in line with studies in asthmatic and COPD patients[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the absence of alterations of all other systemic markers measured, this relatively minor increase might suggest spillover from the nasopharynx to the circulation, although production by cells outside the nasopharynx cannot be excluded.</p><p>Apart from the increase in IP-10, neither systemic symptoms or immune effects were found after HRV infection, nor effects on the lower respiratory tract were observed. These findings suggest that, unlike what has been described for vulnerable groups such as young children, immunocompromised patients, and/or patients with pre-existing airway diseases[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], HRV-16 does not exert these effects in healthy subjects.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we included a relatively low number of subjects, which probably explains that several differences did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Second, we only studied healthy subjects, therefore the observed effects could be different in a diseased population, such as those suffering from sepsis, which might display dysregulated cytokine responses[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Third, we did not store the nasal wash cellular fraction and therefore could not assess cellular markers such as induction of antiviral genes such as type I or III interferons, which play important roles in respiratory viral infections[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we chose to perform the second HRV challenge one week after the first, as at this time point the innate immune response induced by the first infection is expected to be largely resolved, but apparently, viral load and levels of the cytokines in nasal wash had not returned to baseline yet. However, one would expect a further increase in these parameters after a second HRV challenge in case of a normal immune response, while a similar viral load and further decrease in cytokines was apparent. In addition, although tolerance is a plausible explanation for the attenuated immune response, one could speculate about the possibility that, albeit in relatively little quantities, anti-HRV specific antibodies are already present at this time, which could also lead to attenuation of the immune response upon the second HRV-16 challenge. However, studies that investigated kinetics of HRV-induced neutralizing antibodies make this theory less likely[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191937.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that HRV-neutralizing antibodies in both nasal wash and serum are low seven days after HRV inoculation, and their titers begin to rise at approximately two weeks after inoculation[<xref rid="pone.0191937.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], although it should be mentioned that the conventional detection tests used in these studies might be less sensitive in detecting HRV-specific antibodies than the tests that are used nowadays. Nonetheless, our data also show that viral load remained elevated until day 28, when the majority of subjects displayed seroconversion. Therefore, it appears not to be possible to find a suitable time-window to investigate the effects of consecutive HRV challenges without taking into account the possibly confounding effects of the development of an adaptive immune response, leading to the production of anti-HRV specific antibodies. Using a different HRV strain for the second HRV challenge would eliminate the possible influence of HRV-16-specific antibodies on the immune response.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that a second HRV challenge one week after the first results in a less pronounced response of several innate immune parameters. This could indicate that relatively mild viruses can also induce immunosuppression, possibly leading to increased vulnerability towards secondary infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191937.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting Tables and Figures.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191937.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191937.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Study_protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191937.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191937.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191937.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the research nurses (Marieke van der A, Chantal Luijten-Arts, Hellen van Wezel) of the ICU department and Hicham el Moussaoui of the Laboratory of Paediatric Infectious Diseases for their help during the HRV experiments and Cor Jacobs for the flow cytometry analysis.
