The incidence ranges from 15 and 34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Compression atelectasis is observed in the dependent parts of the lung, where cardiac weight, abdominal pressure, and pleural effusions compress the lower lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nondependent parts of the lungs are therefore often overventilated and have barotrauma induced by high ventilator pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A prone position is known to improve oxygenation in about 70% of patients with ALI or ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and to reduce lung stress and strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A supine upright (semirecumbent) position also significantly improves gas exchange in patients with ALI or ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The effect of combining upright and prone positions has not been systematically examined. We hypothesized that in patients with ALI/ARDS, oxygenation improves when combining upright and prone positions because of changes in respiratory mechanics. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized study to investigate the short-term effects of combined upright and prone positioning on gas exchange and lung mechanics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was conducted at a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital between October 2008 and April 2010 and was approved by the institutional ethical review board. According to Austrian law, informed consent of unresponsive patients was obtained from them after they regained responsiveness. Patients were eligible for inclusion if ventilated for ALI or ARDS, and the decision to perform the prone position had been taken by the responsible intensivist. ALI and ARDS were defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Patients were not eligible for the study if a diagnosis of ARDS had been established more than 3 days before evaluation, if younger than 18 or older than 89 years of age, if pregnant, if severe life-threatening hypoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio &#x0003c;60) was present, or a decision to perform extracorporeal gas exchange was taken. Furthermore, patients with elevated intracranial pressure, elevated intraabdominal pressure, unstable spine fractures, life-threatening arrhythmias, or hemodynamic deterioration in whom prone positioning was contraindicated or at least not advisable were excluded. Randomization was performed by opening sealed envelopes containing the allocation to group A or B. All patients were positioned in a low-airloss bed system before the first proning maneuver (ATP Therapulse; KCI Austria, Vienna, Austria). Prone positioning was performed by turning the patients around the longitudinal axis into complete (180 degree) prone position. The head was positioned by supporting one shoulder with a cushion and turning the head toward one side. Additional upright position was achieved by raising the head end and lowering the foot end of the bed to achieve an angle of at least 20 degrees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Cushions were positioned between the feet of the patient and the end of the bed to guard patients against sliding down. To exclude a time-dependent effect, patients were randomized into two groups: In both groups, basal measurements were performed in a supine position immediately before turning the patient prone; in group A, patients were kept in prone position without an upright position for 2 hours followed by 2 hours of prone-plus-upright position. In group B, patients were placed in an upright position immediately after turning them prone for 2 hours, followed by prone position without upright position for another 2 hours. Every hour, blood-gas analysis and measurement of dynamic and static compliance were performed. After this 4-hour period, patients in group A remained in prone-plus-upright position, and patients in group B in prone position without upright position for another 4 hours. A final assessment of gas exchange was performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Compliance of the respiratory system was measured with the Bicore Monitoring System (Bicore CP 100, Bicore, Irvine, California, U.S.A.) by using a self-calibrating flow transducer connected to the endotracheal tube (Varflex; Bicore) and a balloon-equipped nasogastric tube to measure esophageal pressure (SmartCath; Bicore). The compliance of the respiratory system was obtained by the occlusion method by using the inspiratory and expiratory hold function of the ventilator (Servo<sub>i</sub>; Maquet, Solna, Sweden). All respiratory-mechanics data were obtained as an average of three measurements. The calculation of chest wall and lung compliance was performed according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All patients were continuously monitored by ECG, pulse oximetry, and an indwelling arterial catheter. Blood-gas analysis was performed by using an automated blood-gas analyzer (ABL 700; Radiometer Company, Copenhagen, Denmark). Response was defined by an increase in the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio of &#x0003e;10% from baseline. Mechanical ventilation was performed by using a time-cycled pressure-controlled mode. Positive end-expiratory pressure levels were adjusted in increments of 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to maintain the FiO<sub>2 </sub>at 0.6 or less with arterial oxygen saturation of &#x0003e;91%, if possible. The inspiration/expiration ratio was set to 1.0 in all patients. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was kept to the lowest possible level to apply tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg ideal body weight. Respiratory rate was chosen to maintain the PaCO<sub>2 </sub>at levels to avoid respiratory acidosis at less than pH 7.25, as well as to avoid dynamic hyperinflation. Ventilator settings remained unchanged during the study period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Example of a patient in prone position with additional upright position achieved by raising the head end and lowering the foot end of the bed</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc10471-1"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of randomization and study procedures</bold>.

Chest-wall compliance tended to decrease in prone position, yet did not reach statistical significance. When we analyzed responders with respect to oxygenation only, also no statistically significant changes with respect to total respiratory system static compliance, lung static compliance, and chest-wall static compliance were observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results prove for the first time that combining upright with prone position in patients with ARDS can lead to additional improvement of oxygenation. Prone position exerts an improvement on oxygenation over time up to 12 hours or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To exclude a time-dependent effect on gas exchange, patients were randomized into two groups alternating the sequence of positioning maneuvers. The deterioration of oxygenation after reversing upright position in group B seems to exclude such a time-dependent effect. In two patients in group A, however, the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio deteriorated after establishing the upright position. Therefore, when turning a patient prone, it seems advisable to evaluate changes in oxygenation before adding the upright position to be able to differentiate between the effects of the methods.</p><p>Response with respect to oxygenation could be observed in most of our patients; three patients could be classified as responders only after adding the upright position. Response to proning was associated with a worse oxygenation, indicating a better effect in patients with more-severe ARDS. Eighty percent of our patients had pulmonary ARDS, including all nonresponders. Extrapolating our results to all ARDS patients, including those with extrapulmonary ARDS, therefore seems speculative. As pulmonary ARDS, however, has been reported to be associated with a worse response to upright and prone positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a comparable or even more-pronounced effect in patients with extrapulmonary ARDS could be possible. Notably, three of six patients with pulmonary ARDS not responding to proning improved only after adding the upright position. Therefore, adding the upright to the prone position seems a simple and advisable measure before classifying patients as nonresponders.</p><p>With regard to outcome, the prone position failed to improve outcome significantly in several large, randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A recently published meta-analysis, however, showed favorable effects on survival in patients with severe ARDS with a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio &#x0003c;100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Most of our patients showed a higher PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio at inclusion. Interestingly, a higher response rate with respect to oxygenation was observed in patients with lower PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>ratio and a tendency toward higher SAPS II scores, indicating more-severe illness. Obviously, with respect to oxygenation, these patients responded better to positioning maneuvers. Oxygenation has been shown, however, to be a poor surrogate parameter with respect to outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], whereas a decrease in PaCO<sub>2 </sub>after prone position was associated with higher survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, because of the low number of patients and the very short observation period, no conclusions with respect to any effect on outcome by applying the prone-plus-upright position can be derived from our data. It may be speculated, however, that the additional beneficial effects on gas exchange by modifying the prone position, as in our study, could enable a less-invasive ventilation strategy, thus leading to better survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which upright position improves oxygenation are not completely clear. Hoste and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] observed a significant improvement in oxygenation with the upright position and speculated about a resolution of dorsal atelectases and less pressure of the heart and lung tissue as underlying mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this study, no changes in tidal volumes and compliance could be observed. Richard <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], reporting a comparable improvement in oxygenation, additionally measured end-expiratory lung volume. Improvement of oxygenation was associated with an increase in end-expiratory lung volume, pointing toward alveolar recruitment or changes in the compliance of the respiratory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas in this study in nonresponders, these effects were not observed. When analyzing our subgroup of 16 responders, however, no significant changes in compliance could be observed as well (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S2). Recruitment by prone positioning, however, does not necessarily lead to increase of compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that recruitment by prone position is indicated by a decrease of PaCO<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the upright-position studies Hoste and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] did not observe changes in PaCO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the second study did not report PaCO<sub>2 </sub>values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, as we were not able to detect significant changes in the compliance of lungs and chest wall as well as PaCO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, changes in neither lung volume nor recruitment as possible mechanisms leading to improved oxygenation can be derived from our data. It can therefore only be speculated that a caudal shift of the diaphragm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] leads to redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, thus optimizing the ventilation-perfusion relation. By turning a patient prone, improvement of the ventilation-perfusion relation is known to be a major factor contributing to improved gas exchange: although resolution of dorsal atelectases leads to better ventilation and recruitment, perfusion is less gravitation dependent and more evenly distributed in the prone than in the supine position, leading to a decrease in ventilation-perfusion mismatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It must be taken into account, however, that in both studies investigating the effects of supine upright position, head-elevation angles between 40 and 45 degrees were reached, whereas in our study, only angles between 20 and 30 degrees could be achieved. During the prone position, head elevation of more than 30 degrees can hardly be reached with standard bed systems, as in the prone position, only a reverse Trendelenburg position (combined with minimal additional elevation of the bed head at the best) can be performed. These lower angles could have led to less-pronounced effects on lung mechanics, more difficult to detect.</p><p>It should be noticed that we cannot estimate the long-term effects of combining the upright and prone positions, as our measurements were restricted to an 8-hour period. In the studies investigating the effects of the supine upright position, Richard and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] measured short = term effects over a 2-hour period only; in the second study, patients improved over a period of 12 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Prone position could be shown to lead to a sustained improvement of oxygenation even after a period of 12 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, sustained beneficial long-term effects on oxygenation when combining both methods may be expected, yet cannot be derived from our data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Conclusively, the prone position and the additional upright position may exert additive beneficial effects on oxygenation in patients with ARDS and could be attempted routinely when deciding to turn a patient prone.
