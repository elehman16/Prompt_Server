Difficult or unsuccessful tracheal intubation is one of the important causes for morbidity and mortality in both emergency and operative settings.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Laryngoscopes play an important role in the administration of general anaesthesia and in securing the airway in emergency conditions. They range from simple rigid scopes to complex fibreoptic video devices. With the advances in technology, new devices are available for airway management. The Airtraq&#x02122; (Prodol Meditec SA, Vizcaya, Spain) is a novel optical laryngoscope designed to facilitate management of normal and difficult airways. As a result of the exaggerated curvature of the blade and the internal arrangement of optical components, a view of the glottis is provided without alignment of oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes. The blade of the Airtraq&#x02122; consists of two side by side channels; one channel acts as a conduit through which tracheal tube is passed while the other has a series of lenses, prisms and mirrors with a built in antifog system which transmit the image from the illuminated tip to the proximal viewfinder.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The McCoy&#x02122; laryngoscope (Penlon) is designed to elevate the epiglottis with its hinged tip and requires less lifting force during laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is frequently used to facilitate tracheal intubation when the view of the glottic opening is restricted.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Manual inline axial stabilisation (MIAS) of the cervical spine is widely used in clinical practice in patients with actual or suspected cervical spinal injuries, to reduce the risk of cord injury during tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>This randomised, prospective study was designed to determine the relative effectiveness of Airtraq&#x02122; over conventional Macintosh and McCoy&#x02122; laryngoscope in patients undergoing tracheal intubation with MIAS technique. We hypothesised that Airtraq&#x02122; with its anatomical curvature would perform better while intubating patients by MIAS technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval by the hospital Research Ethics Committee, and written informed patient consent, ninety American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I&#x02013;II patients, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, scheduled for various elective surgeries under general anaesthesia requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled in this single-blinded, prospective randomised clinical trial.</p><p>Patients with risk factors for difficult intubation (modified Mallampati class III and IV, thyromental distance &#x0003c;6 cm, interincisor distance &#x0003c;3 cm, body mass index more than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), risk for gastric aspiration, relevant drug allergy were excluded from the study. All data were collected during preanaesthetic evaluation by an independent observer.</p><p>Patients were randomised to undergo tracheal intubation based on the allocation sequence generated using online randomisation software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>), with Macintosh, McCoy&#x02122; or Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope, and the allocation concealed in sealed envelopes, which were opened after patient consent had been obtained. In the operation theatre, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure and end tidal carbondioxide monitors were attached. Patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Intravenous premedication was given with injection glycopyrolate 10 &#x003bc;g/kg, injection midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg. Intravenous induction was done with injection propofol 2 mg/kg. All patients were manually ventilated and injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg intravenous was administered as muscle relaxant. After the onset of neuromuscular block, the neck was immobilised by MIAS, which was achieved by an assistant standing on the side of bed and using fingers and palms of both hands to stabilise patient's occiput and mastoid process.</p><p>Group A patients were intubated using conventional Macintosh laryngoscope, Group B with McCoy&#x02122; laryngoscope and Group C with optical Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope by the same anaesthesiologist who was experienced in using all three laryngoscopes. An intubation attempt was defined as one advancement of the tube in the direction of the glottis during direct laryngoscopy. A maximum of three attempts at intubation were permitted after which it was considered as failed intubation attempt and the anaesthetist utilised an alternative predetermined rescue laryngoscope. Following intubation, patients were mechanically ventilated for the duration of the surgical procedure and anaesthesia was maintained using isoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. During the 5 min, period immediately following tracheal intubation, no other interventions were performed, nor were any drugs administered. Subsequent management of the patient was left to the discretion of anaesthesiologist providing care for the patients.</p><p>The primary objective was assessment of the difficulty of tracheal intubation based on intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], a quantitative scale of difficult intubation with seven variables assessing the complexity of tracheal intubation, developed by Adnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] An IDS score of zero implies the best intubation conditions, while progressively more difficult tracheal intubations result in higher scores.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Intubation difficulty scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-61-332-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The secondary objectives were glottic view according to Cormack-Lehane grading, number of optimisation techniques (use of bougie, different size blade, stylet), impact on haemodynamic variables such as heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, which were recorded preintubation, 1, 3 and 5 min after intubation. Preintubation values were taken as baseline measurements. Any adverse events such as arrhythmias, oral trauma, fall in saturation were recorded.</p><p>The sample size estimation was based on our primary objective, namely the IDS score. Based on prior study,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] the clinically significant change in mean IDS score between groups was considered as 2.0 with expected standard deviation of 2.25. Using &#x0038f;&#x000b1; = 0.05 and power of study being 80%, we estimated that 27 patients were required in each group. Thus, ninety patients with thirty in each group were enrolled in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20. The patients demographic profile, IDS score, Cormack-Lehane grade, number of optimisation techniques and haemodynamic parameters were analysed using ANOVA and each device was compared with other two using Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test.

Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope resulted in significantly better glottic view with lower Cormack-Lehane grade and had a statistically significant less optimisation manoeuvres during intubation than Macintosh and McCoy&#x02122; group and offered easier intubating conditions.</p><p>Management of difficult airway continues to be a challenge even in the hands of most experienced anaesthesiologists despite the invention of many novel airway devices. MIAS is widely used in clinical practice in patients with actual or suspected cervical spinal injuries to reduce the risk of cord injury during tracheal intubation and has become established standard of care for head trauma patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A key concern is, when the neck is immobilised by MIAS, it makes more difficult in aligning the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes to visualise the cords.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The factors that influence the magnitude of haemodynamic changes during laryngoscopy are the duration of laryngoscopy and intubation, type of laryngoscope[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used, anaesthetic agent and the depth of anaesthesia. The pressor response following laryngoscopy can lead to complications such as myocardial ischaemia, cardiac failure, increase in intracranial pressure and intraocular pressure.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>A study comparing Macintosh and Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscopes in patients with cervical spine immobilisation reported significantly higher IDS scores in Macintosh group compared to the Airtraq&#x02122; group, which was similar to our results.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A better success rate of intubation was reported[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with Airtraq&#x02122; in patients with cervical immobilisation with the application of rigid cervical collar. In our study MIAS technique was used instead of cervical collar, which restricts mouth opening. A recent study reported that Airtraq&#x02122; produces 66% less movement of the cervical spine during MIAS when compared with the Macintosh and further underlines the utility of this device in this setting.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Since the technique of MIAS makes glottic view difficult by increasing the Cormack Lehane grade, our study highlights the use of Airtraq&#x02122; over conventional laryngoscope with 77% grade 1 glottic view. These results are supported by studies comparing the laryngeal view during tracheal intubation using Airtraq&#x02122;, McCoy&#x02122; and Macintosh laryngoscopes which concluded that Cormack-Lehane grade was statistically significantly lower with the Airtraq&#x02122; device.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It is reported that the intubation with Airtraq&#x02122; did not require any optimisation manoeuvres, in comparison to Macintosh group in a similar study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Our study highlights similar findings in Indian population while comparing conventional Macintosh, McCoy&#x02122; and novel Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope.</p><p>The haemodynamic findings in our study was comparable to other studies using Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope in different scenarios like in patients with normal airway,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] anticipated difficult airway[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and also in a comparative study between the use of Macintosh laryngoscope and Airtraq&#x02122; in patients with cervical spine immobilisation, which reported statistically significant increase in both heart rate and mean arterial pressure in Macintosh group than Airtraq&#x02122; group.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Oxygen saturation showed no significant difference between the groups.</p><p>The internal arrangements of the high definition optical give a high quality and wide angle view of glottis, surrounding structures and the tip of the endotracheal tube. The exaggerated anatomical curvature of the blade of Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope does not require alignment of oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes, thus resulting less lifting force needed during laryngoscopy and less haemodynamic response during intubation. The recent guidelines published by the Difficult Airway Society for the management of difficult intubation advocates consideration of alternative video laryngoscopes in the primary intubation plan.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation of patients with head injury with potential cervical spinal injury is a high-risk procedure. MIAS reduces segmental angular rotation and distraction and therefore potentially protects the patients from further injury. With the advances in technology, a large number of novel laryngoscope devices have been available in recent years, despite having a relatively limited base supporting their use in different clinical situations. Our study highlights the clinical utility of optical Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope in patients undergoing intubation with MIAS.</p><p>We acknowledge that there are few limitations with regard to our study. Blinding the anaesthesiologist involved in intubation was not possible and measurements like laryngoscopic grading and lifting force applied are subjective in nature. In our study all the three devices were used by experienced anaesthesiologist and the results are variable in the hands of inexperienced ones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The novel optical Airtraq&#x02122; laryngoscope provides better intubation conditions with greater ease of intubation, better glottic view and lesser haemodynamic alterations during laryngoscopy as compared to McCoy&#x02122; and Macintosh laryngoscope.
