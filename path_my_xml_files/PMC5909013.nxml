the effects of three acute exercises in the sitting position&#x02014;stepping, stretching, and
finger movement&#x02014;on older adults&#x02019; executive functioning in comparison to a resting state
(i.e., control condition). [Subjects and Methods] Participants were 26 healthy older
adults (mean age, 71.8 &#x000b1; 4.7&#x02005;years). All participants performed the three sitting
exercises for 10 minutes; resting for an equal amount of time was used as a control
condition. These four conditions were presented in random order. The color-word matching
Stroop task was used to evaluate executive function before and after the sitting exercises
and control condition. [Results] All three sitting exercises significantly reduced Stroop
interference scores, while the control condition did not. There was a significant
difference between the finger movement exercise and the control condition in
pre-to-post-intervention changes in Stroop interference scores. [Conclusion] The acute
finger movement exercise was especially beneficial for executive function as evaluated by
the color-word matching Stroop task.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chair exercise</kwd><kwd>Executive function</kwd><kwd>Motor function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Previous reviews on the relationship between acute exercise and cognitive function
concluded that executive function is temporarily enhanced after acute exercises<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, the exercise mode is a determining factor of this cognitive enhancement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, cycling exercises appear to
lead to greater enhancement than does running<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, both aerobic exercise and resistance training
improved executive function on the Stroop task<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas only aerobic exercise enhanced working memory<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, one systematic review revealed that the participants of most previous studies in
this area utilized young adult participants<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, while few targeted older adults. Because cognitive decline is a
serious problem among older adults, this population should be studied in greater detail.
Typically, interventions for older adults rely on exercises in sitting and standing
positions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sitting exercises can be used with both healthy and frail older
adults, because they are relatively safe to perform<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, we targeted 3 sitting exercises (stepping as aerobic
exercise, stretching, and finger movements) to determine the effects of acute exercises on
executive function. In Japan, these exercises have been frequently used in community
settings for older adults and in facilities that cater to this age group, such as day care
centers. Identifying effective intervention methods that employ sitting exercises might help
in developing beneficial programs for older adults. This study aimed to examine the effects
of these 3 acute exercises in the sitting position on executive function by comparing it
with a control condition in healthy older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Community flyers were used to recruit study participants. The inclusion criteria were: (1)
&#x02265;65&#x02005;years old and (2) no medical history of stroke, heart disease, or neurological disease
(as these conditions would have disrupted participants&#x02019; ability to exercise). Forty
participants met both criteria and were then screened for dementia and depressive disorder
as additional exclusion criteria. One participant dropped out before undergoing this
screening process. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, administered by occupational therapists, was used to screen for
dementia (applying a cut-off of &#x0003c;23/24 as too low to continue). Depressive disorder was
evaluated by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, with a cut-off point of &#x02265;11. No participants had dementia or
depressive disorder. During the experimental period, two further participants dropped out.
Moreover, according to a previous study<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, we excluded 11 participants who had a Stroop task correct answer
rate of less than 80% on at least one trial. Thus, we ultimately analyzed data from 26
community-dwelling older adults (eight men and 18 women, age: 71.8 &#x000b1; 4.7&#x02005;years, MMSE: 28.7 &#x000b1;
1.2; GDS: 3.0 &#x000b1; 2.5). This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of University of
Tsukuba (Ref No., Tai 27-132). All participants were provided with an explanation of the
study and obtained their written informed consent prior to their enrollment in the
study.</p><p>Participants took part in 4 sessions: the 3 types of sitting exercises (stepping,
stretching, and finger movements) and a control condition, administered in a randomized
order (randomization was performed using a random number table). For each sitting exercise
session, participants were first asked to perform the Stroop Color Word Test task
(approximately 6 minutes long), after which they engaged in one of the three types of
sitting exercise for 10 minutes. Participants then rested for 3 minutes before and 5 minutes
after each sitting exercise. After completing each exercise, the participants performed the
Stroop task again. In the control session, participants engaged in a 10-minute rest instead
of one of the sitting exercises. To avoid any residual effects, participants were not
allowed to participate in the experiment for 2 days consecutively. Additionally, we asked
participants to avoid exercising before the measurements.</p><p>In the stepping exercise, participants were asked to step at their usual pace while sitting
on a 41-cm chair for 10 minutes. For stretching, we used the sitting version of the
stretching program. The program involves static and dynamic stretching such as flexion and
extension of the neck and lateral bending of the trunk. Participants performed the program
for 10 minutes while watching a video that demonstrated the exercise movements. For the
finger movement exercise, participants performed symmetrical or asymmetrical movements of
bending and extending each finger for 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

in this study, because previous studies have used it to evaluate the effects of acute
exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The task was displayed on a computer screen placed in front of the
participants. The task display comprised upper and lower rows: the upper row depicted a
figure or word colored red, blue, yellow, or green, and the lower row depicted one of the
following words: &#x0201c;RED,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;BLUE,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;YELLOW,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;GREEN.&#x0201d; If the color of the character
displayed in the upper row was the same as the meaning of the word in the lower row, the
trial is considered correct. Otherwise, the trial was considered incorrect. For neutral
trials, the upper row displayed a figure, while for incongruent trials, the upper row
displayed a word.</p><p>A total of 60 trials were included in each session, 30 neutral and 30 incongruent. These 60
trials were broken into four sets of 15 trials, each containing a random assortment of
neutral and incongruent trials. Each trial was separated by an interval of 3 seconds, while
each set was separated by 30 seconds. Although the trials were randomly presented, we
programed it such that there would be a correct answer rate of 50% for all sessions. The
upper row was presented for 350&#x02005;ms before the word in the lower row was displayed, and each
trial was displayed for 2 seconds. Participants answered using buttons labeled &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; (i.e.,
correct) or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; (i.e., incorrect), and were asked to answer as quickly as possible. The
response time and error rate were measured in each trial. Before the start of the
experiment, participants performed two sessions as practice (for a total of 120 trials).
Moreover, participants were required to carry out 20 trials as practice on each experimental
day.</p><p>To determine the effects of each exercise, we compared the reaction times in the neutral
and incongruent trials with the Stroop interference (yielded by subtracting the reaction
time of neutral trials from that of incongruent trials) before and after each session using
a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (intervention &#x000d7; time). As an
ancillary analysis, we analyzed the number of incorrect answers in the same manner. A
decrease in the Stroop interference from before to after the session indicated improvement.
Simple main effect analyses with Bonferroni corrections were performed for significant
interactions. Post hoc multiple comparisons using Dunnett&#x02019;s test, with the control condition
as a reference, were also performed because the purpose of this study was to determine which
exercises were effective in comparison to the control condition. All analyses were conducted
using SPSS Statistics 21.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A p&#x0003c;0.05 was
regarded as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The means and SDs of the participants&#x02019; characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="478"><col width="48%" span="1"/><col width="52%" span="1"/><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.7 &#x000b1; 4.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Women, n (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (69.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Education (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.4 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.7 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GDS (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0 &#x000b1; 2.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SD: standard deviation; MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination; GDS: Geriatric

executive function in healthy older adults. All three sitting exercises were found to
moderate Stroop interference, indicating that they improved executive function. Moreover,
the change in Stroop interference was significantly greater after the finger movement

older adults<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In agreement with these
studies, we confirmed that acute exercises enhanced executive function as assessed with a
Stroop task. Although these previous studies adopted aerobic exercises such as cycling<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, we selected sitting exercises to identify
which would be most effective. Based on the results of the multiple comparisons using
Dunnett&#x02019;s test, the finger movement exercise was especially effective for improving
executive function. While our study cannot explain why an acute finger movement exercise
improved executive function, some previous findings might be able to explain the results. In
particular, complex hand movement appears to have a stronger association with cognitive
function than does simpler movement, such as tapping<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, performing a complex task using the fingers has been
shown to result in greater brain activation than does performing a simple task<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Aerobic exercise is known to improve executive function in a variety of populations,
including younger<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, middle-aged<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and older adults<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. One previous study reported that chair exercises that
included stepping and stretching were 1.5&#x02013;3.0 metabolic equivalents in participants with
diabetes (age: 66 &#x000b1; 3&#x02005;years)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although
this study did not measure exercise intensity, the stepping and stretching exercises in a
sitting position were more likely to use cardiopulmonary functions than were the finger
exercise, and these sitting exercises showed significant improvements in Stroop
interference. Our results suggested that, similar to regular aerobic exercise, mild aerobic
exercises with sitting positions are effective in maintaining executive function.</p><p>The strengths of our study are that we examined 3 types of sitting exercises simultaneously
and compared their effects on executive function in healthy older adults. However, there are
some limitations in this study. First, although we could expect that the intensities of the
3 sitting exercises were low, we did not provide definite measures of exercise intensity.
Future studies should address exercise intensity in sitting exercises because it is possible
that different results would be obtained when moderate to high intensity exercise in the
sitting position were conducted. Second, none of the participants in this study had
dementia, depression, or physical frailty, which means that we cannot discount the
possibility that our results might differ according to participants&#x02019; physical or cognitive
function. Therefore, participants with frailty or mild cognitive impairment might show
different results. Finally, although we found immediate effects of acute sitting exercise on
executive function, the long-term effects are unclear. Future studies should perform short-
or long-term interventions to reveal the continuous effects.</p><p>Based on our results and those in past studies, we can conclude that acute exercises in a
sitting position are beneficial for executive function, regardless of the exercise mode.
However, the finger movement exercise was found to be especially beneficial. Because the
finger exercise does not require any equipment and can be widely recommended, including to
frail adults, our findings might be useful for older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from Meiji Yasuda Life Foundation of Health and
