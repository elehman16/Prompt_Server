Trial 1182.33, an open-label, randomized trial, compared two TPV/r dose combinations versus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r). Eligible adults, who had no prior antiretroviral therapy were randomized to twice daily (BID) 500/100 mg TPV/r, 500/200 mg TPV/r, or 400/100 mg LPV/r. Each treatment group also received Tenofovir 300 mg + Lamivudine 300 mg QD. The primary endpoint was a confirmed viral load (VL) &#x0003c;50 copies/mL at week 48 without prior antiretroviral regimen changes. Primary analyses examined CD4-adjusted response rates for non-inferiority, using a 15% non-inferiority margin. At week 48, VL&#x0003c;50 copies/mL was 68.4%, 69.9%, and 72.4% in TPV/r100, TPV/r200, and LPV/r groups, respectively, and TPV/r groups showed non-inferiority to LPV/r. Discontinuation due to adverse events was higher in TPV/r100 (10.3%) and TPV/r200 (15.3%) recipients versus LPV/r (3.2%) recipients. The frequency of grade &#x02265;3 transaminase elevations was higher in the TPV/r200 group than the other groups, leading to closure of this group. However, upon continued treatment or following re-introduction after treatment interruption, transaminase elevations returned to grade &#x02264;2 in &#x0003e;65% of patients receiving either TPV/r200 or TPV/r100. The trial was subsequently discontinued; primary objectives were achieved and continuing TPV/r100 was less tolerable than standard of care for initial highly active antiretroviral therapy. All treatment groups had similar 48-week treatment responses. TPV/r100 and TPV/r200 regimens resulted in sustained treatment responses, which were non-inferior to LPV/r at 48 weeks. When compared with the LPV/r regimen and examined in the light of more current regimens, these TPV/r regimens do not appear to be the best options for treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients based on their safety profiles.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Boehringer-Ingelheim.

During the course of tipranavir&#x02019;s (TPV) development for treatment of patients with resistant HIV, substantial efficacy was demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on therapies available at the time, approximately 50% of patients receiving first-line therapy would fail by 1 year, chiefly because of emerging resistance [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It was hypothesized that first-line treatment with TPV could achieve useful efficacy and might prevent the emergence of PI resistance, because of a high genetic barrier to the emergence of resistance. Therefore, this trial was undertaken in 2004&#x02013;2006 with the aspiration of avoiding emergence of ARV resistance during first-line therapy.</p><p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly advanced HIV-1 treatment over the past decade, and first-line therapy regimens have become much more effective in achieving and maintaining long-term virologic suppression of plasma HIV RNA [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Although suppression of HIV replication with first-line therapy is reported in up to 90% cases, virologic treatment failure may still occur in patients treated with cART [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], limiting treatment options and increasing the risk of death [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A substantial prevalence of transmitted ARV resistance among newly infected individuals is well documented [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; up to 20% of untreated patients may demonstrate resistance to ARV drugs in at least one class [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since treatment failure is frequently attributed to the presence or emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants, [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] ARVs with unique resistance profiles and high genetic barriers to resistance may improve treatment outcome, by leveraging drugs with unique resistance profiles and higher genetic barriers to resistance.</p><p>Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrating slow evolution of PI resistance in HIV-1 isolates exposed to TPV [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this trial was conducted to observe if resistance could be minimized. TPV, co-administered with ritonavir (TPV/r) to attain therapeutic concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], achieved good virologic responses in a small treatment-na&#x000ef;ve study [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in two large triple-class-experienced patient studies [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. TPV/r was safe and well tolerated in the 14-day na&#x000ef;ve patient trial [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Forty-eight-week results from RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 show that TPV/r 500/200 mg twice daily (BID), along with an optimized backbone regimen (OBR), had superior efficacy in viral suppression and immunologic responses versus an investigator-selected, ritonavir (RTV)-boosted comparator protease inhibitor (CPI/r) in more than 1400 highly treatment-experienced patients [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The 1182.33 trial was conducted to evaluate the potential role of TPV/r in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-1-infected adults. In this 48-week, randomized, open-label trial, the efficacy and safety of two dose combinations of TPV/r (500/200 mg or 500/100 mg BID) was compared with the active control group, lopinavir plus ritonavir (LPV/r). Each treatment group also received a standardized nucleoside/nucleotide backbone regimen. In vitro inhibition of wild-type HIV-1 is achieved with lower TPV concentrations than those seen with the 500/200 mg BID dose. Therefore, the lower RTV dose was included for testing because it results in lower TPV concentrations; these lower exposures with a 500/100 mg BID dose were projected to decrease adverse effects of TPV and yet provide adequate inhibitory concentrations. In this report, we provide the final trial data, and put the results into historical and clinical context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients</title><p>HIV-1-infected men and women &#x02265;18 years of age who have never previously been treated with ART (up to 7 days of previous treatment was allowed), CD4+ cell count &#x0003c;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, viral load (VL) &#x02265;5000 copies/mL of plasma HIV-1 RNA at screening, and acceptable laboratory values were eligible.

Patients were randomized to receive open-label TPV/r 500/100 mg BID, TPV/r 500/200 mg BID, or LPV/r 400/100 mg BID in combination with a backbone regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC). Patients were randomized centrally at a ratio of 1:1:1 in blocks of six. Centers were restricted to no more than 40 patients. Randomization was stratified by screening CD4 count (&#x02264;200 or &#x0003e;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) but not by the center.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment response at week 48, defined as a confirmed virologic response (two consecutive VL measurements &#x02264;50 copies/mL) without prior virologic failure, discontinuation of study drug, loss to follow-up, introduction of a new drug, or death. Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to treatment failure (TTF), using VL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL and VL &#x0003c;400 copies/mL as response criteria; treatment and virologic response at all visits, using VL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL and VL &#x0003c;400 copies/mL as response criteria; change from baseline in VL (log<sub>10</sub> transformed) and CD4+ cell counts at each visit; patients with new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) AIDS-defining illness or death; and time to new AIDS-defining illness or death. Treatment failure is the complementary outcome to treatment success: the absence of confirmed virologic response (two consecutive VL measurements, &#x02264;50 copies/mL) without prior virologic failure by week 48; discontinuation of study drug; loss to follow-up; introduction of a new ARV drug (except for reason of toxicity); or death. An additional analysis of TTF used &#x02264;400 copies/mL as an alternative viral load threshold.</p><p>Safety endpoints were incidences of any adverse event (AE), any serious adverse events (SAEs), or chemistry and hematology test abnormalities. Analysis included empirical distribution of time to AEs and laboratory abnormalities of interest, including first SAE, grade 3/4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, grade 3/4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, occurrence of diarrhea and/or vomiting, grade 3/4 triglycerides abnormality, and grade 3/4 cholesterol abnormality. Provisions were made for treatment interruption to reduce transaminase elevations in cases with grade &#x02265;3 transaminase elevations.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Treatment</title><p>Patient and investigator were blinded to treatment assignment until after all eligibility criteria were met and the patient was randomized to his/her treatment assignment. Patients randomized to the TPV/r200 group initially took TPV/r 500/100 mg BID for 2 weeks. The 2-week lead-in regimen was used because the pre-steady state concentrations of TPV and RTV are higher in patients without prior liver enzyme induction (e.g., treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients) than is seen in patients with previous induction experience (e.g., treatment-experienced patients). This strategy aimed at avoiding TPV concentrations above the target level during the early dosing period in the 200 mg RTV group.</p><p>A backbone ARV regimen consisting of a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI, TDF 300 mg) plus a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI, 3TC 300 mg) once daily was administered. A change from 3TC or TDF to another NRTI was allowed if toxicity or intolerance was clearly attributed to backbone medication. Patients were considered for withdrawal from the study and appropriate alternative therapy initiated if (i) VL had not dropped for at least 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> after the initial 12 weeks of treatment; and (ii) patients failed to achieve VL &#x0003c; 100,000 copies/mL after 12 weeks of treatment, despite a 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL reduction after 12 weeks; or (iii) had VL &#x0003e; 400 copies/mL confirmed at two consecutive visits &#x0003e;2 weeks apart following a confirmed virologic response.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Sample analysis</title><p>Plasma HIV-RNA concentrations, CD4+ cell counts, and safety laboratory evaluations were performed for every visit while patients remained on study. Study visits were scheduled at 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks and then every 12 weeks until study completion. HIV-RNA concentrations were assayed and quantified using the Roche Amplicor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HIV-1 Monitor Standard or Ultrasensitive Assay, Version 1.5, by Covance Central Laboratory Services. Baseline HIV genotypic resistance assessments were performed by VIRCO using their Virtual Phenotype<sup>TM</sup> assay. Phenotypes were determined using VIRCO&#x02019;s Antivirogram assay.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was estimated using nQuery Advisor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 4.0 by using the simulation of the lower confidence limit for difference in proportions for a one-sided 98.8% confidence interval (CI). A sample size of 180 per group was needed to achieve an 80% power for response rate in all groups of 70%. Primary efficacy analysis of available data was performed after all patients completed week 48. Analyses were based on treatment assigned at randomization. Primary analysis compared the treatment response of each TPV/r treatment group to that of the LPV/r group, using a two-sided 97.5% CI for the difference in response rates, adjusted by baseline CD4 strata (Bonferroni adjustment). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the CI did not exceed the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 15%. Additional analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints used descriptive statistics for all variables, logistic regression for treatment and virologic response, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for change from baseline in VL and CD4 count, and Cox proportional hazards and log-rank tests for time to event endpoints. Analysis of binary endpoints followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, where missing values were replaced using the non-completers considered failures (NCF) approach. For continuous endpoints, including VL and CD4+ cell counts, change from baseline missing values was imputed for analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.

The proportions of patients who achieved a treatment response at 48 weeks were greater in the high CD4 stratum (&#x0003e;200 CD4 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) than the low CD4 stratum: 74.8% (77/103), 79.1% (68/86), and 81.2% (82/101) of patients in the TPV/r100, TPV/r200, and LPV/r groups, respectively.

The difference in response rates across strata can be attributed to a higher rate of virologic failures in the low CD4 strata (22.8%) than in the high strata (8.3%), with no notable differences among treatment groups.</p><p>Treatment response at week 48, analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for CD4 stratum, indicated no significant difference in achieving a response across the treatment groups (odds ratios [ORs] of 0.82 [CI: 0.52, 1.29; p = 0.3824] and 0.94 [CI: 0.60, 1.49; p = 0.8011] for TPV/r100 and TPV/r200, respectively, versus LPV/r; overall p = 0.6648). CD4+ cell count at baseline had a significant effect on treatment response in all treatment groups, with patients in the low strata less likely to achieve a response than patients in the high strata (OR = 0.44 [CI: 0.30, 0.64]; p&#x0003c;0.0001).

The response rate for patients with baseline VL &#x02265;100,000 copies/mL was less for all three treatment groups, with that for TPV/r100 being slightly lower than for other groups (56.7%, 62.7%, and 65.0% for TPV/r100, TPV/r200, and LPV/r, respectively).

Additionally, reduction in VL was rapid for all three treatment groups, with between &#x02212;1.5 and &#x02212;2 log<sub>10</sub> median decreases at 2 weeks. At 48 weeks, similar VL reductions (greater than 3 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) were observed for all three treatment groups. Immunological recovery was evident in TPV and LPV groups, with sustained increases in CD4+ cell count. These results support the potent antiviral effect of TPV. These final results differ slightly from the preliminary results previously presented [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], because missing data on one patient in the TPV/r100 group became available only after the Glasgow presentation. At the time, it appeared that the TPV/r100 group exceeded the 15% boundary for non-inferiority (treatment response for LPV/r: 72.4%; TPV/r100: 67.9%; [difference: &#x02212;4.6% (&#x02212;15.03, 5.8)]). The response rates for TPV/r200 and LPV/r remain unchanged between the Glasgow meeting and the final analyses ((treatment response for TPV/r200: 69.9%; [difference: &#x02212;1.0% (&#x02212;11.4, 9.4)]).</p><p>It should be noted that since this trial was intended as the initial examination of TPV/r in na&#x000ef;ve patients, the sample size was modest and therefore the non-inferiority bound was set at 15%, since this was considered an exploratory Phase 2B trial.</p><p>Subset analysis using the baseline stratification of patients by CD4+ cell count and VL showed similar results between treatment groups. As seen in studies of other treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients, patients in the higher CD4+ strata were more likely to achieve treatment responses [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>HIV genotypes were mostly of clade B subtype, but the proportion of non-B subtypes with three or four TPV score mutations was almost 40-fold greater than that of the B subtype at baseline. Furthermore, the distribution of non-B subtypes was similar across treatment groups. The Stanford University HIV Resistance Database shows that non-B subtypes tend to be more TPV resistant [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite patients with non-B subtypes tending to have more TPV score mutations at baseline, there was no evidence of meaningful response differences between clade B and non-B subtypes.</p><p>The protease inhibitor polymorphisms detected at trial entry represent PI non-key mutations; these polymorphisms differ from the key mutations, the presence of which results in high level PI resistance. These polymorphisms almost certainly represent naturally occurring sequences and are unlikely to imply any prior PI treatment in the study&#x02019;s treatment na&#x000ef;ve patients.</p><p>Testing of the post treatment isolates revealed no emergent phenotypic resistance upon virologic rebound. Specifically, the phenotypic susceptibility classification did not change for any of the 21 patients whose post-rebound isolates were tested. Reverse transcriptase mutation M184I/V was identified in over half of the viruses from patients with virologic rebound, similar to that reported previously in studies of PIs used with 3TC [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Absence of any emerging PI resistance during treatment with TPV was expected due to the high genetic barrier to resistance, as has been seen with other RTV-boosted PIs in HIV-1-infected treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients.</p><p>Most commonly reported AEs among all three treatment groups were GI events, mostly moderate in intensity. Compared to the LPV/r group, both TPV/r groups had higher discontinuations rates due to AEs, largely due to higher rates of discontinuation for GI AEs and transaminase elevations in both TPV/r arms. The open-label design could have influenced investigators&#x02019; decisions to discontinue therapy in TPV patients with GI events. However, a majority of TPV/r200 patients with grade 3/4 transaminase increases could continue therapy uninterrupted or after re-challenge, and levels returned to grade &#x02264;2 in all instances. Fatalities during the trial were uncommon among these treatment-naive patients; a total of nine (1.6%) deaths were reported, of which eight were during treatment or within 30 days following drug discontinuation. One occurred after 30 days of follow-up. Few episodes of treatment-emergent AIDS-defining illnesses were reported. There were only six drug-related SAEs reported. The results indicate that TPV meets the non-inferiority criteria used in this trial despite the reported AE rates, based on the predefined non-inferiority margin of 15% (which is larger than the current generally accepted margin of 10%&#x02013;12%).</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the results of this study suggest that TPV/r should not be considered for use in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV patients. Although the trial demonstrated efficacy similar to a standard of care at the time the trial was conducted, the safety and drug interaction profiles [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] are not compatible with first-line therapy. Furthermore, the current standards of care have evolved; neither the IAS-USA nor DHHS Guidelines now include LPV/r + TDF + 3TC as first-line therapy [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144917.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the first-line therapy standard to which TPV/r was compared is no longer as relevant as it was in 2004&#x02013;2006. Currently recommended first-line therapy is generally recognized as having fewer drug-associated adverse events, a more manageable drug interaction profile and more patient-friendly pill burden. For second-line or later therapy, it is critical that new regimens contain at least 2 (preferably 3) active ARV drugs [<xref rid="pone.0144917.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, there may be need for TPV/r-containing combination regimens in a small number of late-stage treatment patients, who have developed PI resistance, and are unable to use other regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this trial, conducted in 2004&#x02013;2006, both TPV/r100 and TPV/r200 regimens showed sustained treatment responses in approximately 70% of patients, which were non-inferior to LPV/r at 48 weeks. VL reductions and CD4+ cell count increases were similar among treatment groups. However, these TPV/r regimens do not appear to be appropriate options among currently available therapies for treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients. Current therapies have improved adverse event and drug interaction profiles, as well as more patient-friendly pill burdens. The authors suggest that TPV/r regimens should not be used for treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144917.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>List of local Independent Ethics Committees and Institutional Review boards</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144917.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144917.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>CONSORT check list</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144917.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing, editorial support, and formatting assistance was provided by Dr. Annirudha Chillar, MD, PhD of CACTUS communications, which was contracted and funded by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
