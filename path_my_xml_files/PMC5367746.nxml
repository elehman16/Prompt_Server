This was defined as the first steady state concentration attained after 5 unaltered Tac doses. The subsequent dose was determined using TDM. The prespecified Tac C<sub>0</sub> target range was 10 to 15 ng/mL. The hypothesis was that overweight patients are overdosed if the starting dose is strictly based on bodyweight alone. Furthermore, the influence of <italic>CYP3A5</italic> genotype on the relationship between bodyweight (or BMI) and Tac exposure was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>The patients in this study were kidney transplant recipients who participated in a randomized-controlled trial investigating whether adaptation of the Tac starting dose according to <italic>CYP3A5</italic> genotype increases the proportion of kidney transplant recipients reaching the target Tac predose concentration range (10-15 ng/mL) at first steady-state. After day 3, the physicians were allowed to adapt the Tac dose based on whole-blood concentration measurements. The primary outcomes of this trial were presented in a separate publication.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>In this trial, patients were randomized to receive Tac in either the standard, bodyweight-based dose of 0.20 mg/kg per day according to the package insert,<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> or to receive a dose based on their <italic>CYP3A5</italic> genotype. CYP3A5 expressers (ie, carriers of 1 or 2 <italic>CYP3A5*1</italic> alleles) received 0.30 mg/kg per day, whereas the nonexpressers (<italic>CYP3A5*3</italic> homozygotes) received 0.15 mg/kg per day. The additional immunosuppressive therapy was identical for all patients and consisted of basiliximab, mycophenolic acid, and prednisolone.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The only inclusion criteria for the post hoc analysis presented here was that there had to be a Tac C<sub>0</sub> available on day 3 after transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Tac Concentration Measurement</title><p>As described previously,<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the Tac C<sub>0</sub> was measured in the laboratory of the Erasmus MC using 2 different immunoassays: antibody-conjugated magnetic immunoassay (ACMIA) and enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT). The measurements obtained with EMIT were systematically approximately 15% higher than those obtained with ACMIA. The weight of patients measured with the 2 different assays was not significantly different. The mean weight of the patients measured with ACMIA was 79.6 kg (95% confidence interval, 77-82.2 kg) and for EMIT 78.4 kg (95% confidence interval, 74-82.9 kg). The lower limits of detection were 1.5 ng/mL (ACMIA) and 2.0 ng/mL (EMIT). In this study, the lowest Tac concentration was 2.6 ng/mL. The upper limit of detection was 30.0 ng/mL. For calculation purposes, Tac C<sub>0</sub> above the detection limit was set at 30.0 ng/mL.

The latter group was created to be able to compare the C<sub>0</sub> of all patients, irrespective of whether the starting dose was adjusted according to genotype. The scaled C<sub>0</sub> was calculated by dividing the C<sub>0</sub> by the actual dose per kg bodyweight and multiplying this by 0.2. Categorical variables are reported using frequency tables and percentages, and continuous variables are expressed as medians with ranges. Tac overexposure was defined as a Tac concentration above 15 ng/mL, and underexposure as below 10 ng/mL. The correlation between Tac C<sub>0</sub> and bodyweight (or BMI) was investigated by calculating the goodness of fit. Dosing guidelines were calculated using linear regression lines. Descriptive statistics were generated, and all tests were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05.

This is especially the case for overweight and obese patients. Based on the goodness of fit, the association between BMI and Tac exposure seems stronger than the one between bodyweight and Tac. To our knowledge, only 2 studies have investigated the relationship between bodyweight or BMI and Tac exposure at first steady state. Rodrigo et al<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> concluded that overweight renal transplant recipients are more prone to develop initial high exposure (ie, a C<sub>0</sub> &#x0003e; 15 ng/mL) compared with nonoverweight recipients. Rodrigo et al<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> demonstrated that the first Tac C<sub>0</sub> tended to be higher than 15 ng/mL in overweight, older kidney transplant recipients. Sawamoto et al<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> demonstrated that the average Tac maintenance dose in patients with a BMI greater than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is significantly lower compared with that in patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or less. Our study substantiates these findings.</p><p>Dosing guidelines for overweight and obese patients were developed and validated for patients with an unknown genotype and CYP3A5 nonexpressers. As a validation cohort we used patients who participated in the FDCC trial. In this multicenter study, Tac was dosed according to local clinical practice, and as a consequence, this is a very heterogeneous group. Despite this, we managed to validate our guidelines.</p><p>Unfortunately, no dosing guideline could be developed for CYP3A5 expressers because there were too few CYP3A5 expressers in our population. Also, insufficient obese patients with a BMI greater than 35 were available to validate the dosing guideline in that group. Establishing separate dosing guidelines for overweight patients is not unusual. Other drugs, such as aminoglycosides, are dosed using ideal body weight in overweight patients.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, aminoglycosides are hydrophilic drugs, whereas Tac is lipophilic. Overweight patients have a larger fat compartment, and therefore, adjusting the dose of hydrophilic drugs based on total bodyweight would lead to overexposure. However, for lipophilic drugs, a larger volume of distribution would be expected in overweight patients, and therefore, choosing the dose based on total bodyweight seems logical. Miyamoto et al<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> demonstrated that the Tac concentration in fat tissue was lower than what one would expect based on the lipophilicity of the drug. This substantiates the present finding that the Tac dose should not be entirely based on bodyweight in obese patients. An explanation for this counterintuitive finding could be that Tac is extensively distributed into erythrocytes which have a high content of FK-binding proteins to the receptor of Tac.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although with an increasing bodyweight, the blood plasma volume also increases, this occurs to a lesser extent. Theoretically, the Tac initial dose should be based on this increase in blood plasma volume rather than the increase in bodyweight.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to give dosing guidelines for overweight and obese transplant recipients. A subject for future research could be the influence of other genetic polymorphisms in, for example, <italic>CYP3A4</italic> which has also been associated with altered Tac clearance. Especially, <italic>CYP3A4*22</italic> is interesting because it is associated with a lower Tac dosage after renal transplantation.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The biggest limitation of this study is that it is a post hoc analysis. It was unplanned and therefore the apparent differences and associations could be coincidental. The second limitation is that more than three quarters of the studied population was white, and only 10% was from African descent. Research has shown that African-American kidney transplant recipients require a higher Tac dose regardless of their <italic>CYP3A5</italic> genotype.<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The third limitation is that Tac concentrations were measured with immunoassays, instead of using mass spectrometry which is nowadays considered the criterion standard. In our center, immunoassays were used for the routine determination of Tac at the start of the trial. Many transplant centers worldwide still rely on immunoassays for TDM of Tac. The final limitation is that the target range of 10 to 15 ng/mL we aimed for may now be regarded as rather high although the precise therapeutic range for Tac is still unclear.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, basing the Tac starting dose solely on bodyweight leads to overexposure in more than one third of patients, and over half of overweight or obese patients. Basing the Tac starting dose on BMI in overweight patients, whether or not in combination with <italic>CYP3A5</italic> genotype, could reduce overexposure of Tac early after transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to the research nurses Mrs. M.J.
