</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into two groups of thirty each using computer-generated randomization sequence. Patients in Group R received 30 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine with 0.5 ml of normal saline by electrical stimulation and patients in Group RD received 30 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine with 50 &#x000b5;g (0.5 ml) dexmedetomidine by electrical stimulation. The person who prepared the drug solution was different from the person who administered the block and the person who monitored the quality and duration of the block and the hemodynamics postoperatively.</p><p>All patients included in the study were premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally at bedtime the previous night before surgery. They were kept nil orally 10 pm onwards on the previous night.</p><p>On arrival of the patient in the operating room, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted, and an infusion of 500 ml Ringer lactate was started. The patients were connected to, Mindray multi-parameter monitor which records heart rate (HR), noninvasive measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and continuous ECG monitoring, respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). The baseline SBP, DBP, MAP, and HR were recorded (basal parameters).</p><p>After positioning the patient on operating table with the head turned to opposite side, interscalene groove was identified by rolling the finger posterior to sternocleidomastoid muscle between the belly of the anterior and middle scalene muscle at the level of cricoid cartilage. Skin over the insertion site was infiltrated with 2% lignocaine.</p><p>Interscalene block was performed in all patients with the peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, B Braun) connected to 3.5-cm, 22-gauge, short-bevel insulated stimulating needle by modified Winnies approach. The intensity of stimulating current was initially set to deliver 1 mA with an impulse duration of 0.1 ms. Thereafter, current was gradually decreased to 0.5 mA. The localization of the plexus was considered optimal when an output current of &#x0003c;0.5 mA caused the contraction of pectoralis muscle, deltoid, biceps or triceps. After eliciting motor response of any of these muscles, 30 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine with 0.5 ml of normal saline was given in Group R, in the increments of 5 ml after fixing the stimulating needle, aspirating in between to avoid inadvertent intrathecal or intravascular injection.</p><p>The same procedure mentioned above was repeated in patients of Group RD, and 30 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine with 50 mcg (0.5 ml) of dexmedetomidine was injected.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as HR, SBP, DBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and RR were monitored at every 10 min interval till 1 h of LA injection and then every 20 min till 2<sup>nd</sup> h and thereafter every hour min till the end of surgery and postoperatively one hourly till first 24 h. Adverse events such as hypotension (20% decrease in relation to the baseline value), bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;60 bpm), hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x02264; 90%), and perioperative nausea and vomiting were recorded.

Interscalene brachial plexus block is most often used for humerus and forearm surgeries. It was first described by Winnie in 1970, but the technique had a high incidence of major complications such as inadvertent injection in intrathecal space or vertebral artery injection for which the patients developed seizures. The technique was unpopular for a period of time when it underwent many modifications and has now proved its safety and advantages to general anesthesia in current studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Various LAs such as lignocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine have been used in peripheral nerve block. Though lignocaine causes profound muscle relaxation, it is associated with significant local nerve toxicity. Bupivacaine has serious cardiac toxicity if accidental intravascular injection occurs. Ropivacaine is a newer LA that is used in various concentrations of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 0.75% for nerve blocks. It has less cardiac toxicity when compared to bupivacaine. It causes a greater sensory and motor differential blockade than bupivacaine, which is dose dependent, with higher concentrations (1%) causing greater degree of motor blockade than lower concentration (0.5% and 0.75%).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Many adjuvants such as clonidine,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] fentanyl,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and magnesium[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have been added to LA to hasten the onset time and prolong the duration of block.

Dexmedetomidine is a pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine and is highly specific and selective &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor agonist with &#x003b1;2:&#x003b1;1 binding selectivity ratio of 1620:1 as compared to 220:1 for clonidine, thus decreasing the unwanted side effects of &#x003b1;1 receptors. Presynaptic activation of &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor in central nervous system inhibits the release of norepinephrine, terminating the propagation of pain signals and their postsynaptic activation inhibits sympathetic activity, thereby decreasing HR and BP.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Various authors had used it in combination with LAs such as bupivacaine 0.25%,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] levobupivacaine 0.5%,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and ropivacaine 0.5% and 0.75%.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Esmaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that addition of 100 &#x000b5;g of dexmedetomidine to levobupivacaine for axillary block causes significant prolongation sensory and motor blockade and also causes high incidence of bradycardia.
