Multimedia interventions are useful for educating children about their health and demonstrate potential to improve children&#x02019;s health-related self-efficacy, but few paediatric clinics offer web-based resources as part of routine care. The Steps to Active Kids with Diabetes (STAK-D) programme is an online intervention grounded in psychological theory (social cognitive theory) and informed by extensive preliminary research. The aim of the programme is to encourage and support safe engagement with physical activity for children with T1DM. The aim of this research is to explore the feasibility of delivering the STAK-D programme to children aged 9&#x02013;12 years with T1DM, and to assess the feasibility of further research to demonstrate its clinical and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Up to 50 children aged 9&#x02013;12 years with T1DM and their parents will be recruited from two paediatric diabetes clinics in the UK. Child-parent dyads randomised to the intervention group will have access to the intervention website (STAK-D) and a wrist-worn activity monitor for 6&#x000a0;months. The feasibility of intervention and further research will be assessed by rate of recruitment, adherence, retention, data completion and adverse events. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken with a subsample of children and parents (up to 25 dyads) and health care professionals (up to 10). Health outcomes and the feasibility of outcome measurement tools will be assessed. These include self-efficacy (CSAPPA), objective physical activity, self-reported physical activity (PAQ), fear of hypoglycaemia (CHFS; PHFS), glycaemic control (HbA1c), insulin dose, Body Mass Index (BMI), health-related quality of life (CHU9D; CHQ-PF28), health service use and patient-clinician communication. Assessments will be taken at baseline (T0), 8&#x000a0;weeks (T1) and at 6-month follow-up (T2).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this feasibility trial is to assess the delivery of STAK-D to promote physical activity among children with T1DM, and to assess the potential for further, definitive research to demonstrate its effectiveness. Results will provide the information necessary to design a larger randomised controlled trial and maximise the recruitment rate, intervention delivery and trial retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN48994721">ISRCTN48994721</ext-link>.

It is a serious illness, with rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and age-specific mortality double that of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2015, there were approximately 31,500 children under the age of 19&#x000a0;years with diabetes in the UK, the vast majority with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Diabetes management is complex and costly in social, psychological and economic terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Parents/carers<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> of preadolescent children with T1DM are generally responsible for their child&#x02019;s diabetes management and behaviours, making the transition from parental care to independent self-management a unique experience for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment includes daily insulin injections, a healthy diet with carbohydrate monitoring and regular physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Poorly managed childhood diabetes can have significant lifelong consequences. Physical activity has specific benefits for diabetes control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], reducing risk of diabetes complications and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], reducing overweight and benefiting mental wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research has shown that children with T1DM are less active than their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and this can be associated with parental concerns about hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the exposure of chronically ill children to excessive fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Interventions to increase physical activity in paediatric T1DM have commonly focussed upon structured aerobic or resistance exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These interventions work well for young people who are already active but for those children who are less active, promoting lifestyle physical activity (such as walking, active play, etc.) may be more appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, there is need for an intervention that encourages and supports safe engagement with physical activity for children with T1DM.</p><p>Our previous work highlights a need for theoretically-informed interventions which include psychological elements (and outcomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our studies have shown that parental fear of hypoglycaemia and children&#x02019;s low confidence for physical activity (self-efficacy) are important barriers to being active for children with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Self-efficacy in particular is a critical element in increasing and sustaining physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Parents have pointed to a lack of &#x02018;digestible&#x02019; resources for physical activity promotion and health care professionals (HCPs) have similarly identified a lack of age-appropriate, evidence-based resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Consequently, intervention should be age-appropriate and build children&#x02019;s self-efficacy for physical activity which is essential to enable sustained lifelong behavioural changes.</p><p>In the UK, the peak age for diagnosis of T1DM is between 10 and 14&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Interactive, multimedia interventions may be useful health promotion tools with children of this age, who are learning skills in self-managing their condition. Our previous research shows that HCPs support the concept of introducing interactive, multimedia resources focussed on behaviour change into the clinical care of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Multimedia interventions are useful for educating children about their health, demonstrate potential to improve children&#x02019;s health-related self-efficacy, and could make them more able partners in face-to-face communications with HCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Prior work has demonstrated that children with T1DM favour web-based information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and that they (irrespective of socioeconomic and ethnic background) are comfortable with electronic media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, parents of this age group are receptive to the use of novel technologies to help manage their child&#x02019;s diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite this, few paediatric clinics offer web resources for physical activity promotion as part of routine care, and technology-based interventions for children with T1DM are scarce. Existing resources are not developed for this age group; they tend to focus on &#x02018;sport&#x02019; rather than physical activity and active lifestyles; or they focus primarily on the parent rather than the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Computer or web-based interventions have shown to be feasible, acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in promoting physical activity in school-aged children. Consequently, there is potential for a dedicated, interactive resource specifically promoting physical activity in children with T1DM.</p><p>We have previously developed a theory-based physical activity intervention for children with chronic conditions called Steps to Active Kids (STAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which builds self-efficacy for physical activity. This includes educational materials for parents and children, a physical activity diary, group activity sessions and goal-setting strategies. This feasibility study, known as the SKIP trial (&#x02018;Supporting Kids with Diabetes in Physical activity&#x02019;), will adapt and test the feasibility of these materials for use by children with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] using an interactive, online resource called STAK-D (Steps to Active Kids with Diabetes). STAK-D is a web package delivering all aspects of STAK-D except the group activity sessions. It is intended to promote safe physical activity, build self-efficacy and reduce fear of hypoglycaemia. It includes interactive elements, including child and parent zones, physical activity tracking and goal-setting (with feedback), active role models, activity routines using video demonstrations, and a message board. It is also a medium through which parents and children can contact a diabetes professional for advice on physical activity with diabetes through an &#x02018;Ask the Expert&#x02019; facility.</p><p>STAK-D is a complex intervention which has been designed for implementation as an adjunct to clinical care in T1DM management. It is targeted at children aged 9&#x02013;12 years and their families. Targeting this age range is appropriate since participants are likely to have a level of independence commensurate with using computer-based packages at home (98%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with support from their parents. Also, intervention is beneficial at this age since lifestyle behaviours which are adopted preadolescence are more likely to be sustainable and, therefore, to influence disease risk factors across the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The STAK-D programme combines educational (information, physical activity guidance, safety information), behavioural (physical activities and activity tracking) and cognitive-behavioural (physical activity monitoring and goal-setting) strategies to promote children&#x02019;s self-efficacy for physical activity. STAK-D draws upon social cognitive theory constructs of self-efficacy and observational learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The intervention targets children who have barriers to physical activity and aims to promote self-efficacy via observing role models, mastery experience and persuasion (via education). It provides general advice around regular blood glucose monitoring (e.g. before, during and after physical activities and regularly throughout the day) and healthy eating, which has been approved by diabetes specialists, but it does not give guidance on insulin dosage and administration or carbohydrate counting. For this, families are encouraged to contact their clinical team, either using the &#x02018;Ask the Expert&#x02019; element of the website or at their standard clinic appointments.</p><p>In addition to the website, STAK-D utilises a wrist-worn activity monitor (PolarActive; Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY, USA) to encourage activity monitoring and goal-setting behaviours. The site is password-protected and can currently only be accessed by research participants and personnel.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>As there is no published data for the efficacy of a theory-based, online physical activity intervention for preadolescent children with T1DM, this research marks an important first stage in the development of an evidence base. This study will explore how feasible it is to deliver the STAK-D programme to promote self-efficacy for physical activity in this population, and its findings will inform the decision to run a future definitive clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The main aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial to investigate the effectiveness of STAK-D. The definitive trial will be deemed feasible if it is demonstrated that we can successfully identify, recruit and retain patients with T1DM, and the proposed study design and intervention are considered acceptable by patients, parents and clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study objectives</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary research objective</title><p>The main objectives are to accomplish the following: (1) to estimate the likely recruitment rate of children and their parents, (2) to assess the willingness of the clinical staff to recruit participants, (3) to assess the willingness of eligible participants to be randomised, (4) to assess adherence and compliance to different elements of the intervention (including wrist-worn activity monitors), (5) to examine potential adverse effects of the intervention, (6) to test collection of health, clinical and economic outcome measures with the aim of informing the larger trial, (7) to explore reasons for loss to follow-up and (8) to access the overall acceptability of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary research objectives</title><p>A secondary research objective is to estimate the variability of self-efficacy for physical activity scores (e.g. pre-intervention to post-intervention change) and other outcome measures in order to inform decisions about primary and secondary outcomes for the larger-scale randomised control trial (RCT) and associated sample size calculation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol has been prepared according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Extension for Newborns, Children, and Adolescents (SPIRIT-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Higher scores indicate greater frequency of engagement in physical activity. The authors of the PAQ reported good agreement between questionnaire responses for PAQ and observed activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

CSAPPA is a 20-item scale to measure the self-perception of confidence in, preference for, and enjoyment of physical activity. CSAPPA is composed of three subscales: (1) perceived adequacy (perceived ability to achieve some level of successful with respect to being physically active), (2) predilection toward physical activity (preference for being active over being sedentary when given the choice) and (3) enjoyment of physical education class. The scale employs a structured alternative choice format. Children are asked to choose the option that best describes them from pairs of statements about other children such as, &#x02018;Some kids can&#x02019;t wait to play active games after school&#x02019; and &#x02018;Other kids would rather do something else&#x02019; by indicating whether the sentence was either &#x02018;sort of true for me&#x02019; or &#x02018;really true for me&#x02019;.

As close to visits 1, 3 and 5 as possible, the researcher will ask the clinician for clinical data from the participants&#x02019; clinical records (height, weight, HbA1c level and insulin dosage). Parents will be assessed for demographics, fear of hypoglycaemia (PHFS), child&#x02019;s quality of life (CHQ-PF28) and additional self-reported items. One week after visits 1, 3 and 5 (at visits 2, 4 and 6), data from the activity watch will be downloaded.
