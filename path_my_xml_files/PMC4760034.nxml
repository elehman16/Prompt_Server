Narcotic based analgesia is commonly used for postoperative pain management. However, the side-effects and complications of systemic narcotics is a significant disadvantage. Different locoregional anesthetic techniques have been tried including, single and multiple levels paravertebral block (PVB), which seems to have a significant reduction in immediate postoperative pain with fewer side-effects.

Inclusion criteria included age 20-70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I, II, and III, body mass index &#x0003c;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included infection at the site of injections, anatomic deformities of the thoracic spine, coagulation disorders, and allergy against local anesthetics or morphine.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated using a computer generated random numbers to receive either preoperative unilateral multiple injections PVB at five thoracic dermatomes (group P) or postoperative intravenous PCA with morphine (group M) for postoperative pain control. Patients were evaluated for eligibility the day before the procedure by an investigator who do not control or know the future patients group assignment and both of PVB and PCA were explained to the patients.</p><p>In the operating room, intravenous access was secured, and midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) was given to all patients. Standard ASA monitors were applied including pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and electrocardiogram. The same experienced anesthetist performed all the blocks for patients in group P. Group <italic>P</italic> patients were placed in the sitting position, leaning forward. After skin disinfection using chlorhexidine solution, spinous processes were identified and at parasagittal plan at 2.5 cm, skin wheel is raised using 1% lidocaine and a 20-gauge tuohy needle connected to tubing that is connected to a syringe containing the local anesthetic. The needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin, once the transverse process is contacted, the depth is noted by needle marking and the needle walked off caudally beyond the needle depth by 1-1.5 cm, after the negative aspiration for air, cerebrospinal fluid and blood, 4 ml of 0.5% bupivicaine given at each level from T2 to T6.</p><p>General anesthesia was induced for all patients using fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg), and rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in a mixture of oxygen, and air and analgesia were supplemented with fentanyl according to the vital signs parameters, and the total amount of narcotics was reported.</p><p>At the postoperative care unit, patients in group M were connected to PCA machine containing morphine with a bolus dose of 1 mg boluses, lockout interval 6 min with no basal rate, and maximum 240 mg/24 h.</p><p>The pain score was the primary outcome, it was assessed on movement of the shoulder using the numerical pain scale from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain 10 = Worst imaginable pain) at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h postoperatively together with mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Patients on both groups received 1 g of intravenous paracetamol every 6 h on regular basis for the first 24 h and the rescue analgesic was lornixacam 8 mg intravenously every 8 h on as needed basis, if this was insufficient additional order of morphine 1 mg every 5 min until pain score is &#x02264;3 was written and calculated. Time to first analgesic demand, and 24-h morphine consumption were recorded. Complications related to the narcotic use such as constipation, urinary retention, purities and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and complications related to the PVB, such as vascular puncture, dural puncture, pneumothorax, local anesthetics toxicity Horner's syndrome, epidural spreading, hypotension that is not related to another reason were also documented. The length of the hospital stay was recorded and patient's satisfaction was evaluated before hospital discharge with the numerical rating scale (0 = Dissatisfied and 10 = Most satisfied).</p><p>Minimal sample size of 17 patients was required in each group to achieve an &#x003b1; error of 5% and a &#x003b2; error of 10%. To compensate for dropout cases and shifting from normality in data distribution, 20 cases were studied in each group. Sample size was calculated using an online statistical calculator (The program G* Power 3 from the Department of Experimental Psychology at Heinrich Heine University, D&#x000fc;sseldorf <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.psycho.uniduesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3/">www.psycho.uniduesseldorf.de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3/</ext-link>).

In group M eight patients reported significant PONV (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results showed that preoperative unilateral, multiple level, PVB significantly lowers postoperative pain scores compared to PCA morphine. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that single injection one level thoracic PVB is effective in reducing the severity of postoperative pain after thoracoscopic[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and breast surgery.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, compared to those studies, our patients had more prolonged postoperative analgesia. This may be attributed to multiple levels injections with the optimal spread of the local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, PVB given before surgery, on the preemptive analgesia concept, could provide better postoperative analgesia than being given after surgery.</p><p>In our study, we found that PVB significantly affect the course of the postoperative period. The PVB group demonstrated significantly lower pain scores, stable MAP and HR 6 h and 12 h postoperatively; on the other hand, patients who received PCA experienced higher pain scores, higher MAP and HR, which led to longer hospital stay. We can thus hypothesize that this could cause an increase in the total hospital cost, however, this was not calculated.</p><p>Low incidences of PVB induced complications are well documented. This included hypotension (4.0%), vascular puncture (6.8%), hematoma formation (2.4%), intrathecal or epidural spread (1.0%), pneumothorax (0.5%), and pain at the site of injection (1.3%).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, we had a low incidence of complications related to the PVB that may be attributed to the small sample size in our study. The PCA group had significantly higher incidence of PONV throughout the first 24 h, which could be explained by the known emetogenic effect of morphine.</p><p>Different techniques have been tried in breast cancer surgery aiming to improve the postoperative experience, expressed in lower pain scores, less nausea and vomiting, shorter hospital stay. Those include local infiltration,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] intercostal nerve block[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and thoracic epidural block,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] however each technique showed some limitations. Local infiltration caused local tissue distortion, pain on injection and carries a risk of local anesthetic toxicity, intercostal block is technically difficult as the approach is obscured by the scapula that interferes with the injection and limit the spread of the local anesthetic, and while the thoracic epidural provide satisfactory analgesia, it has the risk of neurological damage, hemodynamic instability, necessitates monitoring and it requires higher level of technical experience. On the other hand, PVB is a simple technique with high success rate, adequate postoperative analgesia, and low complication rate.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Our finding confirms the outcome of previous studies showing that PVB given before surgery in combination with GA could provide better postoperative analgesia than did GA alone for unilateral breast surgery.</p><p>This study, however, is not without limitations. Firstly, we should consider it a proof of concept; being a preliminary report on a small sample size. Secondly, was the lack of double blindness in the methodology. This is because primarily, we do not think it is ethical to give a placebo PVB using saline in the PCA group and expose the patients to the complications of the procedure. Secondly, it was impractical to blind the clinician or the patient to the assigned treatment group; however, we do not expect the results to provide biased information, as there was good conformity with the protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multiple levels PVB is superior to PCA morphine for postoperative pain management in patients with breast
