A recent report demonstrated that inhaled sodium cromoglycate is an effective treatment for ACE inhibitors' cough; this effect might be due to the suppression of afferent unmyelinated C-fibres. We tested the hypothesis that inhaled sodium cromoglycate might also be effective in lung cancer patients who presented with irritative neoplastic cough. Twenty non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients complaining of cough resistant to conventional treatment were randomised to receive, in a double-blind trial, either inhaled sodium cromoglycate or placebo. Patients recorded cough severity daily, before and during treatment, on a 0 to 4 scale. The efficacy of treatment was tested with the Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric measures, comparing the intergroup differences in the measures of summary of symptom scores calculated in each patient before and after treatment. We report that inhaled sodium cromoglycate can reduce cough, also in NSCLC patients and that such reduction, observed in all patients treated, is statistically significant (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Inhaled sodium cromoglycate appears to be a cost-effective and safe treatment for lung cancer-related cough.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="309" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="310" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="311" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
