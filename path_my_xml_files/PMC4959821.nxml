The number of falls keep rising with increased longevity of the population. Conventionally, the &#x02018;Timed Up and Go&#x02019; test (TUG)&#x000a0;is used as a predictor of fall in adults [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TUG is easy to perform and has a reported sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 94% [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Activities of daily living do not limit to only one task at a time. We usually perform <italic>'dual&#x000a0;tasks'</italic>, like holding a cup of tea while walking or communicating with someone while walking; as well as <italic>'triple or multiple tasks'</italic>, like crossing an obstacle while holding an object and talking. Various studies have assessed the performance of dual and triple tasks and their influence on prediction of falls. Conventional TUG, motor TUG and cognitive TUG were comparable in determining the likelihood of falls [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Motor dual task TUG better identifies pre-frail individuals than single task TUG. Motor TUG was found to be more valid and sensitive than conventional TUG, therefore it can serve as screening tool for early detection of individuals with frailty in community dwelling adults [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The addition of dual task or cognitive task to TUG, improves the detection of risk of falls in people with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Thus, our study aimed to determine the temporal and demographic variations in the performance outcomes of dual and triple task TUG against conventional TUG, amongst community dwelling Indian adults above 50 years of age. Secondarily, the study involved classifying them as one of three categories, namely: a) at no risk of fall, b) high risk of fall, c) definite fallers, based on each test outcome measures. Thereby, we propose an alternate hypothesis i.e. demographic and temporal variations are seen while performing dual and triple tasks in community dwelling Indian adults and a null hypothesis i.e. there is no demographic or temporal variation seen while performing dual and triple tasks in community dwelling Indian adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This cross-sectional analytical study was done at the physiotherapy department of a tertiary care centre. Sixty healthy adult participants, with age greater than 50 years, presented to the physiotherapy outpatient department as accompanying relatives of patients coming for therapy,&#x000a0;were randomly selected. Participants were excluded if they had any form of neurological deficit, which could lead&#x000a0;to imbalance, in-coordination and dementia, like stroke, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, head injury, brain tumours and vertigo. Conditions for exclusions included any upper or lower extremity musculoskeletal deficit or congenital deformity; affected vision, even with the assistance of visual aids; inability to count. Institutional ethics committee approved the research protocol for the purpose of&#x000a0;the study. Written informed consent was taken from all the participants of the study at the time of enrolment.</p><p>Detailed history and demographic findings were recorded for all participants at the time of enrolment in the study. The study protocol and the task procedures were explained to each participant. Each person was asked to perform six different tasks: 1) <italic>conventional TUG</italic>; 2) walking with a cup filled with water <italic>(TUG motor)</italic>; 3) counting backwards from 100 while walking <italic>(TUG cognitive)</italic>; 4) holding a cup filled with water and counting backwards while walking <italic>(TUG motor and cognitive)</italic>; 5) stepping&#x000a0;over an obstacle while walking <italic>(TUG visuospatial); </italic>6) stepping over an obstacle while walking holding a cup filled with water <italic>(TUG motor and visuospatial)</italic>. The outcome was measured in terms of time taken to perform each task; calculated in <italic>seconds (sec)</italic>. A washout period of 20 minutes was given between each task. The tasks were performed in a well-lit and well-ventilated room with a three meter even pathway. An arm rest chair was used with a seat height of 43-46 cm and arm rest height of 62-66 cm [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An empty shoe box, 10 cm high, 19 cm wide and 33 cm long was used as an obstacle to cross [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A cup filled with water was used. A three meter pathway was marked. The chair with arm rest was kept at the starting line. For the conventional TUG, participants seated in the chair were asked to get up from the chair with the word &#x02018;Go&#x02019;, walk the pathway till the marked line, turn around, walk back and sit on the chair. Time was recorded with a stopwatch starting from the command word &#x02018;Go&#x02019; till the participant completed the task and their buttock touched the chair again. After a wash out period of 20 minutes each, they were asked to perform above mentioned dual and triple tasks along with the conventional TUG procedure.</p><p>Cut-off values were set to identify the persons with risk of fall: 13.5 sec for conventional TUG [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>];&#x000a0;14.5 sec for TUG with any manual task (<italic>dual test</italic>); 15 sec for TUG with any cognitive task (<italic>dual test</italic>) [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; 16 sec for TUG with any triple task (<italic>triple test</italic>) [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cut-off value for triple test was calculated as an additional time of 22% per addition of each task [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cut-off value for definite fallers (needing assistance) was set at 30 sec [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using the Graphpad Prism 6 for Windows (publisher GraphPad Software), using one way ANOVA, with post hoc Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated using standard formulae within the analysis software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty participants were included in the study, age ranging from 50 years to 93 years (mean- 65.5 years).

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As age advances, it is difficult for the elderly to coordinate two streams of visual information i.e. one related to navigation through visually defined space and the other related to a visually demanding second task [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When two or more tasks are needed to be performed concurrently, the task performance declines in at least one of them. Neuronal plasticity may help overcome this problem in the older age group, but it is at the cost of cognitive resources. They are no longer available for other activities while walking, such as obstacle avoidance, navigation along planned route, watching for pedestrian and vehicular traffic, as well as engaging in tasks not related to gait. As a consequence, the elderly often face more difficulties than the younger ones, in walking and concurrently engaging in another activity [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The study showed that the age has moderate positive correlation with the time required to perform each test. Thus, an increase in the age, moderately increases the time needed to complete a particular task. However, increasing age is not the only factor responsible for the test performance and risk of falls. Falls can occur because of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Intrinsic factors include balance impairment, neurological disorders, sensory deterioration, musculoskeletal disorders, postural hypotension and medications which are used by the person. Extrinsic factors include ill-fitting footwear, poor lighting, surface quality and inappropriate furniture. Fallers show more evidence of cognitive impairment, use of diuretics and tranquillizers [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Present study was performed on healthy individuals and in a controlled environment; thereby the influence of such intrinsic or extrinsic factors could not be accounted for. There was a significant temporal variation with the addition of tasks in all age groups i.e. there was&#x000a0;significant increase in the time taken to perform the TUG with additional task. Balance deteriorates in elderly when sensory inputs contributing to balance control are reduced, indicating that balance depends not only on motor, but also sensory system functions. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly apparent that other neural systems, including cognitive resources, may contribute to balance control&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additional research has shown that, with a simultaneous walking and talking task, participants were found to either stop talking or take longer time to complete gait task [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This was evidenced on our study as the participants taking increased time to perform each additional task, thereby supporting our alternate hypothesis. These findings confirm the notion that the balance performance is influenced by simultaneously performing cognitive and motor tasks. Lundin-Olsson et al also found that those who are more distracted by a familiar manual task performed concurrently with functional manoeuvres, were more at risk of fall [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>All tests were found to be comparable in their efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity above 90%. This supports the findings that all the tests are comparable. Measurement of mobility and balance under multitasking conditions is not a more sensitive indicator of likelihood for falls. Therefore adding a task was not found to have any added advantage in identifying high risk or definite fallers. The study highlights the potential importance of dual/ multi-task balance training as a preventive measure in elderly, as the findings of the study showed an increase in performance time with addition of tasks to conventional TUG.</p><sec><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>The study included only healthy individuals and their performance in a controlled environment, so the influence of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, on test performance, could not be assessed. A follow up on the assessment of the participants and their falls was not performed. There lies a potential for future research in examining the effects of preventive dual/ multitask balance training on the test performance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The time needed to perform the TUG, dual or triple tasks increases with advancing age. Factors other than age may also play an important role in maintaining balance and increasing the risk of fall. Conventional TUG is the most sensitive and specific test to identify fallers. Though dual and triple task tests were also comparable, addition of a task to TUG did not turn out to be a sensitive indicator to identify fallers as compared to TUG.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Human Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Institutional Ethics Committee-HR Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College issued approval IEC/47/13</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Animal Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> This study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Fall-risk screening test</article-title><source>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</source><person-group><name><surname>Tromp</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pluijm</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Smit</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Deeg</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bouter</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lips</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><fpage>837</fpage><lpage>844</lpage><volume>54 (8)</volume><year>2001</year><uri xlink:href="http://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(01)00349-3/abstract">http://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(01)00349-3/abstract</uri><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11470394</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="REF2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="website"><article-title>Timed Up and Go (TUG).
