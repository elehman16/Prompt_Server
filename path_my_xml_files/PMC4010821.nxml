Treatment includes intravenous steroids but up to 40% of patients do not respond and require emergency colectomy. Mortality following emergency colectomy has fallen, but 10% of patients still die within 3&#x02005;months of surgery. Infliximab and ciclosporin, both immunosuppressive drugs, offer hope for treating steroid-resistant UC as there is evidence of their short-term effectiveness. As there is little long-term evidence, this pragmatic randomised trial, known as Comparison Of iNfliximab and ciclosporin in STeroid Resistant Ulcerative Colitis: a Trial (CONSTRUCT), aims to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of infliximab and ciclosporin for steroid-resistant UC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Between May 2010 and February 2013, 52 UK centres recruited 270 patients admitted with acute severe UC who failed to respond to intravenous steroids but did not need surgery. We allocated them at random in equal proportions between infliximab and ciclosporin.The primary clinical outcome measure is quality-adjusted survival, that is survival weighted by Crohn's and Colitis Questionnaire (CCQ) participants&#x02019; scores, analysed by Cox regression. Secondary outcome measures include: the CCQ&#x02014;an extension of the validated but community-focused UK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) to include patients with acute severe colitis and stoma; two general quality of life measures&#x02014;EQ-5D and SF-12; mortality; survival weighted by EQ-5D; emergency and planned colectomies; readmissions; incidence of adverse events including malignancies, serious infections and renal disorders; disease activity; National Health Service (NHS) costs and patient-borne costs. Interviews investigate participants&#x02019; views on therapies for acute severe UC and healthcare professionals&#x02019; views on the two drugs and their administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Research Ethics Committee for Wales has given ethical approval (Ref. 08/MRE09/42); each participating Trust or Health Board has given NHS Reseach &#x00026; Development approval.

However, the outcome measures were limited to colectomy rates, adverse drug reactions and postoperative complications over 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A recent meta-analysis of 38 patients with steroid-resistant UC showed that the 20 on ciclosporin had a higher colectomy rate, more steroid dependency and more adverse events (AEs) than the 18 on infliximab.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Against this background of studies that compared these two drugs only indirectly, la Groupe d'Etude Th&#x000e9;rapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires Digestives (GETAID) recently reported on the trial &#x02018;CYcloSporine versus InFliximab (CYSIF)&#x02019;,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the first head-to-head comparison of these two drugs. CYSIF found no significant differences in &#x02018;treatment failure&#x02019; within 98&#x02005;days, defined as any of: (1) no clinical response after 7&#x02005;days; (2) no remission without steroids after 98&#x02005;days; (3) relapse between 7 and 98&#x02005;days; (4) serious AE leading to treatment interruption; (5) colectomy or (6) death. However, CYSIF recruited only 110 patients, followed them for only 98&#x02005;days, reported no data on quality of life, and collected no data on costs.</p><p>In summary, infliximab and ciclosporin are often effective in the short term, but there is little long-term evidence, especially about comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness. The Evidence Review Group Report commissioned by NICE<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> concluded: &#x02018;The results consistently indicate that the move from standard care to ciclosporin is highly cost-effective. Thus the policy question is clear: should we make a subsequent move from ciclosporin to infliximab.&#x02019; Hence we have designed Comparison Of iNfliximab and ciclosporin in STeroid Resistant Ulcerative Colitis: a Trial (CONSTRUCT) to achieve a rigorous and comprehensive comparison of these costly therapies.</p><p>In response to this debate, the CONSTRUCT team has recently extended the measurement of quality of life and costs in four ways:

Participating patients and their doctors knew which of the two drugs they were receiving. As the two modes of administration are different, any other approach would have been difficult. Fortunately this pragmatic approach enables us to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the drugs in normal clinical practice, whereas the more explanatory double-blind placebo controlled trial would have compared the efficacy of the drugs under stricter, less realistic, conditions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014005091F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison Of iNfliximab and ciclosporin in STeroid Resistant Ulcerative Colitis: a Trial (CONSTRUCT) flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014005091f01"/></fig><p>To this design we added a comprehensive cohort to help recruit patients into a complex trial. Following explanation we invited inpatients with known or suspected colitis to join the cohort as soon as possible after admission. We told them that if they had UC and did not respond to intravenous steroids, they might need other drug treatment; and, if they were suitable, we would invite them to have further treatment as part of a clinical trial. To increase the chance of recruiting them, and ensure the quality of their data, we collected their baseline data as soon as possible after they had given consent. Although our primary aim in recruiting this cohort was to enhance recruitment to the trial, it has potential to enhance future study of UC, notably through anonymised linkage to routine data.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>From May 2010 to the end of February 2013 we recruited from the cohort to the trial those participants diagnosed with UC (assessed by Truelove and Witts criteria,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> a Mayo score of at least 2 on endoscopy, or clinical judgement) who failed to respond to a course of up to about 5&#x02005;days of intravenous steroids but did not need immediate surgery. After the clinical team had confirmed steroid resistance, and full oral and written explanation, we invited participants who fulfilled the trial inclusion criteria to consent to randomisation to either infliximab or ciclosporin. A placebo control group would have been unethical, as these patients are severely ill and need treatment, as the NICE Evidence Review Group recognised.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The current design of CONSTRUCT requires a combination of survival analysis and statistical imputation to get full value from the resulting dataset. As these techniques are difficult to incorporate into power calculations, we present a simpler calculation based on t tests of mean Crohn's and Colitis Questionnaire (CCQ) scores at 12&#x02005;months. For CONSTRUCT to detect an effect size of 0.35 in these scores (ie, a difference between infliximab and ciclosporin groups of at least 0.35 of the population SE) with 80% power when using a 5% significance level requires that we analyse at least 250 of the 270 participants recruited to the trial. Although more than 10% of CONSTRUCT participants are likely to drop out over the follow-up period of at least 12&#x02005;months, all analyses will exploit the techniques of statistical imputation used successfully by the Cancer of the Oesophagous or Gastricus: New Assessment of the Technology of Endosonography (COGNATE)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and Folate Augmentation of Treatment&#x02014;Evaluation of Depression (FolATED)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> trials to maintain the effective sample size at 250. Our initial, more conservative power calculation had proposed: to recruit 480 participants; not to impute missing data statistically; therefore to allow for 25% loss to follow-up; and thus to yield 80% power to detect a slightly smaller effect size of 0.30 in CCQ scores. We amended our target to 270 participants once the difficulty of identifying patients with acute steroid-resistant UC became clear early in recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Routine data</title><p>Designed research data collection will continue until April 2014. We shall supplement the designed data collected from cohort participants by operational data from their electronic records, routine data on National Health Service (NHS) resource use from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p><p>We plan to continue follow-up for up to 10&#x02005;years through record linkage of routine mortality, inpatient and primary care data using the existing facilities of the Medical Research Council (MRC)-funded Centre for Improving Population Health through E-health Research (CIPHER) in the College of Medicine of Swansea University. We hope to monitor all participants&#x02019; long-term outcomes, including mortality, emergency colectomy, elective colectomy and major morbidity including hospitalisation and surgery, and thus most of their NHS costs. Thus we aim to achieve both long-term follow-up for trial participants and to create a larger electronic comprehensive cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trial management</title><p>The management structure includes: Trial Steering Committee (TSC) which provides oversight of the trial and meets at six monthly intervals, Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) which monitors trial data in accordance with an agreed charter and reports to the TSC, and Trial Management Group (TMG) comprising academics, health professionals, researchers and representatives of service users and the Swansea Clinical Trials Unit&#x02014;the West Wales Organisation for Rigorous Trials in Health (WWORTH). The TMG undertakes general management of the trial, meets every month and reports to the TSC. In accordance with the relevant WWORTH standard operating procedure,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> we include service users as active contributors at all stages of this study. They attend the TSC, DMEC and TMG where they contribute to the research process and provide valuable insights into UC.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Setting and site selection</title><p>We invited consultant gastroenterologists to express interest in taking part in the study via the British Society of Gastroenterology by completing a feasibility questionnaire. We considered sites which had treated four or more patients with steroid-resistant UC in the previous 12&#x02005;months to be eligible and invited them to seek local approval. As a result we are undertaking the study in 68 NHS Health Boards or Trusts, including large teaching and district general hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Informed consent</title><p>Patients who were eligible for the cohort received Cohort Participant Information Leaflets and oral explanation about the cohort from consultant gastroenterologists or research professionals (usually research nurses); they gave written consent by signing and dating a Cohort Consent Form. Cohort participants who became eligible for the trial received Trial Participant Information Leaflets and oral explanation about the trial; they gave written consent by signing and dating a Trial Consent Form. For cohort and trial, those taking consent countersigned and dated the form to confirm that the participant had fully understood the nature of the study and had had opportunity to ask questions; they also put a copy of that consent in the medical record, and gave another copy to the participant.</p><p>Research professionals could take consent to the cohort if authorised to do so on the Site Delegation Log following appropriate training including Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Although they could also explain the trial to cohort participants, responsibility for countersigning lay with the site principal investigator (PI) or another doctor with delegated authority on the Site Delegation Log.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Withdrawal</title><p>The process of consenting participants stressed that they could withdraw from cohort or trial whenever they wished without giving a reason and without affecting their care in any way. We documented reasons given where available. We encouraged participants who withdrew from completing questionnaires to continue other types of follow-up. We encouraged site staff to trace participants lost to follow-up and document the reasons for their loss when possible.</p><p>Clinical judgements that participants had not responded to treatment with infliximab or ciclosporin usually led to surgical intervention; however, those participants remained in the trial, especially for analysis by treatment allocated, unless they chose to withdraw.

Follow-up interviews use a similar schedule but include additional questions to explore what has happened to participants following treatment, including changes over time in their opinions of the treatment, their interactions with healthcare professionals, and their health.</p><p>We also interview healthcare professionals, by telephone or face-to-face, to understand their views about the two drugs, their administration and ease of handling. We have recruited 15 doctors and 9 nurses, stratified by number of patients recruited by their sites. These interviews address the ease of handling a range of drugs for UC, aspects of drug provision that might influence professional preference for one drug over another, and impressions of other professional contributions to treatment and care. This is particularly relevant if interviewing consultant and nurse at the same site.

Data are held in a remote, professionally managed repository and accessed over a virtual private network via the secure NHS N3 network. The system also supports data validation and facilitates quality assurance, and is backed up comprehensively every working day. We ask all patients to consent to data capture using this system, and to linkage of their electronically held routine data. Other data sources include participants&#x02019; medical records, pathology systems and routine data from HES, mortality data from ONS, and primary care systems. Participating sites have access only to identifiable data for those participants under their care, and cannot view any other records.</p><p>Aggregated data for analysis by the staff engaged in quantitative reporting are extracted in pseudonymised form. They do not have access to identifiable data and remain blind to treatment allocated and received until primary analysis is complete. In contrast qualitative researchers have access to identifiable data&#x02014;non-clinical but not clinical. They audiotape and transcribe their qualitative data, and store them securely, identifying them only by the participant's trial number. The Trial Data Manager (TDM) is responsible for maintaining data quality, reporting on that to both TMG and DMEC, and supplying the DMEC with unblinded data in response to formal requests.

Some of these will have personal reasons for partial non-completion, so it is unlikely that we accurately can impute their answers&#x02014;conditionally missing at random (MAR).</p><p>Nevertheless, to reduce missing data and make good use of available information, we shall impute missing responses within the three QoL measures. If the incidence of missing data is low, we shall make single use of the expectation maximisation (EM) version of the SPSS Missing Value Analysis module.

Otherwise, if any potential factor or covariate has an F value of less than 1 (and so increases SEs of estimates) it will be removed from the model and the data reanalysed. Rare categories in some factors (such as ethnic group) may need to be combined; if so, the categories to be combined will be assessed before examining outcomes, taking account only of observed numbers in each category and the coherence of the new groupings. Age will be treated as a covariate or factor (dichotomised at the observed median) depending on goodness of fit. The treatment by centre interaction will be tested by an F test.</p><p>Multiple observations of QoL measures (EQ-5D, SF-12 and CCQ) at different time points will be analysed using the &#x02018;area under the curve&#x02019; (AUC). This provides a link with the economic analysis via QALYs, and gives a practical answer relevant to the objectives of the trial. QoL observations will also be analysed as &#x02018;repeated measures&#x02019; to test whether findings are sensitive to the choice of AUC as main criterion.</p><p>The AUC and GLM analyses will be supplemented by descriptive univariate comparisons of the mean QoL in the two groups at each time point. Events such as mortality and colectomy will be compared descriptively by cross-tabulating the numbers and proportions in each treatment group, with a CI for the relative risk of the event occurring differentially in the two groups. Where data are available on time to these events, an appropriate survival analysis, based on Cox's proportional hazard approach<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> will investigate differences by adjusting for the same potential factors and covariates.</p><p>Residual diagnostics will be used where analyses assume normality; if the distributions of residuals are markedly non-normal, data transformation or bootstrapping will be considered.

The same process will be followed for the second-round interviews.</p><p>Three transcripts (one from a participant given infliximab, one given ciclosporin and one given ciclosporin followed by surgery) will also be taken forward to group analysis sessions for two reasons: to enhance the analysis framework by verifying if aspects are cogent and agreed by a wider group of analysts, and to give those analysing other study datasets an insight into the lives of people suffering from UC. Members of the study team will read the three transcripts and write three one-page overviews of the main features to tell the story of each participant's health and illness.

We then conducted a prepilot study to test the recruitment process up to randomisation and ensure that the main components of this trial worked together. Thereafter we used the resulting cohort of some 40 patients to test aspects of study design beyond initial recruitment. Following the prepilot, we piloted the use of the GeneCIS online data collection system, patient recruitment, randomisation and primary data collection. Each centre was asked to recruit and successfully randomise one participant. This was followed by a meeting of investigators to learn from the pilot. As the pilot uncovered no major problems, we have included cohort and trial participants recruited during the pilot period within the main study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e282" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005091.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank their collaborators in National Health Service (NHS) Health Boards and Trusts for their continued support for this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JGW conceived the trial.
