Histologic specimens from chronic cases confirm that tendinitis is not an acute inflammatory condition but rather a failure of the normal tendon repair mechanism associated with angiofibroblastic degeneration. Tendon regeneration may be improved by injecting autologous growth factors obtained from the patient's own blood. Autologous growth factors can be injected with autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized study with 83 patients was done. The study population comprised two groups. Group A (<italic>n</italic> = 50) treated with local steroid injection and Group B (<italic>n</italic> = 33) treated with autologous PRP. Patients were allocated randomly using computer-generated random number table. The base-line evaluation was done using visual analog score (VAS) and modified Mayo performance index for elbow (MAYO).

Although these conditions affect opposite sides of the elbow, the underlying pathology is similar and lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is more common than medial (Golfer's elbow).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>It is believed that the lesion starts as a tear in the common extensor tendon caused by mechanical overloading and is followed by abnormal microvascular responses. The microscopic finding demonstrates immature tissue that resembles angiofibroblastic hyperplasia;[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] however, it is uncertain about the pathophysiology of epicondylitis.</p><p>Numerous treatment modalities have been mentioned in literature for the management of epicondylitis including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, local anesthetics, autologous blood constituents, etc.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Corticosteroid injections are the gold standard, but they have a short-term effect (2&#x02013;6 weeks).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) delivered into various tissues to achieve a high local concentration of platelet-derived growth factors has been shown to enhance healing in wounds, tendons, and bones.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We believe that supplementing the natural healing process with PRP would give better long-term results in the management of epicondylitis as compared to local corticosteroids. In this study, we compared the short-term and long-term outcomes of corticosteroid injection and autologous PRP injection in cases of elbow epicondylitis randomly selected for treatment modality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Institutional Ethics Committee clearance was taken before starting the research. One hundred and thirty cases with a primary diagnosis of elbow epicondylitis were recruited in this study over a period of 15 months after taking written informed consent. A computer random number table for two intervention groups was generated, and the patients were distributed according to the table randomly after subjecting them to the exclusion criteria. Cases with the following conditions were excluded from the study, age &#x0003c;18 years, diabetes mellitus, cervical radiculopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, hemoglobin &#x0003c;10 mg/dl, platelet count &#x0003c;1.5 lakh/cumm, patients on aspirin, or similar drugs. Pain and elbow function were assessed using the visual analog score (VAS) and modified Mayo performance index for elbow (MAYO), respectively. Plain anterioposterior and lateral radiographs of affected elbow were obtained for all the patients. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I received steroid (80 mg of methyl prednisolone + 1 ml of lignocaine) and Group II received PRP (2 ml of PRP + 1 ml of lignocaine). All infiltrations were done under sterile condition by the senior author using a 22 gauge needle at the most tender point. After the injection, the patient was kept in a supine position for 15 min and then was sent home with instructions to limit the use of the arm for at least 24 h. All interventions were carried out on the outpatient basis, and patients were called for follow-up at 1, 2, 6 months, and 1 year.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using the IBM SPSS Version 22 software. Quantitative data were expressed in terms of mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the means of the study groups.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of platelet-rich plasma</title><p>Patients in the autologous PRP group were subjected to a platelet count. Only those with counts above 1.5 lakh/cumm were selected for the study. A volume of 200 ml whole blood was collected in a standard 350 ml blood bag after removal of 21 ml of anticoagulant from the blood bag. The blood was collected on a biomixer (Terumo Pempol D 601) for continuous running of blood. The bag was kept at room temperature (20&#x000b0;C&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C), and separation was carried out as soon as possible. The blood was centrifuged using a light/soft spin with 1400 rpm at 22&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The supernatant was expressed into the transfer bag intended for platelet storage. The tubing was sealed twice and cut between the two seals. This bag was further centrifuged at 20&#x000b0;C using a heavy spin with 3500 rpm for 10 min. The &#x0201c;platelet-poor plasma&#x0201d; was expressed out into another bag, and tubing was sealed. Some plasma was left along with the settled platelets. The product was kept stationary at room temperature for approximately 1 h. Platelets were then transferred to platelet agitator at 20&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C. The prepared unit was inspected for swirling movement, and platelet count was one prior to intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>After exclusion, we had a total of 112 cases; 62 in Group I and 50 in Group II.

A possible explanation for the long-lasting effect of PRP in chronic tendinopathy is that it promotes revascularization and enhances healing at the microscopic level.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Edwards and Calandrucio injected whole blood into patients with lateral epicondylitis and saw a success rate of 79%; however, multiple injections were necessary in 32% of patients.

Further studies are required with a greater number of patients in each group with even longer periods of follow-up.
