Throughout the last decade several studies have found positive effects of VR training on the learning curve as well as the improvement of basic psychomotor skills in the operating room, both in surgery and gynecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. VR simulators offer standardized and reproducible laparoscopic tasks, ranging from simple basic skills training to complex procedures such as a cholecystectomy or salpingectomy. Despite the well-established advantages of VR simulators, the majority of surgical and gynecological departments encounter hurdles implementing this form of training in surgical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge concerning the time, human resources, and costs needed to train novice surgeons to an adequate level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Current literature suggests a predefined proficiency level based on experts' performance as a preferred outcome for novice training rather than a fixed training time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but it has not been investigated whether instructor feedback impacts training to this predefined proficiency level in complex operational tasks. One study suggested that proctored instruction did not offer any advantages to trainees compared with an independent approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; however, the authors investigated only training of simple basic skills, such as instrument coordination, and did not include complex tasks, which is necessary in an advanced surgical training program.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-directed learning</title><p>Researchers in motor skills have demonstrated that participants who self-direct their access to instruction or feedback during practice learn more than those whose access is externally controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is uncertain whether these results apply in a surgical training environment. One study found self-directed learning beneficial in terms of unlimited access to video instruction, the technical task being simple suturing of a wound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The present randomized trial focuses on self-directed learning in regards to when to receive instructor feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Research goals</title><p>With a worldwide proliferation of simulation centers, it is essential to explore the optimal setting for laparoscopic training and investigate different learning approaches, e.g., a self-directed approach. The overall research goal of the present trial is to compare a feedback guided approach with an independent approach when training operational procedures on a laparoscopic VR simulator. Secondary research goals are to examine self-directed learning towards receiving instructor feedback along with potential sex differences and computer game experience during VR training. With this randomized trial we aim to study the need for human resources and optimal training methods when using VR simulation, and, thus, explore the best set up for surgical education.</p><p>We hypothesize that instructor feedback is pivotal when training on a VR simulator and will significantly improve surgical skills and self-perception. Additionally, retention of acquired surgical VR skills will be examined after six months.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants are medical students recruited through advertisements on websites at three student associations (Young Surgeons, Young Anesthesiologist, and the General Student newspaper) at the Copenhagen University Medical School, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Identifying the impact of instructor feedback may clarify the need for human resources when surgical training encompasses VR simulation. Furthermore, the trial can impart focus on feedback during VR training.</p><p>One randomized trial with 36 participants demonstrated that an independent approach to VR training, in which trainees rely solely on automated simulator feedback, required fewer training hours than a proctored approach to achieve simulator proficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The trial tested basic laparoscopic tasks on a VR simulator: camera navigation, instrument navigation and coordination, clip applying, and grasping. These tasks are relatively easy to accomplish intuitively, and is very different from the present trial where the task is a complex operational procedure involving both knowledge and motor skills. Furthermore, the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] had an overweight of participants who had had prior laparoscopic exposure in the non-proctored group (equaling our control group), which could affect the results.</p><p>Another randomized trial, where the intervention group had access to VR training (but no feedback) and the control group did not train on a VR simulator, indicated that simulator training in a non-supervised setting may not be sufficient to increase laparoscopic suturing skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The absence of supervised training could conceivably lead to bad habits, such as inappropriate tissue handling and instrument use, which could be detrimental in the operating room.</p><p>Several studies have focused on reactions from trainees using simulation-based training, and among the advantages found were: improved self-confidence and self-efficacy, and improved feeling of being proficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, there were also some indications of drawbacks, which include high levels of anxiety and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although little is known about which personal and contextual factors facilitate or impair transfer of learning from a simulation based setting to the clinical setting, it is thought to be important to provide feedback early on in order to support optimal performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Self-guided feedback</title><p>A self-directed learner takes responsibility for his or her knowledge production by becoming behaviorally and metacognitively active, and increased autonomy probably allows the participant to tailor knowledge production to his or her specific needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within motor skills learning, researchers have demonstrated that participants who self-direct their access to instruction or feedback during practice learn more than those whose access is externally controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. On the basis of these studies, we let the participants in the intervention group decide individually when they want the optional second and third feedback session. To our knowledge, no prior studies have focused on the optimal time to provide feedback in surgical VR training, and expect the present study will provide a guiding principle.</p><sec><title>Sex differences in surgical VR training</title><p>Several studies have found that men spend less time and produce fewer errors in surgical simulator training compared with women, however, this difference remains largely unrecognized and, consequently, unaddressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In an environment where laparoscopic training is increasingly used for evaluation of residents, it is important that surgical curricula acknowledge sex differences to ensure fair and personalized training opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Likewise, this trial will also explore potential sex differences in VR training.</p></sec><sec><title>Study limitations</title><p>None of the participants have performed laparoscopic surgery prior to the study, which could be seen as differing from the group of first-year residents to whom a VR curriculum would apply. In a Danish setting, the participants actually resemble first year residents since they often have no prior laparoscopic training either. The participants are recruited from special interest groups, i.e. students joining technological student organizations. In that respect they resemble residents more than the average student.</p><p>It would be optimal with residents as participants, but it is unrealistic since there are only 28 gynaecological residents a year in the Capital and Zealand Region of Denmark.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We hope this trial will improve our understanding of how to optimize the efficiency of surgical VR training and thus lead to better patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>VR: Virtual reality.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JO, FB, MM, PW, CRL, CR, CG, TG, BO and JLS participated in conception and design of the trial.
