Changes in sleep pattern are frequent signs of a new episode of (hypo)mania or depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment for primary insomnia, but there are no published results on the effects of CBT-I in patients with bipolar disorder. In this randomized controlled trial, we wish to compare CBT-I and treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone to determine its effect in improving quality of sleep, stabilizing minor mood variations and preventing new mood episodes in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with euthymic bipolar I or II disorder and insomnia, as verified by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-1) assessment, will be included. The patients enter a three-week run-in phase in which they complete a sleep diary and a mood diary, are monitored for seven consecutive days with an actigraph and on two of these nights with polysomnography in addition before randomization to an eight-week treatment trial. Treatment as usual consists of pharmacological and supportive psychosocial treatment. In this trial, CBT-I will consist of sleep restriction, psychoeducation about sleep, stabilization of the circadian rhythm, and challenging and correcting sleep state misperception, in three to eight sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial could document a new treatment for insomnia in bipolar disorder with possible effects on sleep and on stability of mood.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and is among the most costly disorders to affect human beings
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In many patients, bipolar disorder has a chronic and remitting nature characterized by periods of depression and periods of hypomania or mania, and is associated with disability in social and occupational function.</p><p>Between 50% and 100% of patients with bipolar disorder have been found to suffer from sleep disturbance, even in euthymic phases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sleep could be a key factor in bipolar disorder, as sleep has been shown to be vital for emotional regulation, and a change in sleep is one of the most frequent first signs of a new episode of (hypo)mania or depression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The main interventions for sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are regulation of the pharmacological treatment and focusing on circadian regularity in psychosocial treatments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Psychosocial treatments for bipolar disorder are based on around 20 sessions and consist of a package of lifestyle changes, such as regulation of activity and sleep, reduced use of alcohol and substances, monitoring signs of new episodes, support, and the formation of a plan for early intervention. Monitoring symptoms and early intervention for signs of mania are the only elements in the treatment packages that have been tested and found effective as a stand-alone intervention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Insomnia is defined as difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep. The disturbed sleep or associated daytime fatigue causes distress or impairment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Insomnia may be a primary disorder or it may be comorbid with other disorders. Insomnia affects 10% to 12% of the general population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Despite focusing on sleep and circadian regularity in existing treatments of bipolar disorder, there may be room for improvement in the treatment of sleep
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To our knowledge, studies describing more focused interventions using well-documented techniques in treating insomnia in bipolar patients have not been published.</p><p>Several trials have demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment for primary insomnia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It can be superior to pharmacological treatment in both short-term and long-term perspectives
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although evidence of the effectiveness of CBT-I has existed for more than 20 years, it has not been introduced to patients who also suffer from bipolar disorder
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Between-group effect sizes for CBT-I are usually in the range of 1.0 to 1.6, as measured with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although it is well documented that sleep is disturbed in bipolar disorder, there is less knowledge about how sleep is disturbed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There is evidence to suggest that sleep in bipolar disorder is characterized by circadian rhythm disturbance, as in patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome, as well as by maladaptive cognitive and behavioral strategies, as in otherwise healthy individuals with insomnia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Descriptive studies of frequency and type of sleep disturbance in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder are needed to improve treatment. Data from this trial will be used in a micro- and macroscopic description of the character of sleep disturbance in patients with euthymic bipolar disorder and comorbid sleep disturbance.</p><p>Sleep diaries, actigraphy, and, more seldom, polysomnography have traditionally been used to measure the effects of sleep interventions. Polysomnography is considered the best objective monitoring system and the only way to assess the constitution of sleep stages, including changes in slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, whereas subjective descriptions of sleep quality are better predictors of functional impairment and emotional distress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this randomized controlled trial are to compare CBT-I and treatment as usual (TAU) with treatment as usual alone in improving quality of sleep, stabilizing minor mood variations, and preventing new mood episodes in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid insomnia. In addition, the study will compare the use of sleep diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography, in order to possibly simplify registrations of sleep for clinical use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a randomized controlled trial aimed to study the efficacy of CBT-I in euthymic bipolar disorder patients with comorbid insomnia compared with TAU. Patients will be recruited from the Department of Psychiatry, St. Olav&#x02019;s University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. They must fulfill criteria for SCID-1 (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders) verified bipolar I or II disorder and be euthymic, as defined by a score on the Montgomery &#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) not higher than 13 or by a score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) not higher than seven. In addition, patients must fulfill the DSM-IV diagnosis criteria of &#x02018;insomnia related to another mental disorder&#x02019; as assessed by the Insomnia Interview Schedule (IIS)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Patients will not be accepted if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: they are in an affective episode; they work night shifts; they have an ongoing alcohol or substance abuse problem, or sleep apnea or other confounding sleep disorders, or medical conditions that may account for a sleep disturbance; or they have conditions or cognitive impairments incompatible with participation. Patients must not have been in a defined episode in the previous month or have been hospitalized in the previous two months. Any prophylactic medication of the participants must be accepted by a doctor in the study.</p><p>Patients meeting criteria for inclusion will enter a run-in phase consisting of three weeks, during which they will complete a sleep and mood diary and a register of adherence to medication. In the last of these three weeks, they will be monitored for seven consecutive days with an actigraph and for two nights using ambulatory polysomnography. The patients will be assigned a patient number and sign a consent form after receiving oral and written information about the study prior to undergoing study procedures. The patients will receive US $85 in compensation for each polysomnography session, and another US $85 in compensation for transport costs and other expenses related to participation. Those patients who are able to complete the three-week run-in phase and meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia will then be randomized to the treatment trial. Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> summarizes the study design and Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the measures to be used in the trial. Patients who have not received psychoeducation for bipolar disorder, either in groups or individually, will be offered such psychoeducation, to ensure that they have received optimal treatment for bipolar disorder. The patients will be rediagnosed for insomnia 6 months after treatment termination. The results of the nights recorded with sleep diaries, actigraphs, and polysomnography will be compared in order to describe the accuracy and clinical utility of sleep diaries and actigraphy compared with polysomnography in bipolar disorder. Participants in the TAU group will be offered standard treatment at the sleep clinic for their sleep disturbances at the end of the six-month follow-up. The included bipolar disorder patients will also be included in a descriptive study of bipolar patients in Norway, the Bipolar Research and Innovation Network- Norway (BRAIN-Norway).</p><fig id="F1"

The insomnia diagnosis will be assessed before randomization, and at a six-month follow-up. The polysomnographs will be administered by the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology at St. Olav&#x02019;s University Hospital and assessed by a blinded medical doctor. The actigraphy recordings will be administered by the clinician in charge of treatment of each patient. Except for the daily assessments of mood and sleep, the patient-reported measures will be collected using a secure internet-based interface, but patients will be given the option of completing the paper-version of the self-reported measures at the clinic instead.</p><p>Patients will be randomized to CBT-I or TAU by a web-based system developed and administered by the Unit of Applied Clinical Research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.

Bipolar patients may be prone to misperceive sleep for wakefulness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. There will also be a focus on challenging and correcting sleep state misperception using cognitive and behavioral techniques
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Circadian rhythm is likely to be disturbed in the included patients, so there will be particular emphasis on stabilization of the circadian rhythm. Chronotherapeutic interventions of light therapy and gradual sleep phase advancement are currently the best available treatment options for circadian rhythm disturbances
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. If necessary, these interventions will be included, to stabilize the circadian rhythm. The treatment will last for three to eight sessions. The therapists will be two clinical psychologists and one psychiatrist. Therapists will have received training in CBT-I and have one to nine years of clinical experience with CBT-I. Patients will be given checks for treatment credibility. Therapy sessions will be checked for adherence to manual by having at least two therapists present during treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal criteria</title><p>Patients will be withdrawn from the study if the clinician finds that the patient is in need of, or better served with, other treatment; if exclusion criteria are met; if the clinical condition gets significantly worse according to the clinicians&#x02019; judgment; or if patients withdraw their consent. All patients prematurely discontinuing the trial will be seen for a final evaluation.

Ordinal variables will be analyzed using nonparametric tests in addition to using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline values as covariates. The time to change in treatment for bipolar disorder will be analyzed using survival analysis. Linear mixed models will be applied in analyses of treatment response. All patients who fulfill baseline registration will be included in the analysis of baseline characteristics. All subjects who receive at least one session of CBT-I and provide post-baseline efficacy measurements will be included in efficacy data analyses.

Insomnia is associated with several negative health outcomes in the general population
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is likely that patients with bipolar disorder and insomnia, in addition to the same negative consequences, have an increased risk of experiencing new episodes of depression or (hypo) mania.</p><p>We are not aware of side effects related to CBT-I, but as it is an untested treatment in bipolar disorder, we do not know if it may trigger new episodes of depression or mania
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The extensive study program may become a potential problem for inclusion of participants and completion of study procedures. Motivational work will be all-important before and during treatment in both groups.</p><p>Descriptions of quality of sleep in euthymic periods of bipolar disorder are important for planning interventions and improving monitoring for signs of recurrence of new episodes of depression or (hypo) mania.</p><p>It is important to compare the value of diagnostic tools, such as sleep diaries, actigraphs and polysomnography, in order to improve the quality of diagnosis and possibly to simplify the clinical practice of such tools
