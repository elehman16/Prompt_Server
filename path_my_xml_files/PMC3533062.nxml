Mean age-at-death was 51.7 (&#x000b1;8.7) years. COD, MS relationship, or both were determined for 88% of deaths (71/81). Patients were assigned to one of nine COD categories: cardiovascular disease/stroke; cancer; pulmonary infections; sepsis; accidents; suicide; death due to MS; other known CODs; and unknown COD. Of the 69 patients for whom information on the relationship of death to MS was available, 78.3% (54/69) were adjudicated to be MS related.

This measure assesses the ratio of the mortality in patients with a condition (over the entire period of observation) divided by the mortality in an age-matched and sex-matched cohort (over the same interval) without the condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> In MS, the SMR is generally in the range of 2&#x02013;3, indicating that, in MS patients, death is 2&#x02013;3 times more likely over the observation period than in age-matched and gender-matched controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12 R13">9&#x02013;13</xref> An alternative metric of effect on longevity in MS patients is the average time from clinical onset to death. This time is approximately 35&#x02005;years (ranging from a low of 24.5&#x02005;years in a Scottish cohort to a high of 45&#x02005;years in a New Zealand cohort). Thus, compared with unaffected age-matched and sex-matched controls, MS patients die, on average, 7&#x02013;14&#x02005;years prematurely.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>Importantly, long-term outcomes such as the avoidance of unambiguous physical impairment, the ability to remain employed, and survival are of far greater importance to patients and families than are the short-term clinical and MRI outcomes measured during randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For this reason, long-term follow-up (LTF) studies are essential to assess the true impact of MS therapies on the disease. Nevertheless, such studies are difficult to execute successfully. The study of mortality in MS has been infrequent and, even then, only as part of natural history studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Moreover, and particularly in the past 20&#x02005;years, the potential impact of therapy on mortality has been largely ignored.</p><p>Recently, we reported our experience at 21&#x02005;years (the 21Y-LTF) in the cohort of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients who had previously participated in the pivotal RCT of interferon beta (IFN&#x003b2;)-1b for MS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18 R19">16&#x02013;19</xref> After a median of 21.1&#x02005;years from RCT enrolment, we identified 98.4% (366/372) of the original patient cohort. In this group, 81 deaths were recorded (22.1%; 81/366). Patients originally randomised to receive IFN&#x003b2;-1b (either 250 or 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g; every other day subcutaneously) had a significant reduction in the hazard rate for &#x02018;all-cause&#x02019; mortality (46.8% and 46.0%, respectively) over the 21-year period compared with patients originally randomised to receive placebo.</p><p>Although these findings clearly imply a mortality benefit of therapy, it is, nevertheless, important to determine both the causes of the observed deaths in these cohorts and the relationship between these deaths and the underlying MS. Thus, it is only through such an undertaking that one can connect the mortality benefit to an impact of therapy on MS. Nevertheless, this task can be problematic because the recorded cause-of-death (COD) may be unreliable due to multiple factors. These include the infrequency of autopsies in MS patients, the recording physician's lack of knowledge of the patient's medical history, and the absence of uniform diagnostic criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Similarly, establishing the MS relationship is often difficult because MS may be only an indirect contributor to death. For example, MS-related disability (either physical or cognitive) can predispose patients to a variety of other illnesses or conditions that, by themselves, can be fatal (eg, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis from pressure sores or urinary tract infections, deep-vein thromboses with subsequent pulmonary emboli, suicide, etc).</p><p>In the present study we aimed to develop a reliable method to determine the COD for the patients who died and to assess the relationship of these deaths to MS. We also aimed to establish whether the excessive 21-year mortality, which was observed in patients originally randomised to placebo, was due either to MS related or non-MS-related causes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>All patients enrolled in the pivotal RCT of IFN&#x003b2;-1b in RRMS were eligible to participate in the 21Y-LTF.

During the RCT, patients were treated and prospectively followed for a period of up to 5.1&#x02005;years on their assigned treatment regimen (mean: 3.3&#x000b1;1.4&#x02005;years; median: 3.8&#x02005;years; range: 0.1&#x02013;5.1&#x02005;years). At the end of the RCT in 1993, subsequent use of disease-modifying treatment (DMT) was at the discretion of patients and their physicians. IFN&#x003b2;-1b was the only DMT available until 1996 when the use of alternative DMTs became possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Post-RCT treatment information was available for 67% (249/372) of the original RCT population at the time of the 16-year (16Y)-LTF study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Of these, 55% (138/249) received only IFN&#x003b2;-1b and, in the remainder, there were no systematic differences in treatment or care observed across the three RCT-defined cohorts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Treatment information for the final 5&#x02005;years of follow-up was largely unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design and determination of vital status</title><p>Between 1 October 2009 and 15 December 2010 (approximately 21&#x02005;years after RCT enrolment), investigators at each study site attempted to identify each of the 372 randomised patients who took part in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b RCT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>

The voting members included two neurologists (SC and GE) and a critical care specialist (TO). Two of these three members (SC and TO) did not participate in the 21Y-LTF (ie, they were completely independent). In addition, two non-voting members also served on the committee&#x02014;a neurologist representative from Bayer (VK)&#x02014;who oversaw the deliberations&#x02014;and an academic biostatistician (GC). Committee members were blinded to the treatment allocation of the deceased patients.

This rule was invoked in eight patients (evenly divided among the treatment arms). Also, if MS was listed as the first (or only) COD on the death certificate, then the death was classified as &#x02018;death due to MS&#x02019;, which was, by definition, MS related. This rule was applied to 21 patients. Finally, if the patient had reached an EDSS &#x02265;7 at any time prior to their demise, the death was always considered to be MS related, regardless of the recorded COD. This rule was invoked to determine the MS relationship in six patients. In three of these, the COD was indeterminate but advanced disability was known to be present. In only three instances was this rule applied to patients in whom a COD other than MS was recorded&#x02014;in two with a suspected cardiovascular COD and in one with a multisystem organ failure. These three patients were evenly divided among the treatment arms and excluding did not alter the analysis.</p><p>For the second of these possible MS relationships, it was agreed a priori that deaths due to brainstem dysfunction, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, trauma or side effects of treatment were likely to be MS related. In these cases, however, determination of the MS relationship was judged by the context in which the death occurred and required some ancillary information. For example, death from a pulmonary embolism would be considered MS related if the patient were known have had marked lower-extremity weakness and/or was confined to wheelchair or bed and, especially, if the embolus was from a deep-vein thrombosis thought secondary to the patient's immobility.

In our earlier 21Y-LTF report,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> we observed that the HR for death was significantly reduced by 46.8% in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b 250&#x02009;&#x000b5;g group and by 46.0% in the IFN&#x003b2;-1b 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;g group compared to placebo. This nearly identical effect size in the two independently randomised groups provided strong supportive evidence that the observed survival benefit was not due to chance (ie, from a type I error). Although it was still possible that the observed benefit reflected an unusually high death rate in the placebo arm, this too seemed unlikely given the virtual overlap of placebo-group mortality with natural history studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, supplementary figure e-1) Thus, the survival rate for 29&#x02005;years after disease onset (&#x0223c;70%) observed by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> was much like that in our placebo group (70.4%). In addition, the fact that after completion of the RCT, some patients chose to receive alternative therapies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> does not detract from the findings. The 21Y-LTF analysis was done on a strict intent-to-treat basis. Moreover, the use of alternative therapies after randomisation will make any differences between the cohorts less (not more) conspicuous and, thus, should favour the null-hypothesis. Therefore, taken together, these findings of the 21Y-LTF strongly support the notion that there is a survival advantage following either earlier (or greater) exposure to IFN&#x003b2;-1b.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>The patient population included in this cohort study is relatively young in the context of mortality and, indeed, our cohort exhibits many of the expected trends from such a circumstance. Thus, the average age (&#x000b1;SD) at the time of the 21Y-LTF was 56.3 (&#x000b1;7.1) years, with an average age at death even younger (51.7&#x000b1;8.7&#x02005;years)&#x02014;a feature characteristic of young and active cohorts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Also typical of younger MS populations, the observed suicide rate was quite high (11.9%; 8/67). Moreover, the large majority of the deaths observed over the course of 21&#x02005;years were due to MS-related causes. This finding is anticipated in a younger cohort, where diseases of the elderly (eg, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer) are yet to overtake MS as the principal COD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Thus, in the 21Y-LTF, &#x02018;death due to MS&#x02019; accounted for 31.3% (21/67) of the assignable CODs and &#x02018;MS-related death&#x02019; accounted for 78.3% (54/69) of the assignable relationships and 67% of all deaths; these were more frequent compared with the combined category of cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer, which accounted for only 23.9% (16/67) of the assignable CODs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001972TB2">tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001972TB3">3</xref>).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> MS-related mortality ranges between 50% and 65%.</p><p>In addition to the fact that most of the observed deaths in this cohort were MS related, three other observations support the notion that the observed intergroup differences in death are likely due to the MS disease state. First, the excess in &#x02018;all-cause&#x02019; mortality in the placebo-assigned group is due, almost entirely, to an excess in MS-related deaths and not to other CODs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001972TB3">table 3</xref>). Second, the excess in MS-related deaths is largely attributable to an excess in fatal pulmonary infections, a complication known to occur in end-stage MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001972TB2">table 2</xref>). And, third, both of these observations were highly consistent in the two groups of patients who received active treatment during the RCT compared to those who received placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001972TB3">table 3</xref>). Taken together, these observations support the notion that the mortality benefit provided by IFN&#x003b2;-1b therapy is related to a reduction in MS-related disability and, secondarily, from those complications, which are known to occur in the setting of advanced MS.</p><p>These findings underscore the importance of conducting LTF studies after completion of the RCTs that lead to product approval, particularly when they use (as ours did) a strict ITT analysis, have very high ascertainment rates, and measure unambiguously objective endpoints. Although, there has been some surprising controversy about the need to perform group-matching procedures in these randomised LTF populations, several methodologists have pointed out that such procedures (in randomised trials) can actually introduce bias where none existed earlier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24 R25 R26 R27">24&#x02013;27</xref></p><p>A very important feature of our study is its near-complete ascertainment rate for survival data of the cohort (98.4%). This stands in stark contrast to previous LTF studies of MS patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29 R30">28&#x02013;30</xref> in which ascertainment rates were substantially less (39.8&#x02013;68.2%). Low ascertainment rates substantially increase the likelihood of bias, because patients who are lost to follow-up are more likely to be deceased than those who are actually located.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> In addition, the rules used for classifying the different CODs and establishing their MS relationship in this study were predefined and each assignment required the unanimous agreement of the three voting members on the adjudication committee (two of whom were completely independent of the 21Y-LTF). The fact that the observed COD in our cohort was usually MS related is, in general, consistent with previous reports;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4">1&#x02013;4</xref> however, the actual percentage of MS-related deaths (78.3%, 54/69) was somewhat higher than the 50&#x02013;70% reported by others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4">2&#x02013;4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> The reason for this is uncertain but probably reflects the younger age, the relatively early analysis compared with epidemiological studies with more complete mortality observations, and the selection of more active patients in this RCT-derived cohort compared to these other populations.</p><p>In summary, the large majority of deaths observed in this young RCT-derived cohort were adjudicated to be MS related (78.3%). Moreover, the excess in deaths observed in the placebo-randomised group were accounted for entirely by an excess in MS-related deaths and, in particular, by deaths due to pulmonary infections. Whether the impact of therapy on mortality is the consequence of early treatment or a larger cumulative exposure to IFN&#x003b2;-1b cannot be resolved. Regardless, however, these data support the notion that the mortality benefit from IFN&#x003b2;-1b is due to a treatment-related impact on the MS disease process itself.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e352" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001972.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e353" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001972.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DSG has contributed to the design/conceptualisation of the study, analysis/interpretation of the data, and drafting/revising the manuscript for intellectual content.
