Currently intensification is achieved by adding one or more prandial insulin injections to a basal insulin regimen (basal&#x02013;bolus), or by switching to a premixed biphasic insulin; for example, biphasic insulin aspart or insulin lispro mix <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>.</p><p>Basal&#x02013;bolus insulin regimens offer mealtime and between&#x02010;meal insulin coverage, but people may perceive these regimens to be intrusive and burdensome <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Injections of premixed, biphasic insulin regimens offer a less stringent alternative to provide prandial coverage for multiple meals <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>; however, these may be associated with an increased rate of overall <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> and nocturnal hypoglycaemia <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> because interaction between the soluble and protaminated components results in a prolonged and uneven peak glucose&#x02010;lowering effect compared with rapid&#x02010;acting insulins and a duration of action of &#x0003c;24 h <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Until recently, combining a long&#x02010;acting basal insulin with a distinct rapid&#x02010;acting insulin in a single injection was not feasible as the properties of the individual components are adversely affected by co&#x02010;formulation <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>.</p><p>Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a soluble combination of an ultra&#x02010;long&#x02010;acting basal insulin degludec (IDeg; 70%), and the rapid&#x02010;acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart (IAsp; 30%). The two components IDeg and IAsp coexist separately in solution <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, allowing them to be co&#x02010;formulated within a single injection. Upon subcutaneous injection, IDeg immediately forms stable multihexamers, resulting in a soluble tissue depot from which IDeg monomers slowly dissociate, while IAsp monomers are rapidly released into the circulation <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that the IDeg and IAsp components remain distinct in IDegAsp and provide separate prandial and basal glucose&#x02010;lowering effects, with a peak action attributable to IAsp and a flat, stable basal effect attributable to IDeg, sustainable for &#x0003e;24 h <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. The latter is in contrast to existing premixed insulins, which contain a rapid&#x02010;acting insulin analogue with a protaminated analogue that has an intermediate action profile <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. A limitation of premixed insulin and of fixed&#x02010;dose combination products, therefore, is the fixed ratio of prandial to basal insulin dose and that the doses can be complex to titrate <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>.</p><p>The clinical benefits of IDegAsp were demonstrated in a phase III trial of people with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on pre&#x02010; or self&#x02010;mixed insulin <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>.

Lower FPG with IDegAsp twice daily vs biphasic insulin aspart 30 twice daily was also reported in a pan&#x02010;Asian trial of participants with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal, pre&#x02010; or self&#x02010;mixed insulin + oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>.</p><p>Although clinical trials have shown the potential clinical benefits of IDegAsp twice daily vs premix insulins <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, some people may prefer to use IDegAsp once daily as a straightforward way to intensify treatment <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>.

Both treatments were well tolerated. There was no statistically significant difference in nocturnal hypoglycaemia between treatment groups, although there were fewer nocturnal hypoglycaemic events with IDegAsp, possibly as a result of the flat and stable action of the basal component of IDegAsp. IDegAsp once daily was associated with higher rates of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia compared with IGlar once daily, which may be related to the difference in timing of the hypoglycaemic events. With IDegAsp once daily, hypoglycaemic events were evenly distributed throughout the day, with a trend towards a higher rate in the evening (20.00&#x02013;24.00 h) when the majority of subjects receiving IDegAsp were dosed alongside their main evening meal (65% of subjects). In contrast, with IGlar once daily the rate was higher from late night to early morning (04.00&#x02013;08.00 h). This higher rate may be explained by the pharmacodynamic variability of IGlar vs that of the basal component of IDegAsp; in particular, within&#x02010;subject variability must be considered, which has been reported to be higher with IGlar and increases substantially 8 h post&#x02010;dosing <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>.</p><p>These differences in timing suggest that the higher rate of overall hypoglycaemic events seen with IDegAsp could be attributed to the increased daytime effects of the bolus component, rather than the basal component, while the lower rate of overall hypoglycaemic events observed with IGlar could be attributed to its basal component.</p><p>While the addition of prandial insulin may lead to an increase in daytime hypoglycaemia, the trial design and conduct of this study may have contributed to the relatively high rate of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia that was observed with IDegAsp. The protocol specified that IDegAsp was to be administered with the main evening meal (or largest meal of the day), with participants required to continue administering IDegAsp at the same meal throughout the trial; however, the timing of the largest meal of the day may vary over time, and hence, for some participants, on some days the dose of prandial insulin injected as part of IDegAsp could have triggered postprandial hypoglycaemia. The trial protocol may also account for the higher proportion of patients administering IGlar at an &#x02018;other&#x02019; or &#x02018;unknown&#x02019; meal, as participants in the IGlar group were advised to administer insulin according to approved label instructions, which may vary day to day based on subject lifestyle and preference.</p><p>Furthermore, as the participants were instructed to titrate their insulin dose according to their mean pre&#x02010;breakfast glucose level, the increase in dose of IDegAsp once daily to achieve the pre&#x02010;breakfast target also inadvertently increased the dose of the prandial insulin (IAsp) component in IDegAsp, which, in turn, may have contributed to higher rates of hypoglycaemia, if the size and association with the meal were not considered. These results highlight the importance of adjusting prandial insulin doses with the actual size of the meal consumed, whilst also considering evening glucose values, which will also have an impact on the decision to uptitrate the IDegAsp dose.</p><p>In a real&#x02010;life setting participants are more likely to adjust the injection time and/or dose to match day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day changes in eating and/or activity than they are when following a strictly defined study protocol, and as they become more familiar with a combination of insulins. Hence, the difference in overall hypoglycaemia between the two regimens may be lower in the real&#x02010;life setting.</p><p>In a separate phase III, 26&#x02010;week, open&#x02010;label, treat&#x02010;to&#x02010;target trial of IDegAsp once daily in insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve Japanese participants, IDegAsp once daily dosed at the largest meal provided superior glycaemic control, with significantly greater HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction and similar improvements in FPG as well similar rates of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, compared with IGlar <xref rid="dme13125-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. It could be speculated that Japanese eating patterns, in terms of meal size and timing, are more consistent from day to day, contributing to improved outcomes despite the inability to adjust injection time to match changes in diet. These findings highlight the importance of choosing and administering IDegAsp with the appropriate meal of the day to address the needs for prandial insulin coverage and to benefit from the characteristics of IDeg as basal insulin.</p><p>The study design may have had a strong impact on the results; specifically, on the rate of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia. The study protocol mandated a specific dosing time for IDegAsp administration and, as is the case with many clinical trials, may not be entirely reflective of real&#x02010;life practices of insulin administration. As such, in real life, dosing times are likely to change depending on the dietary and daily routines of participants. As in any open&#x02010;label trial, there may be a risk of underlying reporting bias. Investigators are likely to be more alert when treating subjects with a new insulin medical entity, such as IDegAsp, and subjects may be more hesitant towards a new treatment, for fear of hypoglycaemia or other side effects associated with treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this treat&#x02010;to&#x02010;target trial in insulin&#x02010;experienced participants with advanced Type 2 diabetes showed that IDegAsp once daily effectively improves glycaemic control and is non&#x02010;inferior to IGlar once daily in terms of reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Flexibility in the injection time together with changes in dose to match any significant day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day changes in eating patterns should be considered when using IDegAsp dosed once daily to minimize the risk of postprandial hypoglycaemia.</p></sec><sec id="dme13125-sec-0022"><title>Funding sources</title><p>This study was funded by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01045447, EudraCT number: 2008&#x02010;005767&#x02010;34), which was also responsible for the design, analysis and reporting of the study, with input from the authors.</p></sec><sec id="dme13125-sec-0023"><title>Competing interests</title><p>H.C.J. has received payments in the capacity of advisory panel member for Novo Nordisk.
