training using incremental weight loading on the ankle of the affected side on hemiplegic
stroke patients&#x02019; balance. [Subjects] In this study, 30 hemiplegic stroke patients were
randomly divided into an incremental weight load group (IWLG, <italic>n</italic>=15) and a
no-load group (NLG, <italic>n</italic>=15). [Methods] The IWLG performed gait training on
treadmills for four weeks wearing a sandbag weighing 3% of the body weight on the affected
side ankle, followed by wearing a sandbag weighing 5% of the body weight from the 5th
week. The NLG performed similar training without sandbags. [Results] Both the IWLG and the
NLG showed significant improvements in balance ability. The IWLG showed a larger decrease
in the area and length of movement of the center of pressure in static standing positions
after the experiment although the difference was not significant. [Conclusion] We
recommend, utilizing the treadmill-based gait training using incremental weight loading on
the affected side ankle as a clinical intervention for improving hemiplegic stroke
patients&#x02019; balance ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Incremental weight load</kwd><kwd>Treadmill</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hemiplegic stroke patients support only 25:43% of their body weight on their affected side
lower extremity in standing positions. As a result, asymmetric positions occur. Accordingly,
their balancing ability and ambulatory ability, which are among the most basic abilities
needed for maintaining daily living, are remarkably reduced. This significantly deteriorates
their quality of life, as it limits their activities of daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treadmill gait training, which simulates walking on flat land<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, is prescribed in hemiplegic stroke patients&#x02019; rehabilitation to
improve their balance and/or to reduce their gait disturbance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill gait training supporting the body weight has been
reported to improve the symmetry of gait and reduce ankylosis, and enable more effective
improvement of stroke patients&#x02019; ambulatory ability than walking on flat land alone<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, it has been reported to not
only improve standing balance, but also to reinforce muscle strength, improve balance, and
enable motor control in gait patterns to be newly recognized<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study in which weight was loaded on stroke patients&#x02019; affected side lower extremity to
examine the effect of load on walking speed, it was reported that although the effect was
not significant, the weight increased the muscle strength of the flexor muscles and improved
the toe-off action<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, in a
study in which weight was loaded on the affected side lower extremity during treadmill gait
training, increases in the swing phase time and improvement s in of ambulatory ability, such
as stair climbing, were found<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although diverse studies have been conducted on treadmill training for improvement of
hemiplegic stroke patients&#x02019; balance and ambulatory ability, studies of incremental weight
loading in gait training involving a treadmill are lacking. Therefore, this study examined
the effects of treadmill-based gait training with incremental weight loading on the affected
side ankle with respect to the improvement of hemiplegic stroke patients&#x02019; balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were inpatients who were being treated at D Hospital, Daegu, South Korea
who were diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke by specialists in rehabilitative medicine.
They were randomly assigned to an IWLG (8 males, 7 females) or an NLG (9 males, 6 females).
The IWLG subjects&#x02019; age was 55.07&#x000b1;15.14&#x02005;years(mean&#x000b1;SD), their height was 164.20&#x000b1;7.86&#x02005;cm, and
their weight was 61.93&#x000b1;10.40&#x02005;kg. There were 9 cases of left hemiplegia and 6 cases of right
hemiplegia, and the mean time since onset of stroke was 13.47&#x000b1;16.26 months. The NLG
subjects&#x02019; age was 50.00&#x000b1;13.33&#x02005;years(mean&#x000b1;SD), their height was 164.20&#x000b1;7.91&#x02005;cm, and their
weight was 60.67&#x000b1;6.81&#x02005;kg. There were 6 cases of left hemiplegia and 9 cases of right
hemiplegia, and the mean time since onset of stroke was 17.86&#x000b1;16.15 months.</p><p>The subjects were selected from among those who had no visual field defect or abnormality
in the vestibular organs, no orthopedic disease of the trunk or the lower extremities, were
not limited in their range of motion of the joints, had the cognitive ability to understand
and follow the researchers&#x02019; instructions, and scored 24 points or higher on the Mini-Mental
Status Examination-Korea (MMSE-K). All the subjects understood the purpose of this study and
provided their written informed consent prior to their participation in the study in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The IWLG engaged in gait training on motor-operated treadmills with a sandbag weighing
3&#x02013;&#x0003e;5% of body weight attached to the affected side ankle. During treadmill gait training,
one therapist assisted the subject when necessary by standing next to the affected side and
helping the patient with steps and lower extremity control during the swing and stance
phases. The treadmill speed was selected by the patient for walking on level ground, and was
increased by 0.1&#x02005;km/hr when the patient had walked for 20s or longer<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. For four weeks
from the beginning of the intervention, each patient wore a sandbag weighing 3% of body
weight on the affected side ankle, and from the fifth week onward, the patient wore a
sandbag weighing 5% of body weight during the gait training. The NLG engaged in gait
training without sandbags on motor-operated treadmills. Both groups engaged in the training
for 30 minutes per session, 5 times per week, for 8 weeks. Warm-up exercises and
cooling-down exercises were implemented before and after the gait training, respectively.
The outcome measures were measured twice, once, before the intervention, and again on the
completion of the 8-weeks intervention.</p><p>To measure the patients&#x02019; ability to balance, center of pressure sway areas (SA) and sway
length (SL) in the static standing position were measured.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 KO (IBM, IL, USA).
After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, the paired t-test was
used to compare the sway area and length following quiet standing between pre- and
post-intervention within each group. The significance of the differences in sway area and
length between the two groups were investigated using the independent t-test. The
statistical significance level, &#x003b1;, was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The IWLG showed significant decreases in center of pressure SA and SL in the static

not significant, in a comparison of the differences in center of pressure SA and SL in a
static standing position between before and after the experiment. Given this result, the
muscle strength of the affected side lower extremity seems to have been increased in the
IWLG because of the repetitive weight loading gait training. Thus, this group&#x02019;s ability to
bear weight increased. Additionally, the ability to shift weight improved, improving ankle
stability which in turn improved balance ability.</p><p>Frenceschini et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
treadmill gait training improved stroke patients&#x02019; trunk control ability such that their
balance ability was improve. Also, studies conducted by Laufer et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and Lin et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that reinforced muscle strength, such as those of the
dorsal flexor of the ankle joint and the flexor of the hip joint on the affected side lower
extremity, reduced the phenomenon of foot dragging during the swing phase. As a result, the
affected side lower extremity&#x02019;s time in the air was reduced, enabling weight shifting, and
improving balance, witch resulted in a faster walking speed. In recent studies, Raymond et
al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that incremental weight
loading training seemed to be a safe exercise method for elderly persons, and Hass et
al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that incremental weight
loading training for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease patients showed good effects on the movement of the
center of pressure in the standing position, and the length and speed of the first step.</p><p>As in these previous studies, both groups in our present study showed improvement in
balance. However, when compared to the NLG, the IWLG showed a little more improvement in
balance ability. We infer, that the incremental weight loading gait training additionally
implemented on a treadmill increased the hemiplegic stroke patients&#x02019; lower extremity
stability and lower extremity flexor strength more, thereby contributing to the greater
improvement in balance. Therefore, treadmill gait training with incremental weight loading
on the affected side lower extremity can be recommended as a clinical intervention for
stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>YR</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dual-task-related gait changes in individuals with
