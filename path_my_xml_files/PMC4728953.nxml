Thus, the air flow through one nostril is greater than next at any given point of time which later switches to another. This is called nasal cycle.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The nasal cycle which lasts for 25 min to 2&#x02013;3 h is closely related to the ultradian rhythm of cerebral dominance that lasts for 1.5&#x02013;3 h.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The dominance of nasal cycle is inversely correlated to the alternating dominance in the cerebral hemispheres; this is regulated by a common mechanism mediated through the autonomic nervous system.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have shown that integrated EEG amplitudes are greater over the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the dominant nostril.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This rhythm of cerebral dominance plays an important role in cognitive performance, memory processes, mood, and behavior.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Pranayama refers to voluntarily regulated rhythmic yoga breathing technique.

The subjects were students of graduation and postgraduation studies from a Yoga University. They had an experience of practicing the three yoga breathing techniques that are, RNYB, LNYB and breathe awareness (BA) ranging between 3 and 36 months (group mean &#x000b1; SD, 12.5 &#x000b1; 8.6 months). All of them had completed a residential training course in yoga which was for 1-month. In addition to this, all the subjects included in the study were given week long training in the breathing practices assessed in the present study for 30 min each day for a week before starting the study. This 1-week of supervised practice was to ensure the uniformity among all the subjects. All subjects were checked for their health using general health questionnaire (GHQ) and those with GHQ score &#x02265;7 were excluded. None of them had a history of smoking or respiratory ailments including nasopharyngeal abnormalities. They were all right handed dominant based on their response to the Edinburgh handedness inventory.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Also, none of them was taking medication and they did not use any other wellness strategy.

We found that RNYB lead to a significant increase in the level of oxyHb and totalHb in the left PFC in comparison to BA or LNYB, also, there was a trend toward significant reduction in oxyHb in right PFC during LNYB and BA, respectively.</p><p>Increase in totalHb and oxyHb and a reciprocal decrease in deoxyHb are expected to be observed in activated areas of the brain in NIRS measurements which indicates an increase in the blood flow,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] though researchers have found activation of a brain region when there is: (1) No change in totalHb alongside an increase in oxyHb and a reciprocal decrease in deoxyHb and (2) an increase or no change in deoxyHb accompanying increases in totalHb and oxyHb.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] OxyHb is considered as the most sensitive indicator of changes in regional cerebral blood flow in NIRS measurements.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] We found an increase in both oxyHb and totalHb with no change in deoxyHb in the left PFC during RNYB. Thus, the present study suggests activation or increase in the blood flow in the left PFC during RNYB and trend towards deactivation of right PFC during LNYB and BA, respectively.</p><p>These results support the relationship between nasal cycle and ultradian rhythm of cerebral dominance and point toward change in the blood flow and oxygenation in contralateral brain regions as one of the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Present study also explains: (1) Better performance in the left hemisphere dominant tasks such as verbal memory scores and letter-cancellation task and (2) increased integrated EEG amplitudes and reduced P300 latency in left hemisphere observed immediately after RNYB respectively.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>We also observed a trend toward the significant decrease in oxyHb [<italic>P</italic> = 0.053; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] along with no change in deoxyHb or totalHb in right PFC during LNYB. This suggests a probable deactivating or relaxing effect of LNYB on right PFC. But studies have observed the better performances in right hemisphere dominant tasks and higher integrated EEG amplitudes in the right hemisphere after LNYB. Thus, why we did not get activating effects on right hemisphere following LNYB or in contrast why our results show a deactivating or relaxing trend is difficult to explain and more detailed studies to understand the underlying mechanisms are needed in future. Here one important aspect is the traditional ancient yogic view on uninostril yogic breathing where LNYB also known as <italic>Chandra anulomaviloma</italic> is believed to produce the calming and relaxing effect on the body in contrast to RNYB or <italic>Surya anulomaviloma</italic> which is more activating and energizing.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Results in the present study support this view. Previously, similar diverging effects of RNYB and LNYB have been observed on autonomic nervous system, where RNYB lead to higher sympathetic activity but LNYB, on the other hand, brought parasympathetic dominance.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The exact mechanism through which uninostril breathing influences cerebral blood flow is not known. PFC receives serotonergic input from dorsal raphe nucleus of the brainstem, as well as noradrenergic input from another brainstem nucleus, the locus coeruleus (LC). A large number of studies have shown that these two neurotransmitter systems (serotonin and nordrenaline) modulate the functional properties of the PFC in both humans and animal models. Studies have revealed that breathing through a particular nostril can alter metabolism and autonomic activites.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The mechanical receptors in the nasal mucosa are activated with airflow into the nostrils, and this signal is unilaterally transmitted to the hypothalamus thereby altering the autonomic functions mediated via hypthalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Telles <italic>et al</italic>. found that regular practice of RNYB for a month leads to a significant increase of 37% in baseline oxygen consumption. The authors attributed this increase in metabolism to increased sympathetic discharge mediated by increased output of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Interestingly, LC has been identified as an upstream component of circuitry providing for dorsal medial PFC modulation of emotional stress-induced (HPA) activation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Thus, uninostril yoga breathing may influence PFC through HPA-LC mediated noradrenaline release. Another neurotransmitter which may play an important role in mediating PFC activation is serotonin. In order to understand the neuro-physiological mechanisms involved in Zen meditation, another study used 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy during a 20-min session of abdominal (Tanden) breathing in 15 healthy volunteers. They found a significant increase in the level of oxyHb in anterior PFC during Tanden breathing, accompanied by a reduction in feeling of negative mood compared to the baseline. They also observed changes in EEG such as increased alpha band activity and decreased theta band activity during Tanden breathing and EEG changes were correlated with a significant increase in whole blood serotonin (serotonin) levels. Thus, the author concluded that Tanden breathing lead to the activation of the anterior PFC and serotonin system. This may be responsible for the improvement of negative mood and EEG signal changes observed during Tanden breathing.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Another study assessed three primary lines of evidence that comprised of the effects of serotonin and noradrenaline on impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, and working memory and found supporting evidence toward the activating effect of serotonin and deactivating effect of noradrenaline on PFC.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Improvement in mood and EEG changes have been observed with RNYB,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as these changes are correlated with serotonin level as well and serotonin has an activating effect on PFC, it appears probable that RNYB may be mediating its PFC activating effect via increased serotonin release from the dorsal raphe nucleus in the brainstem. Now the question arises, what makes RNYB specifically engage the dorsal raphe nucleus pathway? It is well known that right and LNYB have diverging effects on the autonomic nervous system, where RNYB causes sympathetic activation and LNYB leads to parasympathetic dominance. These effects are exerted via autonomic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] RNYB stimulates the paraventricular nucleus and may selectively increase corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cortisol by modulation of HPA axis. CRH is the stress neurotransmitter which plays an important role in the activation of the central sympathetic and serotonergic systems and release of serotonin from dorsal raphe nucleus has been shown to be mediated by the release of CRH.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Thus, it is hypothesized that RNYB causes prefrontal activation through HPA-CRH-dorsal raphe nucleus mediated serotonin release. LNYB, on the other hand, leads to parasympathetic dominance by suppressing the activation of the paraventricular nucleus and thereby decreasing CRH and cortisol secretion. This may exert opposing effects. It is known that neural connections exist between the CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and noradrenergic neurons in LC.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Also, increased parasympathetic response (as observed after LNYB) could result in a decrease in both heart rate and respiration that may lead to the stimulation of LC by the paragigantocellular nucleus.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Thus, two breathing techniques may follow different pathways to cause the activation or deactivation of contralateral hemispheres [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. A hypothetical mechanism can be postulated to explain the activating and deactivating effects of RNYB and LNYB as observed in our study: This involves HPA-LC mediated noradrenaline release to cause PFC deactivation and HPA-CRH-dorsal raphe nucleus mediated serotonin release to cause PFC activation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Pathway showing hypothetical mechanism of action of uninostril yoga breathing on brain hemodynamics.

A randomized controlled design would have been better, but this could not be achieved in the present study due to limited subject availability. Second, we did not assess the post-breathing baseline. The main objective of present study was to understand the mechanism through which uninostril yoga breathing affects cognition. Thus, this preliminary study was planned to see the effect during the breathing process on PFC activation. In future, we plan to assess the post-breathing effects as well to find out the duration for which the effect lasts after the breathing technique. Future studies should also use other comprehensive imaging techniques such as fMRI to confirm these findings and should observe the effect of uninostril breathings on other brain areas as well. Effect of uninostril yoga breathing on neuro-chemicals should also be assessed in future studies to understand the mechanism behind activation or deactivation of PFCs.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Future studies should also apply and observe the effects of uninostril yoga breathing on individuals with various psychopathologies where lateralized cerebral dysfunctions are prominent, viz., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alzheimer's disease, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder etc.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Yoga breathing through a particular nostril was found to have an effect on contralateral frontal hemodynamics.
