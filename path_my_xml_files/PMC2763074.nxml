Many anatomical landmark (LM)-guided techniques for IJV puncture have been described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cln_64p989">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-cln_64p989">2</xref> Complications, including death, are influenced by patient factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), site of attempted access, and operator experience.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cln_64p989">3</xref> It has been suggested that ultrasound (US) guidance could improve the success rate, reduce the number of needle passes, and decrease complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-cln_64p989">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-cln_64p989">5</xref> Although the ultrasound method has been favorably compared to the landmark technique, its widespread use has been hampered by the unavailability of equipment, such as the specially designed ultrasound device, and the lack of trained personnel.</p><p>Cannulation of the IJV is usually preferred because of its anatomical position and large diameter in the Trendelenburg position. Moreover, the minimal likelihood of obstructions along its route to the right atrium facilitates the introduction of various sizes of catheters using the external anatomical landmark method.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether ultrasound guidance could improve the success rate and decrease the complication rate of IJV catheterization compared to the landmark technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective study was approved by the Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa-Turkey ethics committee (15 April 2008, 2008-8/28), and written consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 380 patients were enrolled in between April and November, 2008. Patients with local or systemic infection, known vascular abnormalities, untreated coagulopathy (international normalization ratio &#x0003e; 1.5 and platelets &#x0003c; 50000/mm<sup>3</sup>) were excluded from the study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the LM group, in which cannulation was attempted via the landmark technique, and the US group, in which cannulation was attempted using ultrasound guidance.</p><sec><title>The landmark technique</title><p>Patients were placed in a supine position with the head rotated at a 30&#x000b0; angle in the Trendelenburg position. The operator, who was a senior medical student in their final year, wore gown, cap, mask, and sterile gloves. The skin was cleaned with povidone-iodine before the placement of sterile drapes. After infiltration with 1% lidocaine, the IJV was located with a &#x02018;finder&#x02019; needle connected to a 2-ml syringe. The needle was advanced through the skin at a 45&#x000b0; angle in the direction of the right nipple. The return of venous blood into the syringe confirmed entry into the vessel, and the finder needle was then used to guide a 16-gauge, 10 cm needle connected to a 10-ml syringe. A guide-wire was then placed through the needle into the vein, and the needle was removed. A central venous catheter (Certofix&#x000ae; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) was placed over the wire and advanced into the IJV.</p></sec><sec><title>The ultrasound technique</title><p>The area was prepared as described in the landmark technique section above. Before the procedure, the position of the IJV was determined using a 7.5 MHz linear ultrasound probe (PLT 704 AT Toshiba Tokyo, Japan) and ultrasound (Aplio, Toshiba Tokyo Japan). After choosing the proper position, the skin was infiltrated with %1 lidocaine, and the IJV was located with an 18-gauge needle guided by the ultrasound probe. When the needle appeared to be in the vessel, evidenced by the ultrasound and the return of venous blood into the syringe, a guide-wire was placed through the needle into the vein and the needle was removed. A central venous catheter (Certofix&#x000ae; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) was placed over the wire and advanced into the IJV.</p><p>Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, physiological score (ASA), coagulation parameters (such as platelet numbers), and clinical parameters were recorded for all patients.</p><p>The measured outcomes were the access time, the number of attempts for successful placement, and catheter complications, such as carotid artery puncture, skin hematoma, brachial plexus injury, pneumothorax, and hemothorax.</p><p>Access time was defined as the time between the first skin puncture and the aspiration of venous blood into the syringe. Successful placement was defined as the observation of the catheters in the proper position by X-ray and functional determinants (i.e., no difficulty in the infusion or aspiration of venous blood).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We estimated a 0.90 probability [standard deviation (SD)] that a patient who received IJV catheterization using the US-guided technique would have lower attempt numbers and complications. Assuming that the number of attempts would be compared using the Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank sum test with a two-sided, 10% level of statistical significance and 90% power, we calculated that at least 167 patients for per group were required. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or as the number of patients per category. A chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, and a Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to compare independent means. <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The characteristics of the 380 patients studied are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln_64p989">table 1</xref>.</p><p>There were no significant differences between the two groups for age, BMI, gender, the side of catheterization, or the risk factors for difficult venous cannulation (such as prior catheterization, limited sites for access attempts, known vascular abnormalities, untreated coagulopathy, and skeletal deformity).</p><p>In all except 189 patients in the US group, the IJV was visualized and cannulated. One of the patients in the ultrasound group had an abnormality of the vascular track (thrombus visualized in the vena cava superior behind the azygos vein), which resulted in an unsuccessful attempt. During the US-guided procedure, the IJV can be visualized before the vessel is actually penetrated. Using this approach, a single-wall puncture can be made by the needle to the anterior wall. A short stabbing motion of the needle at this point will tend to puncture the anterior wall without opposing it to the posterior wall, thereby avoiding a double wall puncture. Single wall punctures were achieved in all cases in the US group.</p><p>Bleeding through the insertion site developed in two patients in the US group as an immediate complication of catheter placement. None of the patients developed a pneumothorax, hemothorax, or inappropriate position of the catheter in the US group.</p><p>The overall complication rate was higher in the LM group compared to the US group (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Carotid puncture and hematoma were the most frequent complications in the LM group compared to the US group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). None of the minor complications required any specific intervention other than compression of the puncture site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cln_64p989">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the number of attempts for successful placement was significantly higher in the LM group compared to the US group, which explains the significant increase in access time in the LM group (p &#x0003c; 0.05 and p &#x0003c; 0.01, respectively). Although the LM group had a higher number of attempts, a longer access time, and a more frequent complication rate, the success rate was comparable between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cln_64p989">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This prospective study demonstrated the superiority of US-assisted cannulation of the IJV compared to the external landmark technique.</p><p>Most studies in the literature have used only US guidance in placing central venous catheters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-cln_64p989">6</xref> These studies, however, were conducted on critically ill or mechanically ventilated patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cln_64p989">7</xref> We studied 380 patients, all of whom had spontaneous breathing.

Using the landmark technique, we found that the success rate of IJV catheterization was 97.3%, which is consistent with previous reports (ranging from 85% to 99%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cln_64p989">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln_64p989">16</xref></p><p>Arterial puncture of the carotid artery is the most frequent complication of IJV catheterization because of its close anatomical proximity to the IJV.
