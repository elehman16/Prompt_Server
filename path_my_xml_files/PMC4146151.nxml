This study examined the effects of acupuncture on brain function in a pathological context. Sixteen patients with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to true point group (true acupuncture at right <italic>Waiguan</italic> (SJ5)) and sham point group (sham acupuncture). Results of functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed activation in right parietal lobe (Brodmann areas 7 and 19), the right temporal lobe (Brodmann area 39), the right limbic lobe (Brodmann area 23) and bilateral occipital lobes (Brodmann area 18). Furthermore, inhibition of bilateral frontal lobes (Brodmann area 4, 6, and 45), right parietal lobe (Brodmann areas 1 and 5) and left temporal lobe (Brodmann area 21) were observed in the true point group. Activation in the precuneus of right parietal lobe (Brodmann area 7) and inhibition of the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 10) was observed in the sham group. Compared with sham acupuncture, acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> in stroke patients inhibited Brodmann area 5 on the healthy side.

Early studies concerning the specificity of meridians and acupuncture points have mainly focused on tissue structure, biophysics, pathological reaction, function, and clinical curative effects[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The proposal of a meridians- and acupuncture-points brain-related theory has provided a new direction for the study of the specificity of meridians and acupuncture points[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Simultaneously, modern imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is developing rapidly and provides an effective means to study these issues.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that acupuncture at meridians and acupuncture points can induce both activation and inhibition in functional brain areas[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Acupuncture at <italic>Neiguan</italic> (PC6) has been confirmed to activate bilateral temporal and frontal lobes of healthy elderly people[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Another study verified that the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations was significantly higher in the cerebral cortex (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe), brainstem, and cerebellum of normal people after acupuncture at <italic>Zusanli</italic> (ST36) in a resting state. Chen et al.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] performed fMRI and found that acupuncture at <italic>Daling</italic> (PC7) activated Brodmann area (BA) 6, BA22, and BA46 in the frontal and temporal lobes of healthy people.</p><p>However, the relationship between meridians and acupuncture points and the brain under pathological conditions remains unknown. Yeo et al.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] verified activation in substantia nigra and caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease after acupuncture at <italic>Yanglingquan</italic> (GB34). Using functional imaging, Yi et al.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] confirmed that after acupuncture at <italic>Taichong</italic> (LR3), fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations was noticeably less in the left frontal lobe (BA10) of patients suffering from depression. Fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations was positively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, showing a potential association between acupuncture at <italic>Taichong</italic> and depression.</p><p>Although numerous studies concerning the correlation of meridians/acupuncture points and brain activity have been conducted, powerful evidence and a complete theoretical system remain lacking. For example, stroke is a very common affliction in the clinic, and while the clinical therapeutic effects of acupuncture for stroke victims have been confirmed[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], current knowledge still cannot fully explain the underlying mechanism. A previous study has confirmed that the mechanism might be associated with specific activation/inhibition of brain areas by acupuncture at meridians and acupuncture points[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> (SJ5) has been shown to effectively improve sequelae of stroke such as hemiplegia and sensory disturbance, it is commonly selected as a target point for research[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, few studies have compared changes in brain activity after acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> and sham points.</p><p>Therefore, this study focused on the effects of acupuncture on brain function in ischemic stroke patients, and compared the effects between <italic>Waiguan</italic> and sham points. fMRI revealed morphological changes in stroke patients and cerebral blood flow.

This study chose a specific acupuncture point (<italic>Waiguan</italic>) based on the specific therapeutic effects for stroke patients, focused on comparing changes in brain activity (assessed by fMRI) between stimulation at <italic>Waiguan</italic> and a sham point, and then explored the possible central mechanism.</p><p>fMRI is based on alterations in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, and detects brain activity in real time[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. By comparing time periods in which the needles were twirled (stimulation) and when they were not moving (baseline), we could find brain regions that were more active during stimulation (higher BOLD signal during twirling), as well as those that were less active during stimulation (lower BOLD signal during twirling).</p><p>Experimental results showed that both acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> and sham acupuncture activated/deactivated several brain regions in patients with ischemic stroke. This is probably because whether at rest or doing a specific task, different brain areas exert their functions by interacting and coordinating with each other, and thus constitute a network[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, infarct foci were primarily in the left hemisphere. However, when compared with sham acupuncture, the specificity of acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> mainly reflected a significant reduction in BOLD signal in right BA5. That is, deoxyhemoglobin contents increased in regional blood, and this kind of change in blood oxygen saturation was associated with decreased blood flow[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A previous study suggested that acupuncture therapy could effectively improve blood perfusion surrounding the ischemic foci of the brain[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another study confirmed that acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> in ischemic stroke patients activates brain areas in the hemisphere ipsiateral to the acupuncture site more than it does in people with undamaged brains. Moreover, the activated areas were similar to those on the affected side. This possibly resulted from improved cerebral blood circulation and promoting compensation on the healthy side[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. BA5 is in parietal association cortex, mainly receives projections from somatosensory cortex, and participates in integrated information processing of somatic sensation. It is closely associated with tactility and space perception, and helps maintain coordination of the body during spatial activities[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, we presume that noticeable inhibition of right BA5 possibly reflected the relative elevation of the functions of the left-brain areas. Compared with the sham point, effects of <italic>Waiguan</italic> were possibly concentrated in the healthy regions of the brain. Cerebral blood flow was reduced on the healthy side. This was consistent with the function-improving effects of acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> on the affected side.</p><p>However, this study did not demonstrate that acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> increased cerebral blood flow on the affected side compared with sham acupuncture. We presumed the reasons are as follows: (1) effects of <italic>Waiguan</italic> were possibly centralized on the healthy side. In the clinic, combining <italic>Waiguan</italic> with other points effectively improved blood perfusion surrounding the ischemic foci. (2) The sample size was relatively small and the ratio of men to women was not the same across groups. Additionally, individual difference was great. For these reasons, alterations in cerebral blood flow on the affected side were likely obscured. Because of limited conditions, pathological changes in the subjects in this study mainly occurred in the left basal ganglia. The focus range was large, and individual difference was great. This study only explored the activated/deactivated brain areas of ischemic stroke patients after acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic>, and did not deeply investigate the specificity of the default network. The present study lacked clinical data on acupuncture at <italic>Waiguan</italic> alone for ischemic stroke, but only analyzed the differences of <italic>Waiguan</italic> and sham point in a pathological state. Further studies should find ways to overcome these limitations.</p><p>In summary, compared with a sham point, <italic>Waiguan</italic> acupuncture noticeably inhibited BA5 contralateral to lesions, and this is possibly a central mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of <italic>Waiguan</italic> acupuncture in ischemic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-4"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Design</title><p>A concurrent randomized controlled study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Time and setting</title><p>Experiments were performed in the MRI Image Center, Nanfang Hospital, China from October 2008 to August 2010.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixteen ischemic stroke patients were enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients were in accordance with diagnostic criteria of the Cardiovascular Health Study[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Numeration data were expressed as ratio. The smoothed data were analyzed with a generalized linear model voxel by voxel. The <italic>T</italic> value of each voxel was calculated utilizing two-sample t-tests, and statistical parametric mapping was based on the <italic>T</italic> value (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001, uncorrected, <italic>K</italic> &#x0003e; 30). Significant alterations in brain regions were identified during stimulation and control conditions and superimposed on the standard brain image mode of anatomic images of each subject. The activated/deactivated con files output by the models for true point and sham point groups were further analyzed by a two-independent sample t-test. Central coordinates from statistical parameters determined with SPM software package were reproduced and input in Talairach Client (download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.talairach.org/client.html">http://www.talairach.org/client.html</ext-link>) to obtain the BA range of the functional areas of the brain and the anatomical location, which were corrected by a physician from the neurological medicine department in accordance with clinical experience and anatomic knowledge.
