However, the findings of a recent meta-analysis suggest that the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) is increased by using staples to close surgical wounds.

The time to close wounds was shorter in the staple group (mean=4.8 min, CI = 2.6&#x02013;7.1) than the suture group (mean=12 min, CI = 7.9&#x02013;16).

Two-hundred and ninety-thousand SSIs occur in the United States annually following elective orthopedic surgery resulting in $1 billion to $10 billionadditional healthcare costs according to CDC estimates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Orthopedic SSIs can prolong hospital stay by a median of two weeks per patient and increased healthcare costs by more than 300% per case
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A potentially more insidious post-operative occurrence are the minor complication(s) faced by patients related to their wound closure. Few research studies address the burden that these complications such as wound drainage, wound necrosis, dehiscence and blistering place on patients, office staff and the healthcare system as a whole.</p><p>Most surgeons choose a method of closure based on training, past experiences, and convenience. A recent meta-analysis comparing staples to sutures in orthopaedic wound closure demonstrated a three-fold increase in infections in stapled wounds compared with sutured wounds
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The ensuing debate surrounding the results of this meta-analysis has pointed out that the included studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] did not uniformly employ experimental designs that limit bias. Additionally, the included studies employed heterogeneous outcome definitions drawing into question the generalizability of the meta-analysis.</p><p>Animal studies have shown the mechanical equivalence of stapled and sutured wounds
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and clinical studies in several specialties have also failed to show superiority of the cosmetic appearance of stapled or sutured wounds
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, no comparative trial exists that has the statistical power to determine if the rate of infection in wounds closed with staples is different from that in wounds closed with sutures in orthopedic procedures. More importantly, great uncertainty exists surrounding the incidence of all infectious and non-infectious wound complications after open orthopaedic procedures. Available studies report rates of between 13% and 60%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this pilot study was to: determine the sample size required to definitively prove the superiority of sutures or staples for wound closure in orthopaedic surgical procedures in terms of reducing wound complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All adult orthopaedic patients undergoing a non-emergent procedure between December 2010 and November 2011 were screened for eligibility either in the preadmission clinics for elective cases or after admission for trauma-related procedures. Patients were consented for participation prior to screening. Patients were included if they were to undergo an orthopedic procedure requiring a wound greater than two centimeters in length. Exclusion criteria included, open fractures, procedures of the foot or hand, arthroscopic procedures and chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment. The study was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Board. A schematic of the trial design can be found in Figure

Medical comorbidities affecting wound healing including: diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, liver failure and inflammatory arthritis were identified. Medications including corticosteroids, transplant anti-rejection medications, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs warfarin, asprin, clopidogrel and heparin were noted by patient report. A smoking history was also obtained. A trained research assistant or orthopaedic surgery resident collected patient data on case report forms which were later entered into an electronic database (MS Excel, Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p><p>Allocation of patients to treatment groups occurred at the completion of deep wound closure using sequentially-numbered opaque envelopes with randomization sequence generated by the principle investigator using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). Any participant felt to be endangered by the use of one closure method was withdrawn from the study prior to allocation.</p><p>After completion of the procedure, deep tissues were closed with absorbable braided suture (Polysorb, Covidien, Mansfield, MA). In all patients the subcutaneous tissue was also closed with an absorbable braided suture. Patients allocated to the sutures intervention had their wounds closed using the suture material chosen by the primary surgeon. The primary surgeon also decided on the most appropriate technique of closure. Those allocated to the staples group were closed using a commercially-available stapler (Weck Visistat 35W, Limerick, PA). Closure material was removed, when necessary, during a wound check two weeks after surgery by medical staff or orthopedic technologists.</p><p>Patients were blinded to treatment allocation by use of an adhesive bandage or plaster which remained in place until the first planned post-operative visit when the closure material was removed or the wound was checked, including the removal of steristrips in the case of absorbable subcuticular closure. During closure material removal the wound was hidden from the view of the patient when necessary to maintain blinding. Immediately prior to unblinding patients completed an outcome assessment survey including a questionnaire determining complication occurance and a 100 mm VAS pain scale. Pain measurements were normalized to worst pain imaginable reported by the patient.</p><p>Wound complications were identified by hospital staff during the post-operative inpatient stay and were reported by patients at two- and six-week follow-up appointments in a survey conducted by the study coordinator. Patients were asked whether they had taken antibiotics, required dressing changes or a re-operation at two- and six-week follow-up appointments, with affirmative answers resulting in further questioning to confirm the type of complication that had occurred. Suspected infections were defined as: reoperation, use of intravenous antibiotics or patient report of use of oral antibiotics related directly to the surgical procedure. Wound drainage, necrosis, dehiscence and suture abscess were suspected when dressing changes or additional medical treatment was reported by the patient. The hospital and clinic charts of all suspected infections and five negative controls were reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon to confirm the diagnosis of surgical site infection as defined by the CDC. Secondary outcome measures of time taken to close wounds and pain with wound closure removal were also collected.</p><p>The primary outcome was a composite measure of all-cause, patient-reported wound complications. Primary outcome data for the entire cohort of patients encompassing four anatomic sites was analyzed using the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (Stata, College Station, TX) and are presented as relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. Strata-specific relative risks were calculated for each anatomic site using the primary outcome measure. Continuous secondary outcome measures were analyzed using a 2-tailed Student&#x02019;s t-test. The results were reported as per the guidelines of the CONSORT group

The mean difference for time of closure in this study indicates a seven minute time savings with the use of staples to close skin. If the average orthopaedic surgeon performs five procedures a day, the use of staples could save as much as 35 minutes of operative time preventing the cancellation of surgeries.</p><p>This study showed a small, clinically relevant difference in pain upon staple removal compared to that of suture removal.</p><p>There are several limitations to the results presented here. This pilot study represents a short-term follow-up of surgical wounds with only six-week data collected. Therefore, the actual incidence of wound complications may be underestimated. Previous studies comparing the incidence of wound complications in sutured and stapled wounds have used a restricted risk period between ten days and one year with 14 days being the most common duration. Future studies need to standardize the period for which attributable risk is considered. The loss to follow-up we experienced was also a significant concern, with over 20% of patients not completing the six-week study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that there is a discrepancy between surgeon and patient expectations for the course of normal wound healing. Although much of the literature reports complication rates greater than 10% this prospective study suggests that 42% of open orthopaedic surgeries are associated with a patient-reported wound complication. This study suggests approximately 1100 participants are required to show a 25% risk reduction between sutures and staples in terms of wound complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SSI: Surgical site infections;CDC: Centers for disease control</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors do not have any competing interests related to the performance of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All listed authors participated in the design of the above trial.
