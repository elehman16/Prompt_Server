We examined whether 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) with sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) increased exercise efficiency and voluntary achievement of interval walking training (IWT) in older women. Ten women [65 &#x000b1; 3(SD) yr] who had performed IWT for &#x0003e;12 mo and were currently performing IWT participated in this study. The study was conducted in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design. All subjects underwent two trials for 7 days each in which they performed IWT with ALA+SFC (100 and 115 mg/day, respectively) or placebo supplement intake (CNT), intermittently with a 2-wk washout period. Before and after each trial, subjects underwent a graded cycling test at 27.0&#x000b0;C atmospheric temperature and 50% relative humidity, and oxygen consumption rate, carbon dioxide production rate, and lactate concentration in plasma were measured. Furthermore, for the first 6 days of each trial, exercise intensity for IWT was measured by accelerometry. We found that, in the ALA+SFC trial, oxygen consumption rate and carbon dioxide production rate during graded cycling decreased by 12% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and 11% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) at every workload, respectively, accompanied by a 16% reduction in lactate concentration in plasma (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), although all remained unchanged in the CNT trial (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.2). All of the reductions were significantly greater in the ALA+SFC than the CNT trial (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Furthermore, the training days, impulse, and time at fast walking were 42% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.028), 102% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027), and 69% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039) higher during the ALA+SFC than the CNT intake period, respectively. Thus ALA+SFC supplementation augmented exercise efficiency and thereby improved IWT achievement in older women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>5-aminolevulinic acid</kwd><kwd>exercise efficiency</kwd><kwd>respiratory response</kwd><kwd>home-based walking training achievement</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001691</named-content>

A reduction in O<sub>2</sub> utilization efficiency in the muscles has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms underlying this decrease in aerobic capacity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Experimentally, the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function, especially complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) activity, was reported to decline with aging in human (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and animal muscles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The dysfunction of mitochondria has been suggested not only to decrease exercise efficiency (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), but also to enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species to injure the tissues (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which may evoke chronic inflammatory responses in the body and thereby cause lifestyle-related diseases (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Thus the dysfunction of mitochondrial function may be one of the key mechanisms in limiting daily physical activity and evoking lifestyle-related diseases in middle-aged and older people (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>To prevent this, aerobic exercise training above a given intensity has been recommended (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>); however, during exercise, the ATP demand increases drastically in active muscles in the face of the decline in mitochondrial functions with aging (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Consequently, there is a huge imbalance between ATP production and demand (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which may accelerate lactic acid production in muscles and thus the dissociation of hydrogen ions, evoking panting as compensatory hyperventilation for metabolic acidosis and sometimes causing pain through the muscle receptors (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). These responses may diminish the enjoyment of, and intrinsic motivation for, physical activity and may prevent middle-aged and older people from performing exercise training. Accordingly, we surmised that, if some nutritional supplements are proved to improve mitochondrial functions, they will help those who feel difficulty in performing exercise training to lower the psychological barrier.</p><p>One of the candidates for these supplements is 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA is an amino acid that can be found in many foods and is the sole initial material of heme biosynthesis in vivo (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It has been confirmed that ALA is incorporated into cytochromes <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> in the mitochondrial ETC in vitro (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Indeed, it has been reported that the oral ingestion of ALA by mice increased complex IV activity and raised the ATP production rate in the liver (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, no studies have evaluated how ALA affects the age-related reduction in exercise efficiency and the voluntary achievement of exercise training.</p><p>Based on these facts, we hypothesized that, if the oral ingestion of ALA accelerated the O<sub>2</sub> utilization efficiency in muscle mitochondria, it would increase the exercise efficiency and thereby improve the training achievement in older human subjects. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study in older women.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the Review Board on Human Experiments, Shinshu University School of Medicine, and conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. To minimize the effects of subject selection and the levels of training readiness, the subjects were recruited from the 547 participants in the &#x0201c;Jukunen Taiikudaigaku Project,&#x0201d; which is a health promotion program for middle-aged and older people in Matsumoto City, Japan. The participants had performed the interval walking training (IWT) program for more than 12 mo before this study; therefore, they were familiar with the exercise testing procedures used in the present study. Moreover, their exercise efficiency had likely reached the steady state and would thus enable us to detect only the effects of ALA intake on their exercise efficiency without accounting for the acute effects of exercise training.</p><p>After the experimental protocol was fully explained, 10 healthy older female volunteers (60-69 yr old) gave written, informed consent before participating in this study. Each subject gave a complete medical history and underwent examinations of physical characteristics, resting blood pressure (BP), and peak aerobic capacity (&#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2 peak</sub>). All subjects were nonsmokers and had no overt history of hepatic, thyroid, renal, metabolic, cardiovascular, or pulmonary disease, or orthopedic limitations in the exercise tests. Moreover, no subjects showed symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, as confirmed in the health examination before participating in the study.

Therefore, we thought that a higher dose would be needed to improve mitochondrial function, if it occurred. Regarding dose safety, there is no legal dose limit in Japan because ALA phosphate has been approved as a food ingredient by the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

Regarding the mechanisms, Ferguson et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) suggested that, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the activity of complex IV, which is one of the enzymes in the mitochondrial ETC, decreased in an older body such that the reduced transferring rate of electrons caused a backlog of electrons in the system, increased the reactive oxygen species generation rate, and decreased the ATP production rate. In fact, biochemical studies in human skeletal muscle suggested that the activity of complex IV decreased from 20 to 80 yr old by 35&#x02013;50% (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).

In the present study, we first confirmed in the whole body of older human subjects that the oral ingestion of ALA increased the gross and net efficiencies during cycling by 12% at the cadence mentioned above; however, we found no significant increase in delta efficiency, reflecting in part the phosphorylative-coupling efficiency, in the ALA+SFC trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>The result of no significant increase in delta efficiency in the ALA+SFC trial might be due to the requirement to determine the value at which &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> reached a &#x0201c;steady state&#x0201d; after an increase in workload.

This is consistent with a recent study showing that higher muscle mitochondrial efficiency was associated with a faster preferred walking speed in older adults (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, the training achievement in the ALA+SFC trial started to increase after the 3rd day of supplement intake, which suggests that at least 3 days are required to attain the effects of ALA+SFC intake in the protocol used in the present study. Although this response seems slow, Mingone et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) reported that, in an organ culture of bovine pulmonary arteries with ALA and iron ion, a significant increase in heme content was observed after 24 h of incubation. They also examined the time-dependent effects of organ culture with ALA on generating protoporphyrin IX, the heme precursor, and reported that at least a 24-h culture period was required to detect the ALA-induced effect. Therefore, in the present study, if the increased training achievement was caused by ALA+SFC-induced increases in heme content and subsequent improvements of mitochondrial function, it seems reasonable to observe these changes after the 3rd day of supplement intake.</p><p>Alternatively, the increased training achievement in the ALA+SFC trial might be related to enhanced central mechanisms. ALA administration to rats reportedly induced increased levels of tryptophan and serotonin in the forebrain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which might enhance the melatonin concentration in the pineal gland and improve the circadian rhythm in older people (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Indeed, Rodriguez et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) suggested that, in middle-aged and older subjects, the ingestion of ALA+SFC (50 and 57 mg/day, respectively) for 6 wk improved the quality of sleep, emotional state, and reaction to psychological stress evaluated by questionnaires. Therefore, in the present study, we could not exclude the possibility that the increased training achievement in the ALA+SFC trial was caused by enhanced central mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>Iron intake per day in the ALA+SFC trial (supplement + dietary intake, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) was three times higher than the RDA value (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Therefore, the possible effects of iron intake on the results were not excluded; however, because subjects showed no symptoms of iron deficiency anemia in the health examination before participating in the study and because [Hb] did not change after ALA+SFC supplementation, it was unlikely that SFC was independently incorporated into the mitochondrial function in the ALA+SFC trial. Therefore, we surmise that the simultaneous ingestion of a mixture of ALA and iron ion is necessary to attain the results, and this interpretation is consistent with several other studies assessing the effects of ALA combined with the iron ion (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>We employed no sedentary groups in the present study. Because this is the first study to examine whether ALA+SFC supplementation improved exercise efficiency and facilitated training achievement in older people, we started with subjects who were expected to have high and chronic heme demand to compensate for insufficient ATP production during daily IWT. Therefore, it remains unknown whether supplementation would increase the O<sub>2</sub> utilization efficiency in sedentary subjects.</p><p>We used a cycle ergometer to evaluate exercise efficiency, while exercise format in the field experiment was walking. We used this approach because it is more challenging to accurately measure external work done during walking. However, we believe that the improvement in efficiency during cycling observed in the present study is likely to provide some insight into the increased IWT achievement.</p><p>In conclusion, the supplementation of ALA+SFC increased exercise efficiency determined as work per the total metabolic cost of exercise and improved voluntary achievement of IWT in older women who had performed habitual training before this study. Because higher training achievement is associated with greater improvements in physical fitness and risk factors for lifestyle-related disease (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), this regimen would be useful to help older women continue habitual exercise training and thus improve their health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>GRANTS</title><p content-type="financial-disclosure">This study was supported by a grant from the <funding-source id="gs1">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</funding-source> (<award-id rid="gs1">25670117</award-id>).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>DISCLOSURES</title><p>No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Author contributions: S.M., A.M., Y.-i.K., S.I., K.T., T.T., M.N., and H.N. conception and design of research; S.M., A.M., Y.-i.K., S.I., Y.K., Y.O., E.S., and H.N. performed experiments; S.M., A.M., and S.I. analyzed data; S.M., A.M., Y.-i.K., S.I., and H.N. interpreted results of experiments; S.M. and A.M. prepared figures; S.M., A.M., and H.N. drafted manuscript; S.M., M.N., and H.N. edited and revised manuscript; S.M., A.M., Y.-i.K., S.I., Y.K., Y.O., E.S., K.T., T.T., M.N., and H.N. approved final version of manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>American College of Sports Medicine</collab>. <article-title>General principles of exercise prescription</article-title>.
