We recently demonstrated in a cross-over study that HD with acetate-free citrate dialysate (A(&#x02212;)D) could contribute to improved clinical status, including improved hemodynamic conditions during HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], metabolic acidosis, malnutrition, and ESA-hyporesponsive anemia, which were not normalized by HD with conventional dialysate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A(&#x02212;)D is characterized as total removal of acetate substituted by citrate as a buffer source (Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Past studies have reported the impact of calcium concentrations in dialysates on bone mineral metabolism and int-PTH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, Karohl C et al. reported that calcium balance correlated with i-calcium gradients between plasma and dialysate and PTH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. From these reports, bone remodeling of MHD patients could be affected by calcium mass transfer during HD sessions. Because citrate is an effective chelator of ionized (i)-calcium, HD with A(&#x02212;)D containing citrate may decrease serum i-calcium levels and affect int-PTH levels during HD sessions. Moreover, Lefebvre A et al. reported that optimal correction of metabolic acidosis by raising the dialysate base HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration affected PTH and osteocalcin levels and bone resorption surfaces in 21 MHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of varying the dialysate composition on the calcium and int-PTH metabolism in a single HD session and as part of an earlier cross-over study.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Compositions of A(&#x02212;)D and A(+)D</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center"><bold>Chemical</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>A(&#x02212;)D</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>A(+)D</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Sodium (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">140<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">140<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Potassium (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Calcium (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Magnesium (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Chloride (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">111<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">113<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Bicarbonate (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">35<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">25<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Acetate (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">Citrate (mEq/L)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Glucose (mEq/L)</td><td align="center">150</td><td align="center">100</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A(&#x02212;)D does not contain acetate as a buffering agent, and bicarbonate concentration of A(&#x02212;)D is higher than that of A(+)D.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In this study, for clarifying the effect of A(&#x02212;)D on calcium and int-PTH metabolism, we evaluated the changes of total (t)-calcium, i-calcium, and int-PTH in a single HD session and as part of previous cross-over study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Seventeen patients (for the single session study) and 29 patients (for the cross-over study), who had received MHD for more than one year and who were in stable clinical condition, participated in the present study.

We found significant increase in i-calcium, t-calcium and decrease in int-PTH after HD with A(+)D. In contrast, there was no significant difference in i-calcium and int-PTH levels after HD with A(&#x02212;)D. These differences could be affected by the post-dialysis iCa levels. Despite the calcium concentrations of A(&#x02212;)D and A(+)D being the same level (3.0 mEq/L), A(&#x02212;)D contains a small amount of citrate as a buffer source. Because citrate is an effective chelator of i-calcium, HD with A(&#x02212;)D containing citrate might decrease serum i-calcium levels. Therefore, Ca chelating effect of citrate as well as alkalizing effect of A(&#x02212;)D might decrease iCa which affects intPTH.</p><p>In the cross-over study, we conducted a stratified analysis, according to the target int-PTH levels of 60&#x02013;180 pg/mL, as recommended by the 2006 guidelines for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic dialysis patients by JSDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the patients with low int-PTH levels (&#x0003c; 60 pg/mL), we found significant increase in both int-PTH and BAP levels HD after A(&#x02212;)D period, while it did not affect PTH levels in the patients with PTH levels &#x0003e;60 pg/ml. Thus, HD with A(&#x02212;)D could contribute to the increase in PTH and BAP exclusively in the patients with low int-PTH levels.</p><sec><title>Calcium concentrations in dialysate and bone metabolism</title><p>Past studies have reported the impact of calcium concentrations in dialysates on bone mineral metabolism and int-PTH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the presence of low PTH levels, the use of a low calcium dialysate has been shown to increase circulating PTH and BAP levels in MHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, with the excessive lowering of serum calcium during HD using a low calcium dialysate, calcium concentrations may be associated with hypotension and arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, in patients with hyperparathyroidism and high bone turnover disease, the excessive use of a low calcium concentration dialysate may further worsen their conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>There were no significant differences in pre-dialysis t-calcium and i-calcium levels during the cross-over study. On the other hand, in the single session study, we found significant increases in i-calcium and t-calcium and decreases in int-PTH levels after HD with A(+)D, while there were no significant differences in i-calcium or int-PTH between pre- and post-HD levels with A(&#x02212;)D in the single session study. From these results, we presumed that citrate in the dialysate could chelate i-calcium during HD sessions with A(&#x02212;)D. Also from the results of this study, we concluded that not only the decrease in the calcium concentration of dialysate but also the chelation of i-calcium by citrate in dialysate might affect int-PTH levels in patients undergoing MHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic acidosis and bone metabolism</title><p>The bone diseases that accompany CKD are due to alterations in PTH levels and vitamin D levels. However, a substantial quantity of data has been accrued to implicate chronic metabolic acidosis as an additional important factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our cross-over study, although there was no significant difference in int-PTH or BAP during the A(&#x02212;)D and A(+)D periods in the patients with normal or high PTH levels, we found a significant increase in int-PTH and BAP levels during the A(&#x02212;)D period exclusively in the patients with low PTH levels. This result is in agreement with the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which was performed on 21 MHD patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels: 15&#x02013;16.8 mmol/L). The amelioration of metabolic acidosis by raising the dialysate base HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration was found to the rise in PTH, reduce bone resorption in the patients with low PTH levels, on the other hand, improve bone formation in the patients with high PTH levels. Furthermore, Krieger et al. reported, from an in vitro study, a direct, suppressive effect of metabolic acidosis on osteoblastic-induced collagen synthesis, which decreased by 15% after exposure to an acidic milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We did not know the exact mechanism why in crossover study PTH level as well as BAP increased exclusively in patients with low-PTH level. From these reports and our results, the optimal correction of metabolic acidosis might affect int-PTH and BAP levels in the patients with low PTH levels. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in int-PTH or BAP levels, in either the A(&#x02212;)D period or A(+)D periods, in the patients with high PTH levels. Graham K. A. et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported that, after the correction of metabolic acidosis in MHD patients with hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone secretion was suppressed by increasing the sensitivity of the parathyroid glands to ionized calcium. Furthermore, sensitivity to vitamin D treatment in renal osteodystrophy is affected by metabolic acidosis, which induces resistance to vitamin D compounds and calcimimetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>It had been reported that metabolic acidosis triggers an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone formation in parathyroidectomized rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, bone metabolism is affected by pH modulation of calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) activation. Quinn S. J et al. reported that CaR can sense changes in pH. They showed that changes in extracellular pH produced changes in intracellular calcium levels, a key intracellular signal which mediates the inhibition of PTH secretion by CaR activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. From these reports, we presumed that the optimal correction of metabolic acidosis might improve the response to vitamin D compounds and suppress the increase of int-PTH levels during the A(&#x02212;)D period in the patients with high PTH levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Inflammatory condition and bone metabolism</title><p>Acetate induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes, which may be responsible for chronic inflammation in HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The removal of acetate from the dialysates and the purification of the dialysates would lead to a possible attenuation of chronic inflammatory conditions in MHD patients. Recently, Eleftheriadis T et al. demonstrated the negative correlation between serum IL-6 levels and bone turnover osteocalcin or the beta-isomerised C-terminal cross-linked peptide of collagen type I, which suggests a relationship between bone turnover and chronic inflammation in MHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These reports indicate that the attenuation of a chronic inflammatory condition may improve low bone turnover in MHD patients. Although, this study did not compare the inflammatory conditions of A(&#x02212;)D and A(+)D, the improvement in bone turnover found in this study could be caused by the attenuation of the chronic inflammatory condition by A(&#x02212;)D.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The primary limitations of this study are the small patient population, the lack of values for pharmacological parameters such as the blood levels for citrate and acetate, and our inability to specify a single type of dialysis membrane, the glucose concentration or the pH in the dialysate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although further studies are needed, the mechanisms involved in increased int-PTH and BAP levels in patients with low int-PTH levels using A(&#x02212;)D are associated with the adsorption of i-calcium, improvements in metabolic acidosis and with nutritional status. Our data demonstrate that HD with A(&#x02212;)D could increase int-PTH and BAP levels in MHD patients, especially in the patients with low PTH levels that could be associated with low turnover bone disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TK and MF participated in the design of the study.
