However, it has been argued that results may be biased by selective participation. Therefore, we investigated factors influencing participation in a randomized exercise intervention trial for breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Non-metastatic breast cancer patients were systematically screened for a randomized exercise intervention trial on cancer-related fatigue. Participants and nonparticipants were compared concerning sociodemographic characteristics (age, marital status, living status, travel time to the training facility), clinical data (body-mass-index, tumor stage, tumor size and lymph node status, comorbidities, chemotherapy), fatigue, and physical activity. Reasons for participation or declination were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>117 patients (52 participants, 65 nonparticipants) were evaluable for analysis. Multiple regression analyses revealed significantly higher odds to decline participation among patients with longer travel time (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0012), living alone (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039), with more comorbidities (0.031), previous chemotherapy (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0066), of age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;years (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025), or being free of fatigue (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0007). No associations were found with BMI or physical activity. By far the most frequently reported reason for declination of participation was too long commuting time to the training facility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Willingness of breast cancer patients to participate in a randomized exercise intervention study differed by sociodemographic factors and health status. Neither current physical activity level nor BMI appeared to be selective for participation. Reduction of personal inconveniences and time effort, e.g. by decentralized training facilities or flexible training schedules, seem most promising for enhancing participation in exercise intervention trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01468766?term=NCT01468766&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01468766</ext-link> (October 2011).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Recruitment</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>In recent years an increasing number of studies have been published, evaluating the role of physical activity during or after cancer treatment. It has been shown that structured exercise training can reduce adverse effects in cancer patients like cancer-related fatigue (CRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], improve quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and positively impact cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most of the findings are based on clinical studies with small numbers of subjects or patients, and there is an ongoing debate whether those patients willing to be randomized to a demanding exercise program might be highly selective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Clinical trials are essential for research and randomized controlled studies are considered the gold standard to evaluate new therapies and determine efficacy or effectiveness of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, only 3-5% of all cancer patients in Great Britain and the US are included in randomized controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These low rates result from strict study protocols together with patient- and physician related factors, e.g. time constraints or influence on the relationship between physician and patient. Moreover, it has been shown that the process of recruitment itself is very selective and often threatens the generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Data from clinical cancer trials (mostly drug studies) suggest that age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], tumor stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], lymph node involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and travel distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] play an important role in the acceptance or non-acceptance in study participation. De Jong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] determined differences between participants and nonparticipants of an exercise trial for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. They concluded that nonparticipants were older, mainly males, suffered for a longer duration from their disease and had a lower level of education. To our knowledge, the determinants of participation of cancer patients in exercise intervention trials have not yet been systematically investigated in this extent. It is important to explore these determinants to improve participation rates in further trials.</p><p>Therefore aim of the present study was to investigate factors that explain participation and nonparticipation in an exercise intervention trial for breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. This study focuses on demographic, personal and clinical factors associated with participation, as well as patient motivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The present BEST-Participation-study was carried out from July 2011 to December 2011 during the patient screening for the BEST-study. The BEST-study (in German: <bold>B</bold>ewegung und <bold>E</bold>ntspannung f&#x000fc;r Brustkrebspatientinnen unter <bold>S</bold>trahlen<bold>t</bold>herapie, translation: exercise and relaxation for breast cancer patients during radiotherapy) is a prospective, randomized, controlled intervention trial for non-metastatic breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. The BEST-study compared a 12-week resistance intervention program during and after radiotherapy with relaxation training in regard to cancer-related fatigue perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The BEST-Participation-study was an observational study embedded in the BEST-study, collecting information on factors potentially influencing willingness to participate in a randomized exercise-intervention trial. The aims of the present analysis were (1) to determine clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of participants and nonparticipants, and (2) to identify reasons for participation or declination. Patients, who signed informed consent for the BEST trial automatically took part in the BEST-Participation-study and are referred to as participants throughout this manuscript. Patients, who refused participation in the BEST-study but agreed to fill out the short questionnaire for the BEST-Participation-study, are referred to as nonparticipants.</p><p>Protocols of the BEST- and of the BEST-Participation-study were approved by the Ethic Committee of the University of Heidelberg and have been performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The BEST-study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01468766).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>All participants were treated at the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg (NCT) in cooperation with the Department of Radiooncology of the University Medical Centre in Heidelberg. Inclusion criteria were: female breast cancer patients with UICC stage I-III, indication for adjuvant radiotherapy, age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years, BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, written informed consent, ability to follow instructions. Exclusion criteria were: acute infection, problems with walking or standing, severe neurological dysfunction, severe cardiovascular disease, severe pulmonary insufficiency, severe renal insufficiency, other malignancies (except carcinoma in situ of skin or cervix), abuse of alcohol or drugs, regular participation in resistance or endurance training. Breast cancer patients were recruited by a physician who was responsible for the assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both nonparticipants and participants had to fulfill these BEST-inclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study recruitment</title><p>Eligible patients were briefly informed about the exercise trial at their first consultation for radiotherapy at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Radiooncology of the NCT.

Additional information, such as sociodemographic data, fatigue, physical activity and motivational aspects for exercise, was assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Patients were asked to specify marital status (married/living with partner, separated, divorced, widowed, single, not specified), living status (alone, with others) and travel distance (up to 30&#x000a0;min, between 30&#x000a0;min and 1&#x000a0;h, more than 1&#x000a0;h) to the training center. For a baseline assessment of physical activity reflecting the last week prior to inclusion we used the short version of the Freiburg questionnaire of physical activity (FFKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], a standardized and validated instrument. FFKA focuses on everyday activity with low to medium exertion in addition to exercise activities. With 8 questions basal, recreational and sportive activities are assessed. Cancer-related fatigue, the primary endpoint of the BEST-study, was measured by the multidimensional, 20-item Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. FAQ is a standardized and validated questionnaire for self-assessment of the physical, cognitive and affective dimensions of fatigue. In addition, using a visual analogue scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not tired at all, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;totally exhausted), patients were asked to rate the intensity of current fatigue. Besides the continuous fatigue scores (total physical, cognitive and affective fatigue) we also investigated a dichotomous variable using as cutpoint the mean fatigue score of women age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years from the general German population (FAQ point value for women aged 14&#x02013;39 years: 11,2; aged 40&#x02013;59 years: 12,1; aged &#x02265; 60&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].To assess the motivation of patients to participate in the BEST-study they could choose among 7 answers, in addition to provide their own free text. Nonparticipants had the choice between 15 answers and free text to explain why they decided against study participation. Multiple answers were allowed.</p><p>If the questionnaires were not returned, patients were reminded at least three times by phone. All questionnaires and clinical information had to be completed prior to the first radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Characteristics of participants and nonparticipants were compared using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test (metric data), Mann&#x02013;Whitney-<italic>U</italic>-test (ordinal data), or Chi<sup>2</sup>-test (categorical data). To assess the associations between the characteristics and nonparticipation, we performed multiple logistic regression analyses assessing following covariates simultaneously in the model: age group, number of comorbidities, marital status, living status, travel distance, BMI, previous chemotherapy, and fatigue. Due to high collinearity tumor characteristics were investigated in separate models without chemotherapy. The different physical activity variables were also included in the models, but none showed a significant association with nonparticipation. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed using smaller sets of covariates to check for overfitting or spurious effects by related variables, but there were no substantial changes in the results. Reasons for participation or declination were analyzed descriptively. P-values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 19.0 or SAS 9.2 [SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From July to December 2011 a total of 398 patients with non-metastatic breast cancer were irradiated at the study clinic. In this period 52 participants and 69 nonparticipants were recruited (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Due to missing data from 4 nonparticipants the sample was restricted to 65 evaluable nonparticipants. The remaining 277 patients were either not eligible, received no information from the recruiting physicians or were not interested in any study participation. Thus, information for this BEST-Participation-study was available for 30.4% of all breast cancer patients with adjuvant radiotherapy during the study period.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Characteristics of participants and non-participants</title><p>Sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age did not differ statistically significantly between participants and nonparticipants (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64). However, participants were more likely to be middle aged (age 40&#x02013;70 years) whereas nonparticipants were more likely to be younger or older (&#x0003c;40&#x000a0;years, &#x02265; 70&#x000a0;years) (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Significant differences were also noted for living status (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009) and travel distance (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Here, the nonparticipants more commonly reported living alone and had to spend more time to travel from their home to the treatment center. There were no significant differences with respect to marital status (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.18).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

No associations were observed with BMI and extent of current physical activity.</p><p>Patient&#x02019;s well-being often is negatively influenced by cancer itself as well as by common cancer therapies. Intervention studies have revealed the importance of physical activity as an effective method in supportive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In literature, generalizability of results from clinical trials to the overall patient population has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Discrepancies between willingness in general expressed by healthy persons to participate in a clinical cancer trial versus actual participation rates in patient populations have been addressed in the study from Comis et al. 2003: In a survey healthy Americans were asked about their willingness to participate in a clinical cancer trial if they were faced with cancer diagnosis. 31% indicated to be &#x0201c;very willing&#x0201d;, 51% &#x0201c;somewhat willing&#x0201d;, 9% &#x0201c;not very willing&#x0201d; and 6% &#x0201c;not willing at all&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is in clear contrast to the finding that only 3 to 5% of all cancer patients in Great Britain and the US participate in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Reasons may be that no appropriate study was open, patients were not informed about ongoing studies or were ineligible, or patients were not willing to participate. In the BEST-study 13.1% of the target population could be enrolled during the recruitment period (from July to December 2011). In consequence it is assumed that participation in intervention studies is highly selective.</p><p>In the present study, travel distance was a major factor reducing study participation: Participation in the intervention trial required the acceptance to travel twice a week to the treatment center and to spend extra time for the training. The present study shows that patients who needed significantly less time to reach the training centre were more likely to agree. Furthermore, 70.8% of the nonparticipants named &#x0201c;journey too far/difficulties to reach training centre&#x0201d; as an important reason for refusing to participate. Long travel distances and limited transportation capabilities are held responsible for less utilization of cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In line, studies from gynecological cancer types reported that travel distance and study participation are reciprocally related to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Participants of the BEST-study represented the age group between 40 to 69&#x000a0;years very well. However, patients aged younger than 40&#x000a0;years or older than 69&#x000a0;years only accounted for 7.7% of the trial participants whereas 32.2% of the nonparticipants were classified in these groups. Higher age was even significantly associated with nonparticipation when adjusting for other factors such as comorbidities. Our results strengthen previous studies observing that especially older patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, although they comprise about one third of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A detailed explanation for the selected representation of younger patients cannot be determined due to the small size of this age group.</p><p>In the BEST-Participation-study among nonparticipants a larger proportion reported living alone. Participants tended to be more often married, while widowed or single women were more frequent among nonparticipants, but differences were not statistically significant. Our data suggest that social and perhaps logistical support is an important component when considering participation in a rather time-consuming clinical exercise trial. These data are in line with Elting et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] who compared social factors of participants and nonparticipants with different cancer types. However, two other studies could not find such associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Comparable to Elting et al. who observed higher percentages of comorbidities in nonparticipants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the present study revealed a statistical association between more comorbidities and nonparticipation when adjusting for other characteristics. Participants had smaller tumor sizes, lower tumor stages and less frequently positive lymph nodes than nonparticipants. Potentially, physical activity intervention trials are selective for patients with less advanced and rather local disease.</p><p>Importantly, nonparticipants and participants did not differ in their physical activity level and both groups showed a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. Thus, the present study suggests that exercise intervention studies are not selectively addressing more active patients. Likewise the BEST-Participation-study found no influence of BMI on participation in an exercise trial. As the BEST-study focuses on interventions against fatigue, it is not surprising that patients who did not feel fatigued at all were more likely to refuse study participation.</p><p>In the literature two main theories are discussed to explain motivation of participants to participate in clinical trials: Altruistic motives as well as self-interested arguments. Jenkins and Fallowfield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found that a major argument for participation in clinical trials is the desire to help future patients who are confronted with cancer diagnosis. In contrast to these results Truong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] showed that altruism is not the primary reason for accepting participation. Catt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] also discussed personal benefits to be responsible for acceptance or non-acceptance of trial inclusion. In the Best-Participation-study we observed both of these motivations. &#x0201c;I hope to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I want to contribute to scientific progress, that future patients benefit thereof&#x0201d; were the two most frequent statements. Thus, the feeling to influence cancer prognosis and to positively impact the own health status seems both to be important to patients.</p><p>Declination of study participation in the BEST-study was largely attributable to the distance to get to the training centre or to difficulties related to commuting. Previous studies also showed that distance and limited transportation possibilities can be barriers for study participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a review Ross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] concluded that long travel distances associated with higher costs led to a declination of study participation and higher dropout rates. &#x0201c;Date difficulties&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Twice a week training is too much&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Additional time for questionnaires and measurements is too much&#x0201d; can be summarized as additional logistical constraints that may be important in line with findings from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Our study had several strengths: By including only patients who were classified to be eligible through the BEST-study protocol and were offered participation from physicians we were able to investigate patient-related factors in relation to participation and nonparticipation. In contrast, most of the previous studies investigating these differences used retrospective designs where recruitment procedures and criteria were not fully comparable between participants and nonparticipants. Furthermore we collected additional information like fatigue status or physical activity level which are important variables in the emerging field of exercise interventions among cancer patients. A limitation of our BEST-Participation-study is, that as most of the clinical studies, we also cannot report on the exact percentage of contacted patients with respect to the entire target population. Due to organizational difficulties in the recruitment process, such as short-term alterations of the medical staff or time constraints of the physicians, not all patients were informed about the BEST-study, and among patients not willing to participate in BEST, not all were asked to complete the questionnaires of the BEST-Participation-study. Beyond that a certain proportion of the target population decided against any study participation, so that only 30.4% of all patients with breast cancer stage I-III responded to the BEST-Participation-study, either with participation or non-participation in the BEST-study. Further research is necessary to verify these aspects in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study suggest that breast cancer patients are less willing or able to participate in a randomized resistance exercise trial if they live alone, have a long travel distance, a worse cancer prognosis, had a recent chemotherapy, are affected by fatigue, are above age 70 or have more comorbidities. However, there seemed to be no selection by current physical activity level or BMI. By far the most frequently reported reason for declination of participation was too long commuting time to the training facility. Our results might help to improve participation by adapting recruitment procedures in future exercise intervention studies appropriately.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Karin Potthoff and Karen Steindorf contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SG performed the data collection and study coordination and drafted the manuscript.
