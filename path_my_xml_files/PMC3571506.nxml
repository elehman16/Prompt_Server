Despite its commercial use for pharmaceutical purposes, there is a lack of data to support claims of an antigingivitis and antiplaque effect of <italic>L. sidoides.</italic> To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to evaluate the effect of a gel containing <italic>L. sidoides</italic> essential oil in the treatment of gingivitis. The results showed that both test formulations were efficient for plaque reduction (52% in the CLX group and 50% in the LS group). This percent difference was not significant at the end of the trial.

In spite of insufficient data in the literature about the anti-inflammatory action of <italic>L. sidoides</italic> preparations, this property has been reported previously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dent7_p0028">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-dent7_p0028">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dent7_p0028">22</xref></p><p>This anti-inflammatory action could be due an indirect action on plaque reduction or to a direct effect on the cyclooxygenase cycle (COX-2).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dent7_p0028">22</xref> Similarly to those found in other herbal products, the flavonoids contained in <italic>L. sidoides</italic> essential oil inhibit phosphodiesterases, which are involved in cell activation, and their effect depends on the bio-synthesis of protein cytokines that mediate adhesion of circulating white blood cells to sites of injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dent7_p0028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-dent7_p0028">32</xref> Despite these potential explanations, the exact mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of <italic>L. sidoides</italic> is still unknown, and further studies are required.</p><p>The BI is a generally used dichotomous index for evaluation of gingivitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dent7_p0028">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dent7_p0028">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dent7_p0028">14</xref>, but it does not assess the severity of gingival inflammation. Studies evaluating the reduction of gingivitis by a grading index could be interesting to complement these results, as used in other works evaluating herbal agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dent7_p0028">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dent7_p0028">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dent7_p0028">33</xref> However, color change, used as a parameter in this grading index, is not necessarily an accurate indicator of gingivitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dent7_p0028">33</xref> Furthermore, laboratory tests such as enzyme immunoassays of gingival crevicular fluid would be required for a better understanding of the role of <italic>L. sidoides</italic> preparations as effective agents for gingivitis control.</p><p>Home-use studies are often influenced by a number of factors which can mask the superiority of a test agent over controls. Participants of clinical trials may experience some improvement not specifically associated to the therapeutic properties of the test agent, but rather related to a behavioral change; this is known as the Hawthorne effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dent7_p0028">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dent7_p0028">34</xref> Subjects enrolled in oral hygiene studies usually improve their tooth brushing irrespective of the product they receive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dent7_p0028">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dent7_p0028">34</xref></p><p>Although the volunteers in the present study were not aware of which gel they were using, another main factor is the so-called novelty effect, which is the motivation to improve oral hygiene practices induced by the use of a new substance. In contrast, lack of compliance with correct use of the gel can occur as well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dent7_p0028">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dent7_p0028">34</xref> In order to minimize this potential, participants were asked to bring the bottle at the end of the trial, so we could perform an indirect assessment of compliance. The reduction in gingivitis observed in both test groups showed that participants used the product correctly, at least to some extent.</p><p>Finally, the results showed that LS was an effective herbal antigingivitis agent, with performance similar to that of chlorhexidine digluconate, and could be advantageous in cases where patients spend little time on toothbrushing. Further clinical studies are required to evaluate the action of this herbal agent in other oral diseases, such as chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A gel formulation containing 10% <italic>L. sidoides</italic> essential oil was an efficient antiplaque and antigingivitis agent.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-dent7_p0028"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hugoson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sj&#x000f6;din</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Norderyd</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trends over 30 years, 1973&#x02013;2003, in the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2008</year><volume>35</volume><fpage>405</fpage><lpage>414</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18433384</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-dent7_p0028"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Franco Neto</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Parolo</surname><given-names>CCF</given-names></name><name><surname>R&#x000f6;sing</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Maltz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative analysis of the effect of two chlorhexidine mouth-rinses on plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding</article-title><source>Braz Oral Res</source><year>2008</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>139</fpage><lpage>144</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18622483</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-dent7_p0028"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Axelsson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindhe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Nystr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>On the prevention and caries and periodontal disease.
