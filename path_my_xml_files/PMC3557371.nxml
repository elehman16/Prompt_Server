Evidence highlights effective lifestyle interventions for healthy bone aging that includes resistance training (RT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and a combination of muscle strengthening and walking programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A meta-analysis by Martyn-St. James and Carroll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] showed an increase in proximal femur areal bone mineral density (aBMD) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in older adults from prescribed walking programs alone. Of note, previous physical activity studies have reported a modest but important 1&#x000a0;% increase at the proximal femur using DXA following RT interventions in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the evidence supporting physical activity as osteogenic and national guidelines that recommend RT two to three times/week to optimize bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], to our knowledge, the effect of different frequencies of weekly RT on volumetric bone density has not been evaluated in older women.</p><p>Resistance training programs are defined by an increased load or force on the target muscle groups. There are a number of modes that are used for RT, including free weights, air pressure systems, and cantilever systems. During the training program, the load is generally progressively increased, as muscle strength is gained. Bone cells (osteocytes) can respond to loads or strain, and over time, bone is thought to adapt its size and shape based upon the forces acting on it, and the greatest force of influence is conferred by the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and pediatric research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] highlight that exercise may potentially exert an influence on bone geometry by increasing periosteal apposition through osteoblast formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The effect of RT on bone mass in postmenopausal women has most often been evaluated using DXA, where aBMD at the proximal femur was maintained or increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Advanced imaging such as peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) permits a more comprehensive assessment of the bone, including (1) the ability to separate cortical from trabecular bone compartments, (2) an estimate of volumetric bone mineral density, and (3) a measure of bone strength or resistance to fracture. Most previous studies have examined the effect of twice or three times a week resistance training on bone density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] based on the American College of Sports Medicine recommended guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Liu-Ambrose and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] highlighted an increase in cortical volumetric bone mineral density (CovBMD) at the radius after 6&#x000a0;months of twice per week resistance training in women 75&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years of age. While other three times per week RT studies in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] noted significant differences at the distal and midtibia after 12&#x000a0;months, these adaptations were maintained after 1&#x000a0;year following the end of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Very few studies have compared the effect of different frequencies of RT on bone mass, and to our knowledge, none of them have investigated the effect of RT frequency on CovBMD, total area (ToA), or bone strength. Although current studies provide a general agreement that exercise has bone health benefits, there remains a great opportunity to refine RT for older adults.</p><p>Therefore, the primary objective of this analysis was to determine the effect of three different RT frequencies (0, 1, and 2 times per week) on tibial CovBMD in healthy, community-dwelling postmenopausal women aged 65&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years of age. Our secondary objective was to investigate the effect of RT frequency on ToA and tibial bone strength in older women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Brain Power Study was a 1-year parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) for community-dwelling women aged 65&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years, and the primary outcome was executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Clinical Registration Number: NCT00426881). The present study was an evaluation of the bone health outcomes. We included community-dwelling women aged 65&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years of age and excluded women who (1) had a history of neurodegenerative disease and/or stroke, (2) were taking psychotropic drugs or antidepressants within the previous 6&#x000a0;months, (3) were taking cholinesterase inhibitors within the previous 12&#x000a0;months, (4) were on estrogen replacement therapy within the previous 12&#x000a0;months, (5) did not speak or understand English, and/or (6) were unable to attend assessments and the intervention at our research center. The local university and hospital ethics review boards approved this study, and all eligible participants gave an informed, written consent prior to participation in the study.</p><p>We recruited participants through newspaper advertisements, television and radio features, and the provincial physiotherapy professional association. Three hundred and forty-six women were screened and eligible to attend information sessions, after which 155 women were enrolled and assessed. Of the 155 women who were assessed and randomized, 147 women completed the assessment for the bone measures using pQCT at some point during the study (consort flow diagram Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart that includes data from the larger trial and the subgroup analysis of bone health outcomes. <italic>BT</italic>, balance and tone; <italic>RT1</italic>, resistance training once per week; <italic>RT2</italic>, resistance training twice per week</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="198_2012_2000_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Randomization: brain power study</title><p>After consenting to participate and after baseline assessment was completed, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three groups; we used complete randomization sequencing and a computerized generated system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>). The three groups were (1) twice a week balance and tone group (no external resistance other than body weight, BT), (2) once a week resistance training program (RT1), and (3) twice a week resistance training program (RT2). Treatment allocation was concealed, and the measurement team and bone data analyst were blinded to group allocation.</p><p>The exercise intervention ran for 1&#x000a0;year (April 2007&#x02013;April 2008) and was based on the principles of periodization with four terms, each lasting approximately 3&#x000a0;months in duration. Although the intervention was group based, exercises were individualized and the program was progressive so that the exercises in the fourth term built upon the foundation of the previous three terms. All exercise classes were delivered in groups of approximately eight to ten participants, with two certified fitness instructors and one class assistant per class leading each class. All the three groups (BT, RT1, RT2) had similar warm-up and cool-down sessions. The participants in RT1 and RT2 completed eight strengthening exercises for the upper and lower extremities using the Keiser air pressure resistance equipment (Keiser Sports Health Equipment, Fresno, CA) at each session. The participants in RT1 and RT2 completed a one repetition maximum (1RM) at the beginning of each of the four terms, and resistance training was targeted at 8RM; that is, at each session, participants were asked to complete two sets of each exercise at a weight heavy enough that they were able to complete eight repetitions. Every 2&#x000a0;weeks, the exercise instructors increased participants' weights for each exercise if it was appropriate to do so. The BT group completed balance and tone exercises only using the body weight as the resistance. Participants were requested to maintain their usual physical activity routine outside of the classes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p>This was an RCT investigating the effect of resistance training on executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The size of the trial (52 participants/group) was based on the Stroop test, a measure of selective attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the trial was designed to have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect differences between groups. During the trial design phase, we also determined if we had adequate power to detect differences between groups for CovBMD; a change prediction of 1&#x000a0;% of tibial cortical density over 1&#x000a0;year for the RT2 group and &#x02212;1&#x000a0;% for the BT group. Assuming a 20&#x000a0;% attrition rate and using an alpha level&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 (two-sided), we determined that 30 participants per group would provide &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference between groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Adverse events</title><p>We monitored for any adverse events (e.g., pain, discomfort) at each session; participants were requested to report any events to the instructors who regularly communicated with the research staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Bone outcomes</title><p>We determined CovBMD (in milligrams per cubic meter), ToA (in square millimeter), and tibial bone strength (<italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>, in millimeter to the fourth power) using a Norland/Stratec XCT 2000 pQCT (Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) to acquire one 2.3-mm scan at the 50&#x000a0;% site of the left tibia (measured proximally by the length from the lateral malleolus to the knee joint line); the in-plane voxel size was set at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;. Participants were seated comfortably with the left leg supported in position within the scanner. We obtained a scout view and positioned the anatomical reference line at the distal medial edge of the tibia. We reviewed each scan immediately after acquisition and, if movement artifacts were observed, we acquired a second scan. We used customized ImageJ software (NIH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) to analyze all scans. Our main outcome was CovBMD (in milligrams per cubic millimeterer) at the middle (50&#x000a0;%) site of the tibia. Our secondary outcomes were ToA (in square millimter) and tibial bone strength (<italic>I</italic><sub>max,</sub> in millimmeter to the fourth power). The coefficient of variation (in percent) for the pQCT scanner in our lab for tibial total density and strength strain index was 0.46 and 1.12&#x000a0;%, respectively. All pQCT scans were analyzed by the same trained technician blinded to group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Physical activity</title><p>We collected information of the participants' self-reported physical activity in order to determine how much activity occurred outside of the exercise classes. We asked the participants to complete the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), a valid and reliable tool to capture physical activity in the previous 7&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The PASE consists of ten questions that ask participants to report their physical activity patterns as sedentary, light, moderate, strenuous, strength training, household tasks, and volunteer work.

However, in healthy community-dwelling older women, we note no statistically significant difference between the control group (BT) and the two intervention groups (RT1 and RT2) for tibial CovBMD at 12&#x000a0;months. Although, we did observe a statistically significant difference between BT and RT2 at 6&#x000a0;months, it was less than what has been previously reported as yearly change in CovBMD (&#x02212;0.5&#x000a0;%) in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; further interpretation of this result must be cautious in view of multiple statistical testing. We also note no statistically significant differences in ToA or tibial bone strength across the three groups at 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences in CovBMD among exercise groups at 12&#x000a0;months (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and this is consistent with previous DXA-based studies that have examined the effect of RT on proximal femur aBMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and pQCT studies for this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As this is the first study to compare the dose of RT with tibial CovBMD, to our knowledge, it is challenging to compare with previous literature and therefore must rely on previous studies that used different imaging and different study designs. For example, previous literature also highlighted no difference in proximal femur aBMD in premenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], or older men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] who underwent RT. In addition, although Bemben and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found some positive improvement in hip aBMD, they also observed no significant interactions between groups when they compared different RT frequency (2&#x000d7; vs. 3&#x000d7;/week) and intensity (40 vs. 80&#x000a0;% 1RM).

First, our participants were very active prior to joining the study and outside of the intervention exercise classes over the course of the 12-month intervention. We previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], using accelerometry in a subset of participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;77) from this study, no statistically significant between group differences for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) outside of the exercise classes and no seasonal differences at four measurement points over the year. Further, for the combined groups, mean MVPA ranged from 24 to 27&#x000a0;min/day depending on the season. It may be that this group of highly motivated participants were already at their &#x0201c;optimum&#x0201d; bone health and had little room for improvement. Although there were increases in the muscle performance measures (one repetition max) in the RT groups over the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], there were no statistically significant differences in functional capacity (6MWT) at 6 or 12&#x000a0;months, and this may explain some of the observed statistically nonsignificant differences in bone outcomes.</p><p>Frost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] theorized that older adults might not have the same ability to initiate the bone modeling cycle responsible for changes in cortical bone geometry such as increased total bone area due to periosteal apposition. The Utah paradigm and the strain threshold theory suggest that older adults may not generate enough force or novel strains needed to stimulate bone formation. Thus, the role of physical activity in later life may be to sustain bone strength (by various means) in the aging skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It may also be that bone density is not a sensitive enough measure to assess the effect of RT or physical activity in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Further, current imaging techniques may not detect small changes in density at the midtibia whereas the distal tibia may be more responsive given its greater amounts of metabolically active trabecular bone.</p><p>Exercise acts to stimulate osteoblasts to enhance bone formation, and the first phase includes osteoclastic activity, which removes older bone, followed by the creation of a new hypomineralized tissue. An active remodeling cycle and new bone formation would, in theory, persist throughout an exercise intervention, and this may explain the statistically significant mean difference in CovBMD at 6&#x000a0;months in the RT2 group; although we recognize that the plausible explanation for this finding is due to measurement error. However, in a 2011 Cochrane meta-analysis of exercise and bone health in postmenopausal women, overall, there were positive effects for bone; however, for the combined exercise intervention studies (participants engaged in RT and weight-bearing activities), the authors noted a statistically significant effect favoring the control groups in percent change of aBMD at the hip (&#x02212;1.07&#x000a0;%, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) &#x02212;1.58 to &#x02212;0.56) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].These data highlight the importance of future research to unravel bone response to exercise and physical activity for bone compartments of the aging skeleton.</p><p>Our study also raises the question of whether (similar to muscle) there is there an optimum frequency or threshold of resistance exercise that promotes bone strength&#x02014;after which no further benefit is achieved. In a previous study, once a certain level of muscle strength was reached, once weekly training was sufficient to maintain the benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Alternatively, a combination of the RT and exercise outside of the intervention may have sustained cortical density over 12&#x000a0;months in this group of very fit women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The current study cannot provide answers to these questions, and further investigation is required.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>We note that our participants were very active and therefore may not be representative of the general older population and limit the generalizability of the results to a subset of active older women. Second, we acknowledge that pQCT measures bone outcomes at peripheral sites and cannot characterize bone compartments at the clinically relevant proximal femur. Nonetheless, our study includes the novelty of delivering different weekly RT regimens, the length of the exercise intervention, and using pQCT to more aptly assess the cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Physically active older adult women have the capacity to maintain cortical density, total area, and tibial bone strength over 1&#x000a0;year. The optimal regimen to promote this benefit is not yet clear, and our findings generate hypotheses for future studies that should aim to (1) further investigate the effect of RT frequency on bone geometry and strength, (2) evaluate the effect of RT frequency on less active women, and/or (3) evaluate the effect of combined exercise (walking and RT) on bone strength.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the significant contribution of our study participants.
