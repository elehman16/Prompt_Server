The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02438436). Data were collected, analyzed, and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients older than 18 years who underwent open hepatectomy at 1 of the 2 Hepatobiliary Surgery Departments of the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (Nanning, China) were eligible to participate in the study. Diagnosis of HCC was based on 2 types of clinical imaging, together with a serum level of &#x003b1;-fetoprotein higher than 400&#x0200a;ng/mL; diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of surgical samples. Patients were excluded if they had a history of exploratory laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal radiation, or substance abuse; if they had psychological or social conditions that might interfere with their participation in the study; if they were allergic to mint; or if they required intensive care more than 24&#x0200a;hours postoperatively or a nasogastric tube beyond the first postoperative morning.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The study information was explained to all enrolled patients. After written informed consent was obtained, patients were assigned randomly to groups that would receive SMD combined with acupuncture or chewing gum or no intervention. Randomization was performed the day before hepatectomy using TenAlea software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nl.tenalea.net/">http://nl.tenalea.net</ext-link>). The fundamentally different characteristics of SMD or chewing gum meant that no blinding was used after randomization. Patients were informed that the ability of SMD, acupuncture, or chewing gum to promote recovery of gastrointestinal function after hepatectomy was not known, and that none of these measures was expected to cause obvious side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The same surgical team performed all hepatectomies using general anesthesia, the same evidence-based protocol of perioperative management and standardized postoperative care plans.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> An abdominal cavity drainage tube was placed in each patient. The nasogastric drainage tube was removed on the first postoperative morning. Enteral or nasogastric feeding was not provided until after passage of first flatus. All patients were mobilized as soon as possible in the postoperative period. Additional opioid or nonsteroidal analgesia was prescribed for pain when required and their use carefully documented. Then nursing ward staff administered the following interventions to the randomized groups, recording their actions in patient records.</p><p>One group of patients received oral SMD decoction (Hansen Co., Ltd, Yiyang, Hunan Province, China, 10&#x0200a;mL/dose) 3 times per day beginning on the first day after hepatectomy. They also received bilateral injections of vitamin B1 (50&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;2) at the tsusanli acupoint 1 time per day after the skin was swabbed with 75% alcohol. This intervention was performed for a total of 6 consecutive days or until flatus.</p><p>Another group of patients was instructed to chew commercially available sugarless chewing gum (Extra &#x00026; Reg, Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) 3 times daily starting on postoperative day 1. They were instructed to chew the piece of gum for 30&#x0200a;minutes. This intervention was performed for a total of 6 consecutive days or until flatus.</p><p>A third group did not receive any postoperative intervention, including SMD, acupuncture, chewing gum, or adjuvant drugs that might influence recovery of bowel function.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary endpoints were time to first flatus and time to defecation, which were recorded daily by nursing staff. Secondary endpoints were length of hospital stay and postoperative complications such as fever, pneumonia, wound infection, and bleeding. Length of hospital stay was defined as the number of days from hepatectomy to discharge. Criteria for hospital discharge included stability of vital signs with no fever, achievement of flatus or defecation, ability to tolerate solid food without vomiting, control of postoperative pain, absence of other postoperative complications, and ability to function at home independently or with the home care provided. Postoperative complications were classified and graded according to the Clavien&#x02013;Dindo scheme.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size Calculation</title><p>Sample size calculation was based on our previous retrospective study<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> performed in patients with HCC after hepatectomy. Mean time to first flatus was assumed to be 73 and 51&#x0200a;hours between SMD combined with acupuncture and no-intervention group. The minimum detectable difference was 22. Assuming that the common standard deviation is 24&#x0200a;hours, the sample size was calculated to be a total of 171 participants applying statistical power of 90% at a 2-sided significance level of 5%. We recruited an additional 10 subjects to offset potential attrition.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>SPSS 19.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all statistical analyses, with the threshold of significance defined as a two-tailed <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05. Data for continuous variables were expressed as median (range), while data for categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage). Intergroup differences in continuous variables were assessed for significance using Student <italic>t</italic> test (if data were normally distributed) or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (if data were skewed). Intergroup differences in categorical data were assessed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact tests (2-tailed), as appropriate.

This increases healthcare costs and resource utilization.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Various strategies have been developed to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus, including fast-track care, minimally invasive surgery, and epidural anesthesia, but none of these methods is entirely satisfactory.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Our results suggest that the combination of SMD and acupuncture may reduce incidence of postoperative ileus and shorten hospital stay in HCC patients after hepatectomy. Chewing gum may also reduce incidence of ileus but does not appear to significantly affect hospital stay.</p><p>Our findings in this randomized controlled trial are consistent with our previous small retrospective study, in which SMD with acupuncture reduced incidence of postoperative ileus in HCC patients after hepatectomy.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Our observation that chewing gum reduced the incidence of postoperative ileus is supported by findings in other randomized trials<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and meta-analyses,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> as well as a small prospective case&#x02013;control study from South Korea in which HCC patients who chewed gum after hepatectomy recovered bowel function faster than those who did not.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Thus the available evidence suggests that SMD combined with acupuncture may be the most promising strategy for reducing the incidence of postoperative ileus and shortening the length of hospital stay for HCC patients after hepatectomy. Incidence of grade I and II postoperative complications was significantly lower in the group receiving SMD with acupuncture than in the no-intervention group. We did not observe any adverse events related to SMD, acupuncture, or chewing gum in the present study, similar to the lack of adverse events in previous trials.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Postoperative ileus may have multiple causes, though surgically induced intestinal inflammation appears to be the most frequent one.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Inflammatory infiltration into the intestinal muscularis can lead to hypomotility along the entire gastrointestinal tract.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Consistent with this, early inhibition of inflammation reduces the incidence of postoperative ileus,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> usually by vagus nerve-mediated activation of the autonomic nervous system.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This may help explain why we observed that gum chewing promoted recovery of gastrointestinal function: chewing gum not only activates the cephalic-vagal reflex as a form of sham feeding,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> but it also reduces systemic inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Whether SMD, long used in traditional Chinese medicine to boost gastrointestinal hypomotility, works by a similar mechanism is unclear. Evidence from animal models suggests that SMD can reduce serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and white blood cells.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> That it may also directly promote gastrointestinal motility is suggested by the observation that it promotes contraction of antral circular strips by activating muscarinic M3 receptors.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Acupuncture may help regulate the gastrointestinal tract via the autonomic nervous system,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and acupuncture at the tsusanli acupoint, located on the stomach meridian, is thought to regulate the intestines. Administering vitamin B1 at acupoints is thought to intensify and prolong acupoint stimulation synergistically. This may help explain why we found that SMD with tsusanli acupoint injection with vitamin B1 promoted gastrointestinal hypomotility to a greater extent than chewing gum. The ability of tsusanli acupoint injection to reduce incidence of postoperative ileus has been demonstrated in numerous studies.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We extend these findings to the combination of SMD with tsusanli acupoint injection.</p><p>In our population, SMD with acupuncture reduced hospital stay duration by 2.5 d, which was significant, while chewing gum reduced it by 1.8 d, which was not significant. It is possible that the effects of chewing gum would become significant with a larger sample. These results have several possible explanations. One is that either chewing gum or the combination of SMD with acupuncture stimulates gastrointestinal motility, leading to shorter time to first peristalsis, flatus, and defecation. Such patients will more quickly achieve euphagia without vomiting and start to ambulate. Another possible explanation is that the lower incidence of grade I and II postoperative complications in the 2 intervention groups translated to shorter hospital stay.</p><p>The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution given several limitations. One is that length of stay within each group was calculated over patients undergoing minor and major hepatectomies, which may have confounded the analysis. Nevertheless the frequencies of hepatectomy type were similar among the groups. A second limitation is lack of blinding, which was not feasible because of the nature of the interventions. A third limitation is that patients within each group differed in whether they received opioid analgesia, which may have confounded our analysis. Nevertheless, the frequencies of these treatments were similar among the groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that acupuncture, SMD, and chewing gum can be safely administered in a postoperative setting to HCC patients after hepatectomy.
