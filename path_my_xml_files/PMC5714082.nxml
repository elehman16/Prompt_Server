Participants aged 13 years or older nested within a cluster-randomized trial in 2 South African provinces were evaluated. Outcomes were treatment initiation within 5 days of DR-TB diagnosis (National Tuberculosis Program guidelines) and days from diagnosis to treatment. A total of 521 participants met inclusion criteria. Eighty-two patients (16%) met national guidelines; median time to treatment was 11 days (range = 0-180). No patient (age, sex, prior TB history, HIV status) or health system characteristics (geographic urban/rural location, province) were associated with treatment initiation per guidelines except geographic location (<italic>t</italic> = 3.64, degrees of freedom = 1, <italic>P</italic> = .0003). One in 6 individuals with DR-TB received treatment per guidelines, and average time to treatment was 11 days. Strategies are needed to decrease treatment delays and meet the recommended guidelines for treatment for patients of all ages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>drug-resistance</kwd><kwd>adolescent medicine</kwd><kwd>infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2333794X17744140"><funding-source id="funding1-2333794X17744140"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2333794X17744140">R01AI104488-01A1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X17744140"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is the leading cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide.

Data were collected as part of an ongoing, 5-year cluster-randomized trial investigating the effects of nurse-led case management to improve treatment outcomes in individuals 13 years of age and older with DR-TB residing in 2 South African provinces.

The NCM intervention consists of a nurse coordinating DR-TB treatment with weekly phone calls and/or visits during the intensive first 6 months of treatment to monitor patient progress, and conduct monthly visits during the continuation phase. Patients at control sites receive physician-led standard of care with no optimized nursing support. The parent study protocol is described elsewhere (NCT02129244).

A natural log transformation was employed to normalize the data for this continuous outcome. The variable log (days to treatment + 1) was derived for each patient by adding +1 to the days to treatment initial value and calculating the natural log of that value. Adding the constant 1 was necessary because days to treatment value was 0 for some patients (initiation same day as diagnosis, N = 2). This &#x0201c;log of days to treatment&#x0201d; variable was used in all subsequent analysis.</p><p>The analytic approach applied for days to treatment initiation was the same as the &#x0201c;in 5 or less days&#x0201d; outcome, except that the analytic tools designed for continuous measures were applied. For the preliminary analysis, days to treatment in the 4 age groups were compared using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test due to skewness, and the means of the log of days to treatment were compared using a GLM to conduct the 1-way ANOVA.</p><p>For the primary analysis, linear regression models were conducted on the log of days to treatment to evaluate the influence of age and each covariate.

Thus, the sample inherently lacked patients lost to follow-up between providing a sputum and receiving a result. This was a subanalysis of a parent study not specifically designed to evaluate factors affecting treatment timing; however, the NCM intervention did not affect timing because the intervention only began after patients initiated treatment. This study lacked the opportunity to examine additional factors that may have better predicted DR-TB treatment timing, such as attitudes and health beliefs toward treatment initiation or barriers to treatment initiation. Additional characteristics regarding the delivery system differences in each site, such as access to providers and resources, may be informative.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section23-2333794X17744140"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis found that timing of treatment initiation for individuals with DR-TB, with and without HIV coinfection, in 2 South African provinces did not differ by age yet individuals at rural sites received treatment earlier than at urban sites. Only 16% of individuals met South African guidelines. Early treatment initiation is critical for disease prevention and transmission, and decreasing additional resistance. Future research should aim to include more teens and incorporate data regarding patient and provider attitudes and beliefs toward treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all the participants, sites, and Johns Hopkins students and study staff.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> BJvdW: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to analysis and interpretation; drafted manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>JPB: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>SS: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>JH: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>CKC: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>JEF: Contributed to conception and design; contributed to interpretation; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The parent study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (R01 AI104488-01A1; Farley, PI).
