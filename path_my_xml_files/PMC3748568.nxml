The common treatment for this problem is medical therapy such as mefenamic acid [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)] and oral contraceptive pills, both of which work by reducing myometrial activity.

Generally, in Iran, 74.5% of the teenage girls suffer from dysmenorrhea. Limitation in social activities has been estimated to be in 50% in this period, and poor school activity was reported in 12.0%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Between 50% and 80% of females reported some levels of discomfort associated with menstruation and 20% reported sever dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] </p><p>Primary dysmenorrhea is a condition associated with ovulatory cycles.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is due to myometrium contractions induced by prostaglandins in the second half of menstrual cycle. Many women experience primary dysmenorrhea in about 50% of their menstruation cycle.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It imposes 600 million work-hours absenteeism and $2 billion of financial loss in the USA. Many suggestions, available for cramps, practically guarantee that all females, troubled by the symptoms, can find relief with safe and inexpensive treatments and fewer complications. Management of primary dysmenorrhea depends on the severity of the problem and individual woman's response to various treatments.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The common treatment for dysmenorrhea is medical therapy such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral contraceptive pills (OCP).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These methods are not acceptable for long-term therapy due to their side effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Dysmenorrhea lasts often for 8-72 h and is usually associated with the onset of blood flow.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Unfortunately, all NSAIDs have potential gastrointestinal side effects. All women taking NSAIDs should be warned to report dark-colored stools because this may be an indication of gastrointestinal bleeding.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Women with a history of aspirin sensitivity or an allergy should avoid all NSAIDs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> contains an antispasmodic and anethol agents.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] For centuries, fennel fruits (<italic>F. vulgare</italic>) have been used as traditional herbal medicine in Europe and China.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Fennel seeds were one of the acceptable herbal drugs of primary dysmenorrhea in Iran.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] <italic>F. vulgare</italic> is helpful in colic and has a slight pain reducing potentiality in dysmenorrhea. Many studies recommended more studies about fennel in primary dysmenorrhea.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] With regard to cyclic nature of primary dysmenorrhea, an effective, safe, and suitable method for remedies is obviously necessary. Fennel is an accepted herbal medication for treatment of dysmenorrhea in Iranian culture.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, bleeding severity after fennel therapy is controversial. It is important to find a safe and inexpensive way to decrease menstrual pain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Present study was performed to determine the efficacy, bleeding severity, and satisfaction with oral fennel as a herbal drug in comparison with mefenamic acid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>In the present randomized parallel-group clinical trial, we compared fennel drop 2% and mefenamic acid (cap 250 mg) in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. The subjects were 60 female students from Roghaye female student dormitory of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences. The study was approved by ethical committee of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences. In addition, it was registered in Iranian Registration of Clinical trials (IRCT; Irct ID: IRCT201107096826N2). Informed consent was obtained from each subject. Primary dysmenorrhea is clarified as periodic, spasmodic pain in the absence of certain pelvic pathology in menstrual cycle. It usually begins in teenage years after the establishment of ovulation cycles. It is caused by myometrial activity ensuing in uterine ischemia. All students were visited by a gynecologist, and she confirmed the existence of primary dysmenorrhea with history taking and sonography, if necessary. Every 18-25-year-old student who suffered from primary dysmenorrhea with moderate to severe intensity was randomly assigned to each of the two study groups by use of a random number table. The questionnaire and checklist were delivered to the subjects through a face-to-face interview. Holistic checklist inquiring the onset of the pain before bleeding, any history of gynecological disorders, pain relief with NSAIDs, and any history of pelvic disorder was used to diagnose primary dysmenorrhea. Diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea was based on a history with negative pelvic evaluation findings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] </p><p>Medication was started at the beginning of the pain. The study group received 25 drops of Fennelin 2% every 6 h.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Each 1 ml drop contains 15.5 mg Antole (Barijessence Herbal Drug Company, Kashan, Iran). If pain was not reduced until 2 h, the subject received mefenamic acid cap 250 mg every 6 h, if necessary.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Control group received mefenamic acid cap 250 mg every 6 h, if necessary.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were 18-25 years of age, living in a dormitory, nonsmoker, no systemic disease, not taking OCP and other hormonal and herbal drugs prior to and during menstrual cycle, a regular menstruation condition, and suffering from moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were intolerance to fennel drop, no desire to take any of the treatments, and taking other NSAID (Non anti inflammatory drugs) through study.</p><p>Menstrual pain intensity was measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS),[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] by use of a horizontal 10-cm line with the statements &#x0201c;no pain at all&#x0201d; on the extreme left-hand end and &#x0201c;the worst possible pain&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unbearable&#x0201d; on the extreme right-hand end. VAS is scored by measuring the distance from the end of the scale indicating absence of pain (or no distress or no pain relief) to the place marked by the patient.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Students were followed up for two menstruation cycles. A checklist including VAS, number of pad consumptions, and the amount of drug usage from the day before and the first day until the fourth day of menstruation, and satisfaction with fennel drop was given to all the students to fill. For ethical considerations, the subjects in study group could take mefenamic acid cap if their pain was not reduced with fennel drop. Adequate drug was taken by participants of each group (fennel drop 2% and mefenamic acid cap 250 mg in study group and mefenamic acid cap 250 mg in control group). Study group was compared with the control group and by themselves before and after the new intervention.</p><p>Primary outcome was pain relief in study and control groups and also in the study group before and after invention. Time point was before menstruation and the first day until the fourth day of menstruation. Secondary outcome was menstruation bleeding in study and control groups and also in the study group before and after invention. The time point was the first day to the fifth day of menstruation, and method of measurement was pad count. Mean number of mefenamic cap 250 mg usage was compared in study and control groups. In addition, satisfaction with the drugs was asked for in the two groups at the end of the questionnaire.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 16. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Parametric and non-parametric tests such as Friedman, Wilcoxon, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney were adopted.

Khodakrami showed both mefenamic acid and herbal drugs effectively relieved dysmenorrhea pain. She suggested more clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of fennel.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] For ethical considerations, the study group could also take mefenamic acid cap 250 mg if their pain did not reduce with fennel drop. Fortunately, only four cases in the study group took mefenamic acid cap 250 mg together with herbal medication.</p><p>The second aim was to investigate the effect on severity of menstruation bleeding in each group. Torkzahrani in her investigation showed that there was no significant difference in bleeding severity in fennel users.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] She showed the essence of fennel could be used as a safe and effective herbal drug for primary dysmenorrhea. Namvar Jahromi reported a case who had severe bleeding after using fennel.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Khorshidi's results confirmed that the total amount of bleeding in treatment groups significantly increased.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In our study, only on the fifth day of menstruation, the severity of menstruation bleeding significantly increased in the study and control groups (PV = 0.001) and only one case had severe menstruation after taking fennel drop. Also, a comparison of bleeding severity in the study group before and after intervention showed that 45% of the subjects who had taken fennel had severe bleeding in their cycle, which is probably due to the effect of muscular relaxation of fennel.</p><p>Khorshidi reported no noticeable side effect in the two groups except for one subject with nausea due to mefenamic acid. Conversely in our study, many volunteers complained of some side effects such as nausea due to malodor and bad taste of fennel drop.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Jahromi reported no complications in therapeutic dose of mefenamic acid cap, while five subjects left the study due to the odor of fennel.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Although the researcher did not observe noticeable side effects in the two groups, 70% of the subjects in the study group did like to try this protocol once more. Although the fennel drop can be used for primary dysmenorrhea, its new generation in the form of tablets or capsules seems more suitable for use, compared to oral drop.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The present study showed that the efficacy of fennel drop 2% in pain relief in primary dysmenorrhea is comparable to the efficacy of common NSAIDs such as mefenamic acid cap.
