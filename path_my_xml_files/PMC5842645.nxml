For each glioma case, we extracted four groups of radiological features from volume masks as the previous study described and detailed descriptions of each feature was listed in the supplementary material of the previous study (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>). Fourteen indexes that quantitatively described the distribution of voxel intensities were categorized into group 1. Group 2 included eight radiological features based on the shape and size of the tumors. Group 3 features were textural features that quantified intra-tumor heterogeneity, calculated from gray level co-occurrence (22 indexes) and gray level run-length (11 indexes) texture matrices. Texture matrices were determined considering 26-connected voxels. Features in group 4 were derived from wavelet decompositions of group 1 and 3 features (376 indexes). The original feature was decomposed into 8 decompositions, by directional low-pass (i.e. a scaling) and high-pass (i.e. a wavelet) filtering. All processes of feature extraction were conducted using MATLAB version 2014a, (Natick, MA, USA). Univariate analyses were performed by using individual features to predict p53 status with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the training set. The 10-fold cross validation was performed and then the average of the AUCs were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Machine-learning model for p53 prediction</title><p id="p0055">The lest absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, which is suitable for the regression of high-dimensional data (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Sauerbrei et al., 2007</xref>), was used to select the most predictive features in the training set to prevent overfitting and improve generalization (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). The misclassification error is determined by a tuning parameter (Lambda). As the Lambda gets smaller, some coefficients may be shrunk towards zero (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kumamaru et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Vasquez et al., 2016</xref>). We then selected the Lambda for which the cross-validation error is the smallest. In this way, most of the coefficients of the covariates are decreased to zero and the remaining non-zero coefficients are selected by LASSO. The machine-learning model predictive of p53 was constructed based on the selected radiological features and the support vector machine (SVM) in the training set, and was evaluated in the validation set. The SVM classifier was based on transforming the feature space to a high-dimensional space where a separating hyperplane maximized the margin between classes (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Korfiatis et al., 2016</xref>); this approach is effective for many pattern recognition problems (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). For each patient, the SVM classifier generated an estimated value output. ROC curve analysis was performed in both the training and validation sets to evaluate the predictive efficiency of the machine-learning model.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>p53 immunohistochemistry</title><p id="p0060">Immunoperoxidase staining for p53 mutants was conducted following the standard procedure described in our previous study (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>).

A p53 predictive machine-learning model was constructed using the training set based on the selected features and the SVM classifier. The AUC was 89.6% in the ROC curve analysis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A), and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 80.3%, 84.6%, and 80.0% respectively at the optimal cutoff point (0.1379).

In the ROC curve analysis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), the AUC was 76.3%. In addition, the optimal cutoff value (0.1812) exhibited a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 62.2%, 85.1%, and 70.7%, respectively. Hence, the 15 radiological features that constituted our model were regarded as a p53-associated radiomic signature.</p><p id="p0110"><xref rid="f0025" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> presents two representative cases of patients with lower grade gliomas. The first case was a 46-year-old male patient with p53 wild-type, who was correctly classified into the p53 wild-type group based on the SVM estimated value being high (1.70). Case 2 was a 38-year-old male patient with p53 mutation, who was correctly classified into the p53 mutation group according to the SVM estimated value being low (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.86).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0120">We extracted several radiological features from the preoperative MR images, and assessed the p53 status predictive efficiency of each feature. Subsequently, p53-associated features were screened using the LASSO algorithm, and an SVM classifier was created to integrate the selected features to predict p53 genotype in lower-grade gliomas. Our model achieved an AUC of 89.6% in the training set data and an AUC of 76.3% in the validation set data. Notably, this result was better than the predictive efficiency of any individual feature. Overall, our results indicate that the p53 mutation status can be predicted using non-invasive radiological data, and that a machine-learning approach that integrates multivariate features is more effective and robust than individual features.</p><p id="p0125">Our analysis expands the work of several recent studies that revealed novel associations between radiological features and the glioma expression profile. In a previous study of glioblastomas, tumors that were highly positive for the p53 mutation possessed typical lesions with well-defined borders and a ring enhancement pattern in T1-weighted images with contrast (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mut et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the p53 mutation status has been associated with tumor location based on a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis; p53-mutated glioblastomas tended to be located in the frontal lobe surrounding the rostral extension of the lateral ventricles (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and p53-mutated low-grade gliomas were specifically associated with the left medial temporal lobe and right anterior temporal lobe (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>). With the development of radiogenomics, p53 status can be quantitatively predicted. One previous study enrolled 31 glioma patients and extracted 86 radiomic features from preoperative MRI to predict p53 status, with an accuracy of 65.2% (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71.9%) (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Our study enrolled 272 lower-grade glioma patients and extracted 431 radiomic features, with accuracies of 80.0% (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;89.6%) and 70.7% (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;76.3%) in the training and validation sets respectively. As for the comparison between our study and another radiogenomics study focused on MGMT (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Korfiatis et al., 2016</xref>), 155 glioblastoma patients were collected and 18 texture features were extracted in the later study, with an AUC of 85%.</p><p id="p0130">In the current study, the most predictive features of p53 status were selected based on the LASSO algorithm, and the biological correlations between these features and p53 status could also be revealed preliminarily. For example, it was reported that the microvessel count is higher in p53-mutated tumors than in p53-wildtype tumors (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2008</xref>), as the vascular endothelial growth factor is overexpressed in p53-mutated tumors (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Riedel et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Uchida et al., 1998</xref>). Differences in microvascularity could result in differences in signal on T2 weighted images due to differences in water content (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dang et al., 2015</xref>), which could explain why Maximum_6 and Median_6 are higher in p53-mutant tumors than those in p53-wildtype tumors. Further, our results indicate that Uniformity_4, a radiological indicator for the consistency of the image (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>), could serve as a predictive factor of the p53 status. As previously noted, the p53 mutation promotes tumor malignancy and heterogeneity (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Gillet et al., 2014</xref>), thereby leading to the expressive discrepancy of Uniformity.</p><p id="p0135">At present, the p53 status of lower-grade gliomas is mainly used for diagnosis and prognosis. IDH-mutant gliomas can be subdivided into diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors based on the ATRX and p53 mutation status (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Malzkorn and Reifenberger, 2016</xref>). Strong nuclear p53 positivity is frequently observed in IDH-mutant astrocytic gliomas, but almost never detected in IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Ceccarelli et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding the prognostic significance of the p53 status, a previous study reported that patients with wild-type p53 survive longer than those with mutant p53 in triple-negative (i.e., 1p/19q codeletion, IDH mutation, and TERT promoter mutation) lower-grade gliomas (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0140">To develop the p53-related radiomic signature, a LASSO logistic regression model was used to reduce the 431 candidate radiological features to a set of 15 features that are predictive of the p53 mutation status. LASSO avoids overfitting and can be used to analyze multiple radiological features from a relatively small sample size (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gui and Li, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hepp et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the SVM is an effective and robust machine-learning approach (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Han and Jiang, 2014</xref>) that has been broadly applied within the field of medicine. The SVM has been used to differentiate benign and malignant pulmonary nodules (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>), predict grades (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Zacharaki et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Zollner et al., 2012</xref>) and survival (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Emblem et al., 2014</xref>) of gliomas, and diagnose thyroid cancer (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Gopinath and Shanthi, 2013</xref>). The LASSO and SVM matched well in our study, achieving a favorable prediction of the p53 mutation status in lower-grade gliomas.</p><p id="p0145">A limitation of our study is that our machine-learning approach relied on respectively collected single-institution data. Therefore, our results should be evaluated further in a prospective study. Moreover, limited by the retrospectively collected data, how different imaging protocols and field intensities (1.5&#x000a0;T and 3&#x000a0;T) affect radiomic features have not been revealed in the present study. However, many studies have already demonstrated the robustness of radiomics feature extraction in terms of repeatability and reproducibility in test/re-test settings (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fried et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Parmar et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we did not thoroughly reveal the biological process behind each selected radiological feature. Further radiogenomics analysis and experiments are necessary to solve this problem and further our understanding of the disease. Lastly, multi-model radiological data should be integrated into our model to improve prediction of the p53 status.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0150">Here, we found a correlation between p53 phenotype and radiomic features in lower-grade gliomas.
