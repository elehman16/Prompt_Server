isometric trunk exercises on gait in elderly people. [Subjects] This study randomly
allocated 20 elderly people to an isometric trunk exercise group (n=10) and a dynamic
trunk exercise group (n=10). The exercises were performed for 30 minutes three times a
week for 12 weeks. Gait speed, stride length, cadence, and step width were measured at a
normal pace using GAITRite. All groups were evaluated before and after 12 weeks. [Results]
The isometric exercise group showed a significant change in gait velocity, cadence, and
left and right step lengths. The dynamic trunk exercise group showed a significant change
in gait velocity, cadence, left and right step lengths, left and right step times, and
left and right stride lengths. Moreover, a comparison of the exercise effect between the
two groups showed a significant difference in gait velocity. [Conclusion] The results of
this study suggest that isometric trunk exercises and dynamic trunk exercises have a
positive effect on gait function in elderly people. In particular, isometric trunk
exercises are recommended to promote gait velocity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Isometric trunk exercise</kwd><kwd>Dynamic trunk exercise</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Posture adjustment, a complex process that involves balance, motor ability, endurance,
scope of exercise, sensory function, and muscle strength, is intrinsically linked to
falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls are related to abnormal gait and poor balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. They are mainly caused by the symptoms of
aging and a decline in balance ability and muscle strength. Loss of postural control
performance, which is caused by a decline in flexibility, and loss of the ability to
maintain postural balance during gait, which is due to a decline in lower extremity
strength, also contribute to falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
progression of aging causes a decline in muscle strength and balance, which in turn cause
movement and gait disorders. Reductions in lower extremity strength and flexibility decrease
gait velocity, shorten step stride, and increase the risk of falls<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, the progression of aging results in delayed reactions to stimulation, increased
brain volume loss rates, a decline in the production of neurotransmitters like dopamine, a
decline in the sense of hearing and the sense of equilibrium, decreased vision and
somatosensory system function, and decreased cognitive ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, loss of
balance ability due to musculoskeletal disorders such as degenerative joint disease can lead
to changes in gait<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aging causes gait
characteristics to change. To compensate for the decline in the ability to balance and
maintain stability, the distance between the feet, stance phase, and double support time are
increased, stride length, gait velocity, and range of motion are decreased, and the swing
phase is shortened<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Isometric trunk exercises, by reacting to given resistances, cause tension and strength to
develop in muscles but do not result in any visible joint movement. Stabilization exercises
are the most representative type of this exercise. Dynamic trunk exercises cause muscles to
contract and stretch within one&#x02019;s scope of exercise to dynamically react to given
resistances<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trunk stability exercises, or isometric trunk exercises, train
muscles such as the transversus abdominis muscles, multifidus muscles, and obliquus internus
abdominis muscles. As tension and postural muscles, these muscles are closely related to
balancing during gait, as they are responsible for the stability of the lumbar spine and
related postural control when performing full body exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Strength exercises, balance training, and flexibility training have been studied as
exercise methods that improve the gait ability of elderly people. It has been reported that
lower extremity strength improvement exercises and balance and flexibility training reduce
the risk of falls and improve gait ability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the effects of isometric trunk exercises and dynamic trunk exercises on gait

simultaneous contraction of the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles, slowly
extending each bent knee in succession, pushing each elbow downward in succession, slowly
lifting both arms above the head, lifting each knee in succession, opposite arm and leg lift

elderly women by Choi et al. resulted in a significant improvement in gait velocity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Approximately 80% of the swing phase
during gait is dependent on one&#x02019;s ability to support the body on one foot; however, the
state of one&#x02019;s body becomes unstable if the body&#x02019;s center of mass shifts to the outer edge
of the supporting foot. The major muscles used during this phase are the erector muscle of
the spine, the gluteus medius muscle, and the gluteus minimus muscle, the musculus tensor
fasciae latae, among others, all of which play an important role during trunk exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Grabiner et al. studied the factors that
play roles in recovering the body&#x02019;s balance when postural balance is suddenly lost during
gait. They found that the ability to control lower extremity strength and the angle of trunk
flexion is important<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The isometric
trunk exercises in this study employ the muscles that are associated with control of the
trunk flexion angle. These isometric trunk exercises are thus considered effective for
improving the balancing ability and gait stability of elderly people.</p><p>Previous research on dynamic trunk exercises generally supports the findings of this study.
Park conducted a four-week trunk muscle strengthening exercise program using elastic bands
on patients with hemiparalysis due to stroke or traumatic brain injury, and found that the
step length and gait velocity of the patients increased significantly<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al. conducted an eight-week resistance exercise
program designed to study how the lumbo-pelvic region and lower extremity muscles in elderly
people react, and reported that gait ability improved significantly<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This supports the results of this study in that dynamic
trunk exercises improve the gait ability of elderly people. Increased step length and
increased gait velocity are thought to improve balance ability through improvement of trunk
stability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hosseini et al. conducted
six-week muscle strength exercise and core stabilization exercise programs<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. They ascertained that the dynamic gait in
the core stabilization exercise group increased significantly compared with the dynamic gait
in the muscle strength exercise group. This supports the results of this study in that
isometric trunk exercises are more effective in improving gait velocity than dynamic trunk
exercises. It is thought that balance ability is improved through stabilization exercises
and that this leads to an increase in gait velocity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, an isometric trunk exercise program and a dynamic trunk exercise program
were conducted. Both programs improved gait ability, although the results showed that the
isometric trunk exercise program was more effective in increasing gait velocity than the
dynamic trunk exercise program. Isometric trunk exercises and dynamic trunk exercises are
both effective in improving gait ability. Further research on various body exercise programs
to compare the differences between exercise programs of varying periods and their effect on
the gait ability of elderly people are required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Falls in the elderly</article-title>. <source>Am Fam
