This study sought to determine the effect of VD supplementation on serum fibrotic markers in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Fifty-four CHC patients with VD deficiency were randomized into two groups, a VD group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) and a placebo group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29). The serum levels of 25-hydroxy VD, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, TIMP-1, MMP2 and MMP9 were measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-week study period. Upon correction of VD levels, TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and TIMP-1 levels were decreased, and the MMP2 and MMP9 levels were significantly increased in the VD group. A comparison of the mean changes (delta) in the markers between groups showed that TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and TIMP-1 levels were significantly decreased and the MMP2 and MMP9 were significantly higher in the VD group than in the placebo group. By using CHC patients as a model, this study provides additional evidence that VD plays an important role in the reversal of hepatic fibrogenesis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Liver fibrogenesis is a dynamic healing process initiated in response to hepatic injury and inflammation. This process stimulates liver fibroblast-like cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and portal myofibroblasts, resulting in the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the liver parenchyma and ultimately progressing to severe cirrhosis, the disruption of vascular circulation and liver cell dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The imbalance in pro-fibrotic cytokines/enzymes, e.g., transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and antifibrotic enzymes, e.g., matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), plays an important role in the local control of progressive or reversible scarring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Chronic viral hepatitis C (CHC) is currently among the leading causes of the global burden of disease, causing morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is common among patients with chronic liver diseases regardless of the etiology, and the degree of deficiency is correlated with the severity of liver dysfunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Over 70 percent of CHC patients show some degree of VD deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. CHC genotype 1 patients with VD deficiency show lower responses to standard pegylated interferon/ribavirin treatment, while the response rate in difficult-to-treat patients increases after the restoration of VD levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Clinical data also suggest that CHC patients with VD deficiency have more severe progressive liver fibrosis and liver stiffness, leading to the hypothesis that VD might be involved in liver fibrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">VD is currently known to have a wide variety of non-calcium homeostasis functions; the active form, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)VD], can be generated locally in several tissues and exerts para or autocrine functions via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). VD is involved in immune cell regulation and proliferation and maintains balanced innate and adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Activated HSCs, in response to the fibrogenic cytokine TGF-&#x003b2;1, upregulate the expression of <italic>VDR</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>VDR</italic> knockout mice spontaneously develop cirrhosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>DHCR7</italic> gene polymorphisms are associated with more severe liver fibrosis in CHC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a non-calcemic VD derivative, calcipotriol, was shown to prevent liver fibrosis in a mouse model of cirrhosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Convincing evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal models has demonstrated that VD is involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. Thus far, at the clinical level, the concept that low VD may influence and be related to the severity of liver fibrosis is supported by clinical observations based on histological evidence, liver stiffness measurements and the association with VD/VDR metabolic pathway polymorphisms. However, some discrepant data have suggested otherwise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Several factors such as genetics, food intake, ultraviolent B (UVB) radiation exposure and stage of liver disease affect VD status, and many factors such as the disease etiology, time course and treatment influence liver fibrosis. VD deficiency alone might contribute in some part to hepatic fibrogenesis, and its influence might be modified by other factors.</p><p id="Par6">However, there is currently no clinical evidence that VD supplements can delay or prevent the progression of liver fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To support this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to assess the dynamic changes in serum fibrogenic cytokines/enzymes in CHC patients with VD deficiency after short-term supplementation with VD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">Between February and December 2014, 73 CHC patients were assessed for eligibility; of them, 14 patients were excluded due to 25(OH)VD levels of &#x02265;30 ng/mL, and 1 CHC patient was excluded for not providing written informed consent.

Upon activation by fibrogenic cytokines, mainly TGF-&#x003b2;1, quiescent HSCs are transformed into activated myofibroblast-like cells. The accumulation of fibrillar components secreted by these activated HSCs in the ECM leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. The local control of ECM accumulation depends on the balance between MMPs, which are degradation enzymes, and TIMPs, which are fibrogenic enzymes secreted mainly from activated HSCs that function as MMP inhibitors.</p><p id="Par26">An increase in TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels and a shift in favor of TIMPs results in progressive fibrosis, while in the opposite direction, an increase in MMP functions facilitates fibrosis degradation and tissue remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">The results of our study showed that the restoration of VD levels to the normal range in patients with CHC who had VD deficiency resulted in a shift in the pro-fibrogenic cytokines and enzymes in favor of pro-fibrogenic degradation.

Importantly, these changes occurred even though CHC remained active. In other words, the main driving force of hepatic fibrosis persisted, and the additional pro-fibrotic effect of VD deficiency was likely minor, although some changes in the marker levels were still detected following VD supplementation and restoration.</p><p id="Par28">The current study used the model of CHC-induced fibrogenesis, as there is substantial evidence supporting the relationship between VD deficiency and the outcomes of this disease.

CHC patients with VD deficiency also have lower sustained virologic responses (SVRs) to interferon/ribavirin therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Another point of interest from the perspective of hepatology is the association between VD deficiency and liver fibrosis; it is thought that VD deficiency may constitute an additional factor, rather than an outcome, that contributes to more severe fibrosis, especially in CHC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Whether the restoration of VD deficiency could improve or delay fibrosis during ongoing HCV infection or treatment is difficult to evaluate via follow-up tissue biopsies in patients with CHC. These difficulties could also be seen in placebo-controlled trials of the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with high-dose vitamin E or ursodeoxycholic acid; these studies lasted for two years and did not show an improvement in hepatic fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">In addition, increasing data have confirmed the benefit of curative treatment on the improvement of liver functions and the regression of fibrosis in patients with CHC and chronic hepatitis B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which, in turn, has diminished interest in an additional fibrotic therapy for these diseases.

The discrepancy in the changes in serum MMPs among studies in CHC patients might depend on several factors, especially the dynamic phases of the disease, as the pro-fibrogenic and pro-fibrolytic phases require different functions of MMPs. The main sources of MMP2 and MMP9 are activated HSCs and pro-resolution macrophages, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our study was conducted during active chronic infection without the interference of antiviral drugs or the immune modulator effects of interferon. If the driving force of the restoration of VD deficiency to physiological levels is sufficiently robust, the balance of fibrogenesis should shift to the pro-fibrinolytic stage; this shift should be reflected by reductions in TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TIMP-1 and increases in MMP2 and MMP9 in the serum, as demonstrated in this study.</p><p id="Par34">Further, it would be interesting to investigate why TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels in the placebo group increased without any intervention. There were also no significant changes in transaminase levels in this group. We hypothesize that the ongoing active fibrogenesis partly contributed to the increased TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels. However, the continuation of active infection or inflammation might have also contributed to these increased TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels, as changes in transaminase levels usually but do not always reflect the magnitude of hepatic tissue inflammation. On the contrary, our results showed that ALT and TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels were significantly reduced after vitamin D supplementation. These changes might represent decreases in hepatic fibrogenesis and inflammation.</p><p id="Par35">With regard to HCV viral inhibition, although <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy VD3, but not the active form 1, 25-dihydroxy VD3, inhibits HCV viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we did not observe changes in HCV viral loads in our patients during the 6-week period. However, these findings do not imply that there is no minimal local inhibitory effect of VD in hepatocytes.</p><p id="Par36">The results of this study are not yet clinically beneficial. However, we intended to show that short-term vitamin D replacement, with restoration of vitamin D to physiological levels, changes the levels of specific cytokines and enzymes to favor a fibrolytic state. We chose a 6-week treatment duration because most patients&#x02019; VD levels have been shown to be restored after initial doses. We postulated that 6 weeks would be an optimal time to observe immunological changes, which are highly dynamic, as inflammatory processes and viral replication occur in spans of hours and days, respectively. Immunological imbalances caused by viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis or hepatic fibrogenesis are dynamic processes. However, hepatic scars in liver tissues could take years to form. It will be of interest to determine whether VD supplementation has protective effects on or reverses hepatic scars during or after specific therapies in a future long-term study.</p><p id="Par37">Our study has some limitations; first, it was based on serum markers that do not always represent hepatic fibrogenic events. In addition, several factors are known to influence the VD status of patients. Therefore, the trial was conducted in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled fashion to reduce most bias. To demonstrate the benefit of VD in this situation, the comparison of paired biopsies between groups would be ideal; however, a biopsy both before and after CHC treatment would be ethically controversial. Therefore, this study is considered a bridging study from experimental and animal models to humans and was performed to evaluate the benefits of VD in a fibrotic liver condition using serum markers as surrogate markers for fibrosis. Further studies should focus on the effect of VD or VD derivatives in cryptogenic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as these diseases still have no curative options.</p><p id="Par38">This study used CHC patients as a model to support previous findings <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models showing that VD has an important role in the reversal of hepatic fibrogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par39">The CONSORT checklist and a detailed protocol of this trial are available as related manuscript file (Related manuscript).</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Patients and study design</title><p id="Par40">A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, interventional study was carried out in CHC patients with VD deficiency.
