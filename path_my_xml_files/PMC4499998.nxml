patient prognosis after lower extremity bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease.
[Subjects and Methods] A total of 13 patients (16 limbs; 11 males and 2 females; mean age
[standard deviation], 72.8 [5.9] years) who underwent lower extremity bypass surgery for
Fontaine stage 2 peripheral arterial disease were included in this study and assigned to
either an active group (n = 6) to perform increased physical activity after surgery or an
inactive group (n = 7) to perform decreased physical activity after surgery. Daily
in-hospital physical activity levels were measured continuously with a triaxial
accelerometer. The occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events within a 2&#x02005;year follow-up
period was compared between groups. [Results] At discharge, the patients in the active
group were able to walk more steps daily than those in the inactive group. The incidence
of adverse events was 16.7% in the active group and 71.4% in the inactive group.
[Conclusion] A higher in-hospital physical activity level was associated with a better
long-term prognosis after lower extremity bypass surgery in patients with peripheral
arterial disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Peripheral arterial disease</kwd><kwd>Lower extremity bypass surgery</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The main purpose of a rehabilitation program after lower extremity bypass surgery in
patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the early reacquisition of skills in
activities of daily living (ADL) by improving walking ability. A multicenter study<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients who underwent
uneventful lower extremity bypass surgery started walking on postoperative day (POD)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and were discharged home on POD16.9. An aggressive
postoperative rehabilitation is important to improve a patient&#x02019;s walking performance
considering the recent trend of shortening the length of hospital stay. However, some
patients show a very low physical activity (PA) level, spending most of their time in bed,
despite the improvement in their walking ability by revascularization.</p><p>Patients with symptomatic PAD have a lower PA level than non-PAD patients because of their
limited walking capacity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been shown
that a low PA level is a significant risk factor for progression of PAD, loss of physical
function, and occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, rehabilitation
programs should focus not only on improving walking ability but also on increasing daily PA
levels to prevent future adverse cardiovascular events. However, in patients who have
undergone lower extremity bypass surgery, the association between perioperative PA level and
long-term prognosis has not been investigated.</p><p>This study aimed to evaluate preoperative-to-postoperative changes in PA levels of PAD
patients who underwent lower extremity bypass surgery and to examine the effect of these
changes with long-term clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 13 patients (16 limbs; 11 males and 2 females; Fontaine stage 2) who underwent

accelerometer (Active Style Pro. HJA-350IT, Omron Healthcare) attached to the patient&#x02019;s
waist. Daily PA (metabolic equivalents [METs]-hours/day) was defined as the total amount of
METs-hours, calculated using BI-LINK-analysis software (Omron Healthcare), which calculates
the intensity of PA (represented by METs) as a 1-minute value. Measurement began at least 2
days prior to the surgery and continued until the day of discharge, except on the day of
surgery.</p><p>Walking ability was evaluated by measuring the maximum walking distance (MWD) and via the
walking impairment questionnaire (WIQ). The Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity (SEPA) test
was also used for subjective estimation of self-efficacy. MWD was measured distance to walk
without rest on a flat surface. WIQ and SEPA questionnaires were used to measure parameters
preoperatively and at discharge, respectively. There were no target PA levels to attain, and
the patients were not provided with any guidance by the medical staff to increase their PA
level during hospitalization.</p><p>The rehabilitation program was initiated at POD1 and gradually advanced, unless there were
reports of perioperative complications or subjective symptoms such as oppressive pain. Once
independent walking was established, the patients visited the rehabilitation center and
started a supervised exercise program, which consisted of a 60-minute session including a
warm-up phase, 20 minutes of treadmill walking, and a cool-down phase. The exercise
intensity was gradually increased according to the TASC II recommendation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, with a maximum grade of 12% if patients
achieved a walking speed of 2.4&#x02005;km/h.</p><p>Based on the postoperative change in their PA levels, patients were classified into 2
groups: an active group (n = 6), who showed an increase in PA postsurgery, and an inactive
group (n = 7), who showed a decrease in PA postsurgery. The MWD, WIQ, and SEPA scores were
compared between groups. In addition, the occurrence of adverse events such as bypass graft
occlusion, CVD events, and cardiovascular intervention for a new lesion was compared between
the 2 groups.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Sakakibara Heart Institute of
Okayama (approval no. 20120101), and all participants provided written informed consent.
Differences in baseline patient characteristics were evaluated with 2-tailed t tests for
continuous variables and 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables. Paired t tests
were used to compare parameters before and after bypass surgery. The occurrence of adverse
events within 24 months after the surgery was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the
log-rank test was used to assess the association of in-hospital PA level with subsequent
cardiovascular events. Differences were considered significant when p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no hospital deaths or major postoperative complications during the course of the
study. The mean length of hospitalization after bypass surgery was 13.7 &#x000b1; 3.9 days, and all
patients were discharged home from the hospital without a transfer to a rehabilitation
facility. There were no events of bypass occlusion identified during the hospitalization.
The ankle-brachial pressure indexes were significantly improved from 0.53 &#x000b1; 0.23
preoperatively to 0.90 &#x000b1; 0.18 at discharge (p &#x0003c; 0.001). As a result, the walking ability
of the patients improved significantly, with the MWD improving from 265.8 &#x000b1; 173.6&#x02005;m to 744.6
&#x000b1; 440.5&#x02005;m (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and the WIQ score improving from 120.1 &#x000b1; 60.9 to 259.6 &#x000b1; 87.0 (p
&#x0003c; 0.001). The SEPA score showed improvement from 38.5 &#x000b1; 17.6 to 50.1 &#x000b1; 17.2 (p &#x0003c;
0.05). These results demonstrate that the walking performance and self-efficacy of these
patients improved significantly with surgical revascularization.</p><p>In terms of PA level, the number of steps the patients were able to walk daily improved
significantly, from 1,713.1 &#x000b1; 1,261.5 steps preoperatively to 2,692.4 &#x000b1; 1,967.1 steps at
discharge (p &#x0003c; 0.05). However, the actual PA level (represented by a mean daily
METs-hours) did not increase after surgery (23.0 &#x000b1; 4.4 METs-hours/day preoperatively and
22.3 &#x000b1; 4.3 METs-hours/day at discharge). These results suggest that the improved walking
ability after lower extremity bypass surgery was not necessary associated with increased
in-hospital PA level in some patients (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table

patients who underwent lower extremity bypass surgery and the effect of these changes on
long-term clinical outcomes. The walking ability (based on MWD and WIQ scores) and
self-efficacy (based on SEPA score) of the patients improved significantly after surgery.
Lundgren et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the walking
ability of patients improved after surgical revascularization secondary to improvement in
lower leg blood flow and ankle blood pressure. A randomized trial involving PAD patients
with intermittent claudication showed that supervised exercise rehabilitation further
improved walking ability after revascularization<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, our aggressive rehabilitation program, including supervised
exercise therapy, might have enhanced the effect of surgical revascularization. The
self-efficacy of PAD patients has been demonstrated to be related to walking ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The improvement in SEPA scores in this
study is attributable to the improvement in patients&#x02019; walking ability after surgical
revascularization.</p><p>However, despite an improved walking ability, PA levels did not improve postoperatively in
approximately half of the patients. Sieminski et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the PA levels of patients with and without PAD by using an
accelerometer and found that the PAD patients had significantly lower PA levels than the
non-PAD patients (357 and 616&#x02005;kcal/day, respectively). McDermott et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a higher rate of PAD patients (15%) showed
physical inactivity in low-intensity activities such as casual walking or strolling compared
with non-PAD patients (5%), suggesting that the low PA level in PAD patients was
attributable to the inactivity of the relatively low-intensity activities. Furthermore, PAD
patients are less likely to develop regular exercise habits compared with non-PAD
individuals<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, improved
walking capacity with supervised exercise did not result in an improvement in total PA in
the inactive group, probably because the patients continued to be inactive even after
revascularization and, as a consequence, their PA level did not increase outside the
rehabilitation center.</p><p>Despite the similarities in the baseline characteristics and walking ability of the
patients in the 2 groups, late adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 71.4% of patients
in the inactive group within 24 months after surgery (graft occlusion, 42.9%; percutaneous
coronary intervention for progress of coronary artery lesion, 14.3%; rehospitalization for
congestive heart failure, 14.3%), whereas the incidence of CVD in the active group was only
16.7%. Considering the fact that physical inactivity is a risk factor for progression of
arteriosclerosis, the patients who did not show improvement in in-hospital PA levels even
after revascularization may be more likely to experience late adverse cardiovascular events
because they may not change their sedentary lifestyle despite the improvement in their
walking ability.</p><p>Generally, PA is considered to be effective for controlling risk factors like diabetes
mellitus<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the relationship
between physical inactivity and adverse cardiovascular events. Depressive symptoms in PAD
patients are associated with adverse events, and this association is partially explained by
physical inactivity in these patients, who exercise only a few times in a month<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study showed the association
between PA level and inflammatory biomarkers, which are risk factors for adverse
cardiovascular events<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
Garg et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that PAD patients
with higher daily PA levels have lower rates of mortality and adverse cardiovascular events
than those with lower PA levels. In contrast, low-intensity physical activities such as
recreational activities have been shown to decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular
events, which are strongly related to mortality in PAD patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, the higher level of in-hospital PA after lower extremity bypass surgery was
associated with a better long-term prognosis in our study. Post-bypass surgery
rehabilitation programs should aim at improving the daily PA level and walking ability of
PAD patients for the prevention of CVD.</p><p>This study evaluated the PA of patients only during their hospitalization. It is unknown
whether patients who showed a high PA level during hospitalization continue to be active
after discharge. Therefore, a long-term assessment of PA in the home setting is necessary
for a more precise analysis of the association between perioperative PA and patient
prognosis after lower extremity bypass surgery for PAD. Furthermore, the number of patients
in this study was small and the follow-up period was relatively short. In the future, a
clinical trial may be needed to determine whether interventions that increase in-hospital PA
levels reduce the occurrence of long-term adverse cardiovascular events in patients with
PAD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 22592469.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Morisawa</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Oura</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Obata</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Fact-finding about rehabilitation after the lower limbs
