It is the most popular modern contraceptive method worldwide. The simplest way to provide tubal ligation is by a procedure called <italic>minilaparotomy</italic>, generally performed with the client&#x000a0;under local anesthesia with systemic sedation and analgesia. In Tanzania, unmet need for family planning is high and has declined little in the past decade. Access to tubal ligation is limited throughout the country, in large part because of a lack of trained providers. Clinical officers (COs) are midlevel health workers who provide diagnosis, treatment, and minor surgeries. They are more prevalent than physicians in poorer and rural communities. Task shifting&#x02014;the delegation of some tasks to less-specialized health workers, including task shifting of surgical procedures to midlevel cadres&#x02014;has improved access to lifesaving interventions in resource-limited settings. It is a cost-effective way to address shortages of physicians, increasing access to services. The primary objective of this trial is to establish whether the safety of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy provided by COs is noninferior to the safety of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy provided by physicians (assistant medical officers [AMOs]), as measured by rates of major adverse events (AEs) during the procedure and through 42&#x000a0;days of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In this facility-based, multicenter, noninferiority randomized controlled trial, we are comparing the safety of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy performed by trained COs versus by trained AMOs.

The simplest way to provide tubal ligation is through a procedure called <italic>minilaparotomy</italic>, which is generally performed with the client&#x000a0;under local anesthesia with systemic sedation and analgesia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tubal ligation by minilaparotomy is a minor surgery that can be performed in resource-limited settings on an outpatient basis with low risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although data are limited and published reports are for the most part several decades old, complication rates of 0.7&#x02013;3.4% following tubal ligation by minilaparotomy performed by physicians have been reported in several countries in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Among currently married Tanzanian women 15&#x02013;49 years old, 25.7% do not want to have any more children, whereas 3.4% have had a tubal ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although modern contraceptive use has steadily increased over the last decade, from 20% in 2004&#x02013;2005 to 27% in 2010 and 32% in 2015&#x02013;2016, unmet need for family planning has remained steady at 22&#x02013;24% since 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Use of tubal ligation among currently married women has more than doubled, from 1.6% in the early 1990s to 3.4% today; however, it represents only about 11% of all contraceptive use, despite the large numbers of women who desire no more children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Despite a high demand for modern contraceptives, access to tubal ligation in Tanzania is limited, with 58% of hospitals and 38% of health centers offering tubal ligation services. (In some cases, only counseling is provided.) Availability is roughly evenly divided between government, private for-profit, and faith-based facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The government of Tanzania (GOT) recognizes that most health facilities in the country are understaffed, with the greatest need in rural areas, and that a lack of trained providers significantly limits the availability of services, including tubal ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinical officers (COs) are midlevel providers who diagnose and treat illnesses and perform minor surgeries. They outnumber physicians, both medical officers (MOs) and assistant medical officers (AMOs), by a 2:1 ratio, and they are more prevalent in rural communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Task shifting, described as delegation or shifting of some tasks to less-specialized health workers, is one method used to expand the health workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Task shifting of surgical procedures to midlevel cadres, including COs, has improved access to lifesaving interventions in resource-limited settings and is considered a safe and cost-effective way to address physician shortages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Two recent systematic reviews of older studies, as well as two recent small-scale studies in Uganda and Malawi, suggest that task-shifting tubal ligation via minilaparotomy to nonphysician clinicians is safe, although available evidence is limited and well-designed clinical trials are needed to definitively demonstrate safety, efficacy, and acceptability of task-shifting the procedure to midlevel providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. WHO guidelines on optimizing health workers&#x02019; roles for maternal and newborn health include COs among those considered competent to provide tubal ligation; however, the recommendation was not based on a review of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Task shifting of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy to COs would increase access to tubal ligation for many Tanzanian women who are most in need and is of interest to the GOT as a way to assist in meeting the needs of the growing numbers of women seeking permanent contraception.

This question lends itself to a noninferiority design. The choice of the noninferiority margin (i.e., the smallest clinical difference that is acceptable between the two treatments) is based on a combination of clinical judgment and statistical reasoning. In the case of major AEs following tubal ligation by minilaparotomy, data from prior trials (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) suggest an average AE rate of 3.85% (95% CI 3.15&#x02013;4.54%). After removing the one trial that is an outlier, in terms of both sample size and AE rate, we calculated the average as 1.59% (95% CI 0.90&#x02013;2.28%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Reported adverse event rates following tubal ligation by minilaparotomy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Reference</td><td>AEs (<italic>n</italic>)</td><td>Sample (<italic>n</italic>)</td><td>AE rate</td><td rowspan="13"/><td rowspan="13"/></tr><tr><td>Chowdhury and Chowdhury, 1975 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]</td><td>7</td><td>600</td><td>1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Fongsri and McDaniel, 1979 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]</td><td>4</td><td>900</td><td>0.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dusitsin et al., 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]</td><td>5</td><td>292</td><td>1.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Koetsawang et al., 1981 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]</td><td>37</td><td>1376</td><td>2.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Satyapan et al., 1983 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</td><td>82</td><td>3549</td><td>2.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Kanchanasinith et al., 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]</td><td>8</td><td>820</td><td>1.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Jack and Chao, 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td><td>482</td><td>5182</td><td>9.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Ruminjo and Ngugi, 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</td><td>8</td><td>1521</td><td>0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Ruminjo and Ngugi, 1993 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]</td><td>30</td><td>1999</td><td>1.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Cisse et al., 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</td><td>7</td><td>800</td><td>0.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Kidan et al., 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</td><td>0</td><td>148</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Gordon-Maclean et al., 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td><td>11</td><td>518</td><td>2.1%</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>AE rate (weighted average)</td><td>Lower limit</td><td>Upper limit</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>681</td><td>17,705</td><td>3.85%</td><td>3.15%</td><td>4.54%</td></tr><tr><td>Total excluding Jack and Chao, 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td><td>199</td><td>12,523</td><td>1.59%</td><td>0.90%</td><td>2.28%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

In addition, in the clinical judgment of EngenderHealth staff and outside experts, we have determined that a noninferiority margin of 2% is appropriate because it implies that up to a 5% AE rate would be clinically acceptable. In other words, if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in AE rates (CO minus AMO) lies fully to the left of the 2% noninferiority margin, we will have proved noninferiority of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy conducted by COs at a level of significance of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05.</p><p id="Par62">Assuming a 3% major AE rate in the control group (AMOs), we will demonstrate noninferiority within the margin of 2% at a one-sided significance level of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and a power of 80% (calculated when AE rates in both arms are the same) with a sample size of 895 per arm (1790 women in total).

If eligible, a research assistant will randomize participants, and the minilaparotomy procedure will be done on the same visit in most cases (or, if not, within 7&#x000a0;days of screening). Providers will conduct tubal ligation procedures according to the GOT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We have not placed any restrictions on clinical care that a provider deems necessary for the health and well-being of study participants, although we will collect data on all relevant concomitant care and interventions provided before or during the procedure, as well as during the follow-up period.</p><p id="Par65">We will ask participants to return for three scheduled follow-up visits at 3, 7, and 42&#x000a0;days postsurgery. A research assistant will call or text participants the day before each scheduled visit to remind them to come for follow-up. If a participant misses a visit, a research assistant will attempt to contact the participant three times to encourage him/her to come for the visit. We will give participants 5000 Tanzanian shillings (approximately $2.25) to cover time and transport cost to/from the study site for each of the three scheduled follow-up visits. A provider may schedule additional visits if clinically necessary, and we will inform participants that they should return to the site at any time if they have problems or concerns related to the procedure.</p><p id="Par66">We will collect data at three time points:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par67">Prior to the minilaparotomy procedure, we will record detailed information on sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric and family planning use&#x000a0;history, and physical examination findings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">At the time of surgery, we will gather details of the anesthesia and procedure, including problems encountered, assistance needed, and occurrence of AEs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">We will record information on physical examination findings, AEs, and participants&#x02019; experience and satisfaction postsurgery; during recovery; and at 3, 7, and 42&#x000a0;days after surgery, as well as during any unscheduled follow-up visits.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par169">At the end of the study, we will collect information from the COs and AMOs on self-efficacy, including measures of general self-efficacy, and confidence and comfort conduting minilaparotomy.</p></list-item></list>

The primary outcome of the trial is major AEs within 42&#x000a0;days of the tubal ligation by minilaparotomy (i.e., the proportion of participants experiencing a major AE by day 42 postsurgery) in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. We will conduct the primary analysis for the ITT population. The ITT population would include participants for whom the protocol is violated (i.e., participants who are randomized to have their procedure done by a CO but in fact have the procedure done by an AMO, or participants who are randomized to have their procedure done by an AMO but in fact have the procedure done by a CO) and withdrawals/discontinuations. We will also conduct a per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome if we have participants who do not receive the treatment to which they were randomly allocated.</p><p id="Par74">Unlike a superiority trial, where the treatment effect is the primary parameter of interest, the interpretation of a noninferiority trial&#x02019;s results depends on the location of the CI for the effect of the experimental treatment relative to the margin of noninferiority and a null effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The primary analysis will be interpreted as follows. If the whole 95% CI lies above the noninferiority margin of 2%, the experimental intervention will be declared &#x0201c;inferior.&#x0201d; If the whole 95% CI lies below the noninferiority margin, the intervention will be considered to be &#x0201c;noninferior&#x0201d; to the standard treatment. If the 95% CI includes the noninferiority margin, study results will be deemed inconclusive. Finally, if the entire 95% CI lies completely below zero, the new treatment may be considered superior to the standard treatment.</p><p id="Par75">We will conduct other analyses on primary and secondary outcomes related to tubal ligation by minilaparotomy, including AE rates (overall and per time point), measures of performance (e.g., procedure times, difficulties performing the procedure, inability to complete the procedure), and participant satisfaction. We will analyze data on key demographic and reproductive variables (e.g., age, education level, marital status, occupation, ethnicity, parity) to generate a profile of study participants undergoing tubal ligation by minilaparotomy at study sites. We will analyze data on key provider-level variables to generate a profile of providers, disaggregated by provider type (CO and AMO). Methods of analysis for each secondary outcome are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> above.</p><p id="Par76">We will include data in the analyses for all outcomes for participants who withdraw or are discontinued in the study through the time their study participation ends. We will not consider observations with missing data in the analyses and will not impute any missing data.</p><p id="Par77">We have recruited a three-member data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) with no direct involvement in the study, including a surgeon experienced with tubal ligation by minilaparotomy, an epidemiologist, and a statistician. The role of the DSMB will be to deal with any ethical and safety issues that may arise during the trial and to review an interim analysis. We will conduct the interim analysis after approximately one-third of the sample has had the minilaparotomy procedure and completed the 7-day follow-up visit. At the time of the interim analyses, we will provide the DSMB with safety and study quality data (e.g., recruitment and follow-up rates, protocol violations), unmasked by treatment group.</p><p id="Par78">We will ask the DSMB to give advice regarding stopping the trial if they have proof beyond doubt of an important advantage or disadvantage for one of the treatment groups and if they consider that the results are likely to affect clinical practice. For the primary outcome (i.e., major AEs), the following stopping guidelines have been proposed for the DSMB:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par79">At the time of the interim analysis, the DSMB may recommend stopping the study or temporarily halting recruitment if there are significantly more major AEs in one randomization group than in the other; a difference between the two treatment arms will be considered significant if the <italic>p</italic> value is&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">In the event that the interim analysis shows notably higher rates of major AEs in the study participants overall (i.e., both study arms) relative to the generally accepted AE rates following tubal ligation by minilaparotomy (e.g., a&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5% rate, which is the upper limit of the 95% CI in previously published studies), the DSMB may recommend stopping the study or temporarily halting recruitment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par81">The DSMB may also recommend stopping the study, temporarily halting recruitment, or adjusting study sites if it seems that recruitment is not proceeding at rates that will allow the study to reach its target sample size within a reasonable time frame.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par82">If the study is stopped temporarily or permanently for any reason, we will continue to follow participants already enrolled for the planned follow-up period (and longer, if necessary, based on clinical indications). We will continue to provide enrolled participants with clinical care as necessary. According to the charter agreed to by the DSMB members before the start of the trial, their role will be as advisors to the investigators; the latter will be responsible for making decisions regarding temporarily or permanently stopping recruitment.</p><p id="Par83">The PI will have responsibility for informing relevant parties (e.g., other investigators, study site personnel, IRBs, trial participants, trial registries), or ensuring they are informed, of any important protocol modifications or other information pertinent to conduct of the trial via email or phone or in person in a timely fashion, depending on the nature and urgency of the information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par84">If no major safety or other issues are identified, the data from this trial may facilitate changes in the GOT regulations, allowing appropriately trained COs to provide tubal ligation by minilaparotomy. We have reason to be optimistic that COs will be able to safely perform tubal ligations by minilaparotomy. As mentioned previously, two recent systematic reviews and results of two recent small-scale studies provide data supporting the safety of task-shifting tubal ligation by minilaparotomy to nonphysician clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, surgical task-shifting initiatives have been reported to be successful in various African countries, including Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Mozambique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with COs and nurses demonstrating success similar to that of their higher-level counterparts in performing cesarean deliveries and other major surgical procedures more complex than tubal ligation by minilaparotomy.</p><p id="Par85">If our results demonstrate that tubal ligation by minilaparotomy provided by COs is noninferior to provision by AMOs, leading to revised guidelines by the GOT and training of COs to provide tubal ligation by minilaparotomy in Tanzania, access to a very effective permanent method of contraception would increase dramatically for thousands of women, given the more widespread availability of COs at health facilities around the country relative to physicians. Three-fourths of the population of Tanzania lives in rural areas; yet, only 31% of physicians are stationed in rural areas, in contrast to 72% of COs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The need for female surgical contraceptive services in Tanzania is critically urgent. If current trends continue, the number of women of reproductive age (15&#x02013;49 years old) choosing female sterilization by 2020 will be more than 65,000 annually, almost a doubling of demand since 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">Positive findings may have broader implications; task shifting to provide long-term contraceptives, if proven safe, may be an effective approach to increasing contraceptive access in many low- and middle-income countries. The results of our large-scale RCT will provide definitive data to support or refute provision of tubal ligation by minilaparotomy conducted by nonphysician clinicians and may lead to changes in government regulations in a variety of countries.</p><p id="Par87">Following completion of the study, we will submit a report to United States Agency for International Development/Tanzania and to the GOT. Additionally, we will prepare policy and technical briefs for dissemination to a wide audience, dependent on the outcome of the study. Regardless of study outcomes, the research team will hold dissemination meetings with key district, regional, and national stakeholders in Tanzania. Given the likely wide potential interest and importance of the results in the international family planning community, we will also disseminate the results in at least one publication in a peer-reviewed journal and at one or more international scientific conferences. We will follow the authorship guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, whereby each author is required to (1) have made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work or to the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; (2) have made substantial contributions to drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) approve the final version to be published; and (4) agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. We do not intend to use professional writers.</p><p id="Par88">We do not plan to disseminate the results among research participants, because the vast majority will not be returning to the facility after their final follow-up visit is complete. Moreover, the intervention being tested is a service delivery approach and is not related to participant behaviors; thus, the communities of interest for dissemination of results are government officials, policymakers, and family planning program managers and providers.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par89">Enrollment began on 6 December 2016 and was completed on 16 June 2017.
