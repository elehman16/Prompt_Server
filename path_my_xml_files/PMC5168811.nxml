They impact greatly on an individual&#x02019;s functional status and health-related quality of life. The mainstay of pressure ulcer prevention practice is the provision of pressure redistribution support surfaces and patient repositioning. The aim of the PRESSURE 2 study is to compare the two main mattress types utilised within the NHS: high-specification foam and alternating pressure mattresses, in the prevention of pressure ulcers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>PRESSURE 2 is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, double triangular, group sequential, parallel group trial. A maximum of 2954 &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; patients with evidence of acute illness will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either a high-specification foam mattress or alternating-pressure mattress in conjunction with an electric profiling bed frame. The primary objective of the trial is to compare mattresses in terms of the time to developing a new Category 2 or above pressure ulcer by 30 days post end of treatment phase. Secondary endpoints include time to developing new Category 1 and 3 or above pressure ulcers, time to healing of pre-existing Category 2 pressure ulcers, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, incidence of mattress change and safety. Validation objectives are to determine the responsiveness of the Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life-Prevention instrument and the feasibility of having a blinded endpoint assessment using photography. The trial will have a maximum of three planned analyses with unequally spaced reviews at event-driven coherent cut-points. The futility boundaries are constructed as non-binding to allow a decision for stopping early to be overruled by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The double triangular, group sequential design of the PRESSURE 2 trial will provide an efficient design through the possibility of early stopping for demonstrating either superiority, inferiority of mattresses or futility of the trial. The trial optimises the potential for producing robust clinical evidence on the effectiveness of two commonly used mattresses in clinical practice earlier than in a conventional design.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

They impact greatly on an individual&#x02019;s functional status and health-related quality of life as a consequence of distressing symptoms including pain, exudate and odour, increased care burden, prolonged rehabilitation, requirement for bed rest, hospitalisation and for those who work, prolonged sickness absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The primary cause of a PU is mechanical load in the form of pressure or pressure and shear, applied to soft tissues, generally over a bony prominence. They range in severity from non-blanchable erythema (Category 1), superficial skin loss (Category 2) to severe ulcers involving fat, muscle and bone (Category 3, 4 or unstageable) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>PU development is influenced by the intensity and duration of pressure and occurs when the soft tissues are unable to tolerate the sustained mechanical loads that develop between bony prominences and a support surface e.g. the sacrum and a mattress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They are a cross-specialty problem, a complication of serious acute or chronic illness in patient populations characterised by high levels of co-morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The mainstay of PU prevention practice is the provision of pressure redistribution support surfaces (mattresses, cushions) and patient repositioning, to minimise both the intensity and duration of pressure exposure of vulnerable skin sites, not adapted to sustained and/or excessive loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pressure-relieving mattresses either distribute the patient&#x02019;s weight over a larger contact area providing &#x02018;constant low pressure&#x02019; or they mechanically vary the pressure beneath the patient, so reducing the duration of the applied pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The two main mattress types utilised within the National Health Service (NHS) are <italic>high-specification foam</italic> (HSF) mattresses, which are classified as a &#x02018;low-tech constant low-pressure device&#x02019; and <italic>alternating-pressure mattresses</italic> (APMs), which are classified as &#x02018;high-tech&#x02019; support surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Alternating pressure mattresses are electrically powered and comprise large air-filled pockets which inflate and deflate in cycles.</p><p>The conclusions of the updated Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] did not differ from the previous review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The recent review concluded that foam alternatives to standard hospital foam mattresses reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in patients at risk (RR 0.40 95% CI 0.21 to 0.74) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One trial suggested that alternating-pressure mattresses may be more cost-effective than alternating-pressure overlays in a UK context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the relative merits of APMs and constant low-pressure devices remain unclear and recommended the evaluation of APMs compared to constant low-pressure devices such as HSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence that some patients do not like APMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The alternating sensation is disliked by some patients and can cause feelings of nausea and impact upon sleep. In addition, upon patient movement, the air-filled pockets are compressed and patients find it difficult to mobilise in bed and also report feeling unstable at the mattress edge, either when they are getting in and out of bed or feeling like they will be &#x02018;rolled out of bed&#x02019;, creating an unsafe feeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other issues include noise from the pump, technical failure and attendant alarms.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends the use of an HSF mattress in adults who are admitted to secondary care and who are assessed as being at high risk of developing a PU in primary and community care settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HSF mattresses are also recommended for adults with a PU, and if this is not sufficient to re-distribute pressure, to consider the use of a dynamic support surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore the NICE guidance states that HSF is the recommended &#x02018;minimum&#x02019; standard of care for mattress provision in the prevention and treatment of PUs. Despite the large difference in the unit cost with HSF units ranging from &#x000a3;180 to &#x000a3;600 and APM units ranging from &#x000a3;1000 to &#x000a3;5000 and limited evidence of benefit of APMs compared to HSF in PU prevention, they are in widespread clinical use. This has been evidenced in the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) PURPOSE pain cohort study where mattress allocation by ward staff to a high-risk target population (mobility impaired and/or Category 1 PU and/or pressure area-related pain) was 48% HSF: 52% APM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], reflecting a lack of standardised practice and clinical uncertainty relating to mattress provision for &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; patients.</p><p>In light of the priority being given to PU prevention by the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the high cost and lack of evidence relating to the effectiveness of mattresses in common use in the NHS, ad hoc practice in mattress allocation and the disadvantages and difficulties reported by patients in the use of APMs, we are undertaking a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare HSF and APMs in a high-risk in-patient population.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main aim of the study is to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of high-specification foam (HSF) and alternating-pressure mattresses (APM) when both are used in conjunction with an electric profiling bed frame in secondary care and community in-patients facilities in patients with evidence of acute illness, for the prevention of Category 2 (and above) PU.</p><p>The primary objective is to compare the time to developing a new Category 2 or above PU, in patients using HSF to those using APM by 30 days post end of treatment phase.</p><p>The secondary objectives are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To compare the time to developing a new Category 3 or above PU, between patients using HSF and those using APM</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the time to developing a new Category 1 or above PU, between patients using HSF and those using APM</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the time to healing of pre-existing Category 2 PU between patients using HSF and those using APM</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the impact of HSF and APM on health-related quality of life</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of APM compared to HSF from the perspective of the health and social care sectors</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare incidence of mattress change between patients using HSF and those using APM</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare safety between patients using HSF and those using APM</p></list-item></list>

A full verbal explanation of the study Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) will be provided by a member of the TVT for the patient to consider. Following information provision, patients will have as long as they need to consider participation and will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their family and other healthcare professionals before they are asked whether they would be willing to participate in the study. Assenting patients will be formally assessed for eligibility and invited to provide informed consent.</p><p>For patients capable of giving consent but physically unable to complete the written aspects of the consent form, witnessed consent will be provided by a family member or friend of the patient, or another member of the patient&#x02019;s healthcare team who is not directly involved in the research study using the Witnessed Consent Form.</p><p>A large proportion of patients at risk of pressure ulcers have cognitive impairment affecting their understanding of the trial and/or dementia. Cognition impacts upon compliance with repositioning and self-care in the use of the electric profiling functionality, which is an integral component of the intervention package. It is important that the trial population is representative of the normal NHS patient population and therefore patients who lack capacity will also be recruited onto the trial.</p><p>The assessment of capacity will relate specifically to decisions pertaining to this particular research project. Each patient will be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity. Ward-based nurses identifying patients for study participation will be asked to consider aspects of capacity before any approach to patients is made and during the information-giving stage prior to consent. The TVT member will assess the patient&#x02019;s ability to understand what decisions they need to make and why; the consequences of the decision to participate; their ability to understand, use and retain the information related to the decision to participate and be able to communicate their decisions effectively (as specified in the Mental Capacity Act 2005). If there is any concern about capacity the ward nurse/TVT member will consult further with other members of the attending clinical team and/or relative/carer/friend (as appropriate) and a decision will be made with the relative/carer/friend as to whether the patient is able to provide written consent. Where the patient is thought not to have capacity to consent, a relative, carer or friend who is interested in the patient&#x02019;s welfare will act as a personal consultee or nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney (Scotland).</p><p>The relative/carer/friend will be involved in the information and decision-making process with the patient and will advise the TVT member on their presumed wishes and feelings and consultee or nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney (Scotland) assent will be obtained on behalf of the patient. The relative, carer or friend will be advised to set aside their own views and provide advice on the participation of the patient in the research, taking into consideration the patient&#x02019;s wishes and interests. Patients will not be required to do anything which is contrary to any advance decisions or statements that have been made by them in relation to their treatment or any other matter. Advance decisions made by the patient about their preferences and wishes will always take precedence.</p><p>If, despite taking all reasonable steps, a personal consultee cannot be identified and contacted then a nominated consultee or nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney (Scotland) would be approached. This person would have no connection with the research project. They would be nominated by the TVT member; they would most likely be the patient&#x02019;s lead clinician. The consultee or nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney (Scotland) would be provided with the information leaflet describing the research study and the role of the consultee/nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney and it would be emphasised that they are being asked to act on behalf of the patient, rather than on any personal views or feelings.</p><p>Where a patient has been enrolled into the study after consultee or nearest relative/guardian/welfare attorney (Scotland) agreement and they subsequently regain capacity, a member of the research team will discuss the study with the patient; provide a full verbal explanation of the trial and a Patient Information Leaflet explaining the trial and their participation in the trial. Assenting patients will be invited to provide informed consent/witnessed verbal consent for ongoing participation. Those who do not wish to continue in the trial will be withdrawn.</p><p>Consent for photographs to be taken of skin sites will be obtained at time of consent to the trial with an opt-out clause allowing patients to withdraw consent for photographs at any time.</p><p>Patients who change from their allocated mattress will continue follow-up assessments unless they are unwilling to do so, and patients who withdraw from the trial will continue to be managed in line with standard care. Patients with capacity at study entry who subsequently lose capacity will be withdrawn from the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following confirmation of informed consent, eligibility and completion of baseline assessments, patients will be randomised by an authorised member of the research team at the site.

The trial optimises the potential for producing robust clinical evidence on the effectiveness of two commonly used mattresses in clinical practice earlier than in a conventional fixed design. A fixed design with the same parameters would require 554 events. Although conducting a group sequential trial increases the maximum sample size required compared to a conventional fixed design, these stopping boundaries will also allow for an increased chance of stopping early. In addition, the trial utilises an early primary endpoint, time to developing a Category 2 or above PU to a maximum of 90 days, and therefore early stopping can be assessed in a timely manner.</p><p>On the other hand, a potential limitation of having an early endpoint is that PUs developing over a longer time horizon will be missed, however as PUs generally develop quickly in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] this would affect a minority of patients, and it is was therefore considered that the duration of follow-up is optimum to allow early assessment of superiority of either mattress or futility of the trial.</p><p>Group sequential trials with a time to event primary endpoint require close monitoring of the overall event rate in order to plan when an interim analysis will be conducted. A benefit of this close monitoring allows the overall event rate to be monitored and evaluated against the assumptions specified in the original trial design, thereby allowing the trial design to be modified prior to an interim analysis if required.</p><p>Stopping boundaries provide statistical guidance to the DMEC on the recommendations for stopping the trial early; however factors including patient safety, cost-effectiveness and other information external to the trial will also need to be considered in order to make a fully informed decision on whether or not to continue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>As this is a pragmatic trial, the operational specifications for both HSF and APM have been developed and defined in the PRESSURE 2 Mattress Specification Guideline, rather than product-specific mattresses for all trial patients, as this increases the generalisability of the trial findings to the NHS. There are also research costs advantages as the trial does not require the purchasing of specified products.</p><p>Having a blinded assessment of outcome measures is a key consideration in reducing the risk of assessment bias. In this study we will assess the feasibility of having a blinded outcome assessment using photography with a blinded independent central review undertaken by clinical nurse specialists.
