Loss of lower limb strength leads to an increased risk of falls and a sedentary lifestyle.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether lower limb strengthening exercise
leads to improved lower limb strength and balance function for the elderly. [Subjects]
From a total of 74 respondents, 50 subjects were randomly assigned to either a training
group (n = 30) or a control group (n = 20). The subjects ranged in age from 65 to
82&#x02005;years. A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of strengthening exercise and
balance function. [Methods] Leg extension and lower curl exercises were performed during
the 12-week study. [Results] After training, the lower limb strength and balance of the
individuals in the training group had significantly improved compared to the baseline.
[Conclusion] Improvement in lower limb strength may lead to balance enhancement in
neurologically intact older persons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Strengthening exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In humans, muscle strength, which can be defined as the force generation capacity of an
individual, reaches its peak in the second and third decades of life, shows an imperceptible
progressive decline until approximately 50 years of age, and then begins to decline
thereafter at a rate between 1.4% to 2.5% per year, with more rapid losses after the age of
65 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low levels of lower limb strength are associated with functional limitations in daily

different ways, depending on the physiological, functional or performance goals.</p><p>Although some researchers have demonstrated that older adults are capable of significant
improvements in lower extremity force measures with strength training, the effect of this
type of training on balance measures has been rarely reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural sway increases

lower limb strength and balance of older persons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety subjects were recruited through advertising targeting individuals 65&#x02005;years or older.
Individuals with severe cardiac disease or orthopedic or neurological disorders that
resulted in mobility impairment were excluded from the study. All the enrolled subjects of
this study had normal cognition, as determined by a Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination
score of 24. Of the participants, 16 were excluded because of cardiac or muscular problems,
and the remaining 74 participants were randomly enrolled in 1 of 2 groups. The exercise
group had twice as many subjects as the control group: 49 subjects were allocated to the
exercise group, and 25 to the control group. During the experimental period, 24 participants
dropped out owing to illness and were lost to follow-up. The participants were enrolled in
this study after providing their informed consent in accordance with the ethical standards
of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The intensity of exercise for the first week was 45&#x02013;55% of 1RM, and it was progressively
increased up by 65&#x02013;75% at the 11&#x02013;12week mark. The exercise group performed in three sets of
10&#x02013;12 repetitions. Between sets, a resting period of 60 seconds was allowed. Leg extension
and curl exercises were performed using Milon exercise equipment (Milon, Emersacker,
Germany), because the resistance of the equipment could be set digitally. To measure lower
limb strength, each subject stood in front of an armless chair and was asked to take a
seated position followed by a standing position as many times as possible within 30 seconds.
During a 2-minute step in-place exercise, the examiner counted the elevation of only the
right lower limb and informed the participant of the time at the end of the first minute and
30 seconds before the time was up. For balance, the limit of stability was measured using a
BioRescue (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France) with a safety bar. This study used the gross area
(cm<sup>2</sup>) measure. Data were analyzed with a commercially available statistical
software program (PASW 18.0, IBM Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The independent t test and
<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test were used to compare the baseline values between the 2
groups, and the paired t test was used to analyze the difference in effects after training.
Values of p &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The general characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training group (n=30)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=20)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.4&#x000b1;3.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.5&#x000b1;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13/17</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body Mass Index</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.7&#x000b1;3.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.36&#x000b1;2.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> lists the demographic data of the subjects.

strength-training exercises on the balance of elderly subjects. Our main finding was that
the well-prescribed strengthening exercises led not only to enhanced strength but also to
improved balance in the elderly persons.</p><p>Numerous studies utilizing traditional progressive strength training approaches have
focused on the development of muscle strength and increased muscle mass to slow or reverse
the effects of sarcopenia in older adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the previous studies, these types of resistance training
improved older adults&#x02019; muscle mass, strength, and high-load power<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the chair rise, a signi&#x0fb01;cant, moderate-to-large
bene&#x0fb01;cial effect of progressive strength training was observed, although this was derived
from only a small amount of data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this research support the
hypothesis that an exercise program emphasizing strengthening improves the static balance of
the elderly. The improvement of static balance in the training group was greater than that
of the control group.</p><p>Several studies have found that older individuals could undertake strength training and
realize several physiological benefits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The findings of this study corroborate
those of a previous 3-month study that randomized high-functioning men and women over the
age of 70&#x02005;years into power training and walking groups. This previous study included a
combined training, 3 times per week, that consisted of knee extension and sitting leg press
machine exercises, walking for 20 minutes, and performing postural control exercises, which
included simple Tai Chi movements that could help balance function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increases in balance measures can be explained as greater
tolerance of instability, increased resistance to gluteus medius muscle fatigue, or improved
balance. The training provided in the present study resulted in modest strength gains (22%);
however, these improvements in strength may not necessarily equate to improvements in
function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effect of progressive
strength training on measures of standing balance of 789 participants were not clear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similar effect estimates were found when only 2 measures (i.e., timed position holding and
balance during more complex activities such as the Berg Balance Scale) were examined
separately.</p><p>The subjects involved in this study were healthy and willing to travel for non-assistive
activities of daily living. The selection of active, high-level functioning subjects with
good baseline characteristics would tend to limit the improvement possible from exercise
intervention. Similar or greater improvements may be achievable in a less-active group of
subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Metter</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Conwit</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Age-associated loss of power and strength in the upper
