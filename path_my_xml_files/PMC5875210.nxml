Limited number of patients and absent control group is another limitation, so further research with larger patient populations from multiple health centers is a must. Finally, the 6 months follow-up program might not have been enough time to detect the long-term effects of the PRF for NP management.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and
