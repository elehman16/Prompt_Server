In the Netherlands, 25,642 primary THAs were performed in 2013.

For the posterolateral surgical approach it has been suggested that patient restrictions might be unnecessary but the amount of available literature is scarce. As such, randomized controlled trials aimed at investigating restrictions following THA using a posterior approach are strongly recommended.</p><p>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to investigate the non-inferiority hypothesis concerning the early dislocation rate after THA in patients with and without the use of a reduced restriction protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>After providing informed consent a group of 456 patients with symptomatic coxarthrosis will be randomized to receive a THA either with care as usual, i.e. receiving postoperative restrictions including the advice to sleep in a supine position for the first 8&#x000a0;weeks postoperatively, or reduced restrictions with no recommendations regarding the position during sleeping. Primary outcome measure will be the percentage of early dislocations within the first 8&#x000a0;weeks after THA.

In the Netherlands, 25,642 primary THA implants were performed in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Postoperative hip dislocation is one of the major complications and has been reported in 0.5 to 10.6&#x000a0;% of patient after primary THA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Surgical technique and approach as well as implant selection, implant positioning, patient education and patient-related factors have an impact on the incidence of dislocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Traditionally, patient restrictions following THA are prescribed in order to prevent early dislocation by limiting the flexion of the hip (&#x0003c;90 degrees) as well as adduction and internal rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In modern orthopedic surgery, less invasive, tissue-sparing techniques have been introduced and patients are operated upon using shorter acting anesthetics. Nowadays, surgery duration is shorter and patients are being mobilized early after surgery. These factors possibly contribute to less loss of muscle strength after surgery, resulting in a more stable hip joint immediately postoperative. Postoperative joint stability is further enhanced by the use of larger diameter femoral head components. Patients are also better educated and managed with clinical pathways which include detailed protocols, thereby reducing the risk of an early dislocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the aspect of evidence-based application of restrictions after THA has attracted less attention, with long-standing protocols continuing to be routinely used in most hospitals.</p><p>Several studies have shown that no or reduced restriction protocols do not result in increased dislocation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, Talbot et al. have documented that patients had difficulties sleeping and felt discouraged during the time of restricted postoperative hip precautions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Likewise, faster return to normal activities, higher patient satisfaction and earlier return to work are the benefits that have been shown when using no or reduced restrictions following THA, making it a cost-effective and patient-friendly alternative to the restricted protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nowadays, most of the available knowledge on the effects of reduced postoperative precautions and restrictions after THA has been obtained utilizing an anterior surgical approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This might be explained by the fact that THA utilizing a posterior approach without repair of the posterior capsule and external rotators is associated with an increased risk for dislocation when compared to patients undergoing an anterior or anterolateral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, when conducting a posterior soft tissue repair this &#x0201c;increased&#x0201d; dislocation rate through the posterior approach is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As such, further research on applying a reduced restriction protocol in this group of patients is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge this will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigates use of a reduced restriction protocol following THA with use of a posterolateral surgical approach. Our hypothesis is that a reduced restriction protocol following THA with use of a posterolateral surgical approach has no influence on the early dislocation rate compared to a restricted protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study design is a single<bold><italic>-</italic></bold>center, parallel-group, stratified, randomized trial with a planned duration of 3&#x000a0;years in which 456 primary THA patients will be allocated to either a care-as-usual group receiving postoperative restrictions including the advice to sleep in a supine position for the first 8&#x000a0;weeks postoperatively or an experimental group, receiving postoperative instructions without restrictions on sleeping position after THA surgery. The experimental group does not use a pillow between the legs in any sleeping position and the care-as-usual group, that is only allowed to sleep in a supine position, is advised to use a pillow between the legs while doing so.</p><p>A non-inferiority design was chosen as a standard approach to assess similarity of results of the experimental as opposed to the care-as-usual treatment. In order to avoid an imbalance in treatment assignments and to reduce the opportunity for bias and confounders, a stratified blocked randomization technique will be applied with random sequences of varying block sizes (varying from <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 or <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6). Among the stratification factors are operating surgeon and the preferred self-reported sleeping position (supine, prone, on the side, combination/no clear preference) of the patient.

All THAs will be performed by one of OCON&#x02019;s four orthopedic surgeons specialized in hip surgery and with at least 5&#x000a0;years&#x02019; experience in THA. Time, duration and type of anesthesia will be recorded in our patient database. The surgical approach is standard posterolateral with use of a capsular repair. The soft-tissue tension is optimized through neck-length adjustments until an axial force with the leg in extension produces 1 to 2&#x000a0;mm of soft-tissue laxity for male patients and 2 to 3&#x000a0;mm of soft-tissue laxity for female patients.</p><p>During trial reduction, stability of the hip is tested in full flexion; 90 degrees of flexion and 45 degrees of internal rotation; full extension; 0 degrees of extension and 45 degrees of external rotation; and with and without knee flexion (up to 90 degrees). Such stability testing is routine in our practice and was not modified for the present study. The implants that will be used are: Exceed ABT Ringloc-XShell, Biomet Orthopedics, E-Poly Hi-Wall Liner Biomet Orthopedics, Modular Taperloc complete femoral stem Biomet Orthopedics, Biolox Delta Modular Ceramic Head 32&#x000a0;mm (Dordrecht, The Netherlands). The postoperative protocol is full weight bearing to tolerance from day 1.</p><p>The first radiologic assessment, to control prosthetic positioning occurs on the day of the operation, with an anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view of the hip. The second radiographic assessment is at 8&#x000a0;weeks postoperative with an AP pelvic view and a lateral view of the hip. Implant position including cup inclination angle, acetabular component anteversion, hip offset, and leg length will be measured on the 8&#x000a0;weeks postoperative AP pelvic view. The target zones for anteversion and inclination are defined as 10&#x02013;30 degrees and 30&#x02013;50 degrees, respectively.</p><p>The local Medical Ethical Committee approves the study design, procedures, protocols and informed consent.

The physiotherapist will mobilize patients on the day of the operation or the first postoperative day. During this mobilization patients are instructed how turn in bed and how to prevent more than 90 degrees of hip flexion and 45 degrees of rotation. The only difference in instruction between the two study arms is the sleeping position. When discharged to home or nursing home, patients receive a booklet describing the instructions relevant to the study arm they are assigned to. This booklet serves as an enchiridion for partners, physiotherapists, and other persons involved in the care of the patient. In addition, patients are handed a standardized diary booklet in which they are asked to document their sleeping position, exercise activities, experience of pain and any further comments they may want to convey. Patient will visit the outpatient clinic preoperatively and then at 8 postoperative weeks. Routine physical examination will be performed by the orthopedic surgeon. All scores and measurements will be recorded by the nurse practitioner who will also collect the diary booklet from the patients. Preoperative functional assessment will be done by pain severity (Visual Analogue Scale: range 0&#x02013;10), hip function (Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and quality of life (EQ-5D). At 8&#x000a0;weeks follow-up the same functional assessment will be recorded by the nurse practitioner. This visit is combined with the regular postoperative control by the orthopedic surgeon. At 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months there will be follow-up questionnaires by Email, paper or telephone depending upon the availability of the patients&#x02019; Email addresses. The primary outcome: dislocations within the first 8&#x000a0;weeks, will be recorded in the patient&#x02019;s file when visiting the emergency department.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The maximum allowable difference in proportion in which there is still equality in the effect is not known in the literature. Previous studies suggested &#x0201c;a threefold difference in dislocation rate&#x0201d; to be a clinically relevant difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since the literature is suggesting an average dislocation rate of 2.03&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in the posterolateral surgical approach, a dislocation percentage between 2.03 and 6.09&#x000a0;% is considered to be &#x0201c;equal.&#x0201d; Hence, the planned sample size is <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;456 THA patients.

This margin corresponds to the definition of clinically relevant difference in dislocation rate by Peak et al.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>The secondary analysis</title><p>A repeated measure analysis of (co)variance (ANOVA; group and time) will be applied in order to investigate differences between the groups satisfaction, functional recovery (HOOS) and quality of life (EQ-5D) at 8&#x000a0;weeks, 6&#x000a0;months, 1 and 2&#x000a0;years postoperatively. In addition, correlation coefficients will be calculated between quality of sleep and functional recovery and quality of life. ANCOVA will be conducted dependent upon the analysis of differences in baseline characteristics between groups (e.g. preoperative values, age, radiographic analysis).

However, the scientific rationale for the effectiveness of these postoperative restrictions in the prevention of early dislocations is limited. Moreover, there are indications that applying a reduced restriction protocol has several benefits. In a prospective, randomized study, with use of an anterolateral surgical approach, Peak et al. reported that patients were much more satisfied when they were given fewer restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, these patients achieved a faster return to daily functions and were able to return to work faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, sleep was positively affected by the reduced precautions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ververeli et al. demonstrated that reduced hip precautions can facilitate recovery and are more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Today the available knowledge is mainly directed at analyzing the anterior or anterolateral surgical approach. However, there are two cohort studies that have investigated the effectiveness of a reduced restriction protocol in primary THA following a posterolateral instead of an anterolateral approach but these studies lack a randomization procedure. For example, Mikkelson et al. found no difference in dislocation rate comparing two cohorts with and without restrictive motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study did not show any beneficial effect of rehabilitation without movement restrictions on patient evaluated function. Schmidt-Braekling et al. showed, in a retrospective analysis, that shortening standard posterior hip precautions from 6 to 4&#x000a0;weeks after primary THA utilizing a posterior approach does not increase the risk for postoperative dislocation within the first year after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we will compare two postoperative protocols that differ in the restriction of sleeping position following THA via the posterolateral surgical approach. Based on the study of Talbot et al., who found that patients had difficulties sleeping following a restricted protocol, our intervention group will not be restricted to sleep in a supine position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In previous studies only the duration of the restrictions was shorted or the reduced restriction protocol was directed towards movement restrictions and use of assistive devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another interestingly aspect of the current study compared to the existing literature is that fact that it incorporates an analysis of the patient self-reported compliance to postoperative restrictions. Our study plans to assess patient compliance to the sleeping position instructions in relation to their preferred sleeping position.</p><p>In summary, the aim of this RCT is to show that a reduced restriction protocol following THA with use of a posterolateral surgical approach has no influence on the early dislocation rate. By omitting the postoperative sleeping restriction patients might have a better quality of sleep, higher patient satisfaction and a faster functional recovery.
