The non-inferiority, immunogenicity, and safety of a cell culture-based investigational QIVc and 2 TIVs (TIV1c, TIV2c), in adults (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;y), were evaluated in this Phase III, double-blind, multicenter study. A total of 2680 age-stratified subjects were randomized (2:1:1) to receive 1 dose of QIVc (n = 1335), TIV1c (n = 676), or TIV2c (n = 669). TIV1c (B/Yamagata) and TIV2c (B/Victoria) differed only in B strain lineage. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the hemagglutinin-inhibition antibody responses of QIVc against TIVc, 22 d post-vaccination. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of immunogenicity of QIVc and TIVc in younger (&#x02265;18 &#x02013; &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;y) and older (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;y) adults. Hemagglutinin inhibition assays were performed at days 1 and 22. Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) were monitored for 7 d post-vaccination, and unsolicited AEs and serious AEs until day 181. QIVc met the non-inferiority criteria for all 4 vaccine strains and demonstrated superiority for both influenza B strains over the unmatched B strain included in the TIV1c and TIV2c, when geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates with TIVc were compared at day 22. Between 48%&#x02013;52% of subjects experienced &#x02265;1 solicited AE, the most common being injection-site pain and headache. Serious AEs were reported by &#x02264;1% of subjects, none were vaccine-related. The results indicate that QIVc is immunogenic and well tolerated in both younger and older adults. The immunogenicity and safety profiles of QIVc and TIVc were comparable at all ages evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>adults</kwd><kwd>B-strain</kwd><kwd>cell culture</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>non-inferior</kwd><kwd>phase III trial</kwd><kwd>quadrivalent influenza vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses undergo frequent genetic mutations (antigenic drifts) that result in accumulating changes in the viral hemagglutin (HA) surface protein, giving rise to antigenically new strains which enable the virus to cause repetitive outbreaks.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Consequently, seasonal influenza vaccines have to be reformulated annually to replace current strains with those that are most likely to circulate in the coming influenza season.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) contain strains of 2 subtypes of influenza A: A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, and a single type B influenza strain.</p><p>There are 2 distinct phylogenetic lineages of influenza B virus, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, whose strains cause human infection.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> There have been several instances, particularly in the past decade, where a lineage-level mismatch between the circulating and the recommended vaccine B strains occurred, thereby reducing the effectiveness of TIV.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3-7</sup></xref> Increasingly, strains of both B lineages have been co-dominantly circulating in the same season.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3,6,7</sup></xref> In a Finnish study spanning 12 influenza seasons (1999&#x02013;2012), approximately 42% of the influenza B infections were found to have been caused by the virus strain of opposite lineage than the virus included in the vaccine.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV), which incorporate strains from both influenza B lineages, are developed to overcome the risk of selecting the incorrect B lineage for the vaccine composition and to improve the immunity of individuals against both lineages.

Another limitation, related to the safety analyses, is that no formal statistical comparisons between the 2 vaccine groups were performed. The study was neither powered to capture nor compare rare AEs following vaccination. The randomized, double-blind, multicenter design of the study aimed to control for confounding environmental factors, such as possible effects of local influenza outbreaks on the subject's antibody responses. Because the study enrolled its first participants in November 2013, it captured all local influenza outbreaks between December 2013 and January 2014.

The addition of the second influenza B strain in the vaccine did not interfere with the immune responses to the other 3 influenza strains. QIVc demonstrated an acceptable AE profile during the 6 mo follow-up.
