Unlike most other body sites, it is characterized by a low diversity and uniform colonization by one of several species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp.. Five to eight community state types (CSTs) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The two most common ones are dominated by <italic>L. crispatus</italic> and <italic>L. iners</italic>, but CSTs dominated by <italic>L. gasseri</italic> and <italic>L. jensenii</italic>, and those dominated by <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and other anaerobic bacteria have also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Together with a low pH (&#x0003c;&#x02009;4.5) and a low Nugent score (0 to 3), these CSTs are characteristics of a healthy vagina, which is clinically characterized by white, normally smelling secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Variation of the microbial community can be high within individuals and vary throughout the menstrual cycle, but the CST is usually stable in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal syndrome in women of childbearing age, with a prevalence of 30% in Caucasian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which are the majority of study participants analyzed here. This prevalence is based on the presence of abnormal microbial flora and can be asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. BV is associated with a higher risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, as well as miscarriage and preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, BV has a 60% rate of recurrence in the 12&#x000a0;months after treatment with the standard of care antibiotic metronidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In BV, the community shifts to a highly diverse flora, concurrent with an increase in pH and a rise of Nugent score to &#x0003e;&#x02009;6. The clinical expression of BV is gray-white, discharge with fishy odor due to elevated pH values. Taxa such as <italic>Gardnerella</italic>, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>, <italic>Mobiluncus</italic>, <italic>Sneathia</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, and BV-associated bacterium 1 (BVAB1) to BVAB3 of the order <italic>Clostridiales</italic> become abundant. Three CSTs dominated by <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, and <italic>Sneathia sanguinegens</italic>, respectively, have been identified in BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another characteristic of BV is the presence of a thick multispecies biofilm on vaginal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such cells are named &#x0201c;clue cells&#x0201d; because they serve as one out of the four diagnostic &#x0201c;Amsel&#x0201d; criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Biofilms consist of adherent bacteria and the extracellular polymeric matrix they produce. This matrix inhibits biofilm elimination by the immune system and may prevent full destruction of the biofilm in bacterial vaginosis by antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been shown that the biofilm is comprised mainly of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> and persists on epithelial cells after treatment with antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The pathogenicity of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> biofilms is demonstrated by their ability to adhere to epithelial cells even in the presence of <italic>L. crispatus</italic> and that they benefit from the addition of BV-related secondary colonizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> biofilms tolerate higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid compared to planktonic cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The high rate of BV recurrence may thus be explained by the presence of a biofilm protecting the bacteria from antibiotic treatment, moreover, serving as a reservoir for regrowth of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Antibiotics (metronidazole or clindamycin) are the treatment of choice against BV and have high initial cure rates in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Alternative strategies, including antiseptics, disinfectants, and vaccines, have been tested, but evidence regarding their effectiveness is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Vaginal oral probiotics with or without prebiotics or concomitant antibiotics, and acidifying agents have also been explored as adjuvants after therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, up to 50% decrease of recurrences seems to be possible, but novel approaches to prevent recurrence are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To attack biofilms of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and thus potentially prevent recurrence, we have screened a variety of compounds and found that amphoteric tensides such as cocoamphopropionate, administered alone or in combination with metronidazole, were very effective in disrupting <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> biofilms in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Here, we report a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial which investigated the tolerability of cocoamphopropionate administered as a pessary after initial metronidazole treatment of BV. Moreover, we compared the effectiveness of cocoamphopropionate versus commercially available lactic acid pessaries against BV recurrence. The vaginal microbiota, clinical parameters, and biofilm characteristics were analyzed for a period of 3&#x000a0;months. A cohort of 20 women recruited independently of the clinical study served as control for the healthy vaginal flora. We compared the microbiota composition in woman with and without biofilms and identified biomarkers for the presence of biofilms in BV. The influence of metronidazole and pessaries on microbial communities was investigated. The time series of five consecutive visits allowed us to analyze in detail which clinical parameters and microbiota characteristics might affect recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">We performed a prospective parallel-design, double-blind, randomized, controlled investigation. The vaginal pessary WO 3191 (certified medical device) was compared to lactic acid pessaries (certified medical device, Dr. August Wolff GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG Arzneimittel, Germany) with respect to safety, tolerability, and efficacy following treatment of BV with metronidazole. Vaginal fluid and urine samples were obtained from all subjects in the clinical trial and from a cohort of healthy women that served as a control for the healthy vaginal microbiota. WO 3191 pessaries contained the amphoteric tenside cocoamphopropionate and, like lactic acid pessaries (LAP), contained lactic acid and sodium lactate. As both products looked similar, they could be assigned randomly in a blinded manner. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (Bayerische Landes&#x000e4;rtzekammer, M&#x000fc;nchen), and written consent was obtained from all participants. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. Principles and guidelines for good clinical practice were followed. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02687789 and in the Eudramed database with the identifier CIV-13-12-011731.

Study participants received 2&#x000a0;g of metronidazole (single dose) orally (visit 1). At visit 2 after 7 to 28&#x000a0;days, they were randomly assigned to receive either WO 3191 or LAP. Each pessary was applied intravaginally by the study participants for 3&#x000a0;weeks, twice per week. An intermediate examination took place after 1&#x000a0;week (visit 3) and the final examination after another 2&#x000a0;weeks (visit 4). A follow-up examination (visit 5) was scheduled 12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;weeks after visit 4. Of the 44 included women, 34 completed the trial. The first database lock was performed after the last patient had completed visit 4, meaning that data entries and data management had to be performed before the database lock and unblinding of the data. One woman received metronidazole at visit 2 and was therefore excluded from the analysis. At each visit, vaginal fluid and urine were collected for the analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), biofilms, and microbiota composition and clinical symptoms were determined. Vaginal fluid of 20 healthy women was sampled independent of this clinical study as part of their gynecological routine examination and served as control group. These women provided informed consent and were not tested for biofilms, EPS in urine, or Nugent score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessment of biofilm in urine and vaginal samples</title><p id="Par12">The method for EPS detection in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was modified for quantitative measurements of EPS with an enzyme-linked lectin assay using peroxidase-coupled lectins.

It occurred in four out of the five patients that did not respond to metronidazole therapy (based on NS), but also occurred in those six women that had initially responded.

The presence of a biofilm was no indicator for recurrence. Women with or without biofilm showed recurrence of BV. PCO before recurrence could not separate recurrence/no recurrence, and LEfSe biomarker analyses did not produce conclusive results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S8B,C). However, women who developed BV at visit 4 or later (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) had a higher diversity at visit 3 (H&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.69) than those who remained healthy (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26, H&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.77), and this difference was significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). Recurrence rates for the clinical population were slightly lower due to a different population set.

We further determined whether WO 3191 would be superior to LAP for reducing biofilm-mediated recurrence of BV after metronidazole treatment. Eighty-six percent of all screened women with BV were biofilm positive in our study as was previously found in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment with metronidazole resulted in reduction of this biofilm in 67% of women of which most stayed biofilm undetected until follow-up at visit 5. This is in contrast to a study by Swidsinski et al. (2008) which demonstrated that biofilms were indeed first apparently eliminated, but restored frequently after treatment with metronidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This discrepancy may have been caused by the threshold for the presence of biofilms which was used here. We considered only those samples biofilm positive in which a minimum of 20% of epithelial cells were covered by a layer of bacteria whereas Swidsinski et al. did not set a cutoff for their observations.</p><p id="Par46">Recent in vitro data from our group showed that amphoteric tensides are able to disrupt biofilms and their surrounding EPS. Although in the present clinical study only a small number of patients was available we found that there was a significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding the impact on &#x0201c;biofilm EPS&#x0201d; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). However, clinical parameters did not reflect the difference of this parameter. However, none of the treatments prevented or noticeably postponed recurrence of BV. This is most likely due to BV being such a multifactorial disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To prevent recurrence, therefore, a combination of several means should be used. For example, probiotics may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It could be worthwhile to explore the combination of WO 3191 or LAP with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> probiotics as strategy against BV recurrence. However, sexually transmitted BV through unprotected intercourse should also be considered in finding strategies for the prevention of recurrent BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">In our study, we have compared the microbiota of healthy women to the microbiota of women with acute BV and found <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> as biomarker for BV. Interestingly, when the BV group was divided into those women with (14%) and without a biofilm (86%), <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> was identified as a biomarker for biofilm absence. Therefore, women with BV were colonized by <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>; however, women with biofilm presence had significantly less <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>. This is in contrast to studies who showed that <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> is an abundant component of biofilms in BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, these studies specifically targeted <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> with FISH probes, and although they have found other species, too, they did not detect <italic>Sneathia</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> and most of the relevant <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> which, as our study suggests, may be even more common than <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> in BV-related biofilms. Furthermore, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> has a strong strain variation and not all <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> isolates form biofilms to the same degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, the structure of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> populations is diverse and presumably can consist of biofilm-formers, non-formers, or a mixture of the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, a limitation to our study is the selection of the 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 region for sequencing which has been shown to underrepresent <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">
<italic>S. amnii</italic> was identified as most important biomarker for acute BV, and <italic>S. sanguinegens</italic> could be identified as biomarker for biofilm presence in acute BV. Little is currently known about the genus <italic>Sneathia</italic>. It was described as a new genus when <italic>Leptotrichia sanguinegens</italic> was renamed to <italic>S. sanguinegens</italic> after having been isolated from human blood and amniotic fluid in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In 2012, <italic>S. amnii</italic> was discovered in the vaginal tract as part of the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Its biochemical characteristics were assessed and several potential virulence factors that may be relevant in BV, such as the adherence to epithelial cells, were described. Later, several studies associated <italic>Sneathia</italic> sp. with BV using molecular techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. <italic>S. sanguinegens</italic> was frequently identified in amniotic fluid and is associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis and preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Like <italic>A. vaginae</italic> and other BV-related species, <italic>S. sanguinegens</italic> is also associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Overall, our study suggests a high relevance of the genus <italic>Sneathia</italic> in BV.</p><p id="Par49">Our microbiota analysis showed that the vaginal fluid microbiota of healthy women is characterized by a very low diversity and three different CSTs which are dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp.. The most common <italic>L. crispatus</italic> CST was followed by the <italic>L. iners</italic> and <italic>L. gasseri</italic> CSTs, in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. By contrast, BV microbiota were characterized by high diversity with <italic>L. iners</italic>, <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, <italic>S. amnii</italic>, and <italic>P. amnii</italic> as the most abundant species. In accordance with these results, Dols et al. suggested to diagnose BV by a combination of the absence of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp<italic>.</italic> and a high diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, solutions for a molecular-based BV diagnosis are so far ambiguous. Two studies found that inclusion of Lactobacillus testing did not improve accuracy for BV diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and other studies found only BV associated species to be indicative for the emergence of BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">After treatment with the antibiotic, patients exhibited low diversity <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> dominated vaginal microbiota; however, the <italic>L. iners</italic> CST was found in most women rather than the <italic>L. crispatus</italic> CST which dominated in the healthy control group. Since we could not analyze the healthy vaginal microbiota of those women that later developed BV, we cannot exclude that this CST dominated in our study cohort already before antibiotic treatment. However, it is more likely that treatment with metronidazole encouraged <italic>L. iners</italic> colonization more than other <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species. It concurs with findings that <italic>L. iners</italic> and <italic>L. crispatus</italic> are negatively correlated in the vaginal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The ambiguous role of <italic>L. iners</italic> has been widely discussed and it is believed that <italic>L. crispatus</italic> is protective for BV whereas <italic>L. iners</italic> may not be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. <italic>L. iners</italic> adapts its expression profile in dysbiosis. Therefore, it has less stress than <italic>L. crispatus</italic> when it comes to fighting the colonization of BV-associated anaerobic species which makes <italic>L. iners</italic> colonization a predisposing factor for BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A study investigating women before and after acute BV may shed light into the question where the abundance of <italic>L. iners</italic> after metronidazole treatment originates.</p><p id="Par51">The BV recurrence rate of 28% observed in our study group for microbiota analysis and about 20% regarding the clinical population is smaller than that found in another study, which was up to 60% over a period of 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Women were treated with pH-adapted pessaries (pH&#x000a0;4.5) containing either an amphoteric tenside or lactic acid, after metronidazole therapy, which could be an influencing factor. A placebo or an untreated control group was not included in the study and therefore could not be used for direct comparison. Since our study covered a period of 4 months, we may also be in line with published recurrence rates that rely on longer periods of time. It is noteworthy to mention that our study only included women with true BV infection. This was assured by strict inclusion criteria to select for the presence of biofilms. In other studies, weaker inclusion criteria might have led to inclusion of patients with transient or mild BV forms, when comparing recurrence rates this fact also should be considered. Nevertheless, our follow-up period ended approximately 3&#x000a0;months after metronidazole treatment. Because our data show an increase in microbial diversity and a decrease in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp. colonization until visit 5, the recurrence rate within the following months is likely to have increased. Recurrence of BV occurred in woman harboring the <italic>L. iners</italic> CST as well as in those with the <italic>L. crispatus</italic> CST. Moreover, recurrence rates were equally high in women treated with LAP or WO 3191 pessary, and no particular species could be associated with recurrence. However, more women with higher microbial diversity at visit 3 developed recurrence than women with lower diversity, suggesting that a diverse CST can predispose to recurrence of BV. However, due to the complex etiology of BV many other parameters might play a role, e.g., host characteristics, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> phages, sexual activity, or smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Stabilizing the low diversity of the healthy vaginal microbiota seems to be the most promising approach in order to prevent recurrence of BV. This could be achieved by a combination of various measures, including dissolving the biofilm, stabilizing the vaginal pH, applying compounds that promote growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp<italic>.</italic>, and providing live probiotics, e.g., strains of <italic>L. crispatus</italic>. For women that are colonized by an unstable but healthy vaginal community, this may prevent tipping the balance towards BV in response to external factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">This study indicates that <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> was not the main pathogen in bacterial vaginosis biofilms.
