Previous studies have found increased uptake of prenatal HIV testing with abbreviated pre-test counseling, however little is known about patient decision making, testing satisfaction and knowledge in this setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Findings</title><p>A randomized-controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted from October 2006 through February 2008 at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), the public teaching hospital of the City and County of San Francisco. A total of 278 English- and Spanish-speaking pregnant women were randomized to receive either abbreviated or standard nurse-performed HIV test counseling at the initial prenatal visit. Patient decision making experience was compared between abbreviated versus standard HIV counseling strategies among a sample of low-income, urban, ethnically diverse prenatal patients. The primary outcome was the decisional conflict score (DCS) using O'Connor low-literacy scale and secondary outcomes included satisfaction with test decision, basic HIV knowledge and HIV testing uptake. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of 278 women &#x02013; 134 (48.2&#x00025;) in the abbreviated arm (AA) and 144 (51.8&#x00025;) in the standard arm (SA). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women with low decisional conflict (71.6&#x00025; in AA vs. 76.4&#x00025; in SA, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.37), and the observed mean difference between the groups of 3.88 (95&#x00025; CI: &#x02212;0.65, 8.41) did not exceed the non-inferiority margin. HIV testing uptake was very high (97. 8&#x00025;) and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (99.3&#x00025; in AA vs. 96.5&#x00025; in SA, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.12). Likewise, there was no difference in satisfaction with testing decision (97.8&#x00025; in AA vs. 99.3&#x00025; in SA, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.36). However, women in AA had significantly lower mean HIV knowledge scores (78.4&#x00025;) compared to women in SA (83.7&#x00025;, p&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study suggests that streamlining the pre-test counseling process, while associated with slightly lower knowledge, does not compromise patient decision making or satisfaction regarding HIV testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00503308">NCT00503308</ext-link>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Preventive Services Task Force and Institute of Medicine (IOM) have published strong recommendations for universal HIV-antibody testing of pregnant women. <xref rid="pone.0005166-2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005166-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> A recent meta-analysis also demonstrated strong evidence supporting routine prenatal HIV testing. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>
</p><p>There are currently two common testing strategies. In an opt-out approach, all women are informed of the inclusion of HIV testing in the standard battery of prenatal labs and may decline such testing. On the other hand, standard, opt-in strategies use more traditional voluntary HIV counseling and testing techniques, which typically include pre-test counseling and/or risk assessment. In a recent CDC retrospective analysis, prenatal HIV testing uptake differed widely according to testing strategy used in various regions in the United States and Canada.<xref rid="pone.0005166-3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Prenatal HIV testing was most common in areas with an opt-out approach, with up to 98&#x00025; of pregnant women testing. In regions using an opt-in approach, testing frequencies were as low as 25&#x00025;. In September 2006, the CDC published revised recommendations for HIV testing in US healthcare settings. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Branson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> In addition to recommending routine, opt-out prenatal HIV screening, the authors advocated streamlined consenting with removal of requirements for prevention counseling as part of screening and diagnostic HIV testing procedures. While there are population-based studies and other observational studies using historical controls <xref rid="pone.0005166-Stringer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> supporting routine, opt-out HIV test counseling, little is known about patient decision making, testing satisfaction and subsequent HIV knowledge with abbreviated counseling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005166.s003">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005166.s004">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California San Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital. All patients provided written informed consent for the data collection and subsequent analysis.</p><p>This was a randomized-controlled, non-inferiority trial evaluating decisional conflict, HIV knowledge and testing uptake associated with two HIV testing strategies among English and Spanish-speaking pregnant women. The strategies included nurse-performed, standard HIV pre-test counseling (control arm) and abbreviated, pre-test counseling (study arm). The standardized HIV pre-test counseling and consent process took approximately 2&#x02013;5 minutes and reviewed the definition of HIV, modes of transmission and prevention, interpretation of test results and the benefits of testing. The intervention arm used a 2-sentence script which lasted approximately 30 seconds. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005166.s001">Appendix S1</xref>. We hypothesized that decisional conflict and testing uptake would not differ significantly among women in the abbreviated study arm and standard control arm.</p><p>Eligible participants included English and Spanish -speaking women aged 16 or older initiating prenatal care at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) between October 3, 2006 and September 24, 2007. Women were considered ineligible if they were unable to give informed consent, known to be infected with HIV at initiation of prenatal care, or obtained an HIV test during the index pregnancy prior to initiation of prenatal care at SFGH.</p><p>Research staff approached eligible women in the clinic immediately before their initial appointment at the SFGH Women's Health Center. Study staff recruited and obtained written informed consent from all participants and the UCSF Committee on Human Research approved this study. Enrolled participants were randomized to either the standard or abbreviated pre-test counseling strategy. At the onset of the prenatal appointment, the intake nurse gave all pregnant women, regardless of study enrollment, a low-literacy HIV educational brochure to be read at a later time. During the appointment, the nurse administered either the standard or abbreviated HIV pre-test counseling script, documented the woman's decision to take or not take the HIV test and obtained written test consent or refusal from the woman as per California state law at the time of the study. Immediately following the appointment, blinded, bilingual study staff administered a structured questionnaire to each participant. The questionnaire included the 10-item O'Connor Low-Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a 9-item instrument assessing basic HIV knowledge (including HIV as the cause of AIDS, perinatal and non-perinatal modes of transmission, whether people with HIV always look and feel sick and whether there is a cure for HIV), a scale assessing perceived risk of being HIV positive, reasons for testing or not testing and satisfaction with information received and the decision-making process. <xref rid="pone.0005166-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005166-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>
</p><p>The O'Connor DCS was used in order to assess the level of certainty and satisfaction with the patient's decision to undergo or not undergo HIV testing upon having received the nurse-performed abbreviated or standard pre-test counseling. The scale evaluates the extent to which patients feel informed about a medical decision, whether the patients' assessment of the relative risks and benefits of each decision are consistent with their values, whether patients have enough support and advice to make a decision without pressure from others, and the certainty about the decision. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005166-t001">Table 1</xref>. Upon the patients' return for the follow-up clinician visit, typically within 2&#x02013;4 weeks, blinded study staff administered a second survey following HIV test result disclosure by the medical provider. The second survey included items adapted from Simpson et al. and evaluated overall satisfaction with the consent and results disclosure process as well as the decision to undergo HIV testing. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005166.s002">Appendix S2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005166-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005166.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>O'Connor Low-Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale <xref rid="pone.0005166-Altman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>

We calculated a knowledge score as the percentage of correct answers on the 9-item knowledge scale. We measured the uptake of testing as a proportion of those in each arm who underwent HIV testing. For binary variables, we compared proportions between the 2 groups using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact Test. For continuous variables, we assessed for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and used the Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test or Student's T-test as appropriate. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To assess non-inferiority with respect to the decisional conflict score, we used a one-sided two group t-test of equivalence in means with equal variances with an equivalence limit difference of 5.625. We then evaluated DCS scores and knowledge scores, stratifying by ethnicity, age, primary language spoken and whether the woman had undergone HIV testing in the past. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis using CONSORT guidelines, including recommendations on reporting of non-inferiority randomized trials. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Altman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005166-Piaggio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Our sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome, decisional conflict score. Because this was a non-inferiority trial, the trial was designed to be able to exclude an actual difference between the abbreviated and standard counseling arms of greater than 5.625 (the non-inferiority margin) with respect to the mean decisional conflict score (DCS) in each group. To calculate our sample size we selected a non-inferiority margin of 5.625 based on investigator judgment of a likely clinically significant difference in DCS. We used a type-I error rate (alpha) of 0.05 with an 80&#x00025; power, a common standard deviation of 18.75 for the DCS obtained from pilot testing of the DCS instrument, and a one-sided two group t-test of equivalence in means (equal n's) to arrive at 139 patients in each arm for a total of 278 participants. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005166-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>

The overall high scores were notable and reassuring given the ethnic diversity and low literacy of our clinic population. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Kuppermann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005166-Kuppermann2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> The difference in knowledge scores was driven primarily by women in the abbreviated arm being less likely to know that HIV-infected pregnant women can take medication to decrease the risk of perinatal HIV transmission. As more institutions and prenatal practices institute the CDC recommended abbreviated HIV pre-test counseling, our data identify gaps in knowledge among low-income, ethnically-diverse pregnant patients and may assist in guiding population-level campaigns that will likely replace the one-on-one pre-test counseling session as a source of patient education.</p><p>While we attempted to minimize bias with the use of blinded study staff, standardized protocols and validated instruments, our study had limitations. As with most surveys assessing patient satisfaction and perceptions, participants may have been biased towards reporting positive attitudes towards testing and limited decisional conflict, despite reassurances about confidentiality of responses and the use of blinded study staff. The slight, though statistically insignificant, higher mean decisional conflict score seen among women in the abbreviated arm suggest that responses may indeed have been truthful. While we did not monitor in real time the nurses administering the standard and abbreviated counseling scripts, we utilized standardized protocols and scripts and trained the nurses during study implementation and conducted on-going education to the nurses about study protocols. Nonetheless, there may have been deviations from the assigned consenting script that went unnoticed. Moreover, efforts to optimize the uptake of prenatal HIV testing in this clinical setting were instituted prior to initiation of this study even with the use of more traditional standard pre-test counseling by nurses as we have reported elsewhere. <xref rid="pone.0005166-Cohan1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> Given the very high acceptance of prenatal HIV testing under non-study conditions at our clinic, our results may not be generalizable to other clinical settings with lower baseline uptake of HIV testing. Similarly, our results may not be generalizable to areas with less developed HIV educational and public health campaigns as compared to San Francisco. Lastly, participants were, by definition, willing to give additional time and effort to participate in this research. As such, participants may have differed in significant and clinically relevant ways from non-participants. In particular, participants may have been more agreeable to health interventions as compared to non-participants and, thus, may have biased the data toward increased satisfaction and minimized the differences between the 2 arms of the study. This bias may also limit the generalizability of our results to populations of pregnant women who would not otherwise participate in research. While selection bias may limit the generalizability of our results, study participation was very high &#x02013; only 14.5&#x00025; of women approached for enrollment refused to participate.</p><p>Despite these potential limitations, this study adds to the growing body of literature evaluating best practices in integrating routine HIV testing into medical settings. While there were no differences seen in testing uptake in our study, this streamlined approach to pretest consenting would likely facilitate the systematic implementation the CDC guidelines recommending universal HIV testing of pregnant women. As such, abbreviated HIV testing strategies may be associated with increased HIV testing uptake on a population level without jeopardizing patients' decision-making process. There are numerous states in the U.S. that still require detailed pre-test counseling and consenting prior to prenatal HIV testing. <xref rid="pone.0005166-National1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> These data support the elimination of such requirements and should bolster legislative efforts to update HIV testing laws aimed at decreasing the burden on health-care providers and reducing overall barriers to HIV testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005166.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005166.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005166.s002"><label>Appendix S2</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005166.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005166.s003"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005166.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005166.s004"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005166.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the women who participated in this study, the nurses at Women's Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital, Teri Dowling, Julie French, Natalia Leva, Melisa Shah, Cynthia Feakins, Dr. Natali Aziz, Arlette Molina, Abby Sokoloff, Dr. Miriam Kuppermann and Dr. Rebecca Jackson.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Investigator-initiated research grant NIH-K23DA016174.
