advances in reperfusion therapies have reduced early mortality from acute myocardial infarction, heart failure remains a common complication, and may develop very early or long after the acute event. Reperfusion itself leads to further tissue damage, a process described as ischaemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI), which contributes up to 50% of the final infarct size. In experimental models nitrite administration potently protects against IRI in several organs, including the heart. In the current study we investigate whether intravenous sodium nitrite administration immediately prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction will reduce myocardial infarct size. This is a phase II, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and multicentre trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and outcomes</title><p>The aim of this trial is to determine whether a 5 minute systemic injection of sodium nitrite, administered immediately before opening of the infarct related artery, results in significant reduction of IRI in patients with first acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI). The primary clinical end point is the difference in infarct size between sodium nitrite and placebo groups measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed at 6&#x02013;8 days following the AMI and corrected for area at risk (AAR) using the endocardial surface area technique. Secondary end points include (i) plasma creatine kinase and Troponin I measured in blood samples taken pre-injection of the study medication and over the following 72 hours; (ii) infarct size at six months; (iii) Infarct size corrected for AAR measured at 6&#x02013;8 days using T2 weighted triple inversion recovery (T2-W SPAIR or STIR) CMR imaging; (iv) Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction measured by CMR at 6&#x02013;8 days and six months following injection of the study medication; and (v) LV end systolic volume index at 6&#x02013;8 days and six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding, ethics and regulatory approvals</title><p>This study is funded by a grant from the UK Medical Research Council.

Whilst advances in reperfusion therapies such as primary percutaneous coronary angiography (PPCI) have reduced early mortality from AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] morbidity, most commonly resulting from heart failure, which may occur early or long after the MI, remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Paradoxically, the act of reperfusion leads to further tissue damage, a process described as ischaemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI) which can account for up to 50% of the final infarct size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Given that infarct size is determined not only by ischaemia but also by IRI, targeting the latter offers the potential to limit myocardial injury and reduce mortality and morbidity.</p><sec><title>Ischaemia reperfusion injury and conditioning</title><p>Following reperfusion of an occluded artery, a cascade of events leads ultimately to the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore (MTP) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Factors promoting opening of the MTP include an increase in intracellular calcium that occurs during ischaemia and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and toxic aldehydes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The opening of the MTP leads to irreversible cell death. This results from both acute energetic impairment (due to loss of the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane that drives ATP synthesis) and release of the mitochondrial contents into the cytosol, including cytochrome C, which activates pro-apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Crucially, the opening of the MTP does not occur until approximately two to three minutes after reperfusion. This is because the low pH that is present during ischaemia inhibits its opening, and it is not until the pH starts to recover following reperfusion that the raised calcium and ROS induce opening of the MTP.</p><p>In 1986 Murry and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] made the seminal observation that brief repeated episodes of myocardial ischaemia reduced the magnitude of myocardial injury caused by a subsequent prolonged episode of coronary occlusion, a phenomenon they termed ischaemic preconditioning and which has since been reproduced in well over 1000 papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several endogenous conditioning pathways confer cardio-protection against IRI including the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase Pathway (RISK). Ultimately these act by inhibiting the opening of the MTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A corollary of the fact that MTP opening is delayed by some minutes after reperfusion is the potential to reduce IRI by interventions delivered either during ischaemia (perconditioning) or at the time of reperfusion (postconditioning). Thus, graded opening of an occluded coronary artery reduces IRI (direct postconditioning). Subsequent studies have shown that brief periods of ischaemia in other organs confer similar protection to the myocardium, a phenomenon called <italic>remote</italic> ischemic myocardial conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. &#x02018;Ischaemic conditioning&#x02019; may be replicated by using several pharmacological stimuli, e.g. opiates, cyclosporine, erythropoietin, H/Na exchange inhibitors and nitric oxide donors. Both ischaemic and pharmacological cardiac pre-conditioning are mediated at least in large part via the RISK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>There is extensive literature on successful pre, per and post conditioning interventions in animal models of AMI, which have resulted in reduction in final infarct size by up to 50%. Unfortunately, in spite of these very promising results in animal models, translation into benefit in human studies has been inconsistent. There may be several reasons for the poor translation into humans: (i) patients have multiple comorbidities that may make the heart more resistant to conditioning (e.g. age, hypertension and diabetes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; (ii) prompt reperfusion with PPCI may minimise the potential benefit from conditioning strategies. Indeed, there is evidence from some of the human intervention studies that the benefit is largely confined to patients with larger infarcts, particularly those associated with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; (iii) it is known that spontaneous opening and closing of the occluded coronary artery (intermittency) is common in acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], potentially replicating direct post conditioning and in this context any additional conditioning intervention may have limited therapeutic impact.</p><p>Nevertheless positive studies in humans have been reported. Remote (forearm) ischaemic perconditioning in acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) (administered in the ambulance <italic>en route</italic> to hospital for PPCI) resulted in a reduction in IRI &#x02013; expressed as an increase in myocardial salvage compared to a placebo intervention. Although this did not translate into a significant reduction in infarct size for the whole group, a reduced infarct size was seen in the subgroup of patients with left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pharmacological postconditioning using cyclosporine administered prior to PPCI in acute STEMI was reported to decrease the area under the curve for the biomarkers creatine kinase (CK) and Troponin (the primary end point) and a reduction in infarct size (assessed by gadolinium late enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed at five days) was reported in a subgroup of 27 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Nitrite, NO and cardioprotection</title><p>Plasma nitrite is derived from oxidation (principally by Caeruloplasmin) of endothelially derived nitric oxide (NO), and by the reduction of dietary inorganic nitrate by bacteria in the salivary glands and gastro-intestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, nitrite has a relatively modest vasorelaxant effect compared to organic nitrates. However in vascular rings highly acidic solutions of nitrite causes marked vasorelaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], largely due to reduction to NO by acid disproportionation. Under less extreme conditions modest hypoxia and/or acidosis results in reduction of nitrite to NO by various mechanisms including by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (ALDH2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], cytochrome C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], deoxygenated forms of heme proteins including haemoglobin and myoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidoreductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Consequently nitrite induced vasodilation is potentiated by hypoxia in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these vascular effects a number of studies in animal models have now shown that sodium nitrite administered acts as both a pre and a per-conditioning agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This effect appears to be at least in part due to reduction of nitrite to NO by deoxymyoglobin in the heart, and can be abolished by NO scavengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Low dose nitrite given at the time of commencing resuscitation in a mouse model of cardiac arrest improved both cardiac and neurological function and increased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In a study of acute MI in a canine model, an infusion of sodium nitrite administered during coronary occlusion (i.e. a perconditioning regime) conferred significant cardioprotection. Pertinently, there was no significant difference in cardioprotection between a group that received an infusion of sodium nitrite during the final five minutes of the two hour coronary occlusion and that seen in a group having an infusion throughout the final 60 minutes of the occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial design and methods</title><p>NIAMI is a UK Medical Research Council funded, multi-centre, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial evaluating sodium nitrite versus placebo.

The brief information sheet will be provided to patients, and they will be asked to sign an initial consent form if they agree to take part (initial informed consent). However, because this initial consent may not be &#x0201c;fully&#x0201d; informed (either because patients have had opiates to relieve pain or are in a state of considerable anxiety), fully informed consent will be sought from these patients when full capacity has returned. At that stage, patients will receive full written information and an explanation of the study. If they are happy to remain part of the study, they will be asked to sign the consent form. However, in the emergency situation when there is no time to follow the initial informed consent process, and the urgency of providing treatment within the necessary time-window precludes any reasonable attempt to obtain informed consent from a relative or &#x02018;legal representative&#x02019;, verbal agreement will be sought from the patient by the treating cardiologist by providing a short spoken explanation. In deciding our policy for seeking only verbal agreement, we have taken full account of the provisions in The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Amendment (No 2) Regulations 2006, section 31 of Mental Capacity Act (2005) and part 5 of The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.</p><p>In the Australian site, participants are asked to sign an informed consent form prior to inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Eligible participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the placebo group on a 1:1 basis.

Images will be stored locally following standard clinical practice and transferred to the core lab in Aberdeen for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of images</title><p>All images will be analysed off line by a blinded observer in the core lab using software already developed for this purpose. A second blinded observer analysed a sample of 40 images. Analysis of AAR will be performed on the basis of two techniques described below. The first technique relates the length of the subendocardial edge of the gadolinium boundary to the transmural volume of left ventricular myocardium that this underlies (ESA technique) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The rationale of this is that infarction begins in the subendocardial region and extends as a wavefront transmurally; therefore salvage has the effect of limiting this transmural extension. In the second technique the area of oedema is measured using a T2 weighted triple inversion recovery (T2-W SPAIR or STIR) CMR imaging. Oedema develops in the territory supplied by an occluded artery within one hour of occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In 40 NIAMI patients, we demonstrated a median area at risk that was quantatively similar using T2-W oedema and ESA methods but both within and between observer variability was substantially better for ESA (intra-class correlation for ESA was 0.96 and for T2 0.6). Accordingly, we chose to employ ESA for measurement of AAR in the primary end point but retained T2 as an area at risk measurement in the secondary end points.</p><p>The infarcted area will be identified from the LGE CMR scan. The infarcted myocardium has conspicuous demarcation on LGE and exquisite contrast compared to the adjacent (nulled) myocardium, therefore tracing the infarct borders poses no problem for analysis. Both the oedematous and infarcted areas will be traced on all short axis slices and the total respective volumes of oedematous/infarcted myocardium calculated in absolute and relative terms to the left ventricular volume using commercially available software (SEGMENT). Volumetric LV ejection fraction will be measured at the initial CMR scan and at six months using standard approaches and commercially available software (CMRTools, Cardiovascular Imaging Solutions, London, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><sec><title>Proposed sample size</title><p>The primary outcome measure in this study will be the infarct size. We will estimate the difference in infarct size between the treatment and intervention group correcting for area at risk (AAR) and diabetic status using an analysis of covariance framework (ANCOVA) to take advantage of the correlation between IS and AAR to reduce sample size. Data from Cook (personal communication) and the Aarhus study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggest that the AAR in this cohort would be approximately mean 30% (standard deviation 15), and that the IS in the placebo group should be between mean 15% (from Aarhus) to 20% (from Cook) (standard deviation 11). We have chosen the lower of these values because this estimate was from clinical trial data. Data from both these data sets indicate that correlation between AAR and IS is above 0.60. The estimate of treatment effect in the Aarhus study was a reduction of IS from 15% in the control to approximately 9% in the intervention group, a reduction of 6%. This trial proposes more conservative, but still clinically relevant treatment effect size of 4% between the treatment and control group (a standardised effect size of about 0.36).</p><p>To explore statistical power and estimate sample size for the trial we used Monte Carlo simulation in Stata 11. (StataCorp. 2009. <italic>Stata Statistical Software: Release 11</italic>. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.) A model based the above assumptions was used to simulate 10,000 trial data sets for a variety of sample sizes. The simulated data sets were analysed using ANCOVA to reflect the primary trial analysis. The proportion of simulated trials that return p-values less than 0.05 was then counted to evaluate the power of ANCOVA. A sample size of 150 (75 per group) will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 4% between treatment and control group in IS corrected for AAR. The sample size has been expanded by approximately 30-35% to account for loss of outcome measure due to death, those who decline CMR or are unsuitable for CMR due to renal dysfunction and those in whom the CMR scans are technically inadequate. We therefore plan to recruit 200&#x02013;210 participants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data will summarised and reported in adherence with CONSORT guidelines. The analysis of the primary outcome (IS) will use a generalised linear model (ANCOVA), with covariates for area at risk, diabetic status and centre. Only participants that have primary outcome data will be included in the analysis, no attempt will be made to impute data for participants that cannot, for whatever reason, contribute CMR data in the primary analysis. We will test the robustness of results to missing data by conducting sensitivity analyses to suit the pattern of missing data that arises. Secondary analyses will be conducted in a similar manner, using models suitable for the outcome. Blood sample outcomes will be analysed by first deriving an area under the curve and then using a similar strategy to the primary outcome. All estimates of effect will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. All analyses will be done in Stata (StataCorp. 2009. <italic>Stata Statistical Software: Release 11</italic>.

We use a robust method of accurately delineating infarct size and area at risk using CMR imaging techniques alongside the standard use of biomarkers. Due to the risk of methaemoglobinaemia in patients at risk of G6PD deficiency, only those of Northern European descent will be recruited. Further studies need to be conducted in other ethnic groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whilst huge strides have been made to reduce myocardial infarct size by timely opening of the infarct related artery, firstly ischemia and subsequently reperfusion itself cause substantial myocardial injury. Effective therapy to reduce this injury is urgently required if we are to make further progress in limiting infarct size, thereby reducing the subsequent development of heart failure. Whilst soundly based on animal studies, this proposal would be the first in man study to investigate whether intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite reduces myocardial infarct size.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declared that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors listed above fulfil all International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines for authorship.
