Background</title><p>
Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment for chronic renal failure. Patients with kidney transplantation are forced to use glucocorticoids in order to prevent rejection, which is the most basic element of transplantation protocols (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Treatment with glucocorticoids is associated with increased risk of diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, weight gain and blood pressure. Other factors such as hepatitis-C virus (HCV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can cause blood glucose disorder in patients with kidney transplantation. These cases can cause conflicts of islets of Langerhans cells. Asymptomatic CMV infection increases the risk of diabetes after renal transplantation (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic renal failure and in some cases; diabetes mellitus occurs immediately after transplantation. One of the effects of uncontrolled blood glucose is increasing inflammatory processes that have negative impacts on the prognosis of renal transplantation (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In conducted studies, using Thiazolidinedione has been emphasized to reduce adverse effects of uncontrolled blood glucose that one of these effects is reducing the inflammatory processes (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
</p><p>
Controlling inflammatory processes in diabetic patients with kidney transplantation will have dramatic effects on reducing mortality, because the inflammatory processes are integral component of the diseases leading to renal failure and diabetes. Also, the experimental data showed that inflammation plays a role in atherogenesis process (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
</p><p>
These drugs increase the sensitivity of insulin receptors by PPAR-&#x00194; receptors stimulation and reduce insulin resistance (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Pioglitazone is a drug of thiazolidinedione category that in addition to controlling glucose, reduces the inflammatory processes, and reduces the inflammatory processes. Based on studies, pioglitazone does not interfere with common transplant medications such as cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. These drugs have been identified secure for damages to the connective tissue (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Pioglitazone consumption is not contraindicated with mentioned medications and it does not cause any change in the creatinine or tacrolimus levels. Pioglitazone does not increase creatinine or the need for immunosuppressive drugs in patients with kidney transplantation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>
This study designed to investigate the effects of pioglitazone on inflammatory processes in diabetic patients with kidney transplantation and if this medicine would be effective, it will help to increase the quality of life, duration of life and kidney function, reduce health care costs related to transplantation, graft rejection, and the need of alternative treatment in patients with kidney transplantation.

3.1. Study patients
</title><p>
In this double blind randomized clinical trial, patients who had undergone kidney transplantation with diabetes, entered to the study. Fasting blood glucose (FBS) more than 126 mg/dl, from America diabetes association diagnostic criteria, was used to diagnose diabetes. The study protocol was designed in compliance with the principles of the Helsinki Convention. Cigarette smokers or patients with heart failure FC II, III, hepatitis B and C, GFR less than 30 cc/min, pregnancy, acute rejection with progressive renal impairment and creatinine more than 1 mg/dl did not enter to the study. Patients gave written consent before entering the study. Patients divided randomly into two groups by closed label method. First group received insulin therapy with daily one 15 mg pioglitazone tablet (A) for four months and second group received insulin therapy with placebo tablet (B). Placebo tablets were produced identical in shape and size with pioglitazone by its manufacturer and drug prescriber, those who visit the patients and filled the checklists in all stages as well as the person who performed the analysis were unaware of drug compounds of both groups. At the beginning of the study, all patients were examined and interviewed, information about various diseases and history of present illness and consumed drugs were assessed through biography and present documents. On height, weight and waist circumference examinations, heart, lung and lower extremity examinations carried out for presence of congestive heart failure and other mentioned diseases in the exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

3.2. Laboratory assessments
</title><p>
Patients&#x02019; blood samples were taken to check for uric acid, lipid profile and hs-CRP. All patients were visited monthly, their blood glucose and creatinine were controlled monthly by experiments and if any problems or side effects were seen, patients were excluded from study. After four months the examinations were performed again.
</p><p>
Initial and four months laboratory tests were conducted using Pars Azmoon lab kits (TG91008, CHL91012, CRP92002, LDL-C92004, HDL-C92002, and Glu92008) at Labbafinejad hospital laboratory.

3.4. Statistical analysis
</title><p>
Data were analyzed by SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) for windows. At first, study patients described using mean descriptive statistics, standard deviation, and frequency then two groups compared before intervention by independent sample <italic>t</italic> test and its nonparametric equivalent (Mann-Whitney) for quantitative variables, then Chi<sup>2</sup> and Fisher exact tests used for qualitative variables. After treatment, groups wrer compared with above tests. Then before and after treatment amounts were compared in each group with paired sample <italic>t</italic> test, its nonparametric equivalent (Wilcoxon), and McNemar test. A, P amount less than 0.05 considered as significant value.
</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>4. Results</title><p>
A total of 58 patients were studied (29 patients in each group). Sixty-nine percent of group A were male and 31% were female. This distribution was 62 males and 38% female in group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.58).
</p><p>
The mean age was 44.15 &#x000b1; 13.82 years that was 44.41 &#x000b1; 14.24 years in group A and 43.68 &#x000b1; 13.67 years in group B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.89). The mean weight was 78.73 &#x000b1; 11.39 kg and the mean BMI was 28.32 &#x000b1; 3.76 kg/m2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

According to results, 15 mg pioglitazone daily added to routine insulin therapy, could decrease serum hs- CRP and cholesterol and increase serum HDL-C in diabetic renal transplant receivers. Pioglitazone could also help to control the blood glucose better.
</p><p>
Given that the patients enrolled to the study after renal transplantation and were treated with prednisolone and immunosuppressive drugs, it seems that these drugs have an impact on the amount of lipid reduction in both groups.
</p><p>
The results of this study are similar to the results of Luther et al in 2004 on serum lipids changes, however both studies did not report significant changes in lipids levels (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
</p><p>
The results of the present study are inconsistent with Mattoo et al study in 2005, on significant reduction in levels of LDL-C, cholesterol, triglycerides and hs- CRP after treatment with pioglitazone. The difference is that, the target group of Mattoo&#x02019;s study was not patients with kidney transplantation and significant change has not been stated in the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides in the control group. Follow-up period of patients in Mattoo&#x02019;s study was six months (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The results of the present study are consistent with the study of Hanefeld et al too (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Likewise, the results of our study are similar to the study by Szapary et al on reduction levels of inflammatory markers and serum lipids (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Additionally, study of Davidson et al on increase of weight and BMI and decrease of hs-CRP in pioglitazone group was in accord with the findings of our study. However, the difference is that, Davidson et al study, was not on patients with kidney transplantation which follow-up period was 24 weeks and also glimepiride drug prescribed for control group (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Furthermore the findings of Han et al showed the changes in hs-CRP, and cholesterol in patients who taking pioglitazone, which was similar to our findings (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
</p><p>
Likewise, the results of the present study was consistent with Liu et al study in 2013 on reduction of hs-CRP levels. However, the difference is that, drug taking period was 24 weeks, the control group received sitagliptin drug and they concluded that pioglitazone had a significant effect in reducing plasma glucose, hs-CRP and HbA1c (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
</p><p>
Additionally, present study approved the results of the study by Suzuki et al., in 2013 on hs-CRP reduction. Importantly, blood pressure, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose reduction are mentioned in their patients. The study stated positive effects of medication with candesartan and pioglitazone on reducing blood pressure, inflammatory markers and improving metabolism in patients with type II diabetes (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
</p><p>
Due to the significant reduction in serum lipids, inflammatory markers, uric acid and fasting blood glucose of patients with kidney transplantation after administration of pioglitazone, this drug can prevent metabolic disorders after renal transplantation, however decision making about long-term effects of drug on patients with kidney transplantation needs more studies (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It is recommended that in future studies, longer treatment duration be considered for patients and patients are examined for longer duration. Also, the effect of pioglitazone drug accompaniment with other anti-diabetic medications should be evaluated. The effect of this drug on blood pressure and HbA1c after transplantation could also be examined in future studies. Therefore, it is also suggested that the effect of this drug be compared with other drugs in diabetic and non-diabetic patients who received organ transplantation.
</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>
Oral pioglitazone seems to be a safe drug for reducing serum lipids and hs-CRP in kidney transplant receivers with diabetes mellitus in short-term evaluation. Long-term effect of pioglitazone therapy in diabetic kidney transplanted patients could be evaluated in future studies.
