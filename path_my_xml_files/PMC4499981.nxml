on the respiratory function and trunk control ability of patients with scoliosis.
[Subjects] Forty scoliosis patients were randomly divided into the Swiss ball exercise
group (n= 20) and resistance exercise group (n = 20). [Methods] The Swiss ball and
resistance exercise groups performed chest expansion and breathing exercises with a Swiss
ball and a therapist&#x02019;s resistance, respectively. Both groups received training 30&#x02005;min per
day, 5 times per week for 8 weeks. [Results] Both groups exhibited significant changes in
forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, and trunk impairment scale
after the intervention. However, there was no significant change in the forced expiratory
volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio after the intervention in either group.
Meanwhile, forced expiratory volume in one second and trunk impairment scale were
significantly greater in the resistance exercise group after the intervention.
[Conclusion] Both Swiss ball exercise and resistance exercise are effective for improving
the respiratory function and trunk control ability of patients with scoliosis. However,
resistance exercise is more effective for increasing the forced expiratory volume in one
second and trunk control ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd><kwd>Trunk control ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>An increasing number of patients are visiting hospitals owing to abnormal posture and
idiopathic spinal deformities. Such conditions are especially serious for adolescents, who
are undergoing dramatic musculoskeletal growth. This problem appears closely related to
lifestyle issues such as learning environment and lack of exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Scoliosis, the most common spinal deformity, is characterized by the spine deviating
laterally from the center axis and rotating. Scoliosis causes both exterior deformity and
decreased respiratory muscle contraction, restricting movements of the costal bones and
trunk. This can progressively exacerbate cardiopulmonary function disorders and cause
complications such as backache. Moreover, the deformity can transpose or press surrounding
organs, resulting in functional disorder and decreased lifespan<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, scoliosis can decrease lung volume,
diminishing lung function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
treatment aiming to correct trunk alignment, stimulate trunk movement during respiration,
and improve respiratory function is mandatory<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both surgical methods and non-surgical conservative treatments have been used to treat
idiopathic scoliosis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conservative
treatments include wearing an orthosis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, exercise therapy while wearing a Milwaukee
orthosis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, wearing a Boston
orthosis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, electrical stimulation
therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, extension therapy<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and exercise therapy<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Traditional exercise therapy methods for scoliosis treatment include postural exercises,
stretching, muscle strengthening exercises, respiratory training, and muscle strength
imbalance correction exercises<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise methods for idiopathic scoliosis have been used for a long time; they are
typically used to stimulate trunk stability and symmetric development by stretching
shortened muscles and strengthening trunk muscles. Although these exercise methods have
limitations in their ability to arrest and correct moderate or severe scoliosis, they are
effective for mild scoliosis or when performed in conjunction with an orthosis or traction
treatment<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many reports on
the effectiveness of exercise therapies for scoliosis treatment<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, until recently, scoliosis treatment was decided
mainly on the basis of the level of deformation and speed of progression, with little or no
regard to its effect on cardiopulmonary function.</p><p>Therefore, the present study evaluated and compared the effects of Swiss ball exercise and
resistance exercise on respiratory function and trunk control in patients with
scoliosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The patients were outpatients at N Hospital in Daegu, South Korea who had been diagnosed
with scoliosis and agreed to participate in the study. Among the chest and pelvic X-ray
images of 49 patients with scoliosis, 42 patients had Cobb angles between 10&#x000b0; and 20&#x000b0;. Among
them, 40 patients who agreed to participate and met the following inclusion criteria
participated in the experiment. The inclusion criteria were as follows: absence of any lung
diseases before scoliosis, no congenital chest deformation or rib fracture, and ability to
sit independently. All patients understood the purpose of this study and provided written
informed consent prior to participation in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into the Swiss ball exercise group (SEG,
<italic>n</italic> = 20) and the resistance exercise group (REG, <italic>n</italic> = 20).
Both groups completed 30 minutes of exercise per day, 5 times per week for 8 weeks.</p><p>The SEG performed a warm-up, stretching, main exercise, and cool-down exercises as
described previously by Kim and Yang<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Chest and waist stretching were performed for 5 minutes each, focusing on stretching the
concave side. Stretching was conducted in two positions. First, the patient lay on one side
to perform stretching. Next, they dropped to their knees while holding a Swiss ball, bent
their waist, and turned in the opposite direction from the convex side. They maintained the
stretching position for 10 seconds each time. Main exercises were performed for 20 minutes.
The patient put both hands on their head, lay on a Swiss ball on the opposite side of the
superior convex side, and twisted their trunk toward the opposite side. Next, they sat on a
ball, put their hands on their pelvis, placed both feet on the ground, and bounced using the
elasticity of the ball. Patients put both legs on the ball, supporting themselves on the
ground using their hands, and moved their legs and the ball from side to side. In the
side-lying-on-elbow position, the patient supported themselves with one hand on the ground
and pushed a ball using the other hand, stretching their trunk. Thoracic resistance exercise
was performed for 10 minutes. The patient lay on one side, and the therapist placed their
hands on the part of the patient&#x02019;s chest on which they wished to focus. In synchrony with
the patient&#x02019;s respiration rhythm, the therapist exerted pressure while tracing an arc along
the costal line in a downward and inward direction. The diaphragm movement was facilitated
by a therapist. The therapist directly facilitated the diaphragm using their thumb or other
fingers to push below the thorax upward and outward. Resistance was provided to the
contracting diaphragm&#x02019;s movement, downwards and stretching. For indirect facilitation, the
therapist placed both hands on the abdomen and applied light pressure toward the upper side
while the patient inhaled.</p><p>Meanwhile, the REG performed stretching, main exercises, and cool-down as described
previously by Lim et al<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. All exercises
were performed under a therapist&#x02019;s guidance.</p><p>Chest stretching and waist stretching were performed for 5 minutes each. The patient lay on
their side with the convex side of chest and waist below, with a thick towel at the apex of
the curve. The waist remained in contact with the ground, and the patient held their arms up
to stretch. The stretching position was maintained for 10 seconds and repeated 15 times.
Next, main exercises were performed for 15 minutes. In the supine position, the patient bent
both legs such that they could pull them toward the chest. The therapist held the patient&#x02019;s
knees to provide resistance, enabling the patient&#x02019;s abdominal muscles to be fully
stimulated.</p><p>In the hook lying position, patients performed a bridge exercise designed to lift the hips.
The therapist held the patient&#x02019;s pelvis and induced posterior tilt to provide resistance. In
the side-lying position, the patient raised their leg on the upper side. The therapist held
the femoral region, providing resistance as the patient moved and stimulating movement. In a
sitting position, the patient bent the knee on the waist on the concave side to 90&#x000b0;, and the
therapist provided resistance to raise the leg. Thoracic resistance exercise was performed
for 10 minutes. The patient lay on one side, and the therapist placed their hands on the
part of the patient&#x02019;s chest they wished to focus. In synchrony with the patient&#x02019;s
respiration rhythm, the therapist exerted pressure while tracing an arc along the costal
line in a downward and inward direction. The diaphragm movement was facilitated by a
therapist. The therapist directly facilitated the diaphragm using his thumb or other fingers
to push below the thorax in an upward and outward direction. Downward resistance was
provided to the contracting diaphragm&#x02019;s movement to induce stretching. For indirect
facilitation, the therapist placed both hands on the abdomen and applied light pressure
toward the upper side while the patient inhaled.</p><p>All patients underwent preliminary evaluation before the exercise program and were
re-evaluated after 8 weeks.</p><p>Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak
expiratory flow were measured by a Cardio Touch 3000S(BIONET,US) and trunk control ability
was evaluated according to the trunk impairment scale (TIS).</p><p>Patients&#x02019; general characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A paired
t-test was used to assess differences pre- and post-intervention. An independent-sample
t-test was used to assess difference between the two groups. The level of significance was
set at p &#x0003c; 0.05. SPSS version 12.0 was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant difference in the baseline general characteristics between the

resistance exercise on respiratory function and trunk control ability in scoliosis patients.
FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC were measured to assess respiratory function, and the TIS was used
to assess trunk control ability.</p><p>Fabian<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> applied asymmetric respiration
exercise-type physical therapy to 30 female idiopathic scoliosis patients aged between 14
and 16&#x02005;years for 4&#x02013;5 weeks and reported that respiratory function and thorax movement
improved significantly. Meanwhile, Alves et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> applied physical therapy for 4 months to high-level idiopathic
scoliosis patients whose thoracic curvature was between 45&#x000b0; and 88&#x000b0;; patients exhibited
improvements in FVC, inspiratory capacity, FEV1, expiratory reserve volume, and 6-minute
walking test results. Dyner-Jama et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>
applied asymmetric respiration exercises to scoliosis patients for 24 days and reported
significant improvements in FVC and FEV1. Weiss<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> applied the Schroth method to idiopathic scoliosis patients and
reported a 13&#x02013;18% improvement in vital capacity and 20% average improvement in chest
expansion.</p><p>Concordant with the abovementioned studies, the present study also showed significant
improvements in FVC, FEV1, and the TIS after both exercise interventions.</p><p>Improved respiratory functions and trunk control ability appear to be due to improved
adaptability in unstable posture, as the Swiss ball exercise is conducted on a dilatational
ball. The development of respiratory muscles and muscles around the spine as well as
improved posture control ability may have affected the results.</p><p>These findings are also concordant with the study of Creager<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reports Swiss ball exercise is effective for developing muscle
strength around the waist, increasing waist flexibility, improving coordination, and
stimulating proprioceptors and the cardiovascular system.</p><p>Resistance exercise improves respiratory function and trunk control ability, growing the
muscles causing the abnormality specifically by lengthening shortened muscles and increasing
the strength of the weakened muscles that created the resistance. By performing this
exercise, patients are likely to achieve improved flexibility and muscle strength of the
respiratory muscles and muscles around the spine. Trunk stability and symmetric development
may have also improved respiratory functions and trunk control ability.</p><p>FEV1 and the TIS were significantly greater after the resistance exercise than the Swiss
ball exercise, suggesting the therapist&#x02019;s application of direct resistance more strongly
influences respiratory muscles and the muscles surrounding the spine. In particular,
resistance exercise may have had a greater effect on the abdominal muscles that move during
expiration.</p><p>A major limitation of this study is the small sample size, meaning the results cannot
immediately be generalized. Therefore, studies evaluating these treatments in more patients
and over a longer period are required. Future follow-up studies must also evaluate the
improvement of muscle strength related to respiration and trunk stability. In addition, it
is essential to investigate the durability of the effects of these exercises.</p><p>In conclusion, Swiss ball exercise and resistance exercise can improve scoliosis patients&#x02019;
respiratory functions and trunk control ability, although resistance exercise is more
effective for improving FEV1 and the TIS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of fehabilitation program in adolescent
