In this 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study, 678 schizophrenia patients were randomized to either pomaglumetad methionil (<italic>n</italic> = 516) or aripiprazole (<italic>n</italic> = 162). Treatment groups were also compared on efficacy and various safety measures, including serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The pomaglumetad methionil group showed significantly greater weight loss at Week 24 (Visit 12) compared with the aripiprazole group (&#x02212;2.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4 versus 0.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). However, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores for aripiprazole was significantly greater than for pomaglumetad methionil (&#x02212;15.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.58 versus &#x02212;12.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.99; <italic>P</italic> = 0.045). The incidences of SAEs (8.2% versus 3.1%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.032) and discontinuation due to AEs (16.2% versus 8.7%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.020) were significantly higher for pomaglumetad methionil compared with aripiprazole. No statistically significant differences in the incidence of TEAEs, EPS, or suicidal ideation or behavior were noted between treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term treatment with pomaglumetad methionil resulted in significantly less weight gain than aripiprazole.

Introduction</title><p>All of the current antipsychotics target dopamine receptors as their common mechanism of action [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to differences in the affinities to the dopamine receptors and interactions with other biogenic monoamine receptors, therapeutic profiles and limitations of individual drugs vary [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The conventional/typical antipsychotic drugs are effective in treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, they are associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinemia [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The newer generation atypical antipsychotics not only improve positive and, to some extent, negative symptoms of schizophrenia [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but also have a lower propensity to cause EPS [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and hyperprolactinemia [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, these agents may still be associated with other adverse events (AEs), such as body weight gain, lipid abnormalities [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and glucose dysregulation [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in some patients. Furthermore, drug-induced weight gain may affect long-term compliance, which directly influences the likelihood of successfully managing the course of disease [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, a significant need exists to develop treatments for schizophrenia that are not associated with these and other AEs.</p><p>Pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023 monohydrate), a methionine prodrug of the active compound LY404039, is a specific and potent metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor agonist. It is devoid of affinity to all biogenic amine receptors, including dopamine receptors [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but demonstrates a preclinical pharmacological profile similar to that of clinically effective atypical antipsychotic drugs [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unlike currently approved antipsychotic medications, pomaglumetad methionil was not expected to be associated with weight gain, EPS, or metabolic side effects because of its selective receptor binding profile [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and hence has been suggested as an alternative treatment for schizophrenia [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies&#x02014;a proof-of-concept study [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a Phase 2, inpatient, dose-ranging study [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a Phase 2 long-term safety study [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and an acute, fixed-dose, Phase 2 study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]&#x02014;showed that treatment with pomaglumetad methionil was well-tolerated and demonstrated a low incidence of AEs, such as weight gain, EPS, and hyperprolactinemia, that are typically observed with currently available dopaminergic antipsychotic treatments. Efficacy results were as follows: positive in the proof-of-concept study [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], inconclusive in the Phase 2, inpatient, dose-ranging study, [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and negative in the acute, fixed-dose, Phase 2 registration study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Aripiprazole, a quinolinone derivative, is a novel atypical antipsychotic drug which has a mechanism of action distinct from other atypical antipsychotic drugs as it is a partial dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist with a lower association with weight gain [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because pomaglumetad methionil also has a low likelihood of inducing weight gain and may even be associated with weight loss in patients previously treated with antipsychotics [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], aripiprazole was selected as an appropriate comparator in this weight gain study to demonstrate a potentially unique weight profile for pomaglumetad methionil.</p><p>The present study was part of a Phase 3 clinical development program for pomaglumetad methionil in the treatment of schizophrenia. The purpose of the present study was to compare the mean weight gain in flexibly dosed pomaglumetad methionil (20, 40, or 80&#x02009;mg, twice daily [BID]) with flexibly dosed aripiprazole (10, 15, or 30&#x02009;mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment. The study was intended to help characterize the benefits and risks of pomaglumetad methionil for a broad population of patients with schizophrenia but was stopped early when the pomaglumetad methionil schizophrenia monotherapy development program was stopped, based on lack of efficacy in an acute placebo-controlled efficacy study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as early stopping of a second acute trial due to futility [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This early stopping had minimal impact on the double-blind active treatment phase results of the present study, however, since enrollment was complete and 97% of patients had already completed or discontinued the double-blind active treatment phase of the study at the time of the termination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>This study was conducted at 57 centers in 10 countries. Male and female outpatients, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as defined by the<italic> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision</italic> (DSM-IV-TR) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and confirmed by Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID), were enrolled into the study. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: (1) if they had other current Axis I psychiatric diagnoses (as defined in DSM-IV-TR) in addition to schizophrenia, (2) if they had a history of inadequate clinical response, in the opinion of the investigator, to antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia (inadequate clinical response for this study was defined as persistent and moderately severe hallucinations, delusions, or thought disorder after completion of 2 or more antipsychotic medication trials of at least 8 weeks duration in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1), (3) if they had aripiprazole treatment within the past 2 months, (4) if they had a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence, (5) if they had a substance-induced psychosis by DSM-IV-TR criteria, or (6) if they were pregnant or breast-feeding. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants at the screening visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Study Design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of pomaglumetad methionil (flexibly dosed between 20 and 80&#x02009;mg BID) in patients with schizophrenia. An active control, aripiprazole (flexibly dosed between 10 and 30 mg/day), was included for comparison.</p><p>This study was divided into 3 study periods. Study Period I was a screening and antipsychotic drug taper/discontinuation phase (3&#x02013;10 days). During this period, all screening procedures were completed and previous antipsychotic medications were stopped. Study Period II was the double-blind active treatment phase. Patients who met enrollment criteria during Study Period I continued into Study Period II and were randomized in 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to either pomaglumetad methionil or aripiprazole. The duration of the double-blind active treatment phase (24 weeks) enabled assessment of the safety of pomaglumetad methionil over a longer period of time than acute efficacy studies. Patients who completed Study Period II continued into Study Period III, which was an open-label active treatment phase. The duration of the open-label active treatment phase (28 weeks) enabled collection of additional safety data.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Ethical Considerations</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with consensus ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6, and applicable laws and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Safety Measures</title><p>Safety measures that were monitored at every visit included weight, AEs, vital signs, suicidality as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], results of a neurological examination, and waist circumference (except at screening). Weight was assessed using a calibrated digital scale and investigator sites were instructed to assess patient's weight at a consistent time of day in light consistent clothing and by the same person at each visit. All serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported according to terminology in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 15.1. Other safety parameters that were monitored throughout the study were electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals and laboratory analytes, as well as EPS and abnormal movements, which were evaluated using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Efficacy Measures</title><p>Efficacy scales which were assessed/collected throughout the study were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the 16-Item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Statistical Analysis</title><p>An expected sample size of at least 450 patients in the pomaglumetad methionil group and 150 patients in the aripiprazole group provided at least an 88% chance to demonstrate that the pomaglumetad methionil group had about 1.8 kilograms (kg) less mean body weight increase from baseline compared with the aripiprazole group at a 1-sided 0.025 alpha level. Sample size was based on a 2-sample<italic> t</italic>-test, assuming that the standard deviation of body weight change from baseline would be approximately 6&#x02009;kg. The sample ratio of 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 was chosen to maximize exposure to pomaglumetad methionil.</p><p>The analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that included all patients according to the treatment group to which they were assigned and received at least 1 dose. The ITT set was modified prior to data lock, excluding patients (<italic>n</italic> = 3) from a site with an International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices noncompliance issue. Analyses of the double-blind active treatment phase included comparisons between treatment groups with 2-sided tests conducted at the 0.05 alpha level. Data collected during the open-label active treatment phase were summarized.</p><p>The primary objective was evaluated with a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The model included the fixed categorical effects of treatment, gender, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and prior olanzapine use (yes or no, where &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; was defined as usage of olanzapine for &#x0003e;7 cumulative days during the 6 weeks prior to screen), as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction. The within-patient errors were modeled according to an unstructured covariance matrix. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. The primary contrast was the pomaglumetad methionil versus aripiprazole comparison at Week 24 (Visit 12). Based on the visitwise treatment contrasts from the primary analysis, a sequential testing procedure was used to determine (with appropriate type I error control) the earliest time point at which the treatments differed statistically in mean weight change. The incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant weight gain (i.e., &#x02265;7% increase from baseline) or weight loss (i.e., &#x02265;7% decrease from baseline) at endpoint or any time during the double-blind active treatment phase was compared between treatment groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], controlling for baseline body mass index (BMI) and prior olanzapine use.</p><p>Incidence rates of safety categorical variables were summarized and compared between treatment groups using Fisher's exact test. The change from baseline in vital signs, ECG, SAS total score, AIMS total score (items 1&#x02013;7), and BAS global score was assessed using an MMRM analysis with a model similar to that used for the efficacy analysis. The change from baseline to the last observed measure in the laboratory analytes was ranktransformed prior to analysis and was assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect.</p><p>All the efficacy variables were evaluated with MMRM analysis. The model included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, gender, pooled site, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and predefined subpopulation (yes/no), as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction.</p><p>Reason for discontinuation, baseline characteristics, baseline efficacy, and baseline EPS measures along with illness characteristics were summarized by treatment group. Continuous measures were analyzed with a single factor ANOVA model with fixed effect of treatment and Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical data between treatment groups. Time-to-discontinuation (due to AEs, lack of efficacy, and for any reason) was analyzed separately with Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the log-rank test was used for comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Patient Characteristics and Disposition</title><p>Of the 962 patients screened, 678 were randomized in an approximately 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio (516 in the pomaglumetad methionil group and 162 in the aripiprazole group) during the double-blind active treatment phase, with 672 patients (511 in the pomaglumetad methionil group and 161 in the aripiprazole group) making up the ITT population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Most of the patients were male (64.3%), white (52.4%), and from the United States (67.4%). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) for age was 42.45 (10.88) years, for baseline weight 89.90 (22.21) kg, for BMI 30.44 (7.39) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and for waist circumference &#x02212;101.11 (17.10) cm. The major reasons for discontinuation across treatment arms during the double-blind active treatment phase were as follows: AE-subject decision (8.3%), subject decision-consent withdrawn (8.2%), lost to follow-up (7.7%), protocol violation (6.0%), AE-physician decision (5.4%), perceived lack of efficacy-physician decision (5.4%), and perceived lack of efficacy-subject decision (4.6%). Reasons for discontinuation were comparable between pomaglumetad methionil and aripiprazole groups except for AE-physician decision (6.7% versus 1.2%, resp.; <italic>P</italic> = 0.005).</p><p>A total of 313 patients completed the double-blind active treatment phase (229 in pomaglumetad methionil arm and 84 in aripiprazole arm) from which 272 patients enrolled into the open-label active treatment phase. Of 83 patients who completed the open-label active treatment phase, 60 had taken pomaglumetad methionil during the double-blind active treatment phase. The most common reason for discontinuation during the open-label active treatment phase was sponsor decision (48.9%), reflecting early termination of the study following negative efficacy of an acute (Phase 2) registration trial [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as early stopping of a second (Phase 3) registration trial due to futility [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the pomaglumetad methionil and aripiprazole treatment groups in time-to-discontinuation (all causality) and time-to-discontinuation due to lack of efficacy.

Discussion</title><p>Weight gain prevention has become a major research interest since drug-induced weight gain is a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular problems and is a significant cause of antipsychotic treatment noncompliance [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Aripiprazole has generally been considered to have a lower propensity for weight gain than some other antipsychotics [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] but may still be associated with weight increase in some populations, depending upon previous antipsychotic exposure [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The significant separation of pomaglumetad methionil and aripiprazole on weight outcome offers the opportunity to demonstrate a unique weight attribute of pomaglumetad methionil. In the current study, the aripiprazole group showed a very small increase in weight from baseline (0.4&#x02009;kg), consistent with previous reports. In contrast, the pomaglumetad methionil group showed significant weight loss from baseline (&#x02212;2.8&#x02009;kg), and significantly more pomaglumetad methionil-treated patients reported a &#x02265;7% decrease in weight from baseline compared with aripiprazole-treated patients at endpoint and at any time during the double-blind study. It is not clear from the present results whether any of the reported weight loss was a consequence of the discontinuation of previous antipsychotic treatment, resulting in shedding of excess weight gained during that treatment, was due to anticraving effects of pomaglumetad methionil treatment, or both [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Regardless, the results suggest that the weight profile for pomaglumetad is unique compared with current antipsychotics.</p><p>Most AEs were reported at similar incidence rates in both treatment groups. However, nausea occurred more often in the pomaglumetad methionil group, and there was a significantly higher incidence of akathisia, dyspepsia, pyrexia, and nasal congestion in the aripiprazole treatment group. The higher incidence of akathisia in the aripiprazole group is consistent with previously reported outcomes for this compound [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nausea and vomiting have been observed in other pomaglumetad methionil trials, and aripiprazole has also been previously associated with gastrointestinal-related AEs. The observed decrease in weight for the pomaglumetad methionil group does not appear to be a consequence of nausea and vomiting because for most patients the gastrointestinal events occurred only during the first weeks of treatment, whereas the time course of weight changes was gradual and persistent across the 24 weeks. Suicidal ideation (40% to 50%) and behavior (20% to 50%) are frequent in patients with schizophrenia [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the present study, rates of suicidal ideation and behavior were not significantly different between the treatment groups during the double-blind active treatment phase, with 1.4% of patients in the pomaglumetad methionil group exhibiting suicidal behavior.</p><p>There were no clinically relevant laboratory findings, and there were no clinically significant findings on vital signs or ECGs for the pomaglumetad methionil group compared with the aripiprazole group. Analysis of fasting lipids and glucose generally did not show significant treatment differences, although there were significantly fewer patients with a shift from normal/borderline triglycerides to high triglycerides at any time in the pomaglumetad methionil group. It is possible that a longer duration of observation may be needed to observe further differences in metabolic parameters as a result of the decreases in weight.</p><p>The overall greater number of SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs in the pomaglumetad methionil group appeared to be primarily driven by disease state-related AEs (psychosis and schizophrenia) and may be related to inferior efficacy compared with aripiprazole as well as manifestations of the underlying disease state.</p><p>The lack of placebo in the current study limits our interpretation of efficacy, so efficacy outcomes were secondary. However, the efficacy of pomaglumetad methionil was inferior compared with aripiprazole in this trial. Definitive placebo-controlled efficacy studies were being conducted in parallel to this study. The present study was stopped early when the pomaglumetad methionil schizophrenia monotherapy development program was stopped, based on lack of efficacy in an acute placebo-controlled efficacy study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as early stopping of a second acute trial due to futility [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This early stopping had minimal impact on the double-blind active treatment phase results of the present study, however, since enrollment was complete and 97% of patients had already completed or discontinued the double-blind active treatment phase of the study at the time of termination. (As noted in the Results Section, the most common reason for discontinuation during the open-label active treatment phase was sponsor decision (48.9%), reflecting early termination of the study.) Subgroups defined by clinical parameters, markers that may reflect an underlying hyperglutamatergic tone, or genotype are currently being explored across the completed pomaglumetad methionil studies to understand if there may be a more responsive subgroup of patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Treatment for 24 weeks with pomaglumetad methionil resulted in significantly less weight gain compared with aripiprazole. However, inferior efficacy in this longer term study along with the recent results of acute placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy studies suggests that pomaglumetad methionil is not effective in a broad schizophrenia patient population. More research is needed to determine whether a targeted patient population may be responsive to a glutamatergic treatment for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA.
