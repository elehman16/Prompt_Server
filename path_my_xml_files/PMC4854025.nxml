PDPH risk factors include the female sex, youth, pregnancy, history of headache or previous PDPH, type of operative procedure, technique of spinal anesthesia, several attempts for dural puncture, and needle tip presentation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Different mechanisms are responsible for PDPH formation. However, its major etiology has not been completely recognized. Distension of intracranial vessels and increase in brain blood flow can play a primary role in PDPH formation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Now-a-days, many surgeries are performable under spinal anesthesia, and because of nonexistence of many complications due to general anesthesia and in cases when general anesthesia is not possible for patients, spinal anesthesia is applied.</p><p>Lower extremities orthopedic surgeries are easily performable using spinal blocking. Yet the prevalence of headache, especially in younger people causes the need for prophylaxis to prevent this complication. For this purpose, different studies have so far been conducted on medicines and preventive effect on the incidence of intra- and post-operative complications, including the prevention of headache incidence, with different and sometimes contradicting results.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] For example, in their study conducted in 2011 at Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Doroudian <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of dexamethasone on the prevention of PDPH incidence after spinal anesthesia in lower extremities orthopedic surgeries and concluded that dexamethasone does not significantly influence the prevention of PDPH incidence; however, decreases its intensity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Yet in the study by Yousefshahi <italic>et al</italic>., conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, application of dexamethasone increased PDPH incidence and intensity after spinal anesthesia for cesarean sections, with no effect on postoperative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In their study conducted in Turkey, Esmaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that acetaminophen-caffeine compound is not effective in the prevention of PDPH.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Yet in their study conducted in Boston, Camann <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that application of oral caffeine decreases PDPH intensity in patients under spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In another study, cosyntropin was used to decrease headache after spinal anesthesia and it was concluded that application of cosyntropin delays the incidence of PDPH.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was designed taking into consideration the limited research conducted in relation to administration of prophylactic medications and existence of contradiction in the obtained results and also lack of any study in prescribing the combination of dexamethasone, caffeine, and acetaminophen together in the prevention of PDPH.

In this study, two groups of 45 patients each undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia were studied [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. Regarding age, sex, weight distribution, and the amount of the liquids administered, the two groups did not show any significant difference, and no interrupting effect of them was observed upon the study of headache incidence.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-5-66-g006"/></fig><p>From the start of entrance to recovery up to 72 h after operation, the patients were studied for headache incidence and other complications including nausea and vomiting. According to the obtained results no patient suffered from nausea and vomiting during operation. Yet during stay in recovery, one patient of the group receiving placebo and one patient in the group receiving dexamethasone + acetaminophen + caffeine were afflicted with nausea. However, no case of vomiting incidence was observed in recovery. Regarding headache incidence at the start of entrance to recovery, two patients in the control group and three patients in the intervention group suffered from headache. Yet 6 to 72 h after operation, more patients suffered from headache in the control group than in the intervention group, with no significant difference observed between the two groups.</p><p>On the other hand, headache incidence frequency and headache duration were not significantly different in the two groups, though headache frequency and duration were higher in the control group.</p><p>In our study, intervention group received dexamethasone, acetaminophen, and caffeine; although some studies have shown that preoperative application of dexamethasone has no significant effect on postoperative headache relief (1 and 5). Yet the study by Hakim has been indicative of dexamethasone's positive effect on postoperative headache relief in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] On the other hand, the study by Esmaogla <italic>et al</italic>. in Turkey showed that application of acetaminophen + caffeine has no essential and statistically significant effect on postoperative headache incidence under spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Yet the study by Doroudian <italic>et al</italic>. has shown that application of dexamethasone has been associated with lower intensity of postoperative headache in spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It should be considered as a limitation in our study that we used spinal needle number 23 for all the patients, and if smaller needles have been used, it may result in significant differences between the two groups.</p><p>During the study, 40% of the control group and 26.7% of the intervention group took excess acetaminophen. Yet the mean amount of the acetaminophen taken was significantly higher in the control group, with no significant difference observed in the two groups; however, 6.7% of the control group and 2.2% of the intervention group accordingly received morphine for pain relief, with no significant difference in the two groups. Regarding the results from this study and comparison with other studies, the general conclusion which can be arrived from this one is that, though associated with headache intensity and duration decrease and also with PDPH incidence decrease, application of acetaminophen + dexamethasone displays no essential and statistically significant effect compared with placebo. It is, thus, advised to conduct much research on identifying methods of how to cope with PDPH incidence.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yousefshahi</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahmardeh</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Khajavi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Najafi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Khashayar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Barkhordari</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of dexamethasone on the frequency of postdural puncture headache after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section: A double-blind randomized clinical trial</article-title><source>Acta Neurol Belg</source><year>2012</year><volume>112</volume><fpage>345</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22527786</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rupasinghe</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Recognition and treatment of post-dural puncture headache</article-title><source>Anaesth Intensive Care Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>273</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buettner</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wresch</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postdural puncture headache: Comparison of 25-gauge Whitacre and Quincke needles</article-title><source>Reg Anesth</source><year>1993</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>166</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8323889</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Esmaoglu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Akpinar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ugur</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral multidose caffeine-paracetamol combination is not effective for the prophylaxis of postdural puncture headache</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2005</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>58</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15721731</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Doroudian</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Norouzi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Esmailie</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanhaeivash</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dexamethasone in preventing post-dural puncture headache: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial</article-title><source>Acta Anaesthesiol Belg</source><year>2011</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>143</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22145255</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Camann</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mushlin</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of oral caffeine on postdural puncture headache.
