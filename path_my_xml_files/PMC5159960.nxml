One of the challenges to the delivery of online interventions is programme engagement; this challenge is even more acute for interventions delivered in real-world settings such as the workplace. The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the effect of an online facilitated discussion group on engagement, and to estimate the potential effectiveness of an online CBT-based stress management programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a minimally guided, online, CBT-based stress management intervention delivered with and without an online facilitated bulletin board, and a wait list control group. Up to 90 employees from six UK-based organisations will be recruited to the study. Inclusion criteria will include age 18&#x000a0;years or over, elevated levels of stress (as measured on the PSS-10 scale), access to a computer or a tablet and the Internet. The primary outcome measure will be engagement, as defined by the number of logins to the site; secondary outcome measures will include further measures of engagement (the number of pages visited, the number of modules completed and self-report engagement) and measures of effectiveness (psychological distress and subjective wellbeing). Possible moderators will include measures of intervention quality (satisfaction, acceptability, credibility, system usability), time pressure, goal conflict, levels of distress at baseline and job autonomy. Measures will be taken at baseline, 2&#x000a0;weeks (credibility and expectancy measures only), 8&#x000a0;weeks (completion of intervention) and 16&#x000a0;weeks (follow-up). Primary analysis will be conducted on intention-to-treat principles.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to explore the effect of an online discussion group on the engagement and effectiveness of an online CBT-based stress management intervention. This study could provide a solution to the growing problem of poor employee psychological health and begin to address the challenge of increasing engagement with Internet-delivered health interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02729987?term=NCT02729987&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02729987</ext-link>.

Psychological ill health is the leading cause of sickness absence in the UK accounting for 70 million sick days in 2013 and costing the economy &#x000a3;70&#x02013;&#x000a3;100 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reducing the prevalence of CMHDs is a major public health challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilise the Internet as a means of delivering evidence-based psychological treatments.</p><p>In 2013, 73% of adults in Great Britain used the Internet every day, with 43% using it to seek health information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The Internet has become a natural means for delivering health care information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], treatment, and prevention programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the UK, computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (cCBT) is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] for the treatment of persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression. NICE have also identified cCBT as a promising low-intensity intervention for generalised anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>A large number of meta-analyses have found evidence for the delivery of online CBT-based programmes delivered in clinical or community settings for individuals with depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but the evidence for online psychological interventions delivered in workplace settings is less convincing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Researchers have argued that adherence (completing the intervention to the extent that the developers intended it to be used; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]), engagement (the extent, both in terms of time and frequency, that participants visit the website) and attrition (participants in a study who do not fulfill the research protocol; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) all pose challenges to the evaluation and delivery of Internet interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For Internet interventions delivered in real-world settings (as opposed to clinical research settings), these challenges can be even more acute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with as few as 1% of registered users completing all sessions of a freely available online CBT programme for people with panic disorder and agoraphobia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that increasing guidance from a therapist can lead to greater adherence to online interventions, and result in improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A facilitated discussion group delivered in the form of a bulletin board could provide a cost-effective and time-efficient means for increasing guidance from a therapist. Although more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis, there is some evidence of improved adherence to bulletin board support: Titov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], compared guided and nonguided Internet-based CBT for social phobia. The guided condition had access to a facilitated bulletin board and email contact from a therapist. The unguided condition had access to a nonfacilitated bulletin board. The study found that adherence rates for the supported condition were higher than for the unsupported condition (77% and 33% respectively). What was unclear from the study was the extent to which it was the facilitated bulletin board or the email support that successfully provided the additional therapist guidance.</p><p>A number of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] have also included discussion groups delivered in the form of bulletin boards as part of an online intervention but have failed to include the groups as a unique research variable so have been unable to identify the impact of the group on the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>In this study we will examine the effect of an online facilitated bulletin board on engagement with an online CBT-based stress management programme (WorkGuru) and explore whether effectiveness is mediated by engagement. We hypothesise that the bulletin board group will have better engagement outcomes than the minimal support group (MSG), and that these outcomes will result in decreased levels of psychological distress and increased levels of subjective wellbeing at work. Furthermore, we expect to identify moderating factors that influence levels of engagement and effectiveness that are either linked to the quality of the intervention (satisfaction, acceptability, credibility, system usability), time pressure, goal conflict, level of distress at baseline, or job autonomy.</p><p>This study is being conducted as a pilot phase of a substantive trial; this will give greater confidence in predicting effect size, refining the optimum engagement of the intervention (adherence) and understanding the accuracy and effectiveness of engagement measures. It will also give a greater understanding of the challenges of conducting this research in a workplace setting.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The aim of this pilot study is to inform a definitive randomised controlled superiority trial.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>Six UK-based organisations will be approached to participate in this study. A sample size of 90 study participants will be recruited from the participating organisations. The sample size of 30 participants per arm is based on the optimum number of discussion group participants identified by WorkGuru, and is equal to the medium per arm sample size identified in an audit of sample sizes for pilot and feasibility studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Participants will be recruited through advertisements distributed via email, the organisations&#x02019; intranets and in-house magazines. All marketing information will include an email address inviting people who are interested in participating in the study to access information made available online or by emailing the first named author (SC). An information leaflet and a link to the online screening questionnaire, the short-form version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) will be made available to all people who express an interest in the study. People who meet the inclusion criteria will automatically be sent a link to the online baseline questionnaire. The online questionnaires will be designed and distributed using Qualtrics survey software. Participants who complete the baseline questionnaire will be randomised. The first author will create an allocation schedule using a computer-generated randomisation sequence (random.org). An independent researcher not otherwise involved in the research will allocate each group (A, B or C) as an active condition (with or without a facilitated bulletin board) or as the WLC. Participants will be randomly allocated on a ratio of 1:1:1 to these groups. The study researchers will be blind to the group allocation.</p><p>Randomisation is being conducted at an individual level rather than at organisation or team level. This allows us to control for group stressors such as large-scale redundancies and team deadlines. One of the risks of individual-level randomisation is contamination between the groups (i.e. participants in the WLC talking with participants in an active intervention). The extent of contamination between the study groups will be monitored.</p><p>Participants using the bulletin board will be required to use a pseudonym to maintain researcher blindness. Individual-level randomisation has been chosen to control for group stressors (i.e. organisational, department or team change).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria will be: age 18&#x000a0;years or over, employed by participating organisation, willingness to engage with an online CBT-based stress management intervention, access to a computer or tablet, access to the Internet, and a score of &#x02265;20 on the PSS-10. No exclusion criteria have been set.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p>The online CBT-based stress management intervention WorkGuru is presented on a secure platform that participants log on to using email addresses and a self-generated password. WorkGuru is a modular intervention that is based on the psychological principles of CBT, positive psychology, mindfulness and problem solving. It has been designed to increase self-awareness, improve flexible thinking and teach active coping skills. There are 10 modules that individuals can select to complete (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for more information). Seven of those modules comprise the core modules, which all participants will be advised to complete. The modules consist of a combination of educational reading and audio, short animations, and interactive exercises. Participants can complete a questionnaire and receive suggestions for modules that they may find useful, or they can chose the modules themselves. As well as the modules, participants can complete eight self-monitoring standardised questionnaires, for example: the Perceived Stress Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the Subjective Happiness Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the Brief Resilience Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Participants have the option to opt in to a weekly email (the Monday Morning Message) that will reinforce messages of positive thinking and healthy working practices. They can also set themselves email reminders to visit the site. To encourage engagement, the coach will contact each participant through the site three times during the course of the 8-week programme (when an account is created, at 2&#x000a0;weeks and at 6&#x000a0;weeks). Participants can chose to share their work with the coach, and to contact the coach at anytime through the site to ask for feedback or additional help or advice. The coach will respond within 24&#x000a0;h. The coach has a postgraduate-level qualification in executive coaching.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>WorkGuru modules</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Module title</th><th>Module content</th><th>Suggested completion time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Learn about me and my values<sup>a</sup>

Analysis of the secondary measures (psychological distress and subjective wellbeing) will also be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Missing data will be imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward method. For the engagement measures where no previous data is available, missing data will be imputed using the group mean. To check the robustness of the primary findings, sensitivity analysis including a per-protocol analysis will be performed. Per-protocol is defined as three or more logins to the WorkGuru site.

One explanation for this failure might be the additional challenge of achieving engagement and adherence to an online intervention that is delivered within a dynamic and busy working environment. This is also a challenge to conducting this real-world research: to what extent will a workplace setting impact on study recruitment and attrition? There is a danger that potential participants may be reluctant to engage with a stress management programme delivered via their workplace for fear of demonstrating vulnerability. We aim to counteract this by maintaining confidentiality between employee and employer. Employing organisations will not be informed of which employees are participating in the research. It may also be possible that the people that the intervention is aimed at (individuals experiencing stress) may feel so time-pressured that they are not willing to engage with the study. To counteract this while maintaining confidentiality, we will ask employers to provide a supporting statement suggesting that all employees participating in the research are given 1&#x000a0;h a week over the 8-week period to compete the programme. One of the aims of this pilot study is to gain a greater understanding of the ways to overcome the challenge of enabling employees to access online psychological interventions in the workplace, and to understand more about the challenges of conducting this research within a workplace setting.</p><p>Another challenge to this study is making an accurate prediction of effect size. A study by Hilvert-Bruce et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] compared adherence to an online CBT programme before and after changes had been made to the way that the intervention was delivered (adding choice of course and timing, and a requirement to pay a fee). Adherence increased after the changes had been made from 37.9% to 60%, an increase of 58%. The average number of lessons completed before the changes per user was 3.72 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and 4.63 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.7) after the changes. This was a significant difference <italic>t</italic>(1106)&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001. The Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> effect size was <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53. However, participants were recruited for the study via prescription from their GP or mental health professional. A stress management intervention, such as the one used in the present study which recruits participants with elevated (but not necessarily clinically significant) stress levels, is likely to report a smaller effect size than an intervention delivered within a clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which makes it difficult to calculate the predicted effect size. This pilot study, while underpowered so unable to allow us to draw definitive conclusions, will provide the parameters to inform the methods of a definitive trial.</p><p>The design of the stress management intervention (WorkGuru) is based on clear theoretical psychological principles, the efficacy for which has been proven in other studies for both face to face delivery (for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]), and for online delivery (for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]). However, the efficacy of the specific online intervention (WorkGuru) has not been established. For this reason a WLC condition has been included which will help to identify the effect of the treatment compared to no treatment. Comparing two active conditions: MSG and Discussion Group, enables the impact of the discussion group on engagement to be isolated.</p><p>Other studies have included online discussion groups as part of an online intervention (for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), but failed to either report usage data, differentiate the usage of the groups across the treatment groups, or analyse the impact of the discussion groups on the study outcomes. These studies are failing to include the group as a unique research variable but instead include it as one component of an intervention. This pilot study will address this failure by including the discussion group as the main research variable.</p><p>The study by Hilvert-Bruce et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found that noncompleters still benefited from the intervention but that greater adherence resulted in greater benefit. Adherence to WorkGuru has been established at three logins to the site. This baseline has been established from current WorkGuru usage and in reference to login data from studies on other health promotion sites (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). This pilot study will give a greater understanding of the extent to which participants are engaging with the intervention and will enable threshold levels of adherence to be refined.</p><p>One of the stated benefits of Internet-based or eHealth (the use of information and communication technology for health) interventions is that utilisation or dose can be objectively measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The most common objective exposure measure used in studies is login rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], other measures include number of pages visited, length of visit and sessions or modules completed. But to what extent do these measures accurately record engagement? Computer-based utilisation measures can register whether someone visits a page but not if they have meaningfully engaged with the material. Participants&#x02019; perception of their engagement may differ from the objective utilisation measure but it is not clear to what extent that is important. Is our perception of engagement or usage a better indicator of intervention exposure than an objective utilisation measure? This pilot study will help us to get a greater understanding of designing and interpreting utilisation measures, and a greater understanding of how that relates to outcome.</p><p>This study has two active groups (the MSG and the Discussion Group). While it is not possible to blind participants to the type of intervention that they receive, which could result in a bias in the self-reported measures, the inclusion of two active groups may limit this bias. A limitation of this study is that while it focuses on engagement the quantitative nature of the study does not allow exploration of why study participants may or may not engage with the intervention. A follow-up study using qualitative methodology is being planned to address this by gaining a greater understanding of the experiences of participants who failed to engage with the study, as well as of participants who did engage.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is that it is examining engagement and adherence to an online CBT-based stress management intervention within a real-world context (the workplace). If we want to increase access to evidence-based psychological interventions, and address the growing problem of poor employee psychological health then we need to get a better understanding of how we increase employee engagement to online psychological interventions. This study will help us to do that.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study that will isolate the effect of an online facilitated discussion group on adherence, engagement and effectiveness of an online CBT-based stress management intervention. This study could help to close the gap between the efficacy of online CBT-based interventions demonstrated within trials conducted in clinical settings and the effectiveness of online CBT-based interventions, delivered within real-world settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial began in March 2016 and is due to complete recruitment in June 2016.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p>
