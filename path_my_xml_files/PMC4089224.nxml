In a one-year follow-up, the patients were treated with simvastatin. These patients were compared with 82 matched controls receiving placebo tablets. At the end of the second and 12<sup>th</sup> month, PRA was rechecked in all patients. Those patients who underwent transplantation continued to take simvastatin six months after transplantation. Serum creatinine levels were checked at monthly intervals post-operation.</p><p>Results: The mean&#x000b1;SD PRA level at the end of the second month was 36.63%&#x000b1;31.14% and 45.34%&#x000b1;24.36% in cases and controls, respectively (P=0.012).

These patients were matched with 25 controls treating with placebo. The mean&#x000b1;SD creatinine level 6 months after kidney transplantation was 2.05&#x000b1;1.14 mg/dL and 3.15&#x000b1;1.09 mg/dL in cases and controls consecutively (P=0.02).</p><p>Conclusion: Simvastatin can be safely used to lower PRA and improve post-transplantation outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Panel reactive antibody (PRA)</kwd><kwd>Renal transplantation</kwd><kwd>Simvastatin</kwd><kwd>Dialysis</kwd><kwd>End-stage renal disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has been proved that presence of panel reactive antibodies (PRAs) in the sera of renal transplant candidates is associated with hyperacute or delayed humoral immune responses against the graft after transplantation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, these sensitized patients must wait for a long time to find a crossmatched negative kidney as donor for transplantation [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As a result, some modalities such as plasmaphresis and intravenous immuonoglobulin (IVIG) in combination with immunosuppressive drugs have been used to overcome this problem [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently, use of statins&#x02014;antihyperlipidemic agents&#x02014;like simvastatin, pravastatin, <italic>etc.</italic> has been proposed to be a safer and more effective method for desensitization [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on lowering serum PRAs in highly sensitized renal transplant candidates and to evaluate its role in prevention of acute rejection after renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients:</p><p>From 750 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who were in the waiting list for renal transplantation or referred to our nephrology clinic in Shiraz Transplant Center, 164 patients who met our criteria, were included in this study. Using a simple random method, these patients were randomized to the patient and control groups, each consisted of 82 patients.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: </p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients from both sexes aged from 18 to 75 years old.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with ESRD on hemo- or peritoneal dialysis.

Then, all of the 82 patients received 20 mg/day oral simvastatin for two months. Patients in the control group received the same dose of the same shape starch tablets as placebo during these two months. At the end of the second month, PRA was checked for all the patients again. PRA testing was done using the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).</p><p>We continued treatment with simvastatin for 12 months by checking liver enzymes (AST, ALT) every two months and PRA at the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> month. In patients who complained of myalgia and muscle weakness, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was also determined to watch any side effects of simvastatin. The control group were also treated with placebo tablets for 12 months. The complete response to simvastatin was defined as a drop of PRA to &#x0003c;25%. Rejection episodes were proven by kidney biopsy.</p><p>Statistical analysis:</p><p>All parameters were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD and analyzed with SPSS software for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) using <italic>Student&#x02019;s t</italic> test for paired data and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for comparison of categorical data.

Twenty-five (33%) of 75 patients underwent renal transplantation after a mean&#x000b1;SD period of 6.45&#x000b1;3.56 months since beginning of simvastatin therapy. Eleven patients received their kidneys from living unrelated donors, five from living related and nine from deceased donor in both cases and controls. These 25 patients were matched with 25 renal transplanted controls. From these 25 patients, three were lost to follow-up. Other 22 transplanted patients were followed for six months after transplantation receiving the same dose of simvastatin. The controls received placebo for six months and all of them completed the study. The mean&#x000b1;SD serum creatinine level six months after kidney transplantation was 2.05&#x000b1;1.14 and 3.15&#x000b1;1.09 mg/dL in cases and controls, respectively (P=0.02). The mean creatinine level at the end of the study (1.37&#x000b1;1.61 mg/dL) showed a significant reduction in comparison to the initial values (P=0.001). </p><p>Two patients presented with graft loss and became dependent on hemodialysis again. Others remained dialysis free with well functioning kidneys. None of the patients presented with liver failure or rhabdomyolysis during the follow-up period. </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>At the first stage of this study, we treated sensitized ESRD patients with simvastatin. Then, we continued simvastatin therapy in those who underwent kidney transplantation. Glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis comprised a significant proportion of known causes of ESRD in sensitized patients. This study revealed that simvastatinn treatment in cases decreased PRA level significantly compared to the controls treated with placebo. Simvastatin also improved the outcomes after kidney transplantation.</p><p>Interesting results have been reported in clinical trials investigating immunomodulatory role of simvastatin. Truncer, <italic>et al.</italic>, reported that the rate of acute rejection was lower in renal transplant patients using simvastatin and pravastatin in comparison with those patients who did not receive these medications [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other studies suggest that pravastatin also decreases the incidence of both clinically severe acute rejection episodes and natural killer cell cytotoxicity after orthotopic heart transplantation [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Results of another study by Ozdemir and co-workers revealed that continuous simvastatin therapy is effective for treatment of highly sensitized patients and is also effective on graft survival of this group of patients [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite investigations in favor of the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in treatment of sensitized patients, it is still a topic of controversy. Ossareh, <italic>et al</italic>., did not observe any useful effects with lovastatin [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mahmoud, <italic>et al</italic>., reported that administration of neither IVIG nor simvastatin alone cannot effectively inhibit preformed HLA-antibodies to allow successful renal transplantation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>This study provided evidence suggesting the role of simvastatin in decreasing PRA level. It also showed that simvastatin may improve the outcome of patients after renal transplantation. Larger sample size and proper duration of follow-up are strength of our study compared to other similar studies conducted on this issue. Considering the presence of many confounding variables including age of patients, causes of ESRD, causes of sensitization, type and duration of dialysis as well as limited number of patients in each categories, there are few controlled trials regarding the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the treatment of sensitized patients.</p><p>Further studies, especially large placebo controlled trials may be more useful and conclusive regarding the use of simvastatin in the treatment of sensitized patients before transplantation along with its usage as a protective medication in acute rejection after renal transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p> The authors would like to thank Ms. Karbalaeevand and Fars province blood transfusion organization for their kind cooperation in this study.
