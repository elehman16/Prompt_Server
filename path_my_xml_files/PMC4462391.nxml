We aimed to compare hepatotoxicity of anastrozole with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Three hundred and fifty-three Chinese postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer were randomized to anastrozole or tamoxifen after optimal primary therapy. The primary end-point was fatty liver disease, defined as a liver&#x02013;spleen ratio &#x0003c;0.9 as determined using a computed tomography scan. The secondary end-points included abnormal liver function and treatment failure during the 3-year follow up. The cumulative incidence of fatty liver disease after 3&#x000a0;years was lower in the anastrozole arm than that of tamoxifen (14.6% <italic>vs</italic> 41.1%, <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0001; relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21&#x02013;0.45). However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of abnormal liver function (24.6% <italic>vs</italic> 24.7%, <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.61). Interestingly, a higher treatment failure rate was observed in the tamoxifen arm compared with anastrozole and median times to treatment failure were 15.1&#x000a0;months and 37.1&#x000a0;months, respectively (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0001; HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20&#x02013;0.37). The most commonly reported adverse events were &#x02018;reproductive system disorders&#x02019; in the tamoxifen group (17.1%), and &#x02018;musculoskeletal disorders&#x02019; in the anastrozole group (14.6%). Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant anastrozole displayed less fatty liver disease, suggesting that this drug had a more favorable hepatic safety profile than tamoxifen and may be preferred for patients with potential hepatic dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anastrozole</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>hepatotoxicity</kwd><kwd>tamoxifen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Breast cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in women in both developing and developed countries.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the Chinese cancer registries, breast cancer incidence rates were ranked sixth in the general population (21.21/100&#x000a0;000) and first among women (42.55/100&#x000a0;000), causing 10.24/100&#x000a0;000 deaths in the Chinese female population in 2009,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which has increased from the 9.31/100&#x000a0;000 mortality rate registered in 2007.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The estrogen antagonist tamoxifen is one of the most firmly established drugs used as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer and is considered a valuable option for hormone receptor (HR)-sensitive early breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, anastrozole, a highly selective, non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), has demonstrated superior efficacy over tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal hormone-sensitive early stage breast cancer in terms of recurrence-free survival and tolerability.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Adjuvant endocrine therapies for breast cancer span at least 5&#x000a0;years, creating long-lasting side-effects, which often results in non-adherence or change of medication.

In the present study, the primary end-point was the incidence of fatty liver disease defined as a liver&#x02013;spleen ratio &#x0003c;0.9 on hepatic CT scan. The secondary end-points included abnormal liver function as well as treatment failure during the 3-year follow up. We observed that participants treated with anastrozole displayed less fatty liver disease cases than those in the tamoxifen group, suggesting a more favorable liver safety profile for anastrozole, which should be preferred for patients with potential hepatic dysfunction.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Postmenopausal women with histologically proven HR-positive invasive breast cancer underwent all optimal treatments for their disease (primary surgery and, in some cases, chemotherapy) before enrollment in the present study.

Three hundred and fifty-three patients were randomized in this prospective, multicenter, comparative, open-label study. Patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive anastrozole 1&#x000a0;mg (AstraZeneca, London, UK) or tamoxifen 20&#x000a0;mg (first Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Ltd, then Shanghai Fudan Fuhua Pharmaceutical Ltd, Shanghai, China) orally, once daily.</p><p>The primary end-point was incidence of fatty liver disease, defined as a liver&#x02013;spleen ratio of &#x0003c;0.9 on hepatic CT images. The extent of steatosis was classified according to CT liver&#x02013;spleen ratios as mild (0.5&#x02013;0.9), moderate (0&#x02013;0.5) or severe (&#x0003c;0).<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The CT scans were performed at baseline and at 48&#x000a0;weeks&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;days, 96&#x000a0;weeks&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;days and 144&#x000a0;weeks&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;days. If a subject was withdrawn, a CT scan was performed if the previous one was performed more than 6&#x000a0;months previously. The CT scan interpretations were performed by a radiologist at each institution and were centrally reviewed by an independent radiologist. Whenever the radiologist from an institution and the central radiologist disagreed on the CT scan results, the central radiologist's view prevailed. Secondary end-points were: (i) incidence of abnormal liver function, defined as AST, ALT, AKP, GGT or TB concentrations more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range; and (ii) time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as the time between randomization and earliest occurrence of fatty liver disease, breast cancer recurrence or withdrawal from study treatment for any reason, including death from any cause. The severity of abnormal liver function was classified into grades 1&#x02013;4 according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 3.0.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The decision criteria bout the adverse events of anastrozole and tamoxifen were the same as those used in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) and the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trials,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> based on the severity grading classified as: mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated); moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities); or severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).</p><p>Patients were followed up for 3&#x000a0;years regardless of whether they discontinued treatment, unless there was evidence of treatment failure, including fatty liver disease detected using hepatic CT scan (confirmed by two blinded experts) or breast cancer recurrence, or withdrawn consent for any reason. Further treatments were made at the investigators' discretion in the case of discontinued participation in the study. In the event of liver function abnormality, continuation of study medication and/or initiation of specific treatment were at the investigators' discretion as well. However, follow ups were made as planned for patients who remained under study treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessment</title><p>At baseline, all patients were assessed by physical examination and appropriate radiological tests. In addition, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, hematology, blood chemistry and coagulation profiles were obtained before randomization. All assessments were repeated every 3&#x000a0;months until patients developed disease and all adverse events were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted according to a pre-defined data analysis plan. The intention to treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomized patients. Primary statistical analyses of the end-points were performed on an ITT basis. The full analysis set population, which excluded patients who were randomized and not treated with study medications, constituted an additional analysis population. All patients who took at least one dose of the study medication were included in the safety population used to analyze drug safety.</p><p>It was reported that tamoxifen induced NAFLD in 30&#x02013;43.2% of patients as detected using imaging.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Power analysis revealed that a Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level had 80% power to detect a difference between 35% and 20% incidence of fatty liver disease between the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups, respectively, with a sample size of 150 in each group. After adjusting for 10% of non-evaluable patients, 334 patients were randomized using sequentially numbered envelopes in a ratio of 1:1, with 167 in each arm.</p><p>Fisher's exact test was performed to assess statistical differences in frequencies such as incidence of fatty liver disease and abnormal liver function test. The Chi-squared test was used to test differences in the proportions of steatosis levels and liver biochemistry grading. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to assess TTF and a log-rank test allowed comparison of the treatment groups. Adverse events were summarized by actual treatment received. The incidence of adverse events was summarized by body system and preferred term for each of the two randomized treatment groups. Physical examination and laboratory data were summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables or frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables. Laboratory values outside the normal reference ranges were collected.</p><p>SAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients' characteristics</title><p>Between September 2007 and February 2009, 353 estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive breast cancer patients (175 and 178 patients in the tamoxifen and anastrozole arms, respectively) were randomized in 28 Chinese centers. The last patient completed the last visit on 28 December 2011. Eleven patients in the tamoxifen group did not receive treatment during the study.

presented at least one drug-related adverse event in the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups, respectively. Of note, most drugs-related adverse events were mild or moderate in both groups. Eight (2.3%) patients experienced a total of 10 non-fatal but serious adverse events during the treatment period, none of which was related to the study medication. Overall, 25 (7.3%) patients discontinued study treatment due to adverse events, with 16 (9.8%) and 9 (5.1%) in the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups, respectively. Fewer patients experienced arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain and bone pain in the tamoxifen group, while fewer reported vaginal discharge, vaginal hemorrhage and endometrial hypertrophy in the anastrozole group. Only two severe bone pain events were reported in the anastrozole group. Other adverse events reported showed similar frequency in both study arms. Overall, both drugs were well tolerated.</p><p>No death due to disease progression was reported. However, two patients died from serious adverse events (cor pulmonale for one and acute myocardial infarction for the other) during the present study. Both were in the anastrozole group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tamoxifen has been used for many years as the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positive early breast cancer. However, third-generation AI, including anastrozole, letrozole (non-steroidal) and exemestane (steroidal), have shown superior efficacy to tamoxifen, either as initial monotherapy or as adjuvant endocrine therapy after 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years treatment with tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with HR-positive early breast cancer.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, considering that endocrine therapy is a long-term treatment, drug toxicity is a very important factor to consider besides efficacy. Indeed, it was reported that more than 30% of patients using tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for breast cancer would develop hepatic steatosis.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> No prospective study investigated whether AI are better for liver safety than tamoxifen, although several large randomized trials have reported that tamoxifen and AI had distinct toxicity profiles.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the present prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study we compared anastrozole and tamoxifen hepatotoxicity in the adjuvant setting. Incidence of fatty liver disease and TTF values demonstrated that anastrozole was associated with less hepatotoxicity compared with tamoxifen. In addition, there were more patients who had TTF due to patient withdrawal in the tamoxifen group, mostly due to adverse effects. Our TTF rate was similar to previous studies.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Ultrasound is widely used in fatty liver disease diagnosis, but this method is operator dependent and less reproducible. In the present study, CT scan was used for detection of fatty liver disease cases. We observed a lower incidence of fatty liver disease in anastrozole-treated patients compared with the tamoxifen group (14.6% <italic>vs</italic> 41.1%). When disease severity was evaluated, all cases were graded as mild, without severe event.</p><p>Estrogen positively affects lipid metabolism and tamoxifen increases the hepatic fat content by blocking estrogen function in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are unknown.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Tamoxifen acts as a competitive&#x000a0;antagonist&#x000a0;of the&#x000a0;ER&#x000a0;in&#x000a0;tissues, while anastrozole directly decreases the circulating plasma estrogen levels. Therefore, further investigation is needed to understand the important difference in fatty liver disease induction after treatment with anastrozole and tamoxifen. Interestingly, we noticed that the incidence of NAFLD and NASH due to tamoxifen was approximately 20&#x02013;30%, most of which were reported by authors from Asia. No specific data on hepatic steatosis were reported in previous trials, including the ATAC, BIG 1-98, Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) and The Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) trials.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This may be due to the low incidence of hepatotoxicity and to the lack of data about variations of tamoxifen and AI efficacy and toxicity between races.</p><p>Abnormal liver function is often observed in drug-related hepatotoxicity. Our data showed no difference in abnormal liver function between patients treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen. These findings, together with higher fatty liver disease incidence in the tamoxifen group, suggest that there is no direct relationship between hepatic steatosis and abnormal liver function. However, more patients with abnormal AKP and TB were detected in the anastrozole group. Interestingly, anastrozole treatment was found to be associated with AKP increase in the ATAC trial.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This phenomenon is not well understood and more studies are needed to fill the knowledge gap. In addition, we evaluated five parameters of liver function (ALT, AST, AKP, GGT and TB) and observed 29 (16.6%) and 36 (20.2%) patients with abnormal liver function in the tamoxifen and anastrozole groups, respectively (excluding patients lost to follow up). These results contrast with the results from the National Cancer Institute of Cancada (NCIC) nnnMA.27, in which only 3% of patients presented liver function abnormalities as indicated by ALT, AST or bilirubin levels.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> An Italian tamoxifen chemoprevention trial showed that 78 (3.1%) tamoxifen-treated women had a single elevation of ALT compared with 92 (3.6%) placebo-treated women, while 42 (1.7%) had multiple elevations of ALT compared with 22 (0.9%). Of these 64 women with multiple elevations of ALT, 12 tested positive for hepatitis C virus.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The TTF, a parameter that depends on many factors, was significantly longer in the anastrozole group compared with tamoxifen-treated patients, mainly due to the lower incidence of fatty liver disease observed in the anastrozole arm. The safety and tolerability parameters were comparable in both groups. Adverse events detected in the present study were mild and moderate, consistent with previous reports, including the ATAC trial. Adverse events caused by endocrine therapies can negatively affect the quality of life, considering the long treatment duration. Indeed, treatment-related symptoms can result in poor adherence to therapy or early treatment discontinuation, and therefore worst breast cancer outcomes.</p><p>The present study has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, we acknowledge the possibility that open-label trials might influence the reporting of adverse events. However, we were unable to obtain placebo pills for anastrozole. Second, the follow-up time used in the present study, 3&#x000a0;years, may appear to be short. Nishino <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> have demonstrated that 43.2% of patients developed hepatic steatosis within the first 2&#x000a0;years of treatment, with no apparent correlation between duration of medication and disease development. Hepatic steatosis rapidly reversed after completion of tamoxifen therapy, with a mean recovery time of 1.2&#x000a0;years.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition, Murata <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that 40/105 patients developed hepatic steatosis while receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, with 35 developing the disease within the first 2&#x000a0;years of treatment. Based on these findings, the duration of follow up was selected as 3&#x000a0;years in the present study. In contrast, although steatosis is non-progressive, patients with NASH/advanced stage fibrosis are at risk of developing liver complications within 7&#x000a0;years.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Fibrosis progression, largely associated with cirrhosis, may be affected by amounts of liver fat, degree of steatohepatitis and a variety of other sensitizing factors.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Nevertheless, it is not yet clear how this happened in patients with hepatic steatosis in the HEART study. Third, we performed a CT scan at baseline only to determine if the patients already suffered from hepatic fatty disease, but we did not record the liver&#x02013;spleen ratio, preventing us from making adjustments based on the baseline value. Fourth, we did not assess further treatments for discontinued participation that can potentially cause fatty liver disease. Indeed, after withdrawal, treatment was at each physician's discretion and no follow-up data are available for these patients. Fifth, we did not record the HER2 status. Indeed, as in the ATAC and BIG 1-98 trials,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we assumed that patients received all optimal primary treatments for their cancer. Last, one-third of the world's individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) reside in China, with 130 million carriers and 30 million chronically infected.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It is unfortunate that HBV infection history was not collected in the present study, rendering it impossible to determine whether high frequency of hepatic steatosis or abnormal liver function was associated with HBV. Except for obesity, no other risk factors for NASH (such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia) were taken into account. The three AI differentially affect lipid metabolism. Some studies have shown that anastrozole and exemestane do not negatively affect the lipid profile, although evidence suggests that letrozole does.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Hypercholesterolemia is a well-known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. In the ATAC trial, although lipid levels were not assessed, hypercholesterolemia incidence was higher in patients treated with anastrozole than those in the tamoxifen group; no difference was observed in the occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events and death, while there were more cerebrovascular events and deaths in the tamoxifen group compared with the anastrozole arm.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>In summary, our results suggest that anastrozole treatment results in less fatty liver disease incidence than tamoxifen. No difference was found in liver function parameters between the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups. In contrast, TTF of anastrozole was significantly longer compared with that of tamoxifen. Although tamoxifen and anastrozole showed distinct safety profiles, both drugs were well tolerated. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, especially in different ethnicities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all study participants, the trial investigators, nurses, data managers, pharmacists and other staff at the participating local hospitals, various collaborators and the staff members of data management at AstraZeneca.</p></ack><sec><title>Disclosure Statement</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarron</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Parkin</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The changing global patterns of female breast cancer incidence and mortality</article-title><source>Breast Cancer Res</source><year>2004</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>229</fpage><lpage>39</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15535852</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Report of incidence and mortality in China cancer registries, 2009</article-title><source>Chin J Cancer Res</source><year>2013</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23372337</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>WQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2007</article-title><source>Chin J Cancer Res</source><year>2012</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23359628</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><element-citation publication-type="other"><collab>NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Breast Cancer</collab><year>2006</year><comment>NCCN Version 1.2006</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuzick</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Baum</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Results of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial after completion of 5&#x000a0;years' adjuvant treatment for breast cancer</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>365</volume><fpage>60</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15639680</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amir</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Seruga</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Niraula</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlsson</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ocana</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Toxicity of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>J Natl Cancer Inst</source><year>2011</year><volume>103</volume><fpage>1299</fpage><lpage>309</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21743022</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b7"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lasso De La Vega</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Zapater</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Such</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Toxic hepatitis associated with tamoxifen use.
