is still noted that a lot of survivors remain with functional deficits, which influence
their quality of life and even constrain them from performing basic functions. Because a
patient does not try to use the affected arm, regaining function of the upper extremity may
be challenging. Moreover, increasing the upper limb function is not often the focus in the
initial stage of rehabilitation for these patients; instead, therapy is more concentrated on
their gait ability. A few studies have introduced quality interventions to improve the upper
limb function after stroke, which entail task-oriented, repetitive, and specific
task-training, such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), virtual reality (VR), and
interactive video games<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR, combined
with an interactive video game, is becoming popular as a way to encourage repetitive
movements, which are challenging for post-stroke patients. VR can offer task-oriented,
random, and progressive learning training, and feedback concerning performance and results
are increased, which stimulate and engage players<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR, using feedback from vision, facilitates the patients to commit
to the training because the patients are seeing their movements that help them adjust the
center of their body, which has resulted from their body image deficit after stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, VR provides a virtual background
that is collaborative, and perceived as related to the real world, which can stimulate
sensory information<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Post-stroke patients
need to be rehabilitated to improve their body balance to avoid falls, which is the most
crucial complication after stroke. For these reasons, VR, which focuses on stimulating
functional activities, can be an influential method for neurologic patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many papers have shown the effect
of VR for the past several years, it would still be difficult to find a study that used VR
on post-stroke patients, with subjects divided into groups, depending on the lesions in the
different regions of the brain. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether a VR
intervention has an influence in the improvement of motor function and activities of daily
living (ADLs) in post-stroke patients with lesions in the different regions of the
brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eleven subjects with hemiplegic stroke were recruited from H hospital in Bucheon, Republic
of Korea to participate in this study, which was conducted from January to February, 2017.
Before the initiation of the study, all subjects provided a written informed consent. This
study was granted ethical approval by the Ethics Committee of Gacheon University (IRB. No:
1044396&#x02013;201701-HR-014&#x02013;01). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) adults with
hemiplegia with onset for the past 6 months, (2) no limited range of motion in the upper
extremities, and (3) no visual deficit<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The subjects were divided into either the middle cerebral artery group (MCAG) or the basal
ganglia group (BGG), depending on the region in which the lesion was detected in the brain.
They received a VR intervention once a day for 30&#x02005;min, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Three of
the 5 VR programs were randomly selected for the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The virtual reality programs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-2103-g001"/></fig>). Motion-controlled VR games, like the Nintendo Wii and Sports, were used in this
study<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)
and the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) were used to assess the
patients&#x02019; motor function and ADLs, respectively. The upper limb sub-tests of the FMA include
the examination of sensation, range of motion, reflexes, synergy, and fine and gross hand
movements. A 3-point scale was used to grade each movement, and the entire score for the
upper limb ranges from 0 to 60 points. The higher score indicates a good function of the
upper extremities. Reliability was good (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.97)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The K-MBI evaluates independence in ADLs in
patients recovering from stroke. This test comprises 10 sub-tests in ADL. Depending on the
amount of assistance needed, the sub-test is graded using a 5-point scale. The lowest total
score is 0 and the highest total score is 100. The higher score shows more independence in
ADL function. The K-MBI proved to have good inter-rater reliabilities (r=0.93&#x02013;0.98) and
internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha=0.84). In construct validation, each item of the
K-MBI had a substantial association with the total score of K-MBI (r=0.54&#x02013;0.78)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that this study followed a normal
distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a paired t-test and an independent t-test
were used to compare the results of the pre- and post-interventions in a group and between
the two groups, respectively, using SPSS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

individual&#x02019;s nervous system and thus take advantage of neuroplasticity to stimulate both
motor and cognitive systems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
previous study, a significant progress in Arm and CS sub-test outcomes was detected in the
VR group. Repetitive and concentrated task training commitment resulted in a precise
progression, which better improved arm function than wrist and hand function in the FMA.
Moreover, visual feedback may stimulate neurological changes that help recover motor
functions, such as mirror neuron firing rates and cortical reorganization<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, significant differences in
Arm and Hand outcomes exist in the MCAG. Moreover, the BGG had more noticeable influences in
all areas of the FMA. This effect was because patients with hemiplegia, caused either by
hemorrhage or infarction in the middle cerebral artery, would have more serious functional
disorders in the upper extremities. Motor and sensory homunculi have shown the somatotopic
arrangement of the body in the brain, and the upper limbs are controlled by the lateral part
of the brain, which is supplied with blood by the middle cerebral artery. In this manner, VR
improved the upper limb function of patients in the BGG better than those in the MCAG. This
result indicates that patients in the BGG have neuroplasticity in the brain, which is
consistent with the results of the study conducted by Jang and colleagues who investigated
the effects of VR therapy on cortical reorganization and motor recovery of 5 chronic stroke
patients and demonstrated VR-induced neuroplastic changes using fMRI<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, K-MBI scores were significantly improved in the
previous study. The score of the self-care items in the K-MBI improved considerably in each
intervention group<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Broeren and
colleagues reported that patients prefer to use the affected arm, and affected arm movements
could be enhanced via VR. Thus, relevant ADL performance can be improved<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, there were significant
differences in the total score of K-MBI in both the MCAG and the BGG. This implied that VR
brought about movements of the distal part of the body, resulting in better core stability,
thereby increasing the sub-test scores in K-MBI. In general, this study revealed that the
use of VR in the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients improved their upper limb motor
function and ADL. In addition, patients with brain damage in the basal ganglia showed more
improvement than those with brain damage in the MCA. A study with a computerized assessment
tool, such as an fMRI or tractography, should be conducted in the future for better
evidence.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Stockley</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Connor</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A mixed methods small pilot study to describe the effects
