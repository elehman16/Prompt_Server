It is worn by the patient on the chest or upper outer arm and is self-adhesive. It employs iontophoresis to deliver fentanyl across intact skin which then diffuses into the systemic circulation and is transported to the central nervous system. When the patient activates a dose by double-pressing a button, the system delivers a dose of fentanyl over a period of 10&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fentanyl ITS has a well-documented efficacy and safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been shown to be more efficacious than placebo in three Phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and to have similar efficacy to morphine intravenous (IV) PCA in four Phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It was approved for use by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 30, 2015 and by the European Commission on November 19, 2015.</p><p>The fentanyl ITS system comprises a controller and a drug unit that are snapped together by the health-care professional before being attached to the patient&#x02019;s chest or upper outer arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fentanyl ITS drug unit contains no components or materials that could be affected by diagnostic X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans or radiofrequency identification (RFID) transmitters. The fentanyl ITS controller contains semiconductor components that could potentially be affected by radiation from diagnostic X-rays, CT scans or RFID transmitters. The controller has four primary modes of operation as described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The fentanyl ITS was tested and verified to be in compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601-1-2 (Medical electrical equipment&#x02014;Part 1&#x02013;2: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance-collateral standard: electromagnetic disturbances&#x02014;requirements and tests) at frequencies and field strength levels for a hospital environment. All medical devices must meet this standard to be approved for use. X-rays and CT scans are commonly utilized in the hospital setting as are RFID devices. RFID transmitters are located throughout hospitals including patient rooms and are utilized to track assets (e.g., IV PCA pumps) and monitor patients. The current US prescribing information indicates that fentanyl ITS should be removed prior to X-ray or CT scan and also recommends a separation distance of 2.3&#x000a0;m between fentanyl ITS and RFID transmitters. In these two studies, the function of the fentanyl ITS was evaluated during and after exposure to X-ray and RFID transmitters to determine whether the prescribed separation distance and the removal precautions are necessary.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Description of each mode of operation of the fentanyl ITS</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Mode</th><th align="left">LED</th><th align="left">LCD</th><th align="left">Audio</th><th align="left">Current output</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Ready Mode</td><td align="left">Slow flashing green</td><td align="left">Completed dose count</td><td align="left">None</td><td align="left">Off</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Dose Mode</td><td align="left">Fast flashing green</td><td align="left">Completed dose count/progress indicator</td><td align="left">Single long tone</td><td align="left">Enabled</td></tr><tr><td align="left">End-of-Use Mode</td><td align="left">Off</td><td align="left">Flashing completed dose count</td><td align="left">None</td><td align="left">Off</td></tr><tr><td align="left">End-of-Life Mode</td><td align="left">Flashing red</td><td align="left">Completed dose count</td><td align="left">Repeated short tones</td><td align="left">Off</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

The ITS controller contains semiconductor components that could potentially be affected by radiation from X-rays, CT scans or from radiofrequency (RF) energy typical of RFID transmitters. The drug unit was not evaluated since it does not contain any components or materials that could be affected by diagnostic X-rays or RF energy from RFID transmitters.

At the start of the study, the controller and the placebo drug unit were assembled. Once assembled, the green light-emitting diode flashed continuously and the liquid&#x02013;crystal display shows 0 for dose count indicating normal activation of the system. This mode of operation is defined as the &#x0201c;Ready Mode&#x0201d;. Five ITS Placebo systems were tested in the Ready Mode and 5 ITS Placebo systems were tested after dose activation (i.e., the dose button had been depressed twice within 3&#x000a0;s to initiate a dose, defined as the &#x0201c;Dose Mode&#x0201d;).</p><p>The X-ray test equipment was set to 150&#x000a0;kV and to exposure durations necessary to provide radiation doses of 20 and 200&#x000a0;mSv. The 20&#x000a0;mSv dose exceeds the typical range used for both X-ray and CT scan. The 200&#x000a0;mSv dose greatly exceeds the typical radiation dose to simulate multiple exposures or unusual variations in the CT procedure to ensure that the test conditions provided a wide margin of safety.</p><p>Each ITS Placebo system in the Ready Mode was connected to a test fixture with a connector for monitoring the electrical performance of the controller. Half of the ITS Placebo systems were activated to enter the Dose Mode. A digital multimeter was connected to the test fixture to record the voltage output from the controller over a 10-min dosing period. System status in the Ready and Dose Modes was monitored throughout the test. The controller output currents were calculated from the voltage measurements using Ohm&#x02019;s law.

CT scans and radiography work on the same basic principle: an X-ray beam is passed through the body where a portion of the X-rays are either absorbed or scattered by the internal structures, and the remaining X-ray pattern is transmitted to a detector (i.e., film or computer screen) for recording or further processing by a computer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Common diagnostic X-ray and CT systems produce (peak) tube potentials in the range of 25&#x02013;150&#x000a0;kilovolts (kVp). Evaluations of X-ray trends (Nationwide Evaluation of X-Ray Trends) indicate that clinical practice utilizes peak tube potentials up to 109&#x000a0;kVp for X-ray and up to 127&#x000a0;kVp for CT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Estimates of the effective dose from diagnostic X-ray are in the range of 0.02&#x02013;8&#x000a0;millisievert (mSv). Estimates of the effective dose from CT scans are in the range of 2&#x02013;16&#x000a0;mSv and can vary by a factor of 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The results from this study indicate that the fentanyl ITS system will continue to work normally even when exposed to the level of radiation seen in X-rays or CT scans and at a level 25&#x000d7; higher than the typical X-ray and 10&#x000d7; higher than the typical CT scan. In this study, ITS Placebo systems performed as expected in the Ready Mode with the dose current off and in the Dose Mode when the nominal target dose current of 170&#x000a0;&#x000b5;A was administered for 10&#x000a0;min. It is important to note the ITS continued to operate as expected even though radiation exposure was 10&#x000d7; the normal level. These data support the conclusion that the fentanyl ITS can be used safely and effectively when exposed to diagnostic X-rays or CT scans, and therefore the system does not need to be removed from patients.</p><p>However, as with other radio-opaque devices, health-care providers do need to consider placement of the fentanyl ITS and potential X-rays and CT scans, because while radiation does not affect the system, it is radiopaque and therefore could obstruct the X-ray or CT scan image. For example, if a patient needs a chest X-ray postoperatively, it would be advisable to place the system on the arm; conversely, if the patient has some reason to need an upper arm or shoulder X-ray, then the system can be placed on the chest or the opposite arm. The small system size and the site placement options for the system are versatile enough that with some forethought it should not create an issue with radiology.</p><p>It is important to note that fentanyl ITS is not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fentanyl ITS contains metal parts and therefore must be removed and properly disposed of before an MRI procedure. Following an MRI procedure, another fentanyl ITS device can then be applied.</p><p>RFID devices are located throughout hospitals. They are commonly used to track medications, patients, nurses, doctors, and equipment in real time. The FDA has set up a program to work with manufacturers of potentially susceptible medical devices to test their products for any adverse effects from RFID exposures. Therefore, it is critical that any device (including PCA pumps) be compatible with RFID devices; the fentanyl ITS system met all those standards. While the RFID devices are typically situated at some distance from a patient, the current study evaluated the effect of exposure with direct contact to the controller to encompass the most extreme possibility. For all test conditions, the system operated normally in all operating modes including the Ready or Dose Modes. This is especially important as the use of RFID devices in hospitals continues to expand.</p><p>It is important to note that this study was conducted on the second-generation fentanyl ITS which is the currently marketed system. With the first-generation system, it was determined that the co-packaging of the electronics within the same primary packaging as the hydrogels exposed the electronics to extreme humidity that could potentially damage the electronics and potentially result in self-initiation of the system. The challenges to the first system were unrelated to radiation or RFID. The second-generation system was designed to fully address the earlier issues by separating the hydrogels in the drug unit from the electronic circuit of the controller during manufacture and storage, which removed the primary cause of corrosion and thereby improved reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it was conducted in the laboratory versus a hospital setting such that the laboratory data has to be extrapolated to the clinical setting. The study was designed to test the system under conditions that would translate to a hospital setting. In addition, the study tested extreme circumstances to demonstrate a large margin of safety. Specifically, the system was tested with radiation levels that were 25&#x000d7; higher than the typical X-ray and 10&#x000d7; higher than the typical CT scan. For RFID, the system and the RFID were positioned adjacently, while in the hospital some distance would exist. It would not be possible to conduct a study under such conditions utilizing patients, and overall these results inform conditions of use in clinical practice. It is also important to note that this system has been tested in a comprehensive, multi-study Phase 3 clinical program that showed the system to be efficacious with a safety profile consistent with the administration of all opioid medications. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Collectively, the clinical and laboratory data provide a set of data that demonstrates the safe and effective use of the fentanyl ITS system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study support the conclusion that the fentanyl ITS can be used safely and effectively in hospitals utilizing the RFID technology at any distance. Also, the fentanyl ITS is not affected by exposure to radiation levels well beyond those typical of diagnostic X-rays or CT scans. These results should provide added confidence to clinicians that the fentanyl ITS system can be used during X-rays and CT scans as well as in the proximity of RFID devices.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/12E4F0600457B40F">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/12E4F0600457B40F</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Sponsorship, article processing charges, and the open access charge for this study were funded by The Medicines Company.
