However, bilateral pathology is common in this patient population, and in long-term follow-up, the contralateral side does not represent a stable control.

Additionally, RCTs have not examined outcomes in terms of the signs and symptoms commonly assessed in this patient population.

Strength measurements were performed using a handheld dynamometer (Lafayette Instruments) for shoulder flexion in the scapular plane with maximum humeral internal rotation (empty can), shoulder flexion with humeral external rotation (full can), shoulder abduction at 10&#x000b0; of abduction, and ER at 0&#x000b0; of abduction. The patient was instructed to resist with maximal force, and the tester performed a break test.

The shoulder was prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A diagnostic arthroscopy via standard anterior and posterior portals was performed. The rotator cuff tendon was debrided, and the greater tuberosity was gently abraded using a bur to allow bleeding from the greater tuberosity footprint. SR repairs were performed with double-loaded 5-mm Bio-Corkscrew anchors (Arthrex). The No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex) sutures were passed through the cuff using a Scorpion Needle (Arthrex) in a horizontal mattress configuration and arthroscopically tied using a Duncan loop knot. The sutures were placed approximately 10 mm from the tendon edge and approximately 10 mm apart.</p><p>DR repairs were performed using the modified DR suture bridge technique. For the medial row, two 5-mm anchors were used (Bio-Corkscrew FT; Arthrex), double loaded with suture (FiberWire). Anchor placement was in the medial footprint at the articular margin. The anchors were placed as far anteriorly and posteriorly as possible within the margins of the tear to maximize the pressurized contact area. Both limbs from each of the 2 sutures were passed through the tendon (Scorpion Needle) at least 5 mm distal to the musculotendinous junction in a double mattress fashion, resulting in 4 mattress stitches medially. After the medial row was tied, the suture limbs were crossed to create suture bridges across the tendon. To complete the lateral row, two 4.57-mm SwiveLock anchors (Arthrex) were fully inserted at an angle perpendicular to the cortical surface at the lateral aspect of the greater tuberosity.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2325967116667398"><title>Rehabilitation</title><p>Postoperative rehabilitation was identical for both groups. For the first 4 weeks, the affected upper extremity was placed in an abduction sling (Ultrasling II; DJO Global) that was removed 3 times daily for pendulum exercises. Passive ROM up to 90&#x000b0; of forward flexion and 90&#x000b0; of abduction was allowed. Passive ER and IR ROM was restricted to 30&#x000b0; for the first 6 weeks. Scapular mobility and stability exercises were initiated at this time. From the fourth week, passive ROM was extended up to 120&#x000b0; of forward flexion and 120&#x000b0; of abduction. After 6 weeks, passive motion was increased as tolerated. Active motion was encouraged as well as specific training of the rotator cuff in the scapular plane before progressing to the frontal and sagittal planes. Abduction strengthening was initiated between 10 and 12 weeks postoperatively. ER strengthening at 0&#x000b0; of abduction was initiated 10 to 12 weeks postoperatively and progressed to 45&#x000b0; at approximately 16 weeks and 90&#x000b0; at approximately 20 weeks.

A similar estimate was not possible for strength measures because previous studies have not reported strength improvements (and the SD of those improvements). Therefore, unpublished data from repeated strength tests on rotator cuff patients were used. Based on the variability in repeated strength tests for the 4 tests used, it was estimated that with 20 patients per group, an 11-N difference in improvement in strength between SR and DR could be detected at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section8-2325967116667398"><title>Results</title><p>The initial study sample consisted of 49 patients who met the preoperative inclusion criteria and had intraoperative findings of a full-thickness rotator cuff repair that was greater than 1 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967116667398">Figure 1</xref>).

Thus, 89% of patients had clinically significant improvements in ASES scores.</p><p>Previous RCTs comparing DR and SR rotator cuff repairs have not reported the effect of surgery on clinical shoulder tests that are routinely used in the evaluation of patients with rotator cuff pathology. In the present study, 71% of patients had a positive Neer impingement sign prior to surgery and 79% had a positive Hawkins-Kennedy impingement test. At follow-up, only 1 patient (3%) had a positive Neer impingement sign, and no patients had a positive Hawkins-Kennedy test. Thus, both treatments successfully eliminated impingement signs (eg, pain) in most patients. Seven patients with DR repairs and 2 patients with SR repairs had positive lift-off tests at follow-up, but only 1 of these patients had subscapularis involvement at the time of surgery. These patients had less passive shoulder ROM than the patients with negative lift-off tests so this finding might be due to shoulder stiffness. Overall, the 9 patients tended to have lower ASES scores than patients with negative lift-off tests (84 &#x000b1; 11 vs 92 &#x000b1; 12, <italic>P</italic> = .10), but this was not apparent for Penn (90 &#x000b1; 7 vs 92 &#x000b1; 11, <italic>P</italic> = .61) or SST (11.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 vs 11.3 &#x000b1; 0.9, <italic>P</italic> = .90) scores. Four patients had subscapularis tears; all 4 were in the SR group, and the subscapularis tears were contiguous with supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears. These 4 patients had good outcomes (ASES, 96 &#x000b1; 5; Penn, 94 &#x000b1; 3; SST, 11 &#x000b1; 1). Only 1 of these patients still had a positive lift-off test at follow-up. The O&#x02019;Brien active compression test, drop-arm test, and lag sign at 90&#x000b0; showed significant improvements with treatment while the lag sign at 0&#x000b0; was only positive in 5 patients prior to surgery and negative in all patients at follow-up. Prior to surgery, there were a high number of positive O&#x02019;Brien tests despite there being few SLAP tears. The resolution of the positive O&#x02019;Brien tests after rotator cuff repair is likely due to the overall symptom resolution and strength improvement.</p><p>It is notable that at follow-up, patients with DR repairs had less ER ROM at 0&#x000b0; of abduction than patients with SR repairs. Patients with a DR repair had a loss of ER ROM from preoperative to follow-up. It is possible that increased coverage area in DR repair may have pulled the cuff too far laterally and constrained the anterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint, resulting in loss of ER ROM. This effect was not apparent with DR repairs in previous RCTs.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Other ROM measures were not different between SR and DR repairs.</p><p>Decreased ER ROM at follow-up was associated with lower Penn scores (<italic>r</italic> = 0.36, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05), with a tendency toward lower ASES scores (<italic>r</italic> = 0.32, <italic>P</italic> = .06). Therefore, the loss of ER ROM in the DR patients may have some clinical significance. Flexion ROM at follow-up was also related to outcome scores (ASES: <italic>r</italic> = 0.37, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05; Penn: <italic>r</italic> = 0.40, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). The combination of flexion ROM and ER ROM at 0&#x000b0; of abduction at follow-up dramatically impacted outcome scores. For the 20 patients with flexion ROM &#x0003e;164&#x000b0; and ER ROM &#x0003e;59&#x000b0;, ASES and Penn scores were 95 &#x000b1; 7 and 96 &#x000b1; 5, respectively. By contrast, ASES and Penn scores were markedly lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01) for the 7 patients with flexion ROM &#x0003c;165&#x000b0; and ER ROM &#x0003c;60&#x000b0; (ASES, 81 &#x000b1; 17; Penn, 83 &#x000b1; 16). Therefore, an emphasis on flexion ROM and ER ROM exercises in rehabilitation may improve outcomes after rotator cuff repair.</p><p>In the present study, restoration of strength in the empty- and full-can tests, ER, and abduction were shown to be similar between SR and DR repairs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2325967116667398">Figure 2, A-D</xref>). In previous RCTs, Burks et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> demonstrated an 85% improvement in ER strength and a 69% improvement in IR strength, Grasso et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> demonstrated a 40% improvement in full-can strength, Lapner et al<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> demonstrated a 73% improvement in flexion strength, and Ma et al<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> demonstrated a 53% improvement in abduction strength and a 71% improvement in ER strength. Strength improvements in the present study were 54% in the empty-can test, 66% in the full-can test, 47% in abduction, and 54% in ER. IR strength was not assessed in this study because in strong subjects it is not possible to perform a break test with the shoulder in 0&#x000b0; of abduction and it is not safe to test patients at 90&#x000b0; of abduction. With respect to the concomitant pathologies, the poor outcome scores for the 4 patients with SLAP tears (and debridement) are notable despite the small number of patients, as the outcome scores were very low (ASES, 73; Penn, 79; SST, 10.7).</p><p>While the present results are consistent with several other RCTs with respect to finding no differences in functional outcomes between DR and SR repairs, this study has some limitations. It was estimated that 20 patients per group would provide 80% power to detect an 11-point difference in ASES improvement between groups. Forty-nine patients were recruited to allow for anticipated loss to follow-up. At final follow-up, the intended sample size was achieved for the SR group but fell short by 4 patients for the DR group. Thus it is important to assess whether there was insufficient power to detect a meaningful difference in ASES scores between the DR and SR groups at follow-up. Post hoc power analysis indicated that there was 80% power to detect a 12-point difference in ASES scores between SR and DR groups. A 12- to 17-point difference in ASES scores is thought to be clinically significant.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967116667398" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The actual difference in ASES scores was very small (SR, 92 &#x000b1; 12; DR, 87 &#x000b1; 12); therefore, it is unlikely that this negative finding is subject to type 2 error. Between-group differences in Penn scores (SR, 92 &#x000b1; 11; DR, 91 &#x000b1; 11) and SST scores (SR, 11.3 &#x000b1; 1.0; DR, 11.4 &#x000b1; 1.0) were similarly small. Thus, the lack of a significant difference in outcome scores is unlikely to be due to a lack of statistical power.</p><p>The lack of any postoperative imaging of the rotator cuff repairs is also a limitation in the present study. The present study sought to focus on functional recovery, specifically a comprehensive assessment of strength recovery and symptomatology with clinical shoulder tests. Other RCTs have not addressed the effect of DR versus SR on the normalization of clinical shoulder tests nor have they examined strength recovery in multiple muscle groups.</p><p>The mean follow-up was 22 &#x000b1; 18 months with a wide range (12-84 months). Thus, it is important to understand the extent to which differences in outcomes between patients were due to differences in the length of time to follow-up. It was apparent that length of follow-up was unrelated to outcome scores (<italic>P</italic> = .36-.96), ROM results (<italic>P</italic> = .19-.90), or strength results (<italic>P</italic> = .11-.46).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-2325967116667398"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This RCT found no advantage of DR repair compared with SR repair for medium, large, and massive rotator cuff tears in terms of outcome scores, clinical tests of shoulder function, shoulder ROM, or shoulder strength. Overall results were very good regardless of surgical technique. DR had some loss of ER ROM and a great number of patients with a positive lift-off test at follow-up. Poorer outcomes were associated with a preoperative SLAP tear and limited flexion and ER ROM at follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967116667398"><p>One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: S.J.N. receives royalties from Arthrex Inc.
